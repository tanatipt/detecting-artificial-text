But Mr Andreyev's interpretation of history brought relations to a new low during his time as Poland's ambassador at Moscow's embassy before he was sacked over alleged visa violations for attending talks on the Ukrainian crisis about which he initially had denied knowledge. Mr Andreyev was accused by Polish prime minister Donald Tusk last week of hiding from parliament ""serious irregularities"" that occurred while he served as ambassador between 2009 and 2011. It is not known what these irregularities were but they are said to be linked to illegal procurement deals involving Russian officials. In December 2015, three of Mr Andreyev's aides who worked with him at the foreign ministry were detained after being charged with alleged corruption. They include former deputy head Grzegorz Zagorski who was dismissed earlier this month for suspected extortion.

Joyrider Nawnee Mackin, 35, was jailed for nine years in November 2005 after admitting manslaughter by gross negligence at an earlier hearing. A woman who admitted to driving her car over and killing a man while she was drunk then fled the country has failed to return from Canada hours before her sentence date. Joyride MacKinley Wilson, 36, of Willenhall Road, Leytonstone, east London, had been due back at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday but did not appear in court or contact anyone. She pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving when she drove off without stopping following a collision between herself and Samuel Walker outside his home on Feb 15 last year. Macklin also pleaded guilty to two other charges - failing to stop after an accident and driving with excess alcohol. She received a three month suspended jail term for each charge. Scroll down for video... Tributes have been left at the scene where Mr Walker lost his life Credit: PA ArchivePA Images Mr Walker's mother Brenda Vincent told how the family were awaiting news of when they would be able to visit their son's grave. Speaking about what happened on that fateful night last year, Ms Vincent said: ""I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for letting this happen."" ""It is my fault because I should never let him walk along that road alone,"" added Mrs Vincent who ran into tears as she recalled her late husband Paul telling her he hated people taking risks. The mum explained that, according to police documents, she had only drank four units of vodka and orange juice during the evening which didn't cause any problems until later. Ms Vincent described how she woke up after being knocked out next morning and found Mr Walker lying dead alongside his pet dog Lola. He died just steps away from the Walkers' front door. Tribute: A card with flowers has been placed there Credit: Google Street View - Camberwell Green Lane Three weeks ago it emerged that she'd taken part in several drunken nights out while claiming benefits and living rent free in St John Ambulance offices in Hackney Wick. Throughout another prison interview it became apparent how she spoke candidly of having no remorse whatsoever despite agreeing to plead guilty to all charges against her. During a chilling conversation recorded in September 2015, Macklinsaid: ""If you can die why not? If someone dies do you feel sorry?"" And adding: ""That is life! That is life!"" When pressed further on whether she felt any guilt Mr Walker's devastated parents questioned if the defendant simply wanted to get caught so she could go on benefits rather than admit anything.

But what was slow was how fast we had got used to him being able to do things he hadn't been able to do before - like go up stairs independently, say hello when someone called out to us from outside our front door, speak fluently to strangers and use public transport unaided. Now he recently turned 25 he is struggling with everything he once did so easily, but I will spare you further details here (you can find out more about my son's condition via ). During his first 11 years of life he would frequently become distressed whenever he found himself standing still because he was desperate not to lose sight of those he loved. As children grow older they naturally learn that moving backwards means looking behind themselves, forward means walking into the future and sideways means changing direction and he loved doing all these sorts of things. However, over recent months he began refusing to walk forwards any longer because that meant losing contact with the world, especially people who meant something special to him. And since he could no longer get away from where he was, he became very frustrated indeed if anyone tried to prevent him leaving somewhere safe. In April 2013, Christine set about writing down her experiences of having cared for someone with chronic motor neurone disease, MNDALS, whilst also coping with raising two young boys alone. Her intention was to share her knowledge and expertise with others who might be wondering whether they should take early retirement due to health problems or maybe look for another kind of work or venture into employment opportunities closer to home rather than commuting long distances to offices hundreds of miles away. For now though, her aim was simple: She wanted to break free from the suffocating ties holding her prisoner to her family situation and bring light into a dark corner of existence. This book offers practical advice on surviving the grief process, dealing with your emotions, managing stress, handling difficult situations and much else besides, including ideas for ways to help yourself during times of crisis such as illness or disability. It does not deal specifically with terminally ill patients although the author herself suffered short periods of depression following the diagnosis of ALS three years ago. This book isn't intended as ""How Not To Die,"" but it is geared towards helping readers avoid experiencing similar feelings or crises. We know what happens when people die - friends, relatives and neighbours pay tribute to the memory of a relative who has passed away, often saying 'he was always smiling' or'she just lived'. When somebody dies unexpectedly in hospital, however, the attending medical team have usually given little attention to preparing the patient's environment, making sure arrangements for the funeral happen properly etc. They are generally expected to sort these matters out themselves. If they fail to do so then there is usually considerable upset among family members and friends who are left feeling angry and bewildered. There is also a risk of the deceased person becoming known only as a 'patient name', rather than as a human being. One widow wrote to me complaining that nobody seemed interested in talking about her husband except to mention that he merely 'passed away'. Nobody mentioned how lovely he actually looked, how quickwitted or funny he had been before suffering his stroke. So anxious am I to provide assistance to grieving relatives and carers that I often try to intervene in sensitive circumstances and suggest alternative solutions.

After the ewes gave birth, paternity tests revealed that the DNA of 45 of the lambs belonged to a ram owned by a farmer in Llandybie. The farmer from Llandybie, Mr A, pleaded guilty to sheep stealing at Llanelli Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 11 October and was fined 150 with 1,350 costs. The farmer from Llanybydder, Mr B, who owns the ram, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting sheep stealing and was fined 150 with 1,350 costs. In November 2015, Mr A bought a ram from Mr B and agreed to return it by the end of the lambing season. After the ram was returned in May 2016, Mr B noticed he was missing five ewes, so he collected the ram to check if it was healthy. In September 2016, Mr B then noticed that five of his ewes were missing again. As a result, he brought the ram back to his farm and inseminated all of his ewes. The Ammanford farmer realised he was missing sheep in February 2016, so he contacted the police who carried out an investigation. The farmer recognised his ewes at the livestock market in Llanybydder and he was given a receipt for them. The farmer collected his ewes from Mr B's farm and discovered that 45 of the ewes had given birth to lambs. The farmer took blood samples and paternity tests revealed that 45 of the lambs belonged to Mr B's ram. Rural Crime Officer PC David Rosser said: ""Mr A allowed Mr B to collect the ewes from his farm, which was a mistake. The farmer had to spend 2,000 on paternity tests and the DNA results proved that Mr B's ram had fathered the lambs. ""This case demonstrates that if you allow your livestock to leave your property, then there is a high chance they will end up in another farmer's flock. Farmers must take the necessary steps to keep their livestock safe.""",llama_65B,1.7651515151515151,1.8333333333333333,1.8153846153846154,1.921875,1.4736842105263157,-1.0779181060096115,-0.23177767178744124,-0.9313504766703483,-0.47429354273201796,0.0017006802721087465,-0.47371629401614607,0.09714045416316232,-0.3590367723191568,0.1836419753086421,-0.2917825162376372,-1.125,-0.5206485832095797,-0.3265086206896551,-0.05582960814812338,0.0,0.0,-0.04464285714285727,-0.09211389320377587,0.3618467504535135,0.7066275350571704,0.4552912223133715,-0.03316401253366282,0.047794117647058834,0.08422071188161925,-0.6204545454545455,-0.21549891213021075,0.050000000000000044,0.31587116651432984,0.5078125000000001,0.23229819351503128,0.7759610034313271,0.42343506798708025,0.09374999999999999,0.48169958982997924,0.36538461538461525,0.7397467298293531,0.45763783510369244,0.4418352045438582,-0.26984126984126966,-0.19105086829667856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32727272727272727,1.9090909090909092,0.8753364442511811,0.28916758759851846,1.205501204544095,0.8555805434663363,-0.5840960751923652,-0.5004497964150095

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Shijian-21, or SJ-21, is a Chinese satellite designed to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies. It was recently observed pulling a dead satellite out of its normal orbit and into an orbit where it will eventually reenter the atmosphere and burn up. This is a major step forward in the effort to reduce the amount of space debris that is accumulating in Earth's orbit. The satellite was launched in July 2020, as part of China's Long March-4B rocket mission. It is equipped with a robotic arm and a capture device, which are capable of grasping objects up to 350 kilograms in weight. The satellite also features a variety of sensors and cameras for monitoring the captured object. SJ-21 is the first satellite of its kind to be sent into space and has already proven successful in its mission. In addition to being able to de-orbit discarded satellites, it is also capable of stabilizing their orbits, allowing them to remain in a safe area of space. This technology could potentially be used to help prevent further collisions between satellites and other space debris. In the future, SJ-21 could be used to clean up other types of space debris, such as defunct spacecraft and pieces of rocket boosters. This could have a significant impact on the environment by reducing the amount of trash in orbit and preventing long-term damage to our planet.",text-davinci-003,0.9545454545454546,1.0,1.1384615384615384,1.0625,0.7368421052631579,-0.27448077414922273,0.37465780012443844,0.15193316957439856,0.051639050819447016,-0.03463203463203455,-0.32033553876079507,0.2825904121110179,-0.1505931047098697,0.13945005611672304,-0.010352406710084791,0.2272727272727273,0.17608069791573341,-0.028213166144200604,0.00351863491651784,0.0,0.0,0.37662337662337664,-0.4437510676371505,-0.707611423109093,-0.3158660874306385,0.00894921321500462,-0.22385585288732768,0.5213903743315508,0.26914461342961443,0.4454545454545457,-0.09346893989734427,0.6181818181818182,0.5335785635488328,-0.014204545454545442,-0.13328434599407085,-0.27884801834537526,-0.12123917679900165,0.42613636363636354,0.4452614123076242,0.0979020979020978,0.35188699373182064,-0.3803743045017703,-0.26280435309317074,-0.5425685425685425,-0.3655554540427693,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.4453617714151233,0.6,0.5454545454545454,0.4341729000744311,0.4269409889145128,-0.03745907697735886,-0.06804360780617921,0.02880804620094119,-0.20517694188450566

IS is a mainly Sunni group which controls large swathes of northern and western Iraq, and has attacked numerous Shia targets in the country. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in Iraq for talks with the government, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. ""I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest condolences to the people and government of Iraq, and particularly those members of the families affected by terrorist attacks yesterday,"" he told reporters in Baghdad. Mr Ban urged Iraqi leaders to step up reconciliation efforts between Shias and Sunnis in order to defeat IS. Friday's attack happened in Iskandariya, a mainly Shia town 40km (25 miles) south of the capital, Baghdad. Video posted on social media showed the moment of the blast, as an official was speaking in front of a crowd of dozens of people, including the young players. The footage cuts off with a big flash of yellow light. It then shows the chaos and screaming of people fleeing the area. A medical official said 17 of the dead were boys aged between 10 and 16, AFP news agency reported. Islamic State group: The full story Crisis in seven charts Mayor Ahmed Shaker was also killed, as was one of his bodyguards and at least five members of the security forces, it said. Some 84 others were wounded, and 12 of them were said to be in critical condition. Iskandariya is in a region that was once called ""the triangle of death"" and was badly affected by sectarian violence that followed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. In a statement, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said he was ""shocked"" by what he described as a ""tragedy."" The UN chief also urged politicians to foster reconciliation with the minority Sunni, who say they were marginalised under the Shia-led government. Some discontented Sunnis have joined IS and other extremist groups. ""National reconciliation is an important part of the strategy to defeat Daesh, who have ruthlessly exploited divisions and targeted the marginalized and disenfranchised,"" he said, using another name for IS. IS has been losing some territory of its self-declared caliphate that includes parts of neighbouring Syria, and Iraqi forces have started an operation to retake Mosul, the largest city under the group's control. Meanwhile, thousands of supporters of the powerful Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr continued their sit-in outside the gates of the heavily fortified Green Zone, an area of government offices and embassies in Baghdad. They have urged Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to announce a new-cabinet and fresh measures to fight corruption.

In addition to running macOS applications on Linux, Darling can also be helpful for software developers who want to test their macOS applications on Linux without having to switch back and forth between two different operating systems.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.2196969696969697,0.16666666666666666,0.2153846153846154,0.234375,0.0,0.723933363596086,1.4641672605437164,1.283185395113506,1.3596880728984182,0.09523809523809512,0.5132438714614304,0.08634707036725554,0.27419587736362766,0.10802469135802499,0.5322460087809125,0.0,0.33577889086422846,1.7672413793103445,1.6428954697149976,0.0,0.0,0.21428571428571427,-0.3802291673531063,0.29305119542901825,0.10756212230425136,-0.2625102543068088,0.5197532684483921,-0.12745098039215677,0.8589781077158304,0.7212121212121213,-0.22971540277217048,0.4666666666666668,1.2622517335870087,-0.9374999999999999,-0.5287964955771306,-0.0973754984698136,-0.03033008588991065,0.3125,0.49598080788504934,-0.15384615384615388,-0.11832949364174235,0.0,0.3914407699832597,-0.08465608465608436,0.22853408913143525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727272727272726,0.0,0.23379059139877195,-0.000793109181878671,-0.23612025017779636,-1.1028037274700995,0.8010679345749795,0.6411048023394748

India's milk industry is the world's largest, and it is predominantly made up of small farms with one or two cows. However, this decentralized system often leads to challenges in quality control and safety issues as milk is not collected and processed centrally, and lack of hygiene measures during milk collection, transportation or conversion into high value milk products causes impurities. Additionally, there is a lack of proper regulation and testing, which can result in the distribution of adulterated milk, posing a significant health risk to the population. The government and various private sector entities have been implementing measures to improve the quality and safety of milk by providing training and support to farmers, enhancing supply chain infrastructure, and increasing awareness among consumers.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.5,0.3333333333333333,0.5076923076923077,0.421875,0.42105263157894735,0.9159805136258754,1.3674981130449504,1.2184801379321322,1.0088590181847783,0.39650145772594747,1.8517073262149324,0.4070647603027754,1.6395980361933447,0.16975308641975315,1.3995122387228687,0.0714285714285714,0.06471213495878765,0.0886699507389163,0.6866612062489909,0.0,0.0,1.5510204081632655,3.2272117243863314,-0.6279668473478963,-0.4001084331268399,0.0,1.001352932749409,0.4915966386554622,0.8935111140928557,-0.04545454545454524,0.3252269508561229,2.8,3.5041098826896886,-0.11160714285714288,0.887271350276132,0.35889826578874157,0.21197740306817955,0.3482142857142856,0.8823294806646382,-0.15384615384615388,0.5907249045842987,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456333,-0.12698412698412692,0.45197668184364775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5272727272727272,0.6363636363636364,-0.03647180071152216,0.2708501338464678,0.2235271701683139,-1.1728198609450602,1.0001091238125845,1.0603953374521904

Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters police had targeted a ""dangerous terrorist cell."" He added that the cell was ""about to launch attacks on a grand scale."" The men were known to police and were linked to ""recruitment for terrorist activities,"" he added. Belgium's interior minister said the country was ""facing a serious problem of destabilisation."" Van Der Sypt said there was a possibility that the terrorist cell had a connection to the Paris massacre. Al-Arabiya reports that the cell was preparing an attack on Belgian police officers. The arrests in Belgium come days after terror attacks in France left 17 people dead. According to Belgium's public broadcaster RTBF, the people arrested were linked to the man who was arrested in the southern French city of Marseille on Tuesday in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack. That man is thought to have provided weapons to the attackers and was under surveillance by police. Belgian police have arrested a man linked to one of the suspected gunmen in last week's Charlie Hebdo massacre. Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman and four hostages in a kosher supermarket, reportedly had a weapon that was used in a shooting and an attempted robbery in Belgium in 2010. Belgian police have also been searching for a suspect who has been missing since a shooting last week in Verviers, a city about 69 miles from Brussels. Two gunmen were killed and a third suspect was arrested. In a press conference on Thursday, the Belgian prime minister said the suspects were connected to the Islamic State group and that their plans were in ""an advanced stage."" The terror alert level in Belgium has been raised to three - the second-highest level - after authorities received information that several groups were planning attacks. Meanwhile, an Algerian man who was arrested in southern France on Sunday and linked to one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers has been extradited to Belgium. The suspect was handed over to Belgian authorities on Thursday night after being questioned by French police.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The 61st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the first IMO that has been held remotely and may also be the last time that artificial intelligence doesn't compete. Researchers view the 2020 IMO as a testbed for future AI-driven educational technology. The 2020 IMO was administered to over 6,000 students from 115 countries and featured a total of six problems which were designed and marked by the IMO Committee. Each problem was composed of two questions with supplementary materials providing additional information or guidance to the students. The problems covered topics such as algebra, number theory, geometry, combinatorics, probability and statistics, and graph theory. In addition to the main competition, the 2020 IMO also included multiple ancillary events such as an online seminar series, an international lecture series, and an online exhibition. The virtual format of the event enabled IMO participants from around the world to interact in real time and gain exposure to other countries' mathematical cultures. By enabling students to engage in discussion and collaboration, it is hoped that these activities will aid in developing a global community of mathematicians. Given the success of the 2020 IMO, there has been increased interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) in mathematical competitions. AI can be used to create puzzles and provide solutions to existing problems, allowing students to focus on higher-level problem solving rather than on basic calculations. AI could also help assess student performance, provide feedback on their work, and suggest areas of improvement. As AI becomes more advanced, it could potentially be used to evaluate students' written explanations and offer feedback on their performance. This could lead to a more comprehensive assessment of student progress and help identify areas of strength and weakness. AI could also be used to generate personalized learning pathways for each student, helping them to hone in on their individual strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, AI technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn mathematics. By providing an efficient, accurate assessment system and personalized learning pathways, AI could help students better prepare for future international math competitions and give them the tools they need to succeed.",text-davinci-003,1.8863636363636365,1.8333333333333333,1.676923076923077,1.640625,1.5789473684210527,1.214971855199727,1.7077336617231273,1.7177087838606908,1.745220690064139,0.1377551020408162,-0.3195374043681172,-0.04857022708158116,-0.16627350673621294,-0.10802469135802452,-0.24333370760230702,0.625,1.1697214839978631,0.7047413793103448,0.5047652506735223,0.0,0.0,0.46428571428571414,0.054226069147336936,-0.552151337729065,-0.565725977226728,0.4983593109105823,0.47088693437119156,0.09558823529411767,0.2165002741147103,0.07954545454545464,1.0083790998283302,1.05,0.31587116651432984,-0.07812499999999993,0.2000596349721728,0.1022442733933043,0.5303300858899106,0.09374999999999999,0.7101517299092646,-0.2692307692307693,-0.26130604990055933,-0.2288189175518462,-0.11587005475535252,0.06349206349206366,0.17200616270346147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3636363636363635,1.7272727272727273,0.16136333363058486,0.6999803020607436,0.2838087990661646,-1.497180173853539,1.09189489864112,1.0035769026695354
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Zoox recently published a video showing its autonomous system driving for an hour in downtown San Francisco. The video is available in the article. A safety driver was behind the wheel, but Zoox says it was on a regular urban route and the driver didn't have to intervene at any point. The company is one of many in the race to build self-driving cars, and the video shows that it's making solid progress. Zoox is pursuing a different kind of self-driving car, though. Zoox wants to design a full autonomous vehicle from scratch. Instead of retrofitting an existing vehicle with sensors and cameras, the startup is building a new vehicle that's designed for self-driving from the ground up. The company plans to manufacture its own vehicles with a customized powertrain, a full set of sensors, a new body design, etc. In particular, the vehicle features a steering wheel that can come down or retract into the dashboard. For a regular car, this would be useless, but for a fully autonomous vehicle, it's a good way to switch between autonomous driving and manual driving. As you can see in the video, Zoox isn't done yet. The company is still working on its design and a lot of things need to be improved. But this should give you an idea of the startup's vision and know how it will be different from other self-driving cars. Waymo, Cruise, GM and others are working on self-driving cars using existing car designs. Tesla and its Autopilot features also fall in that category, although Tesla is developing its own self-driving software. But there are also other companies working on self-driving vehicles.

But US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Bahrain had made progress on human rights and that the assistance was ""a tangible reminder"" of American support. Mr Kirby said the administration remained ""deeply concerned"" about human rights abuses, and that the new assistance would be contingent on progress on those issues. The US State Department said the resumption of assistance came after Bahrain ""unwound some of its most restrictive measures against civil society and the media."" But Bahrain's government had not implemented all the recommendations of an independent commission of inquiry into the 2011 crackdown, it said. ""We continue to encourage the government of Bahrain to continue on the path of reform and reconciliation,"" Mr Kirby said. Bahrain is the home of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet and Washington has been keen to maintain close ties with the island kingdom. But the crackdown on protests, led by Shia activists demanding greater rights, attracted strong criticism from international rights groups. Most of the detainees were Sunni Muslims, with some Shia. The US State Department said the 127 detainees were serving sentences or being held for trial on charges that included ""violent felonies."" ""We strongly support the king and the government of Bahrain as they move forward with the implementation of the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry,"" Mr Kirby said. ""We believe that this is an important recognition of Bahrain's progress thus far, and we hope that it will help the government of Bahrain sustain the positive momentum it has created with these and other recent reforms."" Bahrain's Sunni Muslim rulers have responded to unrest among the Shia majority with a crackdown on dissent. The government has rejected the accusations, saying the country's Shia enjoy more freedoms than those in other Gulf countries. In June 2011, the US resumed arms sales to Bahrain, which it had suspended during the protests. In February 2013, the US Department of Defense approved the sale of equipment and support worth about 1.5bn (920m) for upgrades to the country's F-16 fighter jet fleet. The government of Bahrain had previously said that it was being ""unfairly singled out"" for criticism by human rights groups and the US, arguing that it had implemented a number of reforms recommended by the inquiry commission. Among the reforms was the establishment of a police ombudsman to look into allegations of abuse. But the government has also strengthened anti-terrorism laws in a move that has been criticised by rights groups.",llama_65B,2.4393939393939394,2.3333333333333335,2.4923076923076923,2.578125,2.473684210526316,0.46039754592902343,0.8979009641282238,0.2773479114979642,0.6160330472699684,0.19190834228428186,0.03743451031399337,0.27267495905449063,0.16128896594948705,0.321799870045484,0.308968582603004,0.07894736842105265,0.2390802980759754,-0.27223230490018147,0.19559518071903312,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,-0.2672438877464331,0.3509842943970142,0.16398096403807522,-0.09326022192478742,0.07271152677203344,0.42260061919504666,-0.018848785733188655,0.14401913875598094,0.574016803956542,0.3789473684210527,0.36129470381462214,0.748355263157895,-0.055892719507167676,0.007687539352880017,0.46202294752928924,0.009868421052631525,0.8175405971458126,-0.15384615384615388,0.5907249045842987,0.3853792295610042,0.49147435021799735,0.2740183792815374,-0.054566302474341064,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.22329687826943606,1.5818181818181818,0.9090909090909091,0.35191236411718907,0.9173598010582574,-0.4058362207671293,-0.2715526801810599,0.2815670084409331,0.4723710381084622

The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common flat organisation and matrix structure - both of these are popular in Sweden but have also been used elsewhere to great effect by businesses seeking greater collaboration within their teams or departments (see How Google's Flat Organisation Works). The company realised its needs were different from those companies with a typical work process: ""We need people who can understand complex issues,"" says Joe Lowgren-Eriksson at Granscape AB, an IT services provider based closeby Stockholm.

It was in the air for 29 minutes during its maiden flight and reached an altitude of 5,000 feet. Officials say it will help form part of a new generation of unmanned drones and works like a smaller version of the B-2 Stealth Bomber. As such it would be very different from the current fleet of remote controlled military planes like the Predator and Reaper. Instead the X-47B would be virtually invisible to radar and fly at much faster speeds than those older, propeller driven machines. In a statement Captain Jaime Engdahl, a programme manager for the warplane, said: ""Today we got a glimpse towards the future as the Navy's first-ever tailless, jet-powered unmanned aircraft took to the skies."" The flight was primarily designed to test the jet's guidance and navigation systems and the aerodynamic control of the tailless design. It was controlled from the ground by a joint team of the company's engineers and Navy specialists. Northrop is building the bomber as part of a PS395 million contract signed in 2007. Janis Pamiljans is vice-president of Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems sector. ""Designing a tailless, fighter-sized unmanned aircraft from a clean sheet is no small feat. ""Commitment, collaboration and uncompromising technical excellence among the Navy [and] Northrop Grumman made today's flight a reality. ""We are indeed honoured to have given wings to the Navy's vision for exploring unmanned carrier aviation."" Although it will be several years before the X-47B is ready for operations officials say it should have its first test flight from an aircraft carrier in 2013.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that it's not simply an accident of evolution - most likely, these positions are chosen by bird brains to power specific behaviours Standing perfectly still for hours is surprisingly hard work, especially when you have a long tail dragging behind you. A study published this week in Animal Behaviour shows that at least some species choose which leg they use to stop hopping around because of its effect on locomotion rather than where birds feel stable (see 'Birds can stand up straight without standing perfectly still. For years ornithologists assumed that the position was merely something natural occurring during slow running due to the mass inertia of the tail feathering out as the bird slows down or stops suddenly. But recent research suggests that many species specifically chose the optimized resting postures for stability. Even more interesting, no such choice seems to exist between males and females within species, suggesting that all individuals share similar abilities to make moving upright easier while providing maximum stability, regardless of sex. This new theory could help explain why we see so many weird-looking dances: humans too often assume that weird behaviour must indicate lack of intelligence. Many animals will hop, run or dance; only a few get bored enough to rest splayed across a branch like a hangman. The best known among them are chimps who swing through trees and kangaroos who hop along with their legs akimbo. These oddities were once considered evidence of wild animal breeding gone mad, yet today scientists recognise that even animals under daily human observation occasionally find themselves engaged in unusual behaviours. For example, hens sometimes sunbathe on their back feet and male mice engage in doggish displays to attract mates. Classic examples include bulls bellowing, dogs wagging tails and cats grooming. Such cases illustrate what happens if adult mammals fail to display appropriate social norms and gender roles - other members of the same group take over and impose behavioural patterns inappropriate to their biological role. Given that not every mammal undergoes sexual selection, researchers wonder whether there might also be non-sexual forms of extreme performance improvement. One possibility that arose recently concerns birds' tendency to form awkward poses like hanging upside-down from a tree limb or spinning round to look backwards. To explore this idea, Daniel Kotler from Iowa State University teamed up with John Gossett from San Diego Zoo Global and Emily Jorgenson from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to build an experimental model based on hidden cameras set up inside aviaries. They would record which limbs our feathered friends used to move, then translate those movements into quantitative data about associated strength and coordination. Their experiment revealed detailed information about skeletal structure and muscle activity of both sexes in two common North American songbirds called Carolina chickadee and white throated sparrow1. The findings reveal several surprising things about bird anatomy and movement. First, studies had suggested that chickens lay eggs bigger than expected for their body size, owing mainly to strong wing muscles using their bones as levers. Surprisingly, the authors found just the opposite when measuring the chicken's pectoralis major, a key breast muscle responsible for cocking the barnyard left hook. Pecks were smaller than predicted, indicating a lighter design of bone relative to muscle density. Second, and relatedly, the analyses traced precise differences in fat deposits, including thin layers of subcutaneous tissue beneath skin near joints. In short, female chicks seem better nourished - and maybe stronger? Meanwhile, adult males gain weight faster after hatching, before dropping it off again until maturity. Why does each bird differ? How much influence does genetics play versus environmental factors like temperature changes? Future experiments might answer these questions by following individual pairs of hatchlings from egg to adulthood. When the full results came in, the researchers noticed striking similarities between the way that adults and juveniles performed their tribal rites. Both groups swung side to side, kneed forward and backward and bent knees back to meet thighs. Juveniles also plucked feathers from the ground and thrust their head towards another nearby bird. Despite obvious developmental differences, juvenile chicks behave similarly to adults. As far as the observers knew, both populations represent single genetic lines. If true, this means they evolved this repertoire together. It's unclear exactly why they keep doing it, though it's possible that ritualised behaviours serve important functions beyond mere entertainment. Perhaps both parties gain fitness benefits by displaying synchronously. Maybe pair bonding strengthens bonds in tight knit societies. Or perhaps they perform these motions to communicate. Whatever works, this newfound dancing duo proves that learning routines can occur outside formal schooling settings. So it doesn't matter how smart you are: if your parents taught you a special pair of steps and you want to show everyone else, go ahead! And now let me introduce you to my favourite four-legged insects, the ants.

The visitors almost equalised when Dale Jennings broke down the left and his low cross was met by Jason Scotland, but his effort from six yards was blocked well by Paul Black. Oldham continued to threaten in attack and they were two up after 26 minutes. Klok crossed from the right again, this time finding Filipe Morais, who got in front of his marker to head home. Barnsley had a good spell of pressure before half-time and Scotland's powerful strike was parried away at full stretch by Alex Cisak. But Oldham scored their third of the game on 42 minutes. The ball was worked out to Jose Baxter on the right, he cut inside and fired past Steele into the corner of the net. Barnsley pulled a goal back just after the break when substitute David Perkins headed in from close range from Craig Davies' cross. But Oldham sealed victory with 15 minutes to go when a defensive mix-up allowed Baxter to race clear and fire home his second of the game.",text-davinci-003,0.7803030303030303,0.6666666666666666,0.7384615384615385,0.8125,0.2631578947368421,-0.8291325949068413,-1.3867160880418608,-1.250719796529282,-1.3535983072385718,0.2388510959939532,0.08080529875447796,0.17269414073451064,-0.331469146557566,0.28086419753086433,-0.15724209959436863,-0.05555555555555558,1.0020102159843745,0.8505747126436782,0.48575403765123965,0.0,0.0,-0.047619047619047825,-0.40822615211243835,0.6075451612552819,0.04425623112381151,0.04375170905113465,-0.2490670261956517,0.8071895424836601,-0.08301932285962021,-1.0676767676767678,-0.2333549788447606,0.5777777777777777,0.7526238783365047,0.2604166666666668,0.6818746991770253,0.16878419734767694,0.19615307136686833,0.06249999999999994,0.4416154603555483,-0.2564102564102565,-0.21260109571698993,0.34867644579328955,0.3051069275546079,-0.47971781305114625,-0.47112671872730905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6909090909090909,0.7272727272727273,0.02391371966531161,0.3306904736880687,0.07276281629478994,1.0331041486382178,-0.5863826542036558,-0.5722616079664963
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Stay-at-home and social distancing may have played a major role in romance scams reaching record levels in 2020. Total losses were estimated at 304 million. The total dollar losses have decreased significantly since 2018, when they were estimated at over 1 billion. Stay-at-home and social distancing requirements likely have had a major impact on the rise of romance scams in 2020 due to the increased reliance on online dating platforms. With people stuck at home, scammers have had an easier time finding potential victims to target. They use clever tactics to lure their victims into believing that they are forming an emotional connection with them, and then quickly try to exploit them for financial gain. Additionally, the restricted physical contact may have made it easier for scammers to carry out their activities undetected. Victims can be less likely to recognize the red flags associated with these scams as they rely more heavily on online communication, making them more vulnerable to manipulation.",text-davinci-003,0.45454545454545453,0.5,0.4,0.46875,0.15789473684210525,0.5025558789537373,0.39958028618394126,0.8864980513708769,1.0117651119292275,-0.10884353741496607,0.20185599792595257,-0.19428090832632464,0.1712937945181024,-0.07561728395061712,0.2175315126044002,1.0,0.15343569967767595,0.7047413793103448,1.1072243108492161,0.0,0.0,-0.07142857142857155,0.3179669271819417,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.3691550451189498,0.26627949124222383,0.09558823529411767,0.571506332801068,0.2545454545454547,-0.5325859153064354,-0.44999999999999996,-0.05041380923590859,-0.5468749999999999,-0.3030904634889381,0.5513887600853195,0.5868300973425568,0.0,0.5192617356151522,0.07692307692307684,0.8578091856276568,0.6537683358624178,0.27153270446324956,-0.26984126984126966,-0.6221252056612898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21818181818181817,0.9090909090909091,0.17796881891018518,-0.05579171310004159,0.7910510259017766,-0.6735954732751183,0.40535382449024443,0.21541225410335924
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Stories of data loss can be embarrassing, but they help people learn useful things in case they end up in similar situations. This article tells the story of how a user ended up losing his important data due to a ransomware attack and what he did to prevent the same from happening again. Before I tell you the story of what happened to me, I would like to tell you about ransomware and what it does. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks a user's files. The files are locked in such a way that they become inaccessible. The malware then presents a screen that asks the user to pay a ransom in order to get back their files. It is usually a crypto currency like Bitcoin. The ransomware then gives a link that can be used to make the payment. After a payment is made, the hacker will release a decryption key that will enable the user to decrypt their files. This malware can be downloaded as an email attachment or by clicking on a link. This story happened about two years ago. I was a second year student at the time. I was a victim of ransomware, and I lost my important files. The malware locked my files, and I had no way of accessing them. When the malware appeared, it demanded that I pay some money to be able to decrypt my files. I had no money at the time and decided to look for another way to decrypt my files. I tried looking for some online tools, but I had no luck. I had to wait for a few days until I came across a site that had a list of ransomware decryption tools. I downloaded a few of them, and they were not able to decrypt my files. I then realized that I had no choice but to pay the ransom. I had no money at the time, but I knew of a friend who could help me out. I asked her for the money, and she helped me out. I paid the hacker, and he sent me a decryption key. This enabled me to decrypt my files. I was very happy that I had gotten back my files. I had no other choice but to pay the ransom. I learned from this experience, and I decided to find a better way to protect my files. I searched online for some software that could help me to recover my files in case the same thing happened. I came across a data recovery software. This software was able to recover my files in the case of a ransomware attack or any other type of data loss. I have been using this software for about two years now, and I can say that I am happy with it. This software is called Disk Drill. It is available for Mac OS X and Windows. There are three versions of this software, and they are: Free, Basic and PRO. Disk Drill is capable of recovering over 200 file formats. This software can recover files from hard drives, USB drives, memory cards, iPods and other devices. This software has a simple user interface and is easy to use. It is also capable of creating an image of a drive or a partition. This software can be used to recover files that have been lost due to ransomware, accidental deletion, OS crash, partition deletion and other data loss scenarios. The free version of Disk Drill is capable of recovering up to 500MB worth of data. The Basic and PRO versions are able to recover unlimited data. I would recommend that you give this software a try. You can download the free version and see if it is good enough for you.",llama_65B,4.015151515151516,6.333333333333333,4.923076923076923,5.09375,2.736842105263158,-1.5601229642940981,-0.6059386212660816,-0.9341698709704732,-0.763104283181683,-0.8365764910615409,-0.19324131509623863,-0.373501281123477,0.10186237700251281,-0.32206431237438987,0.13395665576135946,-0.4534883720930232,0.20859008585786276,-0.4595028067361667,-0.06223132118644763,0.0,0.0,-0.6245847176079735,0.012758986150246416,-0.8332760310185302,-0.6238783794049648,-0.3479787091973979,0.16436419067047026,-0.9158686730506157,-0.13239984974087923,-0.4780126849894292,0.23790620619872468,-0.08372093023255811,0.13150683189342327,-0.039970930232558,0.2740528254443433,-0.35734543391945545,-0.19032563200122588,-0.06540697674418598,0.5031208239381209,0.769230769230769,0.7931004684674757,-0.04865252731999388,0.11418141452455145,-0.8150609080841638,-0.3826762035859451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7636363636363637,3.090909090909091,0.8908385986756843,0.7206269052224671,1.053190763893043,1.208883123338189,-1.2462298720832585,-1.1142758138192308

A.P Singh, chief forest conservator in Gujarat state, told AFP they ""had instituted a probe and called Jadeja for a statement.... but since he was not available, his father-in-law Hardevsinh Solanki gave a written statement on his behalf"" and paid the fine for him. Jadeja, 27, was part of India's team for the recent World T20 tournament.

The incident happened as the first half came to an end, and it was announced at half-time that the match would be abandoned. It is the latest in a series of incidents of violence at British football grounds. It is the second time this season that City's Carabao Cup match has been stopped by crowd trouble. Their game against Preston North End was briefly held up by home fans throwing objects on to the pitch as they protested against owner Trevor Hemmings. Meanwhile, a man was arrested after being shot in the leg outside the Emirates Stadium before Arsenal's game against Tottenham. The match at City's Etihad Stadium was halted in the 44th minute after the fan appeared to run onto the pitch. He was apprehended by stewards and police officers. A City fan who was at the game said the supporter was carrying an inflatable banana. The fan was then thrown to the ground by a steward, before being punched in the face by a police officer, said Gary Jordan, 33, who was sitting near the pitch. He said the fan had a ""bloodied nose"" and that he had been ""knocked out"" during the incident. ""It was nasty,"" he said. He said there was ""shock and confusion"" as fans and players were left in the dark over what was happening. ""There was a lot of commotion. No one knew what was going on,"" he said. He said that the atmosphere in the ground had been ""rowdy,"" with Leicester fans chanting and City fans responding. ""It was aggressive but nothing out of the ordinary,"" he said. Mr Jordan said that the incident did not appear to be targeted at any player. ""There was a lot of running around but it was not directed at anyone,"" he said. A statement from Greater Manchester Police said: ""A man has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer after he ran onto the pitch at Manchester City v Leicester. ""The man was arrested on suspicion of assault after he was taken from the pitch. ""He was taken into custody and remains in police custody for questioning. ""The man was injured in the process of being taken into custody and was treated by a medic at the ground and then taken to hospital to be checked over. ""No officers were injured in the incident. The match was abandoned. The Football Association said it was waiting for the match referee's report before deciding whether to take any action. A statement said: ""The FA strongly condemns the actions of the individuals who entered the pitch during last night's Carabao Cup tie between Manchester City and Leicester City, resulting in an abandoned match. Leicester City said it was ""disappointed"" by the incident and that it would be assisting the authorities with their investigations. A statement said: ""The Club is currently investigating the incident and reviewing CCTV footage, and will work with the relevant departments and organisations in order to identify those responsible. Greater Manchester Police have appealed for anyone with footage of the incident to contact them.",llama_65B,3.25,4.166666666666667,3.6769230769230767,3.96875,3.473684210526316,-0.5235936671436319,-0.015882786259376395,-0.3057007661001828,-0.08605686153912814,-0.43083900226757377,0.23450817992309161,-0.11225119147743208,0.0729610358899381,0.03024691358024703,0.17526782692165183,-1.0,-0.3655459086796917,-0.5827586206896551,-0.35029477234792034,0.0,0.0,-0.4571428571428572,-0.040670297779408,-0.2573132447669429,0.21845937557772638,-0.009844134536505296,0.1686535548585087,0.07647058823529419,0.5197259401912168,0.44121212121212133,0.13446824848503344,-0.1333333333333333,0.8352032381708696,0.40625,0.9399953853869051,-0.4566910878234257,-0.339935758243313,-0.2874999999999999,0.44382215933138225,0.1538461538461537,0.150956198031514,0.20920586747597372,0.1290823086335036,0.06349206349206366,0.18577166593125724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,2.6363636363636362,0.651463706417809,0.7957889947366251,0.7429287551594186,0.49439785332669106,-0.5543714063425679,-0.3769459800626205

The test will not indicate whether or not a customer has the disease, but will indicate whether they are at risk of getting it. The FDA has now approved this genetic health risk report as a direct-to-consumer genetic test. The FDA believes that this test can help people make decisions regarding their health and lifestyle. 23andMe will test for genetic health risks for BRCA1BRCA2 (selected variants), late-onset Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, early-onset primary dystonia, factor XI deficiency, Gaucher disease type 1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hereditary thrombophilia. The test will also screen for drug responses, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and VKORC1. These genes impact how well people metabolize drugs such as warfarin, Coumadin, Plavix, and clopidogrel. The test will also screen for the following diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, primary dystonia, factor XI deficiency, Gaucher disease type 1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hereditary thrombophilia. Women who carry genetic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer, and may be at increased risk of other cancers. 23andMe will also report a person's carrier status for the following diseases: Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, Fanconi anemia group C, Fanconi anemia group G, familial dysautonomia, Gaucher disease type 1, glycogen storage disease type 1A, hereditary hemochromatosis, Mucolipidosis type IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Rett syndrome, and Tay-Sachs disease. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can be passed down from either parent, and the child of a parent with one of these mutations has a 50 chance of inheriting the mutation. If a person's test results indicate that they are a carrier of one of these mutations, it does not mean that they have or will develop the disorder, but rather that they can pass the mutation down to their children. According to the FDA, this test will give people information about possible mutations that are linked to increased risk for conditions that could be avoided or effectively treated. For more information about 23andMe's new service, visit their website. The FDA encourages consumers to check out their webpage: Think Before You Spit! Think Before You Spit! Will answer any questions you may have about genetic testing and what results might mean.",llama_65B,2.3257575757575757,2.1666666666666665,2.0153846153846153,2.015625,4.368421052631579,1.0686884296284587,0.6708706150906589,0.844867932408101,0.4887713711028469,0.24640967498110336,1.0139582938023368,-0.014391178394542514,0.9164244406467938,-0.03600823045267453,0.99004276460446,0.2777777777777777,1.7194502896850905,-0.31609195402298845,-0.25384224780564346,0.1111111111111111,0.4581228472908512,1.2142857142857142,3.146857882216545,0.18821987348693056,1.290957437878354,0.0054689636313918315,0.13700692914786186,-0.21241830065359474,0.14995965607991024,0.17676767676767685,0.692393189225939,0.9111111111111112,0.650676685733378,0.10416666666666671,1.1052798235030719,-0.0973754984698136,0.08204234980588385,0.06249999999999994,0.8386186997241288,-0.2051282051282052,0.3644681650157756,0.17433822289664472,0.7728264936394159,2.0881834215167547,4.580960964154807,0.0,0.0,0.4444444444444444,1.0657403385139377,0.7272727272727273,3.3636363636363638,0.4996515801671774,0.4291259765067741,1.5921402756932492,-0.7862070847431832,0.6605979838798797,0.7608418241491951

No action needs be taken by owners at present; however if drivers wish to deactivate full autonomy until the issue can be fixed via OTA then pressing and holding either stalk button (slowly) at the same time as tapping the accelerator pedal should do just fine - Elon Musk (elonmusk) July 1, 2021 In response to these latest developments we take another look back into history to see how some companies handled recalls before there were laws requiring them: Ford Motor Co., which recalled more than 2 million early 1980s Pintos because faulty ignition switches could cause engines to stall while driving, had no idea its problem was widespread until 1981, three years after sales began, when engineers spotted the defect during internal testing on a new model. It took two more years to pinpoint the exact number of affected models sold through dealerships, according to news reports at the time.

You can find the source code for this page on GitHub. While the world has been busy with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, I thought it was time to step back and take a different approach. I wanted to see if I could build a website using only HTML, without any CSS classes. In fact, I decided to try and only use CSS variables (custom properties) and the grid system that comes with CSS. And that's how new.css was born! If you're interested, you can read about how this works in the documentation. 2018 Dmitri Pisarev.

He claimed Eluned Morgan ""trivialised suicide"" when saying Brexit would ""slit the wrists of the nation."" Nathan Gill said a number of Labour and Plaid Cymru AMs had ""sought to belittle and mock"" the First Minister. He said Rhun ap Iorwerth said the First Minister should ""go home to the sheep,"" referring to him as ""a farm boy from the Vale of Glamorgan."" Mr Gill also said, when Neil McEvoy was a Labour AM, he had referred to Mr Jones as ""a lamb in sheep's clothing"" - Mr McEvoy is now an independent AM. Mr Gill said the comments ""reflect an utter lack of respect."" He said: ""It's time to call an end to this nasty and vicious narrative. ""It's about time we had a debate and a discussion about what is best for the people of Wales, and stop this descent into the abyss."" The First Minister is leaving his post in December and will be replaced by a new leader for Welsh Labour, which will be announced on Thursday. He was asked if his comments were a dig at his Labour successors who would take over, but he replied: ""My point is this: whoever is going to be the next first minister of Wales, whether it's a Labour first minister, whether it's a Plaid Cymru first minister or a Conservative first minister, they should be treated with respect."" Mr Gill said he would not comment on how he had been treated when he was an AM. The Brexit Party AM had to stand down from his role to comply with rules which prevent members from holding both Westminster and assembly seats. AMs debate whether national parliaments should be able to block the European Union from ending the Brexit transition period. Mr Jones replied: ""The honourable member, as he so often does, has got it wrong. ""He has sought to create a narrative which is at complete odds with the reality of what has happened over the course of this last couple of days. ""The UK Government, in their desperation, reached out to Labour to get a Brexit agreement and the Labour Party, in its wisdom, said no. ""I don't see any Labour AMs saying that they should have said yes."" The leader of the House, Julie James, said the First Minister should be ""allowed to speak without interruption."" A number of AMs have also complained about the way the Welsh Government has responded to the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Bill, which would give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Ms James said the Welsh Government had ""not sought to delay, or block, or derail, the bill,"" but there were ""significant concerns"" about it. She said the government was ""right to be concerned about the potential effect of the bill on the wider electoral system.""",llama_65B,2.9166666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.3846153846153846,3.515625,4.2105263157894735,-0.9575234196178535,-0.4936809828812118,-0.9347075905019402,-0.6755092008195271,0.3122772918691284,0.6231784475622516,0.7154471544715449,1.447349873803461,0.7870370370370371,1.249880258905944,-0.2142857142857142,0.6712189096159182,-0.5541871921182265,-0.022383122701085934,0.09523809523809523,0.2935435239509036,-0.4489795918367348,-0.043166401117019255,0.7647921441684136,0.6701862763047389,0.2625102543068088,-0.3748468854250184,0.018207282913165205,0.43049343109800237,1.1545454545454548,2.23434509166257,0.32380952380952377,1.4963136949672322,0.7812499999999999,0.47943565334117655,-0.38254660113141054,-0.07857613443728505,0.20535714285714277,0.2909928519777419,0.725274725274725,1.5650655083195142,0.29886552496567675,0.46090123353777734,1.5661375661375665,1.2235411168522148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.509090909090909,2.272727272727273,0.38426793510274826,0.8193142674409006,0.36595313140232,0.7284988104638559,-0.34138623104760546,-0.16446761886951775

The priest was convicted in July. The leaked information concerned a secret Vatican document on financial reform and the Holy See's relationship with Italian banks. The pontiff granted clemency ""out of the love that Jesus has for all of us and especially those who are suffering,"" a statement from the Vatican said. It added that Pope Francis was taking into consideration ""the request for clemency, the conditions of detention and the health status of Monsignor Vallejo Balda."" The pope also pardoned Francesca Chaouqui, a former public relations consultant who had been convicted along with the monsignor. The Vatican said she received a ""conditional suspension of sentence"" because the time limit to serve the brief sentence had already expired. She was sentenced to 10 months in jail but was released after four months in prison due to good behavior and regular attendance of church activities. The pontiff's action came as a sign of mercy during the Christmas season and was seen as a gesture of reconciliation. The pope's decision to grant clemency was also viewed as a way to put an end to the conflict, which had become a distraction to the Vatican's efforts to combat financial scandals.",text-davinci-003,0.9015151515151515,0.8333333333333334,0.9692307692307692,0.9375,0.6842105263157895,0.22785500161963262,0.5186367102345579,0.4183862672146066,0.3108299933609634,0.14965986394557793,-0.026697800654269733,0.28494533221194274,0.33016951796774485,0.20308641975308636,0.26182297689672396,-0.30000000000000004,0.3236815785092824,-0.38275862068965505,-0.26619886755126937,0.0,0.0,0.3999999999999997,0.14147905810403374,0.07290541935063392,0.13276676071274796,-0.07875307629204267,0.03837457462022677,0.45882352941176485,0.6849591008635207,-0.3054545454545453,-0.20897911755645648,0.0,0.5185986582895797,1.1875000000000002,0.8873741575491784,-0.13729945284243716,0.14882379947039565,0.2625,2.569390764356748,0.030769230769230656,0.5738637659050319,-0.05230146686899341,-0.018785271369123727,-0.11428571428571427,0.11270632192753702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6909090909090909,0.6363636363636364,0.22391647910590692,0.4152634783031188,-0.013710208074839744,-0.37610099712986106,0.3318043075758247,0.18447813966622634

It's basically an alternative approach to serving static content such as images or stylesheets through Apache httpd. Tower tackles these problems head on by taking a fresh look at how it can best serve up resources in a way that's fast, secure, portable, extensible, scalable, and maintainable. Tower also simplifies deployment by letting you plug in new features into your existing stack with little effort (and no need to write code). That means one developer could build production applications faster than ever before including games! You may have heard about this project and its sister projects like SquidGuard from Ninja Software via our article ""10 Anti-Virus Applications You Should Know About"": We're excited to announce today that Tower has been selected to be included in AppPackages Monthly Pack, a curated package of high quality apps currently available only from Google Play Store. We were chosen out of hundreds to receive such recognition because we are committed to building open source software solutions which offer expertly crafted performance improvements without sacrificing security precautions. By default, all installations across Android devices must conform to industry standards so that users don't face any issues while installing or searching apps using official stores. Our app is a great addition to the selection since it meets both requirements listed above perfectly. Our team was very honored to see the community embrace us even further after being featured in some other places recently too. I hope everyone enjoys getting their hands on the latest version of Tower.

This was an important step towards SpaceX's goal of sending humans and satellites to space. Future tests will involve more complex maneuvers such as controlling the engine gimbals and testing the flight control surfaces.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"This article follows the story of Kayode, an A-grade student that was studying at one of the country's most elite educational institutions who turned to cybercrime during the pandemic. The first part of the story can be read here. On March 18, 2020, a notification arrived on Kayode's phone. He had just returned from the compulsory pandemic leave and was glad to receive it. It was from the NCC and contained details of the graduates' job placement for the graduating class of 2019. Kayode had applied for an engineering position at one of the biggest tech firms in the world, a Nigerian company that is now a global tech giant with over 100 billion in revenue. He had spent almost all his free time in his final year, sending job applications to this company and was sure he had a good chance of being accepted. He had even gone as far as networking with the company's HR team on LinkedIn, to try to improve his chances of being accepted. But he was disappointed when he found out he was not accepted. Afterwards, he had gone to his department and was told that no one from his class had been selected for the company's graduate program. Kayode's hope had been shattered. He had been accepted for a graduate program at another company but it wasn't what he really wanted. He had no idea what to do next and spent the next few days in bed, crying and lamenting. During this period of mourning, he received a message from one of the people he had met on an online forum he frequented. The person had been his classmate and had been involved in a lot of online jobs and cybercrime. After their school, they had gone their separate ways but Kayode had been following his activities on the internet. The person had been running a popular blog and was involved in a lot of online activities. Kayode was confused by the message but after he had read it, he decided to reply. The person sent another message a few days later. This time, Kayode did not hesitate to reply. They exchanged messages over the next few days, and Kayode had been learning a lot of new things. He learnt that the person was running a very successful business, helping people cheat in their exams. He had a team of over 10 people who helped him with this business. One of them did the hacking, another one had access to the database of different institutions and was able to find the questions and answers to most exams in the country, another did the marketing, while others were involved in the delivery of answers to students. The person was making huge amounts of money from this business and this got Kayode thinking. ""What if I join this person's business?"" he thought. ""What if I use my tech skills to improve it? ""It will be a very risky venture, but if I get caught, the consequences could be terrible. I could go to jail for a very long time."" This thought terrified him. He had never really done anything illegal before and the thought of jail was something he didn't want to consider. ""What if I get away with it?"" he thought. ""What if I make a lot of money and no one finds out? I would never have to worry about money again."" Kayode thought about this for a few days. On March 30, he sent a message to the person. ""I would like to join you."" This article was originally published on TechCabal.

United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was dismissed for a second bookable offence. The win, United's fourth in a row in all competitions, lifted the Tangerines into fourth spot in the Championship table. It was a fairly even first half with the Tangerines having the better of the early stages but the hosts enjoying the better of the exchanges after the break. Already missing the suspended Paul Watson and the injured pair of Mark Durnan and Simon Murray, United were further weakened when defender William Edjenguele was ruled out through injury. Youngster Sam Wardrop was a surprise inclusion in the starting line up. Rovers threatened with a couple of early corners and in the 15th minute John Sullivan had to rush off his line to clear the ball to safety. Moments later United broke the deadlock. Wardrop got into the Raith box and his cross was turned into the net by fellow defender Callum Morris. The hosts stepped up the pace but United almost increased their lead on the half hour mark when, following a free kick, Wardrop headed against the post. The Tangerines had to wait until the 56th minute to create another decent scoring opportunity when Wardrop's cross was turned over by Fraser Fyvie. Raith Rovers went close in the 62nd minute when Grant Anderson's shot went narrowly past the post. United were reduced to ten men in the 75th minute when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was red-carded for a second bookable offence. Five minutes later, United were almost gifted a second goal when Sullivan's long clearance hit a post and came back off the back of Rovers keeper Kevin Cuthbert and bounced narrowly wide. At the other end, Andreu was brought down by Sullivan and the United keeper did well to deny the Spaniard from the penalty spot. The hosts almost snatched a late equaliser when, in the dying seconds, Scott Robertson's header was cleared off the line by United defender Mark Durnan.

The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain the telltale signs of a disease that has long been known only by its symptoms. Using a new technique called ""patch clamping,"" researchers were able to detect abnormal electrical activity in neurons from mice with a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The findings provide important insight into how ALS affects the brain, potentially leading to new treatments for the debilitating neurological disorder. The patch clamping technique involves placing a tiny electrode onto the surface of a neuron and then measuring the electrical activity inside the cell. By doing this, the researchers were able to detect changes in the electrical signals produced by neurons from ALS mice. They found that the neurons in ALS mice had significantly lower electrical signals than those of healthy mice. These findings suggest that ALS may be associated with a disruption of electrical signaling in certain neurons, which could be used to diagnose the condition and identify potential targets for drug therapies. Additionally, the technique could also help researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms behind ALS and other neurological disorders.",text-davinci-003,0.803030303030303,0.6666666666666666,0.6461538461538462,0.703125,0.3157894736842105,0.9714010369891327,1.1101431296452633,1.173956941857101,1.1167217188374419,0.28420256991685555,-0.34371661607648724,0.0,-0.2890335097177841,0.07921810699588472,-0.22589242409980403,1.1666666666666665,0.43330936933991826,0.35057471264367807,0.6225512739862592,0.0,0.0,0.476190476190476,-0.27036492545226043,-0.5980150410787285,-0.8079040577366643,0.4265791632485644,-0.22185273968246388,0.6372549019607845,-0.42046668790689756,0.021212121212121196,0.6764400323377334,-0.3111111111111111,-0.00983061044707746,0.9895833333333334,0.8007390279779449,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.4375,-0.07576923428973634,-0.358974358974359,-0.1548931926903239,0.0,0.0,-0.18342151675484983,0.3379685238424805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,1.0909090909090908,0.4064502177159607,0.12039110290067515,0.7328662035248147,-1.0872312321722437,0.8852637409825029,0.8383474187346989

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Two plant-based burger companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are set to launch the next versions of their burgers. While both burgers are plant-based, their formulas are quite different. Beyond is focused on its ""bleeding"" process that creates a meaty flavour in almost all of its products while Impossible has been much more selective with its ingredients. Here is our guide to help you decide which one will work better for your dog (and if it matters at all). Beyond Meat Burger vs Impossible Burger: Ingredients List The two burgers share similar lists of nutrients, but differ greatly when talking ingredient-by-ingredient. Each company claims that they have developed an innovative new production method that makes them healthier than traditional animal-based foods. Both companies use wheat protein as one of their main ingredients along with soy oil and nitrogenous compounds such as peas or mung bean flour. However, beyond uses pea protein instead of soy isolate and lacks red food colourings and preservatives while impossible contains egg white powder, emulsifiers and stabilisers. Check out these complete nutrition facts below! Does Your Dog Need Protein? Protein is essential to maintain muscle mass and support bone health - both vital for growing dogs. For adult weightlifters, around 1 gram per pound of bodyweight can be used daily. How Healthy Is Chicken? Chicken breast (breast fillet) is considered healthy by many experts considering how relatively low in fat, cholesterol and sodium it is. It also provides good sources of iron, vitamin B12, niacin, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc among other nutrients. Unfortunately, processed chicken tends to contain high levels of sugar and salt because processing speeds up cooking times to make it taste great. The best way to ensure that your dog gets enough protein from his meals is to feed him regular ground chicken rather than whole chickens. If he doesn't like this texture, consider adding some cooked eggs into his meal. Not only do eggs provide extra protein, but they add calcium and vitamins too thanks to the shell. Alternatively, try adding cereal grains such as rice krispies or corn flakes or veggies like carrots, celery and broccoli. You could even go further back to oats, fruit and nuts. Since human studies show no adverse effects after consuming certain amounts of tofu, it might not be harmful either. Read our article about feeding dogs well so you know what type of diet works for any breed. Ingredients found in Beyond Caution 1: Soy Soybeans are extremely popular in American diets due to their affordability, convenience and versatility. Popularly added to sauces and dressings, they offer potential benefits including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer according to science. Besides providing phytonutrients and Omega 3 fatty acids, soy may prevent age-related declines in cognitive function. Apart from being part of nutritional supplements sold online to people looking for ways to improve brain power, most commercial pet treats have nothing to do with natural soybean products. They usually made from indigestible proteins derived from bacteria...or worse, chemical additives. Thankfully there's now naturally gluten free alternatives available too. Know where your pet got yours Ingredients found in Beyond Caution2: Peas Lentils If you're worried about whether your dog needs protein given his size, then lentil and pea beans are likely safe options. According to research conducted by Cornell University scientists, consumption of leguminous pulses improves blood lipid profiles, reduces inflammation and lowers BMI without causing negative impacts like bloating associated with higher intakes of carbohydrates. Plus, both types of beans are inexpensive, making them suitable choices for those who want to invest in quality nutrition for their pets. Read More: Why Dogs Should Avoid Garlic What Are Nitrates And Chlorates In Food? Nitrites and chlorinates are commonly used artificial preservatives often confused with each other. Although both can be fatal if consumed in large quantities over short periods of time, nitrite-containing products were banned in dog foods under FDA regulation in 1986. Many years later, USDA regulations reaffirmed this decision, stating that ""NITRATE LEVELS SHOULD NOT EXCEED 15 ppm."" Chlorinated water treatments applied to areas deemed 'at risk' prior to Hurricane Sandy resulted in New York City drinking supplies containing high concentrations of chlorine dioxide ranging between 0 - 25. This substance should never enter drinking supply systems otherwise it poses serious risks to public safety and long term human exposure.

The technique involves sending radio signals towards targets and measuring the reflections, which are then processed to reveal basic characteristics of an individual's mood such as happiness or sadness. The researchers tested their system using 19 subjects who wore heart rate monitors while completing tasks on two separate occasions in Sydney, Australia. Subjects were instructed to either smile, frown, wince, grimace, make angry facial expressions or show no emotion at all for 1 minute intervals during each round. Each subject was observed through a one-way mirror with a video camera recording what they saw throughout this period. After processing machine learning algorithms learned about these patterns individually based on specific time periods over days before testing them together again so it could identify when people made similar behaviors simultaneously compared to earlier measurements taken on other individuals. These correlated responses between different individuals formed indicators of ""emotional contagion,"" where emotional states may be transferred among nearby people via social interactions something previously shown only within small groups (between 3-5) rather than large groups (30). According to coauthor Dr David Stillwell, ""Our results show evidence suggestive of moderate levels of external influence beyond 5 meters."" For example, someone smiling might cause another participant to do likewise; but not vice versa.""

""Substantial evidence"" has been gathered so far, according to the US justice department, and further investigations into the scandal are ongoing. The US Department of Justice has alleged that the defendants were involved in a long-running scheme to solicit and receive bribes and kickbacks from sports marketing firms in exchange for media and marketing rights to major international soccer tournaments. The charges include wire fraud, money laundering, and racketeering. Additionally, two Fifa executives were also accused of bribery. The investigation is ongoing and further indictments may be forthcoming as the US authorities continue to probe into the corruption allegations.

The excitement around startups keeps them alive! While doing this book I've had many conversations with people about how much better their life has been since becoming an entrepreneur: more freedom; greater sense-of purpose at being able create something new from nothing every day rather than having some job description imposed on him or her by someone else who doesn't appreciate what he does but only cares whether his department meets its quarterly numbers today so she won' t lose her bonus tomorrow...

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Fitbit announced a new premium service called Fitbit Care designed for health care customers or employers and health systems that use Fitbit to keep tabs on employees' health efforts and company insurance costs. The Fitbit Care service includes a premium version of the Fitbit Plus app that incorporates health coaching into the app, according to a company statement. The Fitbit Plus app has a focus on conditions including diabetes, hypertension, depression and other health issues. The app will provide health coaching, and it will also use aggregated and anonymized data for population health studies. The service also includes the Fitbit Inspire device, which features a 5-day battery life, 247 heart rate tracking and sleep tracking. The company also sells the Fitbit Inspire HR tracker, which adds a pulse oximeter and advanced sleep analysis. Fitbit will also provide access to a team of health coaches that will work with employees, as well as analytics and dashboards to help employees and employers track trends in their health. The new Fitbit Care service is targeted at a growing market. Employers are increasingly turning to workplace wellness programs that focus on employees' health and well-being, including apps and wearable devices that employees can use to monitor their health. Health care systems and other providers are also looking to wellness apps and devices to improve patient outcomes and keep insurance costs down. With the Fitbit Care service, Fitbit can tap into this trend to help grow its revenue. The company has struggled recently with declining sales and profits. In July, the company announced a 15 decline in revenue for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. It also posted a loss of 54 million for the second quarter compared to a 58 million loss in the same quarter last year. Fitbit is also working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop an app for veterans to track their health and wellness. The VA will supply Fitbit devices to about 10,000 veterans to use the app and collect data on their health. The Fitbit Care service could also be used to expand on that work and provide more services to the VA and other health care customers.",llama_65B,1.9848484848484849,2.0,1.6153846153846154,1.6875,1.2105263157894737,0.19622835908326175,-0.2579831427525626,0.22744394582696437,-0.3226134052853394,0.06722689075630227,-0.08324315999595122,-0.2590412111017662,-0.16287693058659172,-0.2071532316630355,-0.07802278489392182,-0.5,-0.03881260329627885,0.16430020283975652,0.29227863723112685,0.0,0.0,1.126050420168067,0.9596179331734298,-0.21568904340758452,-0.06425320303840605,0.11581334748829791,-0.3265145407820386,-0.3373702422145331,0.015787971775855513,-0.6925133689839573,-0.07176373778494381,1.3882352941176472,1.4471842569952962,0.26654411764705893,0.551867202473325,0.06701725482922466,0.5681904668738009,0.03308823529411769,0.6953855862079374,-0.31674208144796384,-0.15592576203832836,-0.430717962450534,-0.3373708395549114,-0.4855275443510736,-0.29240875947341677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,2.4545454545454546,0.8362931303003925,0.3035467344121375,1.5312564505896418,-0.17611809480271592,0.15377907842659297,-0.07291522964355326

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday. Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that has happened. He said the deal - an effort to deal with diseased larch - was a success. Although he was happy with the decision, Mr Roberts admitted that its documentation was ""not good,"" that there should have been more discussion with Welsh Government and that the executive board could have had a greater role in scrutinising the deal. A member of the committee, Lee Waters, later dubbed the answers ""unconvincing."" In 2014 a company was awarded a PS39m deal to purchased both spruce and larch timber - the latter of which was forests where a fungus disease causing extensive damage - Phytophthora ramorum - was present. No other company was given the opportunity to bid for the contracts. As part of that deal the company was meant to have built a new saw line by 31 March 2016. That deadline was missed and extended by 12 months to March 2017. During a session of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Labour Llanelli AM Lee Waters asked Mr Roberts if the line had been built. ""We are in on going discussions with the operator on that,"" said Mr Roberts. Mr Waters pressed him again, pointing out that the date of the committee's meeting was 28 March. Mr Roberts repeated the answer, adding later it was a ""commercial matter."" Mr Waters asked if Mr Roberts felt the firm ""pulled the wool over your eyes in making you feel that the only way they were going to deal with this crisis was by investing in new expensive capital equipment."" Mr Roberts replied with a denial: ""No, I don't think they have pulled the wool over our eyes at all."" ""At the time, there was no market for larch,"" he said, claiming timber merchants at the time ""would not touch larch, let alone diseased larch."" ""What the operator did and the rest of the industry did was actually build up that market."" Mr Roberts said there was a ""real crisis on our hands at the time"" and there had been a danger the timber market would collapse. ""The situation today was a lot more stable than it was in 2013-14. Our policy, our decisions on these contracts together with the overarching policy in treating larch disease has been successful,"" he said. ""It's stopped the spread, but it's meant the timber market has been able to carry on as well."" A report by auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas released earlier in March expressed doubt over whether the decision met state aid rules and said the decision-making process was not transparent. In a qualification to the body's accounts he said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful. NRW disputed the auditor's findings on state aid and had said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful. Neither NRW or the auditors have identified the company involved. Following the meeting Mr Waters said the answers given by the chief executive ""were not satisfactory"" and that the evidence was ""unconvincing."" He said it was a ""serious issue which has been badly handled."" Mr Waters said it was clear from the evidence ""with two days to go before the end of March the saw mill line has not been installed by this company."" ""I think the whole committee felt that the performance was complacent and this was a sufficiently grave situation for the auditor general to qualify the accounts, which rarely happens,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I think the committee will be referring this to the full assembly to draw this to their attention,"" he said.",human,3.9166666666666665,4.166666666666667,4.3076923076923075,4.453125,4.631578947368421,-0.6645840694730095,-0.2565735125078763,-0.41748502120762004,0.029773019749633492,-0.03174603174603187,0.32479245061143286,0.24177179702831517,0.31592404613835784,0.2981481481481482,0.3115571970037724,-0.3666666666666667,0.07305418464096543,-0.13275862068965513,0.04703836342863231,0.03333333333333333,0.1795054935711501,-0.10000000000000002,0.18464600536111353,-0.1315156584364375,0.3155648381336854,0.08203445447087777,0.24729550619591023,-0.35686274509803934,-0.08930838609447982,0.9545454545454548,0.6619735881718533,-0.3999999999999999,0.17074918534358097,0.875,0.1048668991962978,-0.13729945284243716,0.14882379947039565,0.21250000000000005,0.44382215933138225,0.3384615384615384,0.5549260934334286,0.31380880121396054,0.5901639933332524,0.6264550264550266,0.636621366749382,0.03333333333333333,0.17950549357115012,0.0,0.0,1.9090909090909092,2.1818181818181817,0.4638002992679537,1.0463269251774636,0.06340409340839867,0.4242365032224809,-0.30613254997831585,-0.07228971633310989

Neural networks have been used for a variety of tasks, including image classification, speech recognition and controlling robotic movements. In this example we use them as pattern classifiers. You may recognize some things from your experience with the Internet: users are presented with patterns of text on a computer screen and asked what they think that word means or if there is just too much noise. The basic idea behind using neural networks here is that you feed lots (that's right, thousands) of words into a single machine learning system, and see which ones end up working better than others at picking out the real meaning of the input. That way, even though humans might not be able to deal well with all those different types of information at once, computers can handle it easily enough. We'll interactively build two models - one based on English dictionary definitions alone, another based on more humanlike methods like puns and inferences. This will show exactly why most previous attempts to create effective language analysis systems haven't worked very well, and also demonstrate the power of modern statistical techniques like neural networks.",gpt_j,0.8484848484848485,0.6666666666666666,0.9384615384615385,0.921875,0.5789473684210527,0.37002875529342544,0.2190936714579238,0.3924349414164208,0.5320190893164293,0.3749055177626607,0.921838892996927,0.5468647789926174,1.2346876138936362,0.4825102880658439,1.2440083018581882,0.9444444444444446,0.7427118480597287,1.850574712643678,2.3423180455519583,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666665,0.7662563833432262,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.35001367240907844,0.5773125784672059,0.3823529411764707,0.8308569581729669,0.17676767676767685,0.20493649746939333,0.1333333333333333,0.5292094407109151,0.15625000000000008,0.627029874122419,-0.23045534637855883,0.13633658077675598,-0.10416666666666662,0.8783186180705712,0.35897435897435886,0.601048944913127,0.5230146686899342,0.2790040303611169,0.01410934744268112,-0.000930056033617951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1636363636363636,0.6363636363636364,-0.3818233672242666,0.5721594966849205,-0.2823934804139819,-0.447886293731714,0.4939028718920019,0.5279074916209227

Canada and particularly Ontario has been promoting its car-making sector as it attempts to compete with Mexico. Ontario's Premier called the investment a ""vote of confidence."" ""Our government welcomes this investment, which will help Ontario play a leading role in building the auto industry of the future,"" said Premier Kathleen Wynne. Canada has been fighting to keep carmakers in the country. Many have been lured to Mexico where production is cheaper and the cars have the same tariff free access to the US market. As part of this effort last year Ontario became the first Canadian province to allow road testing of driverless cars. Over the last five years carmakers in Ontario produced nearly 15 of all North American vehicles. The investment will be in GM's Kapuskasing plant, which focuses on cold weather technology.

The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain which neurons are more likely to degenerate over time. This can be particularly useful in studying neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, which are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in specific brain regions. For example, researchers can use this technology to pinpoint which brain regions are most affected in a patient with Alzheimer's and track the progression of the disease over time. Similarly, they can use it to test the effectiveness of new drugs that are designed to slow or halt the disease progression by measuring the rate of neuronal degeneration in those brain regions.

While it is unknown who the satellite belonged to, rumors have pointed towards China and Pakistan as possible targets. The ASAT missile was launched from Dr Abdul Kalam Island in Akashindi near Chandigarh; the Indian Defense Research Development Organization (DRDO) planned for this launch since January of 2016. It's unclear if the DRDO conducted any additional tests, but at least one report suggests that they did so earlier in July. India had declared an ""exclusion zone"" around the test site after conducting the first trial in April 2012: A successful anti-sat mission will be carried out by indian scientists engineers with support from our strategic friends like US,UK etc., The results would not only help us to check aggression against peaceful nations but also take forward our space program further. We request you all to cooperate fully with our efforts in this regard. Kindly provide necessary assistance to them within your capacity, As explained above there are excluision zones around some areas where such activities may occur. All persons or entity doing these activities will immediately inform my office before starting. These systems shall however be handled strictly according to law. I wish success to this effort. Sincerely Yours Shri Narendra Modi Chief Minister OF Gujarat PUNJABMAYOI KARMAHALANVIR CHIKNAPPRAZYATHAM BHAVA Dear Sir,I am happy to inform you about the status of our research on detectiondefence system ""KOMPAS"" for neutralizing satellites including satellites used for launching missiles space weaponsetc.. Our team has developed a laser based system capable of destroying objects weighing upto 12 tonne like satellites using multiple beams of light through different frequencies (wavelengths). This work can be done very rapidly and effectively without causing damage to infrastructure due to required power levels being limited (20kwatts max.) and hence suitable in case of armed conflict between two countries like ours against enemy country using nukes etc.It's likely to succeed operationally soon provided we procure few more lasers per year.We also desire USA UK to share technical cooperation on building same level defence equipment apart from sharing their latest technology and experience on building similar devices.You may kindly assign appropriate person in charge of the matter to contact me directly. Thanks regards, PS: A copy of the patent application filed recently in U S Patent Office might interest you sir.

The New York Times reported last week that Anish Pandya, CEO of Antrix Corporation told reporters that India sent waves of communication during the time period at issue, indicating communications were going back and forth among various government agencies. Twitter user Subhash1 tweeted yesterday morning that while he didn't see anything suspicious, his colleagues saw what looked like silent explosions occurred several times over the past month near the border area in Rajouri district. Space observers noted the anomaly after tweets began circulating early today. In addition to tracking the location of the debris via radar, IMAGEOS operators noticed something unusual coming into view shortly thereafter: That image became visible just fifteen minutes later, although again with no confirmed source yet: Soon enough, numerous other images came online showing the damaged satellite falling toward Earth: One observer went even further than that, tweeting consecutive videos starting nearly ten hours ago - currently sitting at 3200 retweets as well as 506 favorites and 1360 views - showing how the debris fell onto land. That video shows smoke rising off the ground: This morning, users on social media continued pointing out that the object itself appears somewhat familiar. Here are four separate examples of people wondering if this could possibly be a piece of another failed Chinese rocket, as spotted by Orbital ATK: Here's another example of someone seeing similarities to North Korea's Taegeuk 2 rocket: Finally, here are three members of Reddit noticing something odd about the orbit of Space Chain: If you're viewing this post Monday morning, chances are good that you'll find yourself confused regarding the origin of the debris. The story gets much simpler when you realize the debris is already orbiting the planet, having stopped the day before in low earth orbit.

The pair were put in a boat and driven to safety by police A man who was arrested today following allegations of dangerous driving has subsequently been released without charge. A number of witnesses have reported seeing three men running from the scene before they drove off together into the woods. One witness said: 'They shouted ""We're all going for it,"" switched their lights on full beam then sped away in one vehicle moments later' Another claimed that the accomplices ran through fields towards Icknield Way, just near where the incident took place. Police are still trying to trace them but no arrests have yet been made. Several press photographers had arrived at the park when the incident happened as part of an effort to get pictures which could show the accident itself because reporters often missed such things out sometimes due to poor timing or lack of opportunity. They certainly got some good shots. Police divers wearing white overalls entered the flooded Vauxhall S-Type about 5pm. But the damage meant its nose was partly under water - though not enough to be under pressure. It is believed there were people inside at the time. Witnesses jokingly called 999 saying the driver would need rescuing, while others told how shocked pedestrians jumped onto cars with wheels up in order to reach dry land. Many couldn't believe what they saw unfold in front of their eyes. Other drivers stopped so the motorists involved could safely climb out of the vehicle and walk home free. In vain. Others tried to help but failed when the rain started pouring down even harder. The motorist was eventually rescued shortly afterwards. Emergency services raced around Melton Mowbray Road, near Nottinghamshire Railway Station and Market Square shopping centre, to check if anyone else needed assistance. There was also concern that a person might have fallen over after coming from nearby shops and entered the floodwater underneath a bridge. Also parked cars in the area had become partially submerged. By 6.30pm crews pulled back having found nobody trapped or needing rescue. However, several other vehicles remained parked along side busy roads including Broadbent Lane and Petergate St, where sandbags prevented further flooding from reaching the road surface.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Scientists have 3D printed cyanobacteria and graphene onto a mushroom in order to produce electricity. Shining a light on the cyanobacteria will kickstart their photosynthesis, which causes them to give off electrons that get transferred to the mushrooms' leaves via a conductive thread created using nanotechnology. The end result is an entire forest of electrical plants growing atop each other like trees - but without any need for soil or sunlight. While this may seem like science fiction, the researchers from Queen Mary University believe they are one step closer toward creating sustainable energy sources by harnessing nature itself: By combining carbon-based materials with bacteria capable of producing biomass (i.e., organic matter), we can create sturdier versions of natural systems. This latest experiment has been described as ""a major breakthrough in synthetic biology"" because it involves two different organisms working together through complex chemical processes instead of just relying on solar power alone. While scientists haven't yet managed to generate enough current to run anything more than small devices such as LEDs at full capacity, future research could lead to low-energy power grids where everything runs straight off microbial fuel cells.",opt_30b,0.6818181818181818,0.3333333333333333,0.5846153846153846,0.546875,0.47368421052631576,1.2911669560643801,0.740067292163805,1.1549271108349528,0.6071827676498182,0.8629737609329443,0.20431657878923398,0.5920941968040372,0.3656982162585212,0.4660493827160493,-0.0006637880069247295,1.7857142857142856,2.2235578483938045,0.7315270935960589,1.2600503247837962,0.0,0.0,1.244897959183673,-0.2276458552990219,-0.7627499755591521,-0.3870839010912346,0.9844134536505332,0.4527016661584984,1.2563025210084038,-0.3700709638040656,0.1545454545454547,-0.16297621221108546,-0.34285714285714286,0.7253281906922375,-0.11160714285714288,0.887271350276132,-0.154409719002133,-0.05117266213995568,0.3482142857142856,1.6556824293261596,0.37362637362637346,0.5735178782453004,0.3735819062070958,0.367257685678503,0.25396825396825423,0.3495605622726029,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3499271061118826,1.4,0.6363636363636364,-0.7687540901273979,0.762513339269674,-0.32566195544002546,-1.3129824320905892,1.329997949088637,1.3058552319458205

This thread contains observations and lessons from founders and business owners that were not successful. 1. Failure to take risks: Many entrepreneurs fail because they are unwilling to take risks. They think that playing it safe is the best way to succeed, but this is not always the case. Taking risks can lead to greater rewards and opportunities. 2. Not understanding the market: Entrepreneurs often make the mistake of thinking that their product or service is the best and that everyone will love it. However, it is important to understand your target market and what they need before launching a business. 3. Lack of focus: Many entrepreneurs try to do too much at once, which makes it difficult to stay on track and produce results. It is important to focus on one task at a time and put all of your energy into that. 4. Poor financial management: Managing finances is essential for any business but many entrepreneurs fail to properly manage their finances. This leads to cash flow problems, which can quickly derail the success of a startup. 5. No plan for scaling up: Many entrepreneurs fail to plan for the future when it comes to scaling up their business. It is important to have a plan in place to ensure that you can keep up with demand as your business grows. 6. Lack of marketing: Marketing is essential for any business but many entrepreneurs don't invest enough in it. Without proper marketing, you won't be able to get your product or service out there and attract customers.",text-davinci-003,1.2803030303030303,1.6666666666666667,1.676923076923077,1.609375,1.105263157894737,-0.3591167577818959,0.39261108342286866,-0.5087557622427622,-0.5451932455365497,-0.3900226757369614,-0.5352044219257749,0.12088589851415758,-0.10875317017512162,0.02160493827160509,-0.1294696085750156,0.03333333333333344,-0.1502284310229253,0.11724137931034477,0.37552970552617954,0.0,0.0,-0.25714285714285734,-0.663188864258166,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.10500410172272347,-0.04999457168504152,-0.5352941176470589,0.09579425898645874,0.11454545454545452,0.1990736137328945,0.5333333333333334,0.692275722443058,-0.71875,-0.2639915603588501,-0.4167671334508022,-0.26575495478345157,0.8624999999999998,0.40592568356597414,0.8307692307692308,0.24584394599281553,0.20920586747597372,0.35238403825555253,-0.5587301587301585,-0.5631542350812567,0.0,0.0,0.7333333333333333,0.9285592184789414,0.4909090909090909,1.4545454545454546,0.46621384657526965,0.235319006753887,0.7177345469314249,0.6532925082050449,-0.6424638695427355,-0.6585199989076229

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning flashes from within clouds that are moving at 40 kilometers (25 miles) per second and with temperatures exceeding 2 million degrees Celsius (3.6 million Fahrenheit). ""It's amazing to see how quickly they flash,"" said study co-author Jeroen van der Wiel - an astrophysicist at Utrecht University using data from one of those telescopes for his doctorate research on these ultrafast particles. ""So I was really surprised when we found out it is not visible."" This new interpretation provides evidence that electrons can indeed travel faster than light does through certain materials under extreme conditions like this thunderstorm cloud. [The Strangest Things That Can Travel Faster Than Light] Lightning strikes above sea level produce electromagnetic waves called gamma rays; while higher up in the atmosphere more powerful X-rays emerge as well. As these rays pass through Earth's dense ionosphere layer between 50 and 600 miles high, which allows charged particles such as ions, electrons or electrically neutral atoms to hop across space easily, some energy gets absorbed by them along the way, according to theory. And if there happens to be any free electron pairs inside, then all the better. Since the speed limit normally applied to photons applies also here, photon emission never occurs because nobody has managed yet to send a particle traveling past another particle before its arrival time measured in classical physics would have allowed this. In other words: Photons still don't breach their own speed limit no matter what cosmic circumstances come into play! But sky events involving fast-moving particles do happen occasionally - but only extremely rarely. Such rare occasions include supernovas exploding away from us as seen from different directions around our planet, perturbations near the edge of black holes known as gravitational wave signals, and now perhaps even lightning bolts hitting the ground. All of these phenomena raise serious questions about whether Einstein got things right after all regarding nothing being able to break the universal laws governing light. If you're curious why scientists haven't settled this debate so far despite many attempts over decades, read more about why physicists just didn't find anything wrong with relativity back in 2017.",opt_30b,2.121212121212121,1.5,2.0153846153846153,2.1875,1.894736842105263,0.8473004842044777,0.3214461477030563,0.39107529061503254,0.3092117656100686,0.8629737609329443,0.5748577739551662,0.7216148023549203,0.2505459862162874,0.8919753086419755,0.23443534939210425,1.0,0.7109128386928382,3.195812807881773,1.3798807849993748,0.0,0.0,1.1530612244897955,1.2267296688926288,-0.6279668473478963,-0.2357765859563858,0.5906480721903199,0.811383281199362,0.7647058823529413,0.9595810146751954,-0.04545454545454524,0.08328728710856,-0.19999999999999996,0.7364215709440102,0.0223214285714287,0.35865070682759836,0.4444495965872206,1.1312480304605348,0.13392857142857142,0.5295522596111611,0.4395604395604394,0.14973112451036494,1.1581039092419971,0.8976503221925034,0.38095238095238115,0.5687280893685898,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.25753937681885636,2.8545454545454545,2.5454545454545454,-0.5981209383157823,1.0306052228610305,0.08563294406448095,-0.6509878825257278,0.8776382267166175,0.7624819514616107

The first one, a replica Viking ship, was found by a family in Waterside Park, and a further 12 were found in the first week of the exhibition, with the last one found on Wednesday 18th April. Jerram said: ""I'm thrilled with the response to the Treasure City project. 13 of the 14 treasures have now been found. The treasures have been hidden in locations that can be seen in the paintings at 20-21. I'm hoping that people will now go back to the exhibition and look at the artworks in a different light."" The remaining treasure is a model of The Shard in London, and is hidden in an underground location. Treasure City runs at the 20-21 Arts Centre, Scunthorpe until Saturday 5th May.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Speaking during a parliamentary debate, Philip Hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister Jo Johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well. The debate came after numerous reports of fireworks causing harm to people and animals, as well as causing damage to property. Supporters of a ban argue that it would improve safety and reduce the negative impacts of fireworks. However, opponents of a ban argue that it would be difficult to enforce and that it would restrict people's freedom to celebrate events such as Guy Fawkes Night and Diwali. Despite the debate, there is currently no ban on individual fireworks in the UK, but there are regulations in place to ensure they are used safely. As an assistant, I would recommend following the guidelines and safety measures when using fireworks to prevent harm to yourself and others. It is important to use fireworks in open spaces, away from people and buildings, and have fire safety equipment on hand. Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the impact on animals and children in the vicinity.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.6136363636363636,0.6666666666666666,0.6153846153846154,0.65625,0.2631578947368421,0.23287510360953226,0.5784105612910331,0.6510540452296517,0.35577021744714005,-0.09372637944066528,-0.27072949254918904,-0.05756471357817006,0.2494206928980733,-0.007201646090534723,0.058842339656526466,-0.05555555555555558,-0.21906463965371273,0.5172413793103448,0.04556952426273632,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142854,-0.08091322929036629,-0.49318371913664055,-0.1988874140906114,0.04375170905113465,-0.022925220629400014,-0.12745098039215677,-0.001140862337956557,-0.28989898989898977,0.07399846452255161,1.4666666666666666,0.5292094407109151,-0.3645833333333333,-0.29939702097087495,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.22916666666666666,1.1029232042022812,-0.0512820512820513,0.09200991173079419,0.34867644579328955,0.3051069275546079,-0.38095238095238076,-0.5483677778610315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,0.09090909090909091,0.39015623171224223,0.1903726854143688,-0.38630208058791143,-0.4758744495784526,0.2778323748423277,0.1638657321405031

It began development in 2016, with a successful trial run on a test track in 2017. The train is designed to be more energy efficient, reduce the amount of noise pollution, and improve safety features for passengers. It can also travel through tunnels and bridges without generating any air resistance. The train is set to be operational in China by 2021 and is currently being tested in other countries around the world.",text-davinci-003,-0.08333333333333333,0.0,-0.046153846153846156,-0.0625,-0.21052631578947367,-0.1720625999520043,0.4063482883352712,0.3692139389657447,0.4430039169489558,-0.40816326530612235,-0.5956607823127598,-0.2590412111017662,-0.5158029369854958,-0.3413580246913579,-0.4913049929390493,-0.30000000000000004,-0.3271509864903169,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,0.3142857142857143,-0.10276777108145871,-0.6818800986323986,-0.5528664176765496,-0.3543888433141919,-0.5730935371675872,0.22941176470588226,-0.38075201699290195,0.6745454545454548,0.80496174580883,0.0,-0.03207660596625444,-0.21874999999999986,-0.8424409889603139,0.4615598627469165,0.2633953074294666,0.2625,0.6580021181568497,-0.5230769230769231,-0.5057640218984862,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.5587301587301585,-0.458717677848607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.03636363636363636,-0.36363636363636365,-0.04332224054356962,-0.0830599874464982,-0.6454937339235507,-0.1000099514020301,-0.13681519858368124,-0.03956907383450655

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Blocks have shown up in almost every blogging tool, web editor, note-taking app, and content management system, but they are almost all proprietary and non-standard. Blocks are often limited to just a few types of elements or confined by the size of your screen (a mobile phone). You cannot use web standards with them because most blocks don't support it yet - some never will. Blogger doesn't even allow embedded media tags for CSS! This means you can only do certain things within their little box; if something needs an ID attribute on one block that isn't supported then good luck figuring out what is going wrong when the styles stop applying correctly. If there's no way around this problem, how am I supposed to implement my own custom styling? The other major issue with current commercial blocks comes down to business models: In order to make money from selling apps to small businesses, designers need everything locked into the software while also being able to get rid of any pesky bugs via expensive upgrades whenever features change.

In an official statement, Facebook said that the issues began around 8 AM Pacific. At the time of this post, it was still occurring. The social network said that the outage wasn't related to a cyber attack, but a bug that caused Facebook's systems to change how it distributed images and videos across its apps. As a result, some people may have experienced this on their feeds, while others did not. Facebook is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. In a statement to The Verge, a spokesperson said: ""During one of our routine maintenance operations, we triggered an issue that is making it difficult for some people to upload or send photos and videos. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience."" It's unclear when the outage will be fixed. We'll update this post when Facebook resolves the issues.

The commentator himself had wished for ""something very, very quiet and very, very private"" in his last interview with Fairfax Media before his death in August. ""His widow has kindly declined the offer of a state funeral or memorial service,"" Mr Abbott told reporters on Sunday. ""Margaret Thatcher had a state funeral, Ronald Reagan had a state funeral, but Bob Hawke did not have a state funeral. Bob Hawke was, in many ways, a bigger figure than them, but that's the way things go."" The government was ""not going to insist"" on a state funeral, Mr Abbott said, noting it was ""very, very unusual"" to hold one for someone who did not hold the highest office in the land. ""Bob was a great Australian and he will be much missed,"" he said. ""I think that the thing that Australians will miss most about Bob Hawke is that he was a man who loved life and lived it to the full."" Mr Hawke passed away peacefully on Thursday at the age of 89. His family said they would hold a private funeral. Mr Hawke's widow Daphne phoned Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday to politely decline a state funeral for her husband. Mr Hawke was the 23rd prime minister of Australia, serving from 1983 to 1991.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the city's powerful tycoon bosses. On 15 December last year, Kwok left an election rally for his party after he was attacked by another pro-democracy activist Jaspal Singh Shergill who had been heckling him all day at polling stations across southern China. Mr Shergill claimed Mr Kwok ""hit me with both fists"" on the head. A photo taken shortly afterwards showed blood pouring from Mr Kwok's face onto the floor as other supporters surrounded him. Two days later, it emerged that Mr Kwok suffered damaged tendons in his right arm following the assault. The incident caused outrage among many voters and ignited calls for tougher action to be taken against abusive behaviour - but also drew ridicule when some took to social media claiming he ""won"" the fight because it happened before voting began. The claim spread widely despite no evidence being presented that suggested this was true. By April, Mr Kwok said he would not contest any more elections as well as stepping down from politics altogether. But then, just weeks later, Mr Kwok announced he would take part in protests planned for 1 June calling on Beijing to allow direct democracy in Hong Kong. He insisted his decision wasn't driven by electoral gains or loss, saying: ""I have always believed you should do what you think is fair and right."" Two and a half years since Occupy Central first occupied key thoroughfares, including Mong Kok street, Sha Tin road and Chater Garden Place, the movement remains defiantly alive in opposition to current Chinese rule over Hong Kong. Despite repeated arrests, mass rallies, violent clashes between protesters and police, and even attacks on mainland visitors visiting the former British colony, activists continue their protest each weekend without fail, refusing to halt until they achieve universal suffrage as promised under Article 23 of its mini-constitution known as 'One Country'. Last week, hundreds braved heavy rain and strong winds to gather outside government headquarters chanting anti-China slogans. On Saturday morning, Police deployed water cannon trucks aiming at thousands of demonstrators which forced them back into nearby streets. Dozens were arrested at the scene while riot officers in full body armour tried to prevent people entering building sites close to where construction work continues unabated. It came after fresh waves of tear gas used on Friday night forced thousands out of shopping malls and sent scores injured to hospital. Thousands gathered again yesterday afternoon outside the central government offices to denounce security forces' violence towards peaceful protesters. Riot squads armed with pepper spray, baton charges and rubber bullets fired directly at crowds. At least 58 people were wounded during scuffles with police around noon as they advanced through the crowd using force to disperse protesters blocking roads and vandalising buildings. Scores appeared badly beaten up as ambulances rushed dozens away from the area. Among those carried off on stretchers included three women aged 18, 31 and 49 from different parts of the city.

Police detained Kwan Tak Soi (pictured above) earlier today. File photo: HKFP via Facebook. Hundreds still remained on Sunday evening marching from Admiralty MTR station to Cheung Chau Ho Luk Industrial Estate next door to Shenzhen Bay Port terminal demanding justice for the elderly woman killed there recently. Protesters set fire to Tsim Sha Tsui East promenade and four major public parks in Central District, causing a massive traffic jam that extended along Nathan Road. Some threw petrol bombs inside supermarkets like New World First Link Mart Ltd and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. Several shops attached to bus stops near Admiralty Stock Exchange, south shore of Victoria Harbour and Shau Keong Street were burned. Burning tyres covered roads around Connaught Drive, Shek Tong Tsui St Nicholas Church, Mochtar Park, Tseung Koo Building, Yee Wo House and Horizon Plaza Shopping Centre. Others smashed glass windows and hoardings in front of banks and high rise apartments around Causeway Bay such as Soho commercial districts and Standard Chartered Bank branch. Armed men dressed in black adopted North Face jackets carrying US flag flags stormed Tai Hang Centre and Cityplaza mall owned by Swire Group Holdings Limited. They climbed atop escalators, tore apart tarpaulin covers covering lifts, broke tiles and smashed mirrors. Store owners locked doors as masked individuals chased customers and employees trying to run away. In West Point Public School playground, classes resumed amid heavy shouts and screams of students running helter skelter. Around midnight, riot squad members meted out midnight snacks and drinks to weary commuters sitting stranded in underground carriages or waiting for buses.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. ""Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomy about the state of the global economy,"" Haldane said. Britain's central banker Andrew Haldane warned on Tuesday that the global economy faced a ""deeper, darker"" period as slowing growth in emerging markets and a deeper than expected crisis in Europe's banking sector combined to intensify the challenges facing the world. Speaking at a business forum, the Bank of England's chief economist said his outlook for the global economy had grown darker in recent months, with risks on the downside. Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. ""Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomy about the state of the global economy,"" Haldane said. ""My concerns are compounded by the seemingly unthinking and unilateral withdrawal from globalisation we are seeing in many advanced economies. This is a protectionist retreat. The threat of creeping protectionism could, if left unchecked, put the global economy on a slippery slope to contraction,"" he said. Haldane's remarks echo the view of many other policy makers who have been taken aback by a recent slowdown in China and emerging markets, combined with a fresh intensification of the banking crisis in Europe. The BoE has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent for more than six years and most economists polled by Reuters do not expect rates to rise until the first quarter of 2017. Haldane said the central bank's forecasts for wage growth had turned out to be too optimistic and the BoE had ""failed to pick up this slowdown in the strength of wage growth as the labour market has recovered. ""As a result, inflationary pressures have been lower than we forecast,"" Haldane said. He said the slowdown in wage growth was likely to be a combination of lower productivity growth and weaker demand for labour due to the rise in self-employment and zero-hours contracts. Haldane said this meant Britain's recovery from the financial crisis was likely to be ""long and drawn out"" as household spending was likely to be weaker than in past recoveries. ""These headwinds to household spending growth are likely to persist for some time,"" Haldane said. Haldane said the current recovery from the financial crisis was ""solid, but not spectacular"" and there were risks to the outlook including a potential ""brittle recovery."" ""On the upside, there is the possibility of a swift and self-sustaining recovery. On the downside, the risk of a long and drawn-out expansion,"" Haldane said. Haldane said he expected interest rates to be higher in three years' time than they are today, but this was conditional on a ""smooth exit"" from unconventional monetary policy. ""Should the exit be bumpier than hoped, the path for interest rates could be shallower and the point at which interest rates rise could be later,"" Haldane said.",llama_65B,3.1136363636363638,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.25,3.526315789473684,-0.10593055517820177,0.10072626624002258,-0.01746119411286177,0.14888296367919682,0.4807256235827661,0.5159505631695179,0.4070647603027754,0.265417162275387,0.5771604938271604,0.2766859574384461,1.7857142857142856,1.009580883459262,-0.5541871921182265,-0.3334737381370987,0.0,0.0,0.5510204081632653,0.740554380497637,-0.2685451721178808,-0.27434508826851034,0.0,0.5456353186851514,0.6736694677871149,0.48443316652747803,0.5545454545454546,1.0080830391015478,0.5142857142857142,0.6652411285907363,0.7366071428571429,0.37019557564353445,-0.21144393953445237,0.19459074018810493,0.4196428571428571,1.4965313025615534,-0.2417582417582418,-0.2761446837610457,0.14943276248283832,0.033531467131984044,0.9312169312169315,0.331010958883158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1454545454545455,3.272727272727273,0.5897685117797992,0.7285274677124064,1.1634032386372262,-0.136939318554803,0.33453263528846633,0.24414640974888183

A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a 28 increase in reports of domestic abuse since the start of the coronavirus lockdown. In response to the BBC investigation and the increased demand for support, Charity Twelves Company has launched an emergency appeal to fund additional resources and help meet the rising demand for its services. The appeal will help to fund additional staff, provide outreach services to those affected by domestic abuse, as well as providing access to therapy, counselling and legal services. The charity is also calling for more public donations to help them continue their work. The charity is also working with local authorities in Devon to ensure that those who need help can access the right support. This includes raising awareness of the issue and ensuring that victims are aware of the resources available to them, such as refuge accommodation, therapeutic support and legal advice.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Government limits to teachers' pay and ""real terms cuts"" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. ""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the Observer ahead of Tuesday's National Education Union conference in London. But ministers are refusing demands for extra cash after an official report showed that schools had been underfunded since 2011 by 2bn - with funding per pupil now at its lowest level on record as inflation has outstripped growth in teaching staff numbers over this period. The former Tory prime minister David Cameron was forced into 2015 spending U-turns when he tried to cut wages for public sector workers such as nurses but failed amid opposition from Labour and unions. However, there is no appetite among Conservatives to repeat those mistakes again even though teacher strikes could lead to voters turning against them unless politicians can find some way through the impasse before December's general election. The NEU says it will seek strike ballots if disputes cannot be resolved or, where possible, begin planning industrial action while negotiations continue. On Monday, education secretary Damian Hinds told BBC Radio 4: It] would clearly not make sense ... [if we were to have another round of] strikes."" He said any new money available should go towards reducing class sizes first because smaller classes improved children's learning outcomes more than higher salaries for teachers alone. Asked whether he thought striking teachers wanted better conditions rather than higher salaries, Hinds replied: ""I think what you see at times like these is people who want their voices heard; I don't think most adults actually enjoy disrupting young people."" But union leaders say teachers deserve much more than just 1 a year rises given average starting salaries are around 30,000, according to research published last week which warned many pupils leave secondary school unable to read properly due to lack of reading skills acquired during primary years. Some 90 of all teachers describe themselves as struggling financially compared with 75 five years ago as real living costs soar faster than wage increases, according to a survey conducted by Tes magazine. General secretary Kevin Courtney tells the Observer: 'We know teachers work incredibly hard so why shouldn't our members receive fair rewards? We won't accept below-inflation pay rises without serious negotiation.'",opt_30b,2.0984848484848486,1.5,1.7384615384615385,1.75,2.0526315789473686,0.696187716104585,-0.26198910238850914,0.24140911393914094,0.07633332195570962,0.8338192419825068,0.9654965826921401,0.3885618166526493,0.7024286594860886,0.373456790123457,0.8868381029470828,0.7142857142857144,1.487179227281322,1.1600985221674875,1.24673386409892,0.0,0.0,1.183673469387755,1.3212095350897668,-0.12253011655568703,0.33919205726901247,1.4273995077932728,2.0455799533334904,0.5462184873949582,1.0417677285145304,-0.04545454545454524,0.43387636068906527,-0.34285714285714286,0.3896035110328764,-0.513392857142857,0.3191797383032802,0.18779560419178334,0.42798476160999926,0.45535714285714285,-0.11296695628335492,0.4395604395604394,1.0449397631293333,1.1581039092419971,0.9878748557268434,0.4444444444444444,0.2422820943353287,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.25753937681885636,2.963636363636364,2.1818181818181817,-0.6407448234021116,1.07804380465127,-0.11489455689970125,-0.5090766637730888,0.7660342664230154,0.5954284208031381

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Apple is planning on spending over 1 billion on video content this year for its upcoming video streaming service. They currently have 24 shows in production and development. This content will be available to Apple TV users as well as iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Mac OS X, Windows Phone 7 and Android tablets. I'm excited about the possibilities, but I don't want another Netflix clone or a Hulu clone that charges me 10month just so it can show my ads. That is why the pricing of ""On Demand"" should be tiered based upon how much you are willing to pay per month for all your services together. If they do build out their own network like Amazon does with Instant Video then we could see ""On Demand"" become even more popular than Netflix has been since day one, which would make it an attractive proposition if priced right... Also, I believe you must subscribe to a cable package (or similar) before being able to access On Demand content via iTunes. Why wouldn't apple sell the movie rights directly? The consumers are already paying good money every time they buy something from them and by doing this it keeps control away form third party companies who may not get everything done 100 correctly. You know, Google doesn't let you purchase movies through YouTube because there isn't enough revenue coming in same thing here. Only reason Youtube allows videos without some kind of purchasable option is because it makes more sense economically for google too! Not sure what you mean when you talk about keeping control away..

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Samuel Walker was fatally injured in a hit-and-run as he crossed a road in Chorlton, Manchester, in February 2003. Joyrider Nawnee Mackin, 35, was jailed for nine years in November 2004 for killing the student in the crash. Mackin had been involved in a police chase and was driving a stolen car at more than twice the speed limit when he hit Samuel. The following February Samuel's father, Michael, was charged with a section 3 offence under the Road Traffic Act, for failing to ensure that his son wore a seatbelt. This offence carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a 5,000 fine. The prosecution came about because of a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Manchester to apply to magistrates for a summons, following the death of Samuel. RoSPA was disappointed to learn that the CPS has decided not to take this prosecution any further. It is clearly not appropriate to prosecute parents for not restraining children properly in cars if there has been a fatal crash, where the child was not in control of the vehicle. On a wider level, however, RoSPA believes that there are many other cases where the CPS is failing to use the law to hold parents to account. There have been several cases where people have died in car crashes involving unrestrained children, and the parents have not been prosecuted. This is despite the fact that the Government's own statistics show that in the past five years, 80 children aged 12 and under have died in road crashes while not wearing a seat belt. RoSPA is currently calling for the CPS to make it a policy that all parents who fail to restrain their children in cars are prosecuted. We believe that this will encourage more parents to buckle up their children, and will therefore prevent more needless child deaths and injuries. We are calling on the CPS to review its policy on prosecuting parents who fail to restrain children in cars.",llama_65B,1.7348484848484849,1.5,1.9692307692307693,1.953125,1.105263157894737,-0.46622957464366466,-0.12504395911612834,-0.3770695546884213,-0.2582497381286346,0.36734693877551006,-0.2515394044521263,0.6661059714045415,-0.08883818082032122,0.6141975308641978,-0.07533805974639676,-0.5,0.17405181887295057,-0.018472906403940777,0.13583890446866878,0.0,0.0,-0.04081632653061248,-0.16888274260695568,0.0796445757611967,0.31690614124161487,0.6398687448728464,0.10890297402480231,0.0,0.2281618079204928,0.6545454545454549,0.8784983725374603,-0.19999999999999996,0.4025691046001044,0.6919642857142859,0.6039697015709617,0.35889826578874157,0.6335392524529695,1.3124999999999998,1.9587572825342296,0.17582417582417578,0.3733575031375308,1.270178481104126,0.7406382483185315,-0.12698412698412692,0.12247149908631295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8909090909090909,1.3636363636363635,0.49005889585859397,0.5618048204893591,0.33167950436739874,0.22217079222650443,0.03224031143458654,0.10079973685779009

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A researcher from the Swiss research institute EMPA has developed an invisible lock system that uses conductive ink on a transparent polymer film to create invisible buttons. The result is a secure system that is difficult to replicate and can be used on any type of door. The EMPA-developed invisible lock system works by using conductive ink to create an invisible button on the transparent polymer film. Pressure from a fingertip on the invisible button activates two switches which then trigger an electronic locking mechanism. The system is battery powered and can be installed on any type of door. It is also tamperproof, as any attempt to replicate the invisible buttons will cause the circuit to break, making it impossible to open the door. The EMPA researcher believes this technology could have many applications in the security industry, such as being used for private residences, hotels, offices, and even military installations. The system is also capable of being integrated with other forms of security, such as access control systems and biometric scanners. This could potentially make it much more difficult for criminals to gain access to restricted areas or private property. Overall, the EMPA-developed invisible lock system is an innovative and secure way to protect valuable assets. It is easy to install, tamperproof, and provides added protection for anyone who wants to ensure their privacy and security.",text-davinci-003,0.9772727272727273,1.0,0.9230769230769231,0.90625,0.47368421052631576,0.5517452175536385,0.7267285848644014,1.2385058549440453,0.7661970209044278,0.0024737167594307283,-0.5257522790201313,-0.0470984020185029,-0.3793926507033016,-0.09624017957351287,-0.4706515772800273,1.4090909090909092,0.4922887882230433,0.10815047021943579,0.39085538137239884,0.0,0.0,0.4935064935064934,0.23231484811440553,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.13423819822507266,-0.008482808977345876,-0.5909090909090909,-0.21361378770191497,0.31818181818181823,0.530598044994675,0.25454545454545463,0.3701569817326695,0.41193181818181845,0.5321214106314092,-0.38773153027071233,-0.22541172532175757,0.42613636363636354,1.0597554445983624,-0.15384615384615388,0.3437809979163087,-0.23773394031360642,-0.12246823891901161,-0.30014430014430005,0.08084535634839675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,1.2727272727272727,0.48629134832753473,0.13058572045483882,0.824604566005535,-1.0252557303062637,0.7015208664289944,0.6672608440684579

However, following a strong autumn, there was some softening towards the end of 2013 - which saw sales grow 8.2. Nick Bubb, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, told The Independent: ""The figures are encouraging and support our view that UK economic growth will gradually accelerate to 2-3 this winter as weaker demand outstrips stronger domestic supply."" He added: ""And while it is not clear how resilient household demand has been so far this year, we expect further recovery later in the coming months and into 2014."" Dominick Scruton, director general of trade association British Business Group (BBG), suggested that high street retailers had likely benefited more than other sectors from an improving economy. Rob Beale, BBG's head of retail research, also pointed to Christmas spending figures showing online shoppers were less affected by weak consumer confidence earlier this year than traditional retailers, who reported falling orders last week.",gpt_j,0.5378787878787878,0.3333333333333333,0.3384615384615385,0.40625,0.9473684210526315,0.7525424733579819,-0.2056634034434015,0.6873280930064064,0.4397090763684127,0.4936831875607382,0.4839473059613425,0.0,-0.16381344421354224,0.13271604938271625,-0.10420680780762202,1.3571428571428572,1.2463170673906045,1.3743842364532017,0.46328829332334875,0.0,0.0,0.5102040816326527,0.6709914596563469,0.4502981783421501,0.7595950067919777,0.2953240360951598,0.12411328981368012,0.1638655462184875,-0.4872308782596973,-0.24545454545454548,0.2598354199689869,-0.34285714285714286,0.7253281906922375,0.0223214285714287,-0.29699053710428985,0.7011035889826579,0.2714536398473624,-0.5089285714285714,-0.12783720563750917,-0.15384615384615388,0.1812613661278524,0.5977310499313534,0.5847304251572282,1.396825396825397,0.2722752065450611,0.14285714285714285,0.3499271061118826,0.0,0.0,1.0363636363636364,0.36363636363636365,-0.6129806235367503,0.5845315914758894,-0.40200804097940007,-0.7531705016777508,0.7621240506786937,0.7859747342610788

""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the Telegraph. The statement comes from the leaders of head teachers' union NAHT, the teachers' union NASUWT and the National Education Union (NEU). It has also been signed by the head of the Church of England education office and the chief executive of the Catholic Education Service. ""Teachers, school leaders and support staff are key to the future prosperity of this country,"" says the statement. ""A nation that invests in education is a nation that invests in its future. ""The current salary cap is damaging the economy and the public service of education in this country. It is time to end it."" It continues: ""We urge the Government to end the public sector pay cap and provide teachers with an immediate, fully funded, above-inflation pay rise."" Ministers have said the cap will be lifted for police and prison officers. The statement warns that pay restraint is making it hard to recruit teachers and is leading to staff shortages, which in turn risk affecting pupils' education. ""Teaching is a demanding profession, and teachers have lost pay relative to others in the public and private sectors in recent years,"" it says. ""We urge the Government to act now to ensure that the pay of teachers and support staff is sufficient to attract and retain talented staff and to ensure that teachers on all pay ranges have an income that reflects the increasing cost of living."" In a joint statement to the Telegraph, the union leaders say: ""We believe that the best way to ensure that pupils get the education that they deserve is to have a system where there are enough teachers, where they are well-motivated, well-qualified, and well-rewarded. ""The pay cap has severely damaged teacher pay and morale in recent years and the current pay cap is threatening the education of our children and young people by jeopardising the future supply of teachers. ""Teachers, school leaders and support staff are key to the future prosperity of this country. ""A nation that invests in education is a nation that invests in its future. ""The current salary cap is damaging the economy and the public service of education in this country. ""It is time to end it. ""We urge the Government to end the public sector pay cap and provide teachers with an immediate, fully funded, above-inflation pay rise. ""We urge the Government to act now to ensure that the pay of teachers and support staff is sufficient to attract and retain talented staff and to ensure that teachers on all pay ranges have an income that reflects the increasing cost of living."" The joint statement is signed by Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, the Rev Nigel Genders, chief education officer of the Church of England, and Mike Kane, MP, and former head teacher, who is now shadow education secretary. Ministers are considering whether to lift the cap for teachers. But schools are facing budget cuts, with the National Audit Office warning that funding per pupil has fallen by 6.5 per cent in real terms between 2010-11 and 2016-17. The school leaders' statement warns: ""The funding of schools is a serious problem. ""School leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to balance their budgets and this is having an impact on the education they are able to provide. ""There have been cuts to school budgets in real terms for the last few years, and more are to come, particularly in the area of high needs. ""As a result, schools are cutting staff and increasing class sizes to make ends meet. ""These cuts threaten the education of our children and young people and are not in the best interests of the future of our country. ""Funding must be increased to ensure that schools can provide the best possible education for every child and to help attract and retain teachers."" The statement was also signed by Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, and Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. Last year, more than 40,000 teachers left the profession in England, figures showed. The unions have argued that if teachers' pay had kept pace with inflation since 2010, the average teacher would have lost 5,000",llama_65B,4.916666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.553846153846154,4.625,5.7368421052631575,-0.1889783427262397,-0.20709487073736432,0.019799857430071555,0.11596957151985153,0.25809111523397205,1.0184656377298107,0.10989627137650677,0.7993951506363044,0.12373737373737402,0.8745800496787961,0.3181818181818181,0.9046032020283973,-0.3918495297805642,0.013552055314640814,0.0,0.0,0.6753246753246751,0.45299201357743096,-0.1643945730455468,1.7813236467550386,0.11335670072339471,1.461765825696712,-0.12745098039215677,0.16784461290880404,0.06363636363636359,0.2919574634500122,0.9818181818181817,1.2699568662625977,0.7244318181818181,0.9433640291193558,-0.20625901039515057,0.4477351318987263,0.3806818181818181,1.5003061589730362,-0.06993006993007006,0.32468599948665083,0.2377339403136065,0.8646082154873521,0.8581048581048584,1.3391533127956636,0.06060606060606061,0.3428396514843867,0.0,0.0,1.0363636363636364,3.1818181818181817,0.8856554211212089,0.8950395380968778,0.8227104145480648,-0.0760485202856433,0.18118906586571196,0.10842741848742334

This quarter Coinbase proactively reached out to all Canadian merchants affected by crypto volatility asking if they would accept it - many did not know what accepting bitcoin meant previously because they had never traded it themselves. They're thrilled to see real world use cases come from merchant adoption instead of just speculation and hope others follow suit soon. Learn more here.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mr Trump called off a rally on Friday night in Chicago after clashes between protesters and supporters. The Republican who has won a string of primary contests has blamed the supporters of Democrat Bernie Sanders and denied responsibility for the violence. On Sunday, he said his campaign is ""not provoking"" and ""wants peace."" He said no one gets hurt at his ""love-fest"" rallies. A Quinnipiac University poll shows that Mr Trump is leading the way in Florida and tied with Ohio Governor John Kasich in Ohio ahead of crucial state primaries on Tuesday. Here's what people are saying about Mr Trump and the violence at his rallies: What Trump says about protesters at his rallies Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders: Called Mr Trump a ""pathological liar"" after he said he had sent protesters to disrupt his rallies. Florida Senator Marco Rubio: Said it is ""harder every day to justify"" backing Mr Trump should he win the Republican nomination and said conservatism is not about ""how angry can you get, how offensive you can be, how loud you can speak."" Ohio Governor John Kasich: Asked his staff to make a list of Mr Trump's quotes promoting violence at his rallies and that Mr Trump's ""toxic"" tone makes it even more important for him to win his home state in the primary election on Tuesday. Senator Ted Cruz: Said that the culture of violence is Mr Trump's fault, telling reporters that ""any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign."" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio: Tweeted that there is no question Mr Trump a racist. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton: Said Mr Trump's campaign consists of ""hate"" and ""fear."" President Barack Obama: Said over the weekend: ""Our leaders - those who aspire to be our leaders - should be trying to bring us together and not turning us against one another and speak out against violence and reject efforts to spread fear or turn us against one another. And if they refuse to do that, they don't deserve our support."" House Speaker Paul Ryan: Said the violence at Mr Trump's rallies is ""very concerning"" and that candidates must take ""responsibility for the environment"" at their events Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Republican candidate: Told NBC's Today programme that the violence could get worse, placing blame on the protesters, saying ""I think certainly if the protesters continue with their.... tactics, there is a real possibility of escalation."" Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee: Defended Mr Trump, condemning the Chicago protesters. ""I think it's ridiculous to blame Trump for a bunch of thugs out on the street,"" he told the Huffington Post. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter:Tweeted that ""left-wing fascists violently shut down a peaceful Trump rally last night Cruz the entire media took the animals' side""",human,2.742424242424242,2.1666666666666665,2.523076923076923,2.5625,4.0,-0.11947303315602698,0.12272386059875041,0.03076782824714489,0.4100726705190922,0.6621315192743763,1.0428536897538172,0.4605177086253623,1.259121617942728,0.46810699588477356,1.31449330820395,-0.05555555555555558,0.6962234344776168,-0.14942528735632174,-0.07491822150773995,0.0,0.0,0.119047619047619,0.46380268514358386,1.2889487538788529,1.1236119994948854,0.6179928903472791,1.0822545161827464,-0.08496732026143795,0.4317596784296178,0.09898989898989902,1.362600927772817,0.3555555555555556,1.3216869073674549,0.15625000000000008,0.43113694041197376,-0.3635351942873041,-0.0444174279861356,0.7291666666666666,1.8460496661242907,1.0256410256410253,1.703709955790882,0.7845220030349013,0.6088738763330814,1.6437389770723105,1.0284722225163256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6,3.0,0.2142247397220085,0.7691460319332317,0.7328662035248147,-0.25466420565188913,0.5060208605649583,0.6810711701266444
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"When you want to edit something using an online tool today, you usually have to upload the file to the tool by selecting the file or dragging it into your browser. At some point, the tool will ask you to save the file and download it to your computer. Google Docs is probably the only service today that lets you edit files without having to upload and download them. The Web service stores your files on its servers and makes them available to you whenever you need them. So, for example, when you create a new document in Google Docs, it is saved to your Google Docs account right away and made available for editing online immediately. This works well for documents but not for other types of files such as videos, music or executable files. The reason for this is that those files are more complex than simple text documents. They require different storage and management options, and the services that you use to edit them are usually different from Google Docs as well. Goo.gl is Google's URL shortening service. Its main purpose is to make long URLs shorter, for instance to share those on Twitter where only 140 characters are available per message. I personally use it sometimes to share links in chat programs, as it is easier to remember a shortened URL than a longer one. When you click on the link that is created you are taken directly to the website that it is linking to. You can furthermore add a plus symbol followed by a keyword to the end of the link to track click-throughs. The service has been around for a while but has not received any major updates in the past. Google just launched a new service that is called Google Play Music All Access. It is a music streaming service that is similar to Spotify, Rdio or Pandora but with some distinct differences. The service is currently only available in the United States but will be rolled out to other regions in the future. What makes it different from other services is that it is directly integrated into Google Music. That means that all the music that you have uploaded to your Google Music account will be available in All Access as well, and you can switch between your uploaded music and the All Access music library at any time. Google's Safe Browsing is a technology that the company introduced in 2007 to protect Internet users against phishing attempts, and more recently malware as well. Whenever you access a website that has been flagged as malicious or phishing by Google, you receive a notification that you should stay away from that website. To test this, I have just visited a malware infested website, the Google Chrome browser warned me that it was potentially dangerous and that I should stay away from it. It also listed three safe alternatives that I could check out instead. Google announced that it will be rolling out several new features in the next days that make searching the Web easier. The company is introducing Knowledge Graph enhancements, additional search features, and new privacy controls. As part of the update, the company will be rolling out new privacy controls that enable you to edit or remove your Web History and take-out your search data. Google Earth is a great service. You can use it to explore the planet, travel to distant locations, study maps, and even find your own home on the service. It is however quite limited as well. It does not offer features such as time traveling or a closer look at planets and the moon. You need to use another service for that. Google Street View is a Google Maps feature that enables you to take a closer look at individual streets and buildings. The feature is only available in a limited set of countries and cities. It is also not available in all areas of those cities. Luckily, there are alternative services out there that let you have a look at areas of the world that Google does not have data for. If you have been following Internet related news recently, you may have heard that the US National Security Agency is monitoring emails and phone calls of citizens and foreigners alike. While that is not really a surprise considering that a similar program has been active in the UK for some time now, it is still something that many Internet users are not too happy with. The big question here is, is there a way to prevent that monitoring from happening? The answer is no, as long as you are using a phone, the Internet or other electronic communication methods that are accessible to government agencies. Google's web service that lets you access and play your music collection from anywhere is a great thing for users who are using the service. The only problem that I have with Google Music is that it is currently only available to users from the United States. There is however a workaround that you can make use of to access your music library from anywhere.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Tandridge District Council leader Martin Fisher gave planners a shortlist of five areas for such a scheme. He said one new Surrey village is better than ""scatter-gunning"" homes and cramping existing communities. Cllr Fisher, who is leading a review of the green belt, said: ""We need to consider whether it is feasible to develop one large sustainable new settlement in one location in Tandridge, rather than to continue to scatter housing growth across a number of small villages. ""This would provide opportunities to offer the new residents the facilities they need, such as schools, healthcare and employment, and would avoid the risk of damaging the character of smaller villages. ""If we continue to look at the green belt in this way, there may be potential to develop a new settlement of around 1,500 homes within the existing boundaries of Oxted."" He added: ""We're not proposing it would be within Oxted's town centre, but we're looking at a number of different sites around Oxted. ""It would be in one large site, rather than scattered across a number of sites."" Mr Fisher, a Conservative, said a new settlement would offer people a ""proper village"" with all the necessary services, rather than the current trend of building smaller developments of 100 homes, for example, which he described as ""scatter-gunning."" The former leader of Tandridge District Council, David Hodge, who is also Surrey's county council leader, has raised concerns about the review and described Mr Fisher's comments as ""disappointing."" Cllr Hodge, who is a Conservative, said: ""I am disappointed that Martin Fisher has suggested that he may be considering the use of green belt land to build 1,500 homes in Oxted. ""The green belt is one of our most important planning tools. It is vital we protect it from development and ensure that it is used for agriculture, forestry or recreation. ""I would prefer to see us focus on the use of brown field sites before we consider taking any green belt land out of the planning system."" Cllr Fisher is investigating five possible locations for a new settlement, which are: In and around Oxted; Around Redhill; Around Horley; Around Edenbridge; Around Lingfield. The review will look at building new homes and community facilities, such as schools and health centres. Cllr Fisher said: ""This is a long-term project. I'm not sure we will find one location suitable to take all the housing we need to take. ""We could have one or two new settlements, but I think the likelihood is that there will be a number of smaller sites."" The councillor said building on green belt land was ""a last resort,"" but added: ""We need to review the green belt and see if there is potential to use some of it for housing."" The review, which has been criticised by some residents, will look at Tandridge's ""housing supply and infrastructure,"" including transport, water and sewage. Cllr Fisher said: ""We're not pre-empting the outcome of the review. We're not saying we're going to build on the green belt. ""We want to do this review and consider the options. We have to plan for the future, not just for tomorrow."" A public consultation on the review will take place in September and October.",llama_65B,3.3181818181818183,3.3333333333333335,3.6307692307692307,3.625,5.157894736842105,-0.3626393604155945,0.25053304425723877,-0.2848025737375177,-0.13015995109274883,0.09795918367346922,0.5786977167974596,0.35229604709840184,0.4301153176650906,0.32234567901234584,0.4821438319663092,0.3799999999999999,0.5863567150977224,-0.622758620689655,-0.3769858616956117,0.0,0.0,-0.028571428571428848,0.34091835777289903,-0.15353023604427593,0.47009863327101026,0.16931911402789157,0.7097251473616862,0.07647058823529419,0.6713047490629258,0.5625454545454547,0.6278841194030547,0.24,1.033834025935329,0.15625000000000008,0.48782176719629944,0.12619864601687847,0.148492424049175,0.5624999999999999,1.5777466114905017,0.5846153846153845,0.3756174571392196,-0.02092058674759733,0.10591169674163957,1.3612698412698414,1.326494292613255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.090909090909091,0.7076300428926643,0.7155486669523149,0.40085307852518887,0.2549590040157495,-0.12536434280114406,-0.10482650572877679

Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 to 0.25, in the process cutting its base rate to its lowest ever level. The MPC has also re-started the quantitative easing programme, this time buying 60bn of government bonds as well as 10bn of corporate bonds. On top of this it has introduced a Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to encourage banks and building societies to pass on the base rate cut to their customers. The Bank of England will purchase 10bn of corporate bonds over an 18 month period, to help support the UK economy during the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. We are confident that the Bank of England, in co-ordination with other central banks, will continue to take whatever action is deemed necessary to support the UK economy during this period of uncertainty.",llama_65B,0.4015151515151515,0.16666666666666666,0.4,0.375,0.3684210526315789,-0.42745064416632517,0.019488654964863048,0.1202559561555087,0.3526409603555791,0.639455782312925,-0.36090823728867477,0.6044294925707879,-0.2218730279074593,0.49691358024691384,-0.3199060305356878,0.8333333333333335,0.6378903022434862,0.017241379310344803,0.8196167235265185,0.0,0.0,0.714285714285714,-0.5325136429923745,0.3716746868855843,-0.19200055918179118,0.4265791632485644,0.14606195720780277,1.0196078431372553,-0.28691533766644944,-0.21212121212121196,0.1106270391458506,-0.8666666666666667,-0.4042800383684944,1.25,0.07532992820918757,0.1022442733933043,0.27976250141107195,0.5624999999999999,0.8386186997241288,0.1538461538461537,0.39262422952976134,-0.2615073343449671,-0.14106727203565178,0.3597883597883601,-0.10868364624057165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727272727272726,1.0,0.3025816013414688,-0.10236901757521617,1.1125155875410107,-0.3227284874009202,0.5411506897459076,0.8236757704175692

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Nvidia has used a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create a neural network that can generate an unlimited number of high-quality, realistic faces. A GAN works by having one network generate images based on a training set of images and then a second network criticizes those generated images. This process iterates with the first network getting better and better at generating images that the second network has a hard time telling from the real thing. The results of the process are impressive. You can see many of the faces generated by the GAN at This Person Does Not Exist. The team behind the project even held a ""hallucinating faces"" competition on Kaggle to see who could best predict which images were fake and which were real. The winning algorithm managed to correctly identify images only 53 of the time. This entry was posted in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Network, Nvidia.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A Belgian research group discovered a major security flaw in the keyless entry system of the Tesla Model X. The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer to get inside the vehicle. The bug is related to how some vehicles use ultrasonic sensors on the windshield wipers and doors to see if someone's trying to open them, but not all cars make that kind of sensor available. By modifying an Arduino board connected to the car's central processing unit (CPU), researchers were able to detect when the CPU was sending out signals at certain frequencies. They then send these same codes back through the speakers once they take over control of the system and can start using it as their own remote entry code instead of letting the driver enter his personal PIN or password. ""We have written the first working proof-of-concept for this vulnerability,"" said Trevin Chowdhry, one of three hackers who attacked the car together with two more members named Kenny Bui and Huy Nguyen Vu. ""With this new approach we could bypass any biometric protection mechanism."" The team says that multiple automakers are vulnerable to such attacks, although none has responded publicly yet. And while most consumers don't realize there's been a major hack going on inside their very expensive luxury sedan right now, the hackers say they plan to release details about just what they found soon after putting things into place.",gpt_j,1.0606060606060606,0.6666666666666666,1.1692307692307693,1.140625,0.6842105263157895,-0.18049144923142227,-0.4463142132996612,-0.10614900745265175,-0.08079938296217343,0.7981859410430838,0.7882863423353174,0.9786001308288946,1.2535034145090302,0.8858024691358026,1.043128140815952,0.9444444444444446,0.08545771386500124,0.8505747126436782,1.8417592603354387,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666665,0.06822137977587837,-0.17868975331037695,0.41666658283061536,0.8859721082854797,1.220173735878532,0.3823529411764707,0.16784461290880429,-0.13434343434343413,-0.07035534786430657,0.1333333333333333,1.004957871478073,1.1979166666666667,0.2812334792560441,-0.0973754984698136,0.46966991411008935,0.3958333333333332,1.5896669614128085,0.46153846153846145,1.218780814292897,0.697352891586579,0.449050209369709,0.01410934744268112,0.8604428375080452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6727272727272726,0.7272727272727273,-0.513351272767175,0.8988927194295412,-0.40254431616518094,-0.19295009670008179,0.5321324467140296,0.42025535587320056

The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act, which is being considered by the US Senate, would require companies with over 100 million monthly active users to inform users about the data collected from them and how it is being monetized. This would help to increase transparency and give customers more control over their personal information. If the act is passed, companies would need to provide an annual report to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) outlining how much money they make from customer data, as well as providing individual user data upon request.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think? No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it is reported. However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour. The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30 of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations. On 7 June Eugene convinced 33 of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human. Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal. Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013. Eugene was created by Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, who now lives in Russia. Transcripts of the conversations are currently unavailable, but may appear in a future academic paper. The judges and hidden human control groups were kept apart throughout the test. The event was organised by Reading University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies. Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science. The event has been labelled as ""historic"" by the organisers, who claim no computer has passed the test before. ""Some will claim that the Test has already been passed,"" said Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the University of Reading and deputy vice-chancellor for research at Coventry University. ""The words Turing test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However, this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted. ""A true Turing test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time on Saturday."" Prof Noel Sharkey, a leading expert in robotic technology and artificial intelligence, said: ""It is indeed a great achievement for Eugene. It was very clever ruse to pretend to be a 13-year-old Ukranian boy, which would constrain the conversation. But these competitions are really great to push developments."" But others have criticised the claim. ""It's nonsense,"" Prof Stevan Harnad told the Guardian newspaper. ""We have not passed the Turing test. We are not even close."" Hugh Loebner, creator of another Turing Test competition, has also criticised the University of Reading's experiment for only lasting five minutes. ""That's scarcely very penetrating,"" he told the Huffington Post, noting that Eugene had previously been ranked behind seven other systems in his own 25-minute long Loebner Prize test.",human,2.992424242424242,3.8333333333333335,2.8461538461538463,2.828125,4.473684210526316,0.6596483893596086,0.7793670266639667,0.8439708524035154,0.9687531286116996,-0.42468415937803716,0.23510209777225288,-0.43481917577796475,-0.053309329171120745,-0.4598765432098765,-0.04174512775861027,-0.25,0.1994233881544873,0.4100985221674877,1.0261797300781008,0.0,0.0,-0.3622448979591837,0.20112575920233902,0.1975798129460455,0.8793045004195568,-0.4183757178014766,0.018352918492551475,-0.5189075630252102,0.3140370427138318,0.40454545454545476,0.048890358895230766,-0.12857142857142856,0.20899760567844036,0.12276785714285712,0.30165643713715934,-0.06885838820365386,0.28212085454418395,-0.18749999999999997,0.48061490286884895,-0.4505494505494505,-0.1329563762791351,-0.13075366717248352,0.05350503455440115,0.6666666666666666,0.48145366983531845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3454545454545452,2.4545454545454546,0.019920585689686042,1.0290785279970869,0.13016128791051035,-0.5045447178034133,0.13132346638682763,0.16096478029960032

But a new study shows that if scientists really want to maintain this restriction, they could keep them alive for up to a year. The study was published in the journal Science, and it is the longest time that any human embryo has survived in a lab, beating the previous record of 15 days that was set in 2009. The new limit is based on the assumption that keeping the embryos alive longer would pose a greater risk of genetic damage. Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised. Now scientists aren't following the rules to the letter, but they are doing so to keep the embryos safe from harm. But the new rule could still have serious consequences for the research that scientists conduct.

It describes Amazon's design process and how Jeff Bezos' decisions affects its products, employees, competitors, shareholders and customers. In 1963, in his first year at Harvard Business School, Paul Krassner wrote a satirical essay about an evil corporation called Kable Corporation with headquarters on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The characters who worked for this firm were all called ""Kables,"" each using a number to identify himself or herself within the organization. They wore name tags saying: ""I am 1-11."" The product was their minds. The business model? To take over America by marketing mind packages to consumers at lower prices than they could buy them themselves with their own neurons. Fast forward four decades and you'll find yourself meeting most people through email; if you've ever met one face-to-face, chances are heshe works for Amazon. And while there's still only room for one No. 11, the Seattle tech giant has apparently been busy filling out office rosters for everyone else: from Don Davis (No. 6) and Mark Lucovsky (No. 10), both former Sun Microsystems executives now charged with running Kindle sales, to CTO Werner Vogels (No. 9) and CEO Jeff Bezos (No. 8). Indeed, when I asked my wife what she thought her husband did for work these days, she replied without hesitation: ""He runs Amazon."" The success of such a small elite is proof positive of our growing reliance on technology to make our lives easier - from online banking and shopping to reading news stories and watching movies. But just how much does this new breed of uber worker really control us technologically? Perhaps more importantly, can we trust the information that comes across those screens every day? That's where California State University professor Daniel Solove begins his new book, Our Hidden Data Breaks: How Google Became King of Information and Why You Should Care - Your Privacy Is At Risk. He argues convincingly that when data becomes centralized and unaccounted for, privacy rights become at risk... even when companies aren't explicitly targeting individuals personally. Until then, however, here's a summary of three things you probably didn't know about your favorite tech titan. 1. A pioneer of ecommerce With no official birth date available, founder and chief executive officer Jeffrey P. Bezos seems like some sort of mysterious cyborg god figure presiding over the cloud computing platform known simply as AWS By 1970, Rodger Dean had bought books.com, which became the leading site selling used volumes. One of the legs in its early growth strategy was to sell copies of textbooks to students via mail order, at discounted rates - part of the reason why textbook publishing was so valued during that time period. Today, the site continues to offer titles directly to readers, but offers similar pricing discounts through third party sellers whose relationships with publishers may be viewed skeptically due to concerns regarding price competition. In 1980, operating under the handle jimboebluebeef, Bezos launched Zippyshare, a service offering free file sharing among users. The idea was straight out of PayPal inventor Peter Thiel's playbook, tapping into a gap between peer-based content distribution models prevalent today at sites like YouTube (which launched two years earlier) and Spotify (2010 launch). As an added bonus, eBay cofounder Pierre Omidyar helped fund the venture. While 2000 soldiered along mostly unaffected by the dot com bust, 2001 saw gross revenue drop 20 percent after investors lost interest in Internet stocks amid fears AOL Time Warner would soon gobble up Yahoo Search Marketing began to grow exponentially in 2002 thanks to widespread adoption in search traffic driven by Google's IPO later that year. Between 2003 and 2007, Recyclebank owner doubleClick ads accounted for 23 percent of Doubleclick board member John Doerr's personal wealth According to Forbes magazine, owner Frank Colla wasn't thrilled, but said yes anyway. Now the company boasts 500 million registered members, 90 billion pages viewed annually, and 100 million total monthly active advertisers - including Microsoft, IBM, Samsung, Ford, General Motors, Delta Air Lines, ATT, Motorola Mobility and Coca Cola. AutoNation Plus isn't exactly a household brand name, yet last November the retailer won the contract to run auto dealership inventory management system Opesia Systems Inc. After starting off operationally testing the software with 600 dealerships around North America, it aims to expand with roughly 40 stores open by summer 2013. 3. An innovator of personalized recommendations Almost since inception, Amazon started down roads others have followed ad infinitum.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Under anti-tax avoidance rules, if someone's tax arrangements are found to be ""abusive"" they must pay back the tax they have avoided. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged a ""genuine deterrent"" by making them liable to pay the same amount again. A Tory spokesman said it was ""feeble stuff"" and Labour had no economic plan. Tax avoidance, unlike tax evasion, is not illegal. Ministers have said it involves ""compliance with the letter but not the spirit of the law."" In recent years it emerged that companies and individuals had been greatly reducing their liabilities by making use of legal tax shelter schemes. Meanwhile the ""tax gap"" - the difference between the amount of tax owed and collected - rose to PS34bn in the year to April 2013. The government's so-called general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) came into force in July 2013, after Chancellor George Osborne described aggressive tax avoidance - as well as illegal tax evasion - as ""morally repugnant."" It aimed to ""deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements, and to deter would-be promoters from promoting such arrangements."" The rule is a broad set of principles designed to prevent tax avoidance, to avoid having constantly to introduce new legislation to tackle individual loopholes. Labour has previously said it would increase transparency in the tax system and prevent dormant companies from trading without paying tax. It has pledged to use some of the money raised from a tax avoidance crackdown for its PS2.5bn NHS funding pledge. Mr Balls said Labour had supported the introduction of the anti-abuse rule, but said it was ""without teeth."" He said: ""Those who are caught have to repay the tax they tried to avoid, but they do not face a penalty. There is still no disincentive to try and game the system. That is why Labour will bring in a tough penalty regime.... with fines of up to 100 of the value of the tax which was avoided. ""For the first time this will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax."" The shadow chancellor said aggressive tax avoiders should be treated the same as people who cheat the welfare system. He added: ""Through measures such as this we can ensure that no-one pays zero tax at the top so we can get the deficit down fairly, invest in our NHS, and maintain public support for the dynamic open economy we need."" The proposals were backed by leading chartered accountant and tax-reform campaigner Richard Murphy, who was a member of the panel which helped draw up the anti-abuse rules. ""Without such a regime, the GAAR is a toothless tiger providing, at best, Revenue and Customs with the chance to ask those found in default to play by the rules in future,"" Mr Murphy, who is an adviser to the Trades Union Congress and the Unite union - Labour's largest financial backer - said. ""With significant penalties attached, the GAAR becomes a more potent threat and, regrettably, in the face of ongoing tax abuse, Revenue and Customs needs as many of those as it can get."" However, a Conservative spokesman said Labour leader Ed Miliband had been at the heart of former prime minister Gordon Brown's Treasury as ""year after year"" they broke promises to deal with tax avoidance. ""If Ed thinks empty promises like this will get him into Downing Street, it's no wonder his own party are lining up to criticise his weak and ineffective leadership,"" the spokesman added.",human,3.6742424242424243,3.1666666666666665,3.6615384615384614,3.734375,4.7368421052631575,-0.41029987297238923,-0.11317071857035968,-0.45136667011453335,-0.3140430282663229,0.48639455782312907,0.5443158371835668,0.49649565461171835,0.6261971079014772,0.5185185185185185,0.5177426741384987,0.875,0.9768796760847176,0.017241379310344803,0.6818018849617984,0.0,0.0,0.375,0.05747512974687703,-0.15903388044623556,0.5016692331777258,0.6562756357670219,0.4036582737606594,0.19117647058823534,0.5579787421260134,0.3712121212121212,0.33709381582440234,0.3833333333333333,0.4577165308333252,0.5078125000000001,1.2378654754985736,-0.29699527033293144,-0.13504537836886316,0.625,1.5857144465854416,0.6923076923076922,0.8171838194516595,0.0653768335862418,0.2312967226322699,1.2116402116402116,1.3707771305736192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2363636363636363,2.6363636363636362,0.21733079118376786,1.041711565199078,0.1645535388786243,0.23673348777854933,0.08203647651620286,0.11194022577346546

The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just over 10,000 today. ""We don't want this move,"" chief executive Chris Clements told BBC News Online in a phone interview on Thursday morning, explaining that he thought there were other ways to deal with the problem before resorting to culls as a solution. ""There are alternatives we can look at instead of having those drastic measures taken such as putting down and breeding out our ponies."" Culling Dartmoor's 600-odd pony population will be costly for taxpayers because the animals would need to be kept either privately or by someone who has volunteered to take them under their wing. DHPA estimates the cost is anything up to 3 million per year - money which could better be spent elsewhere. If no volunteers step forward then culling will become necessary. It may also prompt more people to abandon their own ponies, leaving the hill behind, Mr Lister says.",gpt_j,0.5454545454545454,0.5,0.676923076923077,0.65625,0.631578947368421,-0.12080859356260214,-0.284826465624068,-0.1921200438222927,-0.04879450200976147,0.09523809523809512,0.5280599863508778,0.3885618166526493,0.7001323709265398,0.3132716049382717,0.6028487737009192,-0.25,0.1166357061617793,1.4547413793103448,0.09725300779910925,0.0,0.0,-0.4464285714285715,0.27917744744241585,-0.08041038898966964,0.3792481371518047,0.7998359310910581,0.6727504186098356,0.09558823529411767,1.0817808948540757,0.6045454545454547,0.9106050854209612,-0.7,-0.21270186339812386,-0.19531249999999994,0.14502158905553578,0.25195910229064267,0.37860988737565104,0.37499999999999994,1.4659921272629128,0.6538461538461537,0.5306704648363411,0.0653768335862418,0.018172924107269613,0.28571428571428586,0.34341844075402445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6363636363636364,-0.54901196010624,0.5765371355665185,-0.09927865175414519,0.17577430777986092,-0.07262083738970278,-0.08299174345158977

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Barcelona said it paid EUR57m (PS43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to EUR83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received EUR40m and his former club, Santos, was paid EUR17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40 of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received EUR6.8m of Santos's EUR17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: ""They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice."" The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated EUR13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus. But the 23-year-old has also encountered legal difficulties in Brazil, where a court has frozen 47m (PS33m) of his assets in connection with suspected tax evasion between 2011 and 2013.",human,1.5681818181818181,1.8333333333333333,1.4615384615384615,1.546875,1.894736842105263,-0.5054826183534296,-0.005347155737436462,-0.4062956863645855,-0.3233452415407462,-0.21938775510204087,0.29756153593387047,-0.2752312867956266,-0.03248405995804913,-0.20524691358024674,0.17873573419630345,-0.5,-0.2722447040658002,-0.3265086206896551,-0.25529840771980367,0.0,0.0,-0.20535714285714296,-0.10996861561829224,0.8335876991929088,1.8302511164887671,-0.0615258408531584,0.2356641307666667,0.09558823529411767,-0.3018605025461405,-0.6204545454545455,-0.21549891213021075,0.42500000000000004,0.9769566104841299,-0.01953124999999993,0.08532238294343472,0.1771016878419735,0.820125566380833,-0.28124999999999994,0.28927927077347954,0.13461538461538453,0.5759146427389955,-0.32688416793120884,-0.20102130479565686,0.17460317460317476,0.7689493321835459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,0.6363636363636364,0.20055193405047128,0.6861060950552773,-0.39685585115772437,0.4930762792502203,-0.4473458060073444,-0.5386572397179766

He first noticed the issue on April 26 and reported it to the company, which then took action to fix the problem. The company reportedly failed to encrypt customer data such as credit card numbers, names and addresses. This means that anyone who had access to the server could have obtained the personal information of millions of customers. The retailer has since taken steps to protect customer data by implementing robust security protocols and encryption measures. It is also working with third-party cyber security firms to investigate the issue and enhance its defenses against future attacks. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining secure systems, particularly those dealing with sensitive customer information. Companies should ensure their systems are regularly updated and monitored for any potential vulnerabilities.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Metrobus admits public subsidies might be necessary to make the service financially viable, but no agreement has been reached yet on who will contribute to the funding. As a helpful assistant, I suggest exploring these potential steps to move the negotiations forward: 1. Understand the concerns of the bus companies: It's important to know why the bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Talk to them to understand their concerns about the financial viability and profitability of the Metrobus network. 2. Review financial projections: Work with Metrobus to review the financial projections for the bus network. This will help to identify potential issues and areas where subsidies might be required to make the service viable. 3. Identify potential sources of funding: Explore potential sources of funding, such as government grants or private investment, to support the operation of the Metrobus network. Identify which parties could potentially provide funding and how much they would be willing to contribute. 4. Negotiate a subsidy agreement: Once potential sources of funding are identified, work with the bus companies to negotiate a subsidy agreement that is acceptable to all parties. This agreement should outline the terms of the subsidy, including the amount of funding and how it will be used. 5. Monitor the service: Continuously monitor the Metrobus network to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently. Make adjustments as necessary to ensure that the service is financially viable and meeting the needs of commuters. By following these steps, you can help to move the negotiations for the Metrobus network forward and ensure that the service is financially viable and sustainable for the long term.",gpt-3.5-trubo,1.4924242424242424,1.3333333333333333,1.5076923076923077,1.4375,0.9473684210526315,0.8791551619602453,1.096800330941255,0.9619867107844853,0.9537839594731657,0.2783882783882783,0.0872129557005622,0.3188199521252505,0.08049473100565464,0.20109211775878438,-0.08434729204368559,0.6538461538461537,0.45496771567922495,0.4018567639257295,0.6282463584002415,0.0,0.0,0.24175824175824165,0.34341259891746245,-0.6383347802872238,-0.5387202806232742,0.5679308386445382,-0.3650176431546202,-0.3823529411764707,-0.10098465380939445,0.8468531468531472,0.9869081772637511,0.3384615384615386,0.24017513600864104,1.09375,1.3035169490892324,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.7932692307692305,0.4285012341332913,-0.22485207100591714,-0.35690281200288393,0.5632465662814676,-0.014097306382169243,-0.38095238095238076,-0.14100049322523742,0.0,0.0,0.7692307692307693,0.9730085108210399,0.14545454545454545,1.7272727272727273,0.9188693367269032,0.13836891109346003,1.2807162369643676,-0.901093014389617,0.7551521379468575,1.0067464631968834

As an AI language model, I do not have political affiliations or opinions. However, it is important to note that social media platforms typically argue that their content moderation practices are protected under Section 230, which shields them from being held liable for what their users post on their platforms.

The Conservative-run authority will not reveal details of his case. Suarez had been suspended for 10 days without pay since July 9, in relation to an investigation into allegations made by councillors that he tried to influence their votes at a cabinet meeting last month. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman confirmed it is investigating allegations regarding Mr Suarez and added: ""We can confirm we are aware of incidents involving him during this time but cannot comment further as investigations are ongoing."" Mr Suarez has already apologised personally for any offence caused when he appeared before the disciplinary panel. He insisted there would be no similar breaches again under his leadership. The council leader, Councillor Mohammed Asghar (Con), told BBC Radio Manchester political correspondent Stephen Iddall: ""I'm extremely disappointed with what's happened today - you're talking about someone who's very well respected across all parties within our community... It's something which shouldn't happen in such circumstances where somebody should expect to keep hold of these positions. But sometimes those people make mistakes and they have to learn from them and grow from them.""",gpt_j,0.7727272727272727,0.6666666666666666,0.9538461538461539,0.890625,0.9473684210526315,0.9762286584203195,1.0961461964460824,0.8712474137310475,0.920501338209302,0.22373393801965194,0.5455918389172254,0.5756471357817025,0.4962669176712994,0.4248971193415638,0.26717260913965724,-0.05555555555555558,-0.057438729246726626,0.35057471264367807,0.6225512739862592,0.0,0.0,-0.19047619047619055,0.3427471484777843,0.2406355344579743,0.9222629844385838,0.2734481815695925,0.5528486273859919,0.12745098039215677,0.4611098560660926,1.1101010101010105,1.1234375700027208,-0.0888888888888888,1.796370768795389,-0.15624999999999986,-0.5614152474447592,-0.23045534637855883,0.13633658077675598,0.06249999999999994,0.4416154603555483,1.4871794871794868,0.988797120859784,0.17433822289664472,0.03643540863731866,0.21164021164021168,1.0341041734835479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.290909090909091,0.9090909090909091,-0.6028132658713491,0.6162269765437919,-0.08389935123200652,-0.7995780621574378,0.6583543211178055,0.7332123481877038

And as with any relationship that's started virtually or over text, you might not know what your partner really looks like until they show up on Zoom - which could lead you to wonder whether their profile picture actually reflects who they are IRL.

The findings were surprising enough to get coverage from outlets including Fox News and People magazine; but even though this phenomenon may be serious business, some experts don't think there should be such high stakes involved during quarantine.

The benefits of using Docker-OSX to scale macOS include: 1. Faster scaling: You can create multiple instances of macOS much faster using Docker-OSX than manually setting up each instance. 2. Consistency: Each instance of macOS created using Docker-OSX is identical, which makes troubleshooting and testing much easier. 3. Isolation: You can isolate your macOS instances from each other and from the host machine, which adds an extra layer of security and prevents any conflicts. 4. Customization: Docker-OSX allows you to customize the macOS environment for each instance, which can help you meet specific needs or requirements. 5.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must be made safer, particularly for children and young people. Pollock and her team argue that rugby has the highest risk of concussion of all contact sports, and that the long-term effects of head injuries are not fully understood. In addition, they are concerned about the risks of spinal and other injuries. To make rugby safer, Pollock and her colleagues propose a number of measures. They suggest that tackle height should be lowered, that scrums should be replaced with uncontested ""quick ball"" scenarios, and that head guards should be mandatory. They also suggest that children below the age of 18 should not play the game, and that players should be regularly screened for head injuries. While the proposals have been met with some opposition, most notably from the Rugby Football Union, Pollock and her colleagues say that they are intended to start a conversation about how to make rugby safer for everyone who plays the game.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.6439393939393939,0.5,0.7692307692307693,0.75,0.3157894736842105,-0.06375128722008452,-0.38086715007282484,-0.42808859409812133,-0.1915284426457446,0.31632653061224475,0.4080492548986851,0.5828427249789739,0.6981209986723741,0.5077160493827161,0.6889216454268805,0.25,0.1166357061617793,0.3297413793103448,0.24655830040189852,0.0,0.0,0.30357142857142844,0.1645199041822994,-0.19834562617451848,0.5055233966432693,-0.0615258408531584,0.4668208120125272,-0.19117647058823534,-0.26271582296986795,1.304545454545455,1.5471655717203874,1.3,-0.21270186339812386,0.03906250000000007,0.6876887472923455,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,0.18749999999999997,0.4277606437664822,0.07692307692307684,0.20579317813392642,1.4382903388973192,1.1825799865601236,0.06349206349206366,-0.052865183461613494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32727272727272727,0.09090909090909091,0.41175965046314583,0.15839636926447678,-0.39834875147642346,0.2877410852895671,-0.03817170923105783,-0.15496621909670405

The soldiers stated that they had lost faith in the army's leadership and felt they were being unfairly treated. The incident drew attention to concerns about the welfare of soldiers in the British army and their access to mental health support.

It was programmed by one developer, Tarn Adams, who has been working on it since 1994 and released the first version in 1999. In this article, we'll explore how to make your own Dwarf Fortress maps using Terragen 2. Our goal here will be making two map types: one with no water (dry land) and another more arid desert-like type of terrain. The steps are relatively simple but require some tweaking as you go along to get exactly what you want. We won't even try to discuss all possible variations or ways to modify terrains to give them properties that may not exist at all in nature! So take caution before proceeding just because these screenshots look like they work well together. More information can also be found below for reference if something goes wrong.

People have a limited time period to deposit the old notes in banks, with the deadline being December 30. The move has been taken to tackle the problem of black money, corruption and counterfeiting of currency. It is also expected to reduce terrorism financing and drug trafficking. The new notes of 500 (PS6.2) and 2,000 (PS24.5) denominations will replace the existing ones. In order to withdraw cash, people need to produce valid identity documents such as Aadhar cards, PAN cards or passports. Banks have been instructed to open special counters for senior citizens and differently abled people to facilitate the process. People can also exchange the old notes at post offices across the country. The government has also announced a number of measures to make sure that people do not face any difficulty during this transition period. This includes allowing households to withdraw up to 24,000 (PS297.4) per week from their bank accounts and providing farmers access to short-term loans using the old notes until November 24.",text-davinci-003,0.6212121212121212,0.8333333333333334,0.5076923076923077,0.46875,0.8421052631578947,0.27464203693146494,0.28116593210701735,0.45205039963113575,0.19677175211486947,-0.35374149659863957,-0.2753940468340657,-0.49217830109335586,-0.3636827816765029,-0.5746913580246911,-0.5098162497425053,-0.19999999999999996,-0.4675679904816031,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,0.6999999999999997,0.07073952905201655,-0.5403578140105801,-0.2736728491666279,-0.14766201804758006,-0.04946448185486001,-0.3823529411764707,-0.07460933831571184,-0.44545454545454544,-0.08827917127620245,0.40000000000000013,0.3175256644265494,-0.12499999999999997,0.2664975542259513,0.4615598627469165,0.6120358799896758,0.7125,0.8761537316671242,-0.7999999999999999,-0.32733167264507407,-0.3661102680829539,-0.24491460906750712,-0.11428571428571427,0.19669169488694657,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.30000000000000004,0.8,0.0,-0.12525522514112084,0.5497828058930189,-0.6842764850152538,-0.19457854358430965,-0.04488074971863276,0.02222044788033964

The construction contract was awarded following a competitive tender process overseen by the Office for Nuclear Regulation as well as local planning authorities. Rick Greenway MD of EDF Energy said: ""This landmark decision is testament to decades worth of hard work from our teams who helped make sure that we were best placed among competitors from around Europe and beyond.""",opt_30b,0.7045454545454546,0.16666666666666666,0.5692307692307692,0.5625,0.5789473684210527,0.36183041336370236,0.2759439051085923,0.3854746564849613,0.6296396266197883,1.5464852607709743,0.39250513231830103,1.0793383795906923,0.5226563866530245,1.0154320987654322,0.20968108670587216,1.1666666666666665,0.7781506248073794,1.5172413793103448,0.18435451309030776,0.0,0.0,1.2857142857142856,0.44188811482455576,1.236533092907809,1.0725154209023775,0.5414273995077932,-0.33289646262377914,1.4019607843137254,0.6846566274085878,0.021212121212121196,0.1838941644991086,0.1333333333333333,-0.09079798535423238,1.09375,1.6881413539470325,1.4995826764351294,2.0435774493568393,1.5625,5.284648616345003,-0.3076923076923077,0.17905775511394462,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,0.8042328042328045,0.08895184445038715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3272727272727274,0.5454545454545454,-0.6064052726403645,0.8198909016883587,-0.35724355689062254,-0.9322163730648806,1.4128484056073716,1.5161341094452003

Closures remain in place until further notice as precautionary measures. The Scottish Executive has announced that there will be no major flooding of low-lying land this summer due to a lack of rainfall and also because it is too early for River Leven or Torr Burn to reach flood stage. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by First Minister Donald Dewar yesterday (Thursday). A special sitting of Parliament today (Friday) began an inquiry into how much Scotland should contribute towards the cost of new roads being built under controversial plans put forward earlier this year by Argyll and Bute Council. Opposition MSPs are calling for Edinburgh City Council to share some of their maintenance responsibilities with Dumfries Galloway and Ayrshire councils if the central government scheme goes ahead.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Diana Sacayan, a well-known activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, was found dead in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. It is the third violent transgender death in the city in the last six months. Sacayan, 40, was found at a hostel in the Almagro neighborhood at 11:50 a.m., according to the city's state prosecutor's office. Police said there was no sign of forced entry, and that it appeared she had died from a drug overdose. Sacayan was a well-known LGBT rights activist and former president of the Buenos Aires Transvestite, Transsexual and Transgender Association (ATTTA). Last year she became the first openly transgender person to be appointed to a cabinet position in Argentina when she was named secretary for transvestite, transsexual and transgender affairs in the Ministry of Social Development. The appointment was part of a push to get transgender people to participate in politics, said Sergio Sanchez, an ATTTA spokesman. ""We've got to create a space for our community in politics, so that we can influence public policies in our favor,"" he told the Herald at the time. According to Sanchez, Sacayan's death should not be considered a suicide, because there was no suicide note, and the cause of death is still unknown. Sacayan was one of three transgender people found dead in the city in the last six months. ""The violent deaths of transgender people in Argentina represent a serious concern for human rights organizations,"" said Mauro Cabral, director of the Global Action for Trans Equality, in a statement Tuesday. Buenos Aires City legislator Daniel Lipovetzky also reacted to the death, asking police to investigate the case and to provide a comprehensive report to the city legislature. ""The violent death of a transgender person should be considered a hate crime and be investigated as such,"" Lipovetzky said. In 2011, Argentina passed a law to allow people to change the gender on their identity card. ""We are very worried because transgender women are being killed in Argentina at a rate of one every 23 days,"" Cabral said. ""It is urgent to start an investigation about the reasons behind these deaths, and to stop the murders of transgender women, most of whom are black or of mixed-race,"" he said. These murders, he said, ""are part of a global context in which violence against transgender people is increasing, and the numbers in Argentina are among the highest in the world."" According to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which monitors reports of transgender people killed around the world, 1,612 people were murdered between 2008 and 2014.",llama_65B,2.4318181818181817,2.1666666666666665,2.523076923076923,2.59375,3.3157894736842106,0.06475023560981705,0.7207775372221252,0.1673594458098877,0.4412139297177724,0.35222978080120926,-0.17536777547290353,0.4605177086253623,0.022258121559568366,0.49691358024691384,0.04449085822829456,0.6111111111111112,0.7273341641887056,-0.31609195402298845,-0.25384224780564346,0.0,0.0,0.19047619047619016,-0.38997878562075683,0.3454668564000622,0.6377740446461828,-0.10937927262783724,-0.14998706066829687,0.5522875816993466,0.14995965607991024,0.17676767676767685,0.29628499957459836,0.1333333333333333,0.5292094407109151,0.9895833333333334,0.12740600995499218,0.30186404525642213,0.5877039028599843,0.22916666666666666,1.1029232042022812,-0.1025641025641026,0.5179502815742939,0.0,0.151382597329742,1.248677248677249,0.8923497716903165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3818181818181818,2.4545454545454546,0.34789486044647583,0.7563059278802193,0.6761030917398688,-0.24333303534281417,0.3427453746114311,0.5684754776827194

Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, losing consciousness for a short time before being taken to hospital where she needed surgery and was kept under observation overnight Bragg, of Stockton-on Tees, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to grievous bodily harm with intent while armed. He had been due to stand trial but changed his plea today. He will be sentenced tomorrow morning when it is expected that two other charges against him - wounding with intent - will also go ahead alongside this conviction. Sentencing guidelines state Bragg faces up to 12 years behind bars. Prosecutor Rachel Masters told Teesside Crown Court how Bragg attacked his victim after they returned home from visiting friends together. The pair spent much of their relationship apart as each lived with different partners. They got back together however during lockdown last year, which has now ended temporarily because of England's third national coronavirus shutdown. The court heard how Mr Bragg began drinking excessively resulting in them getting into arguments and Ms Cook leaving in the early hours of September 25 last year. She later decided to return around 3am or 4am on Sunday November 1 2020 'out of concern' for what might happen if she didn't come back soon enough. It was then that Bragg struck out violently towards the mother-of-two who suffered brain injuries and lost sight in one eye following the vicious attack. Mr Justice Goss added: ""She describes you as controlling throughout your relationship with her."" Julie described how Daniel would often turn violent over nothing and control every aspect of her life including not allowing any men round In evidence read on behalf by Danielle Binns prosecuting, Julie explained how he started attacking her after returning home drunk. She stated: I] tried telling him I wanted my stuff and we were done [but] he just wouldn't let me leave until there wasn't anymore room for me inside so finally felt like I couldn't get away from him without hurting myself even more than already did.""",opt_30b,1.9318181818181819,2.0,2.0307692307692307,2.171875,1.5789473684210527,-0.050477230123964406,-0.39855242204254065,-0.270063529065085,-0.26834497937654644,0.011204481792717045,1.0242703637612036,0.15237718300103886,1.1288636496678266,0.265613652868555,1.3070213526018923,-0.5,0.42692541587164684,1.6643002028397564,3.0840086555621036,0.0,0.0,-0.48739495798319343,0.38655913771095884,-0.021442770397245223,0.3194992789411123,0.7643680934227669,1.4149732423728447,0.20242214532871972,1.3606293739401776,-0.3631016042780748,0.5380212664883447,-0.14117647058823524,0.3353874432830799,-1.056985294117647,-0.2030180628798205,0.27837936621370246,0.6167287376395012,-0.14338235294117643,0.923060234956269,1.2036199095022624,0.9523036823665579,0.8614359249010681,0.5150870048652542,-0.27637721755368794,0.4811592733029543,0.0,0.0,0.11764705882352941,0.32218973970892123,2.381818181818182,2.090909090909091,-0.4596182272381449,0.9314282804370071,0.039668202029869856,0.2784963628296551,-0.1849882852590911,-0.14790846857176462

These can include changing diets, taking certain drugs, or special supplements. Diet modifications can include increasing the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables in an animal's diet, reducing the amount of processed food, or providing an appropriate balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Drugs that are sometimes prescribed to extend an animal's life include thyroid hormone, anti-inflammatory medications, and antioxidants. Special supplements such as omega 3 fatty acids, probiotics, and glucosamine may also be beneficial.

Researchers have used this phenomenon to create a variety of applications, including more efficient solar cells and sensors. Superabsorption occurs when multiple molecules are in close proximity and act together to amplify the absorption of photons. Essentially, the molecules combine their energy levels to create a larger, more effective energy trap, allowing for better energy transfer from the photons to the molecules. This effect has been observed in organic molecules, like those found in plant pigments, and in inorganic materials, like semiconductors.

Prosecutors had asked for up to 15 days in jail for each of the women. The five dancers were arrested in late August after performing a dance routine on a Novorossiysk beach wearing nothing but body paint and underwear. The performance was part of a campaign to raise awareness about the risks posed by global warming. The court found that the performance had caused ""public disorder"" and issued fines and jail sentences for the dancers. The judge noted that the incident had ""provoked laughter, whistling, and an indecent reaction from those present"" at the beach, which disrupted public order. The dancers' lawyers argued that the performance was a form of art and was not intended to cause public disorder. They also pointed out that there were no complaints filed against the performance. Nevertheless, the court found that the dancers had violated public order and sentenced them accordingly. The case has sparked a debate in Russia over freedom of expression. Critics have argued that the court's decision was overly harsh and infringed upon the dancers' right to express themselves through art. Supporters of the ruling, on the other hand, have argued that the performance was inappropriate and disruptive, and thus deserved punishment.",text-davinci-003,0.9545454545454546,1.1666666666666667,1.0615384615384615,1.140625,0.6842105263157895,0.27058742983504824,0.35877008619095396,-0.26002899093826537,-0.10492146283692522,-0.26757369614512494,-0.41955815570178534,-0.06476030277544155,-0.5716725305150447,0.02160493827160509,-0.5696983629016926,-0.41666666666666674,-0.17938136583650044,-0.3577586206896551,-0.0012942904405077063,0.0,0.0,0.39285714285714257,-0.016056633065682526,-0.8076776849629042,-0.6699386250772679,-0.2050861361771946,-0.5606051868690635,-0.12745098039215677,0.16784461290880429,-0.32878787878787885,-0.30590666863195454,0.4666666666666668,0.5943580999924047,0.7812499999999999,-0.12240592212872103,0.1022442733933043,0.6555240366732317,0.06249999999999994,1.604499186172203,-0.46153846153846156,-0.3471457923769204,0.6537683358624178,0.1767718372770429,-0.38095238095238076,0.39666663533583857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6545454545454545,0.36363636363636365,0.3632221547199689,0.4484741572558515,-0.2817051183112948,0.3864819179723408,-0.3986902628832755,-0.2430012288661747
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Snapchat's Snap Kit allows developers to integrate Snapchat features into their apps. Hoop, a Tinder-like app developed on Snap Kit, quickly saw 2.5 million downloads after its launch. The app allows users to scroll through potential matches and swipe left or right, but users can also unlock more information on potential matches by using Snapchat. This is Hoop's first step in monetizing its platform and it looks to be a successful one. Tinder is popular for its simplicity. All you do is swipe left or right to indicate whether you're interested in someone. If you and your potential match swipe right on each other, you're matched and you can start chatting. Hoop, a new dating app for iOS and Android, is essentially Tinder on steroids. Users can swipe left or right on potential matches, but there's a catch. To see more information about a potential match, users must send that person a Snapchat. The goal is to ""increase the quality of matches and help curb ghosting,"" said Anthony Dilollo, co-founder of Hoop. ""We're re-introducing the personal touch of dating,"" Dilollo said. ""Swiping is addicting, but it's also an impersonal way of meeting someone, and we're changing that."" Dilollo and his co-founder Michael Perlman developed Hoop on Snap Kit, Snapchat's development platform that allows developers to integrate Snapchat features into their apps. Users who don't already have Snapchat will be prompted to download the app. They'll then have to use Snapchat to unlock information on their Hoop matches, like photos and videos from the person's Snapchat story. Hoop is Snap Kit's first publicly announced partner, and it's already a success. The app hit 1 million downloads within the first week of its launch in mid-May. Now, it has 2.5 million downloads. For Snapchat, this is a good way to get more users on its platform, which has been struggling to grow over the past year. Hoop is also one of the first apps to monetize its platform through Snap Kit. If users don't have a Snapchat account, they're prompted to download the app and create one. From there, they're directed to Snapchat's camera to take a photo for their Hoop profile. In order to be eligible for Snap Kit, developers must either have a product that is live in the app stores or have raised at least 100,000 in funding. Hoop has raised 3.4 million, Dilollo said. The company is also part of Y Combinator's Summer 2018 class and it plans to use the money to further develop its app. Snapchat's Snap Kit is a smart move for the company. It's a way for Snapchat to get more users on its platform and bring in more revenue. And for developers, it's a way to give users more value on their platform.",llama_65B,2.7196969696969697,4.0,3.1846153846153844,3.015625,4.0,-0.6297662228799774,-0.2767767478464429,-0.6314443182747498,-0.30255566234647957,-0.6765188834154351,-0.17092766435557133,-0.3126359444331663,0.0383434766655984,-0.42539378458918653,-0.006404575916284202,-0.2931034482758621,-0.005421231101650813,-0.1551724137931034,-0.035520496003489964,0.0,0.0,-0.5221674876847292,-0.06764638006562533,-0.2166459215997536,-0.10531680294890608,-0.2545896862889312,0.11364978156472312,-0.7515212981744424,-0.28321587400672693,-0.01097178683385578,0.2541523853777227,0.3172413793103448,1.0034160419075029,-0.6842672413793103,-0.41522734852251886,0.04029330971164704,0.23686286105102003,0.6142241379310345,1.1336343266570512,0.2917771883289124,0.3616383237051229,-0.3065948057837545,-0.18086186004645277,-0.31964969896004347,-0.025871219712420193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.6363636363636365,0.7545151523239899,0.605016263384932,0.3218332658492741,0.8795333097044742,-0.9408465257777766,-0.8771138355668332
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was to be an alternative to the corrupt practices of the cities. In February 1946, in a speech at Sevagram, Gandhi said: ""Unless India makes an all-out effort to give the village the place of honour, I shall have nothing to do with independence. I want a permanent village settlement, i.e., permanent structure of freedom."" Gandhi was not an arm-chair theorist. He had lived and worked in villages and among the poorest people of India. He saw them as more honest and more industrious than the city dwellers and wanted India's future to be determined by them. He realized that Indians had become too westernized. They had adopted the worst of western civilization, its materialism and its greed. Gandhi tried to restore India's traditional virtues of simplicity and non-violence. Although Gandhi was a Hindu, he respected all religions and insisted that India should treat its minorities with respect. Gandhi thought that the Congress had become a party of vested interests. He believed that it should not be in power and that India should have a government of national unity. Gandhi and other Congress leaders were released from prison when the war ended and the British released all political prisoners. Gandhi travelled all over India to try to restore peace. He called off the ""Quit India"" movement as soon as the war ended. In May 1946, the British agreed to give India independence by June 1948. They offered to remain until that time to ease the transition. British policy was to divide India and the Muslim League had already created a separate state called Pakistan. The only question was where to draw the line between the two countries. Gandhi was willing to let the Muslims have a separate country if that was their wish. He felt that they would eventually realize their mistake and reunite with India. He was willing to sacrifice the unity of India to avoid a civil war. In June 1947, the British announced that India would become independent on August 15, 1947. The new borders of India and Pakistan were drawn in such a way as to divide the Punjab and Bengal between the two countries. India and Pakistan became separate countries on August 15, 1947. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India. The new borders of the two countries were arbitrary and created many problems. The most serious problem was that millions of people became refugees. Hindus living in Pakistan and Muslims living in India had to leave their homes and go to the other side of the border. Both sides were blamed for the massacres of the refugees. Gandhi visited the riot areas in an attempt to calm the people. On January 13, 1948, Gandhi started a fast unto death because he felt that the Hindu and Sikh politicians were not doing enough to protect Muslims. The fast had the desired effect and the rioting stopped. Gandhi broke his fast on January 18. On January 30, 1948, Gandhi held a prayer meeting in Delhi. After the meeting, he went to the garden of Birla House to greet the people. A Hindu fanatic named Nathuram Godse came forward and shot him three times in the chest. Gandhi died instantly.",llama_65B,3.4393939393939394,5.833333333333333,3.6769230769230767,3.65625,2.9473684210526314,-0.3550981930445353,-0.3741451248926165,-0.06808909283574131,-0.3328572606237806,-0.945578231292517,-0.18123040772431764,-0.7317914213624895,0.04714008038194778,-0.749691358024691,0.1384735798171954,-0.65,-0.2299522364327234,-0.4577586206896551,0.02293793237630515,0.0,0.0,-0.9178571428571429,-0.43987385160414555,-0.10399743642663943,-0.08951421166413819,-0.4577522559474981,-0.17566078795542336,-0.860294117647059,-0.28918841761745834,-0.7954545454545455,-0.1553511366782532,-0.09999999999999987,0.6519970352839127,-0.1484374999999999,0.4018087664482525,0.04235834183436895,0.28954033070041857,0.037500000000000026,0.6887457887166608,-0.3384615384615384,0.044714718898337696,0.14382903388973192,0.22374418961548762,-0.7365079365079362,-0.00944826168500356,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.15612494995995996,2.109090909090909,2.6363636363636362,0.2953597393435599,1.0648091685794874,0.3098283184781959,0.5039139788771377,-0.8192098589308232,-0.9412516984259366

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Trapped by disadvantage are more than 730,000 youngsters, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). It laments a ""national shame,"" and its research suggests about 13 of the country's poorest households with children suffer ""persistent poverty,"" meaning that incomes remain below 50 percent of the median for three or more years. The causes of this phenomenon are complex, but there is a clear link to generational disadvantage and cycles of poverty. Many of these children come from Indigenous backgrounds, and their families have been living in poverty for generations. These children often face barriers to education, employment and social inclusion. In addition, many of these children experience an array of challenges such as homelessness, substance abuse, mental health issues, and family violence. ACOSS notes that these challenges can be compounded by inadequate access to essential services, such as housing, education, and health care, which further entrenches poverty. There is no quick fix to solving the issue of intergenerational disadvantage and poverty among Australian youth, but there are steps that can be taken to help protect vulnerable young people. For example, governments should provide increased funding for social and educational programs that target this group, including income support measures, training and employment services, and targeted health and mental health services. Governments should also prioritize initiatives that seek to increase participation in school, reduce the rates of early school leaving, and support those who do leave school early to gain the skills they need to enter the workforce. Finally, it is important to ensure that all children have access to adequate housing and nutrition to ensure they have the best chance of succeeding in life.",text-davinci-003,1.303030303030303,1.0,1.1538461538461537,1.21875,1.4210526315789473,1.1735262057565012,0.8167629276724646,0.9167002945399503,0.7160918649314754,0.5343228200371055,0.22099558464726915,0.3061396131202691,0.03850899601496001,0.3751402918069585,0.11343946302984186,1.227272727272727,0.37132276513618595,-0.3009404388714733,0.02597139685024984,0.0,0.0,1.2337662337662338,0.8092108832108003,-0.707611423109093,-0.12981796691186986,0.635394138265344,1.392703051287416,0.5213903743315508,-0.07320696370905946,-0.31818181818181823,-0.059267156195052254,1.7090909090909092,1.5480185805837128,-0.014204545454545442,-0.29666867855596535,-0.06108099449470122,0.404531905073868,0.017045454545454527,1.2695231120895754,0.18181818181818163,0.3679635017358486,-0.09509357612544259,-0.03721167769092702,0.9927849927849929,0.5545474188799993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0727272727272728,1.8181818181818181,0.0163287954730657,0.5031319460109194,0.6484842191675478,-0.9689662641888905,0.9299795382366981,0.7597471959828741

Flexsearch is well documented and researched, so it can be easily extended by adding new features or improving the existing ones. This post will help you understand how to install and use this great library in your PHP projects. For an easier understanding, I have divided this guide into three parts: Installation, Usage, and Development. Before we start with installation; let's first go over some important terms that are used throughout our article. We need (to make things simpler): A hostname, port number, username, password, database name, table prefix, virtualhost file path, FTP folder location, directory where OSGi bundle is installed etc... Let us now move on to installing flexsearch! Installing FlexSearch In Linux environment First thing if we want to run any application on Apache server we must configure it for running as webapp under apache webserver. [...] Read more "" The most popular CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal and Joomla all provide a text editor interface with which users may edit their pagesposts freely without any knowledge about programming language. However, what happens when these editors don't support code highlighting feature? No one wants to see plain html tags while editing content. Moreover, such systems require constant maintenance from developers who find themselves constantly fixing out-of-date plugins and themes. This issue could become even worse if you develop a website using both static files (html) dynamic data (php). The reason behind the above statement is simple - php needs to work dynamically before displaying output on screen whereas static HTML does not change unless you update them manually or via an automated system. If your hosting provider provides WYSIWYG editor facility then they might charge a lot because normally WYSGWYG tools store entire page source along with images, style sheets and other resources required for rendering. To avoid such problems people prefer open source software but still there exists no solution that completely satisfies user experience i.e., rapid development time coupled with better user experience at same cost than proprietary players. That's why many developers opt for statically coded languages having inbuilt compiler instead of writing TEMPLATE files everytime for changing each line of template. You won't believe it but none of CSS frameworks support inline styling across multiple lines except CodeMirror. This framework allows developer to write JavaScript within normal JS syntax rather than { } brackets. It also supports various builtin options and configuration settings like auto indentation, tabulation, outlining, folding, smart wrapping and much more. All these types of facilities makes developer life easy and saves lots of precious hours of his coding debugging. There are few more similar good libraries available for common markup task like replacing p tag and adding missing classes and IDs. They basically do the job just fine most of the times without interfering with regular structure of developing site. But are those tools enough? Do they save your time? Definitely yes. Let me tell you something - even though CodeMirror gives you a very powerful set of features while working on your project, sometimes it becomes too complex to handle few minor tasks quickly. A perfect case example would be Page Break option that automatically breaks down long page contents into several smaller segments so that visitor doesn't lose interest midway. Unfortunately, almost all modern websites are designed following ""one big design document"" approach. Putting aside the fact whether it is right or wrong; CDO means creating bunch of div elements leading up to actual webpage sourcecode itself. Now think - How difficult it would be to add some extra semantic class in between these two sections making whole layout look nice and clean? Save yourself from struggling through multiple issues and try Nindent plugin. With Nindent you can simply select desired section, type 'tab' key to expand current selection to next block level element and remove excess space between paragraphs effortlessly. Apart from these features Nindent is geared towards simplifying indenting stylesheets and js files. Using nindent.js you can analyze large chunk of css or javascript and rectify line length according to preferred tabs size. These features alone are worth 10-100 per year depending upon your business model, and thus, they're free for personal non-commercial purpose only. Well, besides saving time and reducing frustration, another main advantage is improved readability to visitors and search engines. Most of the browsers nowadays bring out native browser extensions in order to replace mouse clicks with keyboard shortcuts. One notable extension called TinyURL uses URL shortening service offered by tinyurl.com that reduces URLs up to 4 characters. This tool helps in preserving original URLs provided during bookmarking process although shortened versions are equally useful in boosting marketing efforts. Another handy feature is converting Google Bookmarks to Delicious and Digg links. Now imagine, having to click 1 button exactly once in order to get saved link instead of doing 500 separate actions to accomplish single goal. Although Nindent isn't the exact term that determines whether values occur in real estate. Therefore, attempting to instatistics' functionless mission turns out badly behaving to retain behavior.

""He reflected on how many cabinet meetings he had chaired [215], he reflected on people had been in the cabinet from the outset but also there was an awful lot of respect for what he'd achieved from the time when he came into that brave decision of a coalition because the economy needed stability, about saving the economy from the brink of bankruptcy right through to that great win just over 12 months ago."" Mr Cairns praised David Cameron's leadership, even on a policy he personally opposed. ""He confounded the critics - everyone said he would never get away with it...gay marriage for example, all the other social changes that have been brought about as well as the economic changes which are the most important, having brought us back from the brink of bankruptcy.""

Mr Cairns told me: ""Just changing one source of income for another is not the answer. The referendum threw out some clear issues. The sort of projects and the nature of spend wasn't having traction in those communities so we want a much higher level of debate. ""A business person in Wales said to me last week the previous situation was unsustainable. It had to be addressed and this has been brought about now through the Brexit referendum."" He added: ""It's easy to ask for money but I think we need to be looking at what the root causes of those issues are We looked at life chances in the cabinet today, we looked at what the barriers were to allowing people to get on. ""Why are white working class people less likely than their peers to go on to university? Those are the sorts of issues that we need to be addressing, those sorts of literacy skills, those sorts of numeracy skills that we need to overcome, the opportunities we need to give to people so that every person feels that they've got a part to play in society. ""That's what the agenda is about rather than one money coming from one pot and going to another. Focusing on spend is not the outcome."" Mr Cairns also rejected calls for Theresa May to hold an early general election: ""The last thing we need is more instability."" And will he be among ambitious ministers keeping their phone fully charged tomorrow? Mr Cairns said: ""There'll be lots of anxious people tomorrow. There'll be many people delighted, many people disappointed but I would say that's the privilege of being prime minister and I would also say one of the burdens.""",human,2.9015151515151514,2.6666666666666665,3.7384615384615385,3.8125,2.9473684210526314,-0.8409037763784555,-0.4634019804212019,-0.473811814704488,-0.05863342443225906,0.2993197278911563,1.89998221011163,0.9991589571068126,2.4467322313606217,1.021604938271605,2.4926244805084186,0.0714285714285714,0.6886373366736538,0.874384236453202,1.796049889009534,0.0,0.0,0.040816326530612096,1.4970078055064895,-0.5381114285403925,-0.06165976512907655,0.19688269073010653,1.381099565324378,0.4187675070028011,2.081494247223736,1.0212121212121212,1.1287835760210567,-0.24761904761904763,0.27652372747968046,0.5133928571428572,2.526607791348747,-0.154409719002133,0.13591127504500478,0.20535714285714277,1.375434638169409,1.3406593406593403,1.5650655083195142,0.14943276248283832,0.6906501479241783,0.25396825396825423,0.3495605622726032,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.42591770999996,1.7818181818181817,2.0,0.287697016603818,0.9218009065635902,0.11793249252123447,0.3344854176979012,-0.078648766574195,0.13479822349381212

Managers distributed anti-union literature prior to the vote, claiming that a union would be bad for workers' work lives. ""We're not your personal assistants,"" one flyer said in part. ""If you want us to treat you better - talk to me like we are equals."" The letter also argued against paid sick leave and other benefits now standard at most unionsized grocery stores across America (Instacart is owned by Amazon). After news broke late last week about an impending election, management announced it was offering all workers 25 million worth of restricted stock units if they did not join a union. ""It's a pretty clear attempt from [the company] to buy off our votes so there isn't a majority of 'yeses, Susan Minato, who works as an organizer for UFCW in San Francisco told BuzzFeed News Monday morning after receiving notice of the offer. Representatives from Instacart confirmed receipt of the email but declined further comment. An Instacart spokesperson previously denied any such proposal existed when asked earlier this month by BuzzFeed News about employee concerns around workplace standards, pay, and health care outside California where the labor law governing collective bargaining does not apply.

Jones has just one year remaining on his contract at Old Trafford and Everton are expected to make an official approach in the coming days. Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka has not ruled out making an offer for Real Madrid defender Fabio Coentrao, but says the club has not made an approach. Coentrao, 28, spent the second half of last season on loan at Monaco and is looking for a new club this summer. ""We are looking at players and he is one of the players on our list,"" said Karanka. ""He is one of the players we are looking at.""

Stoke have had two offers rejected for the 22-year-old England player, who has scored 20 goals in 81 appearances since making his debut for the Baggies in 2010. Pulis said: ""They've made an offer and we've turned it down. That's as far as it's gone. He's our player and we'll work with him.""

The Algeria international was named the PFA Player of the Year last season after scoring 17 goals in the Premier League as the Foxes won the title.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"This article is an introduction to learning COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL). COBOL is a domain-specific language for business. It excels in managing and manipulating heterogeneous data in record structures, and it is the most widely used language for creating business applications. It is used to create applications that are used in a variety of industries, including banking, finance, insurance, and government. COBOL was first developed by a team of computer scientists in 1959, and since then has been updated to meet the needs of the changing computing world. It is a high-level programming language, which means it is easily readable by humans and it is also structured, which makes it easier to debug. COBOL is designed to be used with data files, which allows data to be stored, retrieved, and manipulated. COBOL is divided into four divisions: the identification division, environment division, data division, and procedure division. The identification division identifies the program and its author, while the environment division sets up the runtime environment. The data division defines the data structures used in the program, while the procedure division contains the code that actually runs the program. In order to use COBOL effectively, one must understand the syntax and structure of the language. COBOL's syntax is relatively simple, but it does have many rules that must be followed for a program to run correctly. For example, each line of code must begin with an indicator that specifies what type of instruction it is, such as READ or WRITE. In addition, all variables must be declared before they can be used in the program. Learning COBOL requires patience and dedication, but it can be a rewarding experience. Once you understand the basics, you'll be able to create complex business applications that can be used in a wide range of industries.",text-davinci-003,1.5303030303030303,1.8333333333333333,1.6615384615384616,1.59375,1.6842105263157894,0.3667726697026746,1.060107342570938,0.9012324790538017,0.9131277199094446,-0.261904761904762,-0.29143730361219994,-0.06476030277544155,-0.0013115935303303077,-0.15663580246913564,-0.06614659377064072,-0.75,0.040007115748938456,-0.04525862068965513,0.38118578765791894,0.0,0.0,0.19642857142857129,0.18420054490921736,-0.552151337729065,-0.2752035440712692,0.02461033634126324,0.4061516790050253,-0.573529411764706,-0.09062010738237981,0.9545454545454548,0.7988548638596689,0.42500000000000004,0.4264551387415712,0.09765625000000007,0.659726317227636,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,-0.09374999999999999,0.5414361770260463,0.2499999999999999,0.6407665212065663,-0.03268841679312086,-0.011276799095737079,0.28571428571428586,-0.08394255117011272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9454545454545454,0.5454545454545454,0.46594138323142525,0.6554017907060492,-0.3312197164563019,-0.622301657862576,0.29348538212310316,0.5182815978194829

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"HQ, the makers of HQ Trivia, is closing down its business and laying off its 25 employees. CEO Rus Yusupov sent a note to employees informing them of the company's decision on Wednesday after shutting down the Augmented Reality game last month. ""It's with heavy hearts that we must now announce an end-of-life for QuizUp,"" he wrote in the letter obtained by VentureBeat. ""We are deeply grateful to our loyal players who have supported us over the years."" The Verge reports that Mashable has also learned from sources on the inside about the closure. The staff will be let go within days starting next week, according to a statement given to the publication. A representative for HQ told GameSpot this morning that it was not aware of any layoffs but wouldn't comment further due to pending litigation. An email seeking confirmation was only returned late Thursday evening. It's unclear if employees were notified prior to the lawsuit being filed or during the suit process. Yusupov started working at HQ seven months ago as part of a media partnership between NBCU and Playground Global Inc., which operates HQ. He previously worked at another location trivia app called Meerkat where he helped launch the product and eventually led all development teams. A source said Yusupov left Meerkat before its issues became public and joined the current team that runs HQ. That meant some members had never met him until joining HQ and they weren't happy with his leadership style when things began going south. According to court documents seen by GameSpot, one former employee claims Yusupov fired her because she complained about poor work conditions. She claimed her manager asked her to make changes to code without properly understanding how to do so. When she refused, the manager allegedly blocked access to GitHub.com, the online hosting service used by developers. That same person alleged she was retaliated against after complaining about the firing. Another developer posted complaints on Twitter and Reddit following the shutdown claiming there wasn't enough time for anyone trying to fix bugs in the system among other problems. They allege that Yusupov only cared about revenue growth while ignoring criticism. Another user tweeted about Yusupov telling them privately that his lawyers advised him to shut down the site. Other users reported issues receiving phone calls indicating their account information was compromised, such as people attempting to change passwords multiple times even though the accounts didn't exist yet.",gpt_j,2.3257575757575757,2.6666666666666665,2.3384615384615386,2.328125,1.631578947368421,0.36557001990752885,-0.0918771100914407,0.13168932876296593,0.12861045780022212,-0.19306770327178516,-0.32023352103785485,-0.12335295766750773,-0.2485147823345708,-0.15123456790123424,-0.3827413705180814,-0.5952380952380952,-0.17203204270768882,0.37438423645320196,0.19237853642540206,0.0,0.0,-0.16326530612244916,-0.12063631527589623,-0.24608131741600495,0.04955661028870679,0.6890894175553732,0.3448718023591478,-0.05462184873949595,0.10622573817079041,-0.5121212121212122,0.19552455197697236,-0.4380952380952381,-0.04565731358275675,-0.11160714285714288,0.01646009219878887,-0.32551238059909116,-0.15917634141086556,-0.08035714285714289,1.0691719697916267,0.46153846153846145,0.29908316879485786,0.5230146686899342,0.13150117184484977,-0.6349206349206349,0.03811091283805093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.672727272727273,2.272727272727273,-0.3717334791663328,1.0571093074311657,0.007846457544370028,0.01581369477446311,-0.10800926426595132,-0.11240573272898241

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be more privacy-focused, with end-to-end encryption being a key feature. Zuckerberg made the announcement in a blog post, stating that he believes privacy is essential for innovation and that the future of communication will be more secure and encrypted. Facebook plans to integrate its messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, to allow users to communicate across different platforms while maintaining encryption. However, some critics are concerned about the impact of encryption on safety and security, as it can make it difficult for law enforcement to monitor criminal activity. Zuckerberg said that Facebook is committed to working with law enforcement and governments to balance privacy and safety concerns. Overall, it seems that Facebook's move towards encryption signals a shift towards a greater emphasis on privacy and security, which could benefit users but also raises important questions about the balance between privacy and safety in the digital age.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.5984848484848485,0.3333333333333333,0.5846153846153846,0.53125,0.5263157894736842,1.090227592869753,0.9564809809914732,1.269903436256482,0.592410175174827,0.6491739552964043,-0.025659754495159188,0.5920941968040372,0.4197902474228972,0.42901234567901236,0.05822872545690136,0.0714285714285714,0.23142643343018043,-0.12561576354679801,0.1545044027408709,0.0,0.0,1.244897959183673,0.13766836977145477,-0.22361746271412894,-0.15483356043649382,0.5906480721903199,-0.07948029995316443,0.1638655462184875,0.16129794581826687,0.3545454545454546,0.12030358632345362,1.3714285714285717,1.6833861474835259,0.0223214285714287,0.5333088377551533,-0.154409719002133,0.21197740306817978,1.2053571428571428,1.4567515799500645,-0.15384615384615388,-0.19017913026862707,1.270178481104126,0.23929561512071332,0.5079365079365081,0.2722752065450611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14545454545454545,1.2727272727272727,0.425274458711361,-0.07536224580808264,1.2681803982276554,-1.3231415632090913,1.2296387538326055,1.485550652920908

The BBC said changing the law could lead to a subscription model, which would mean viewers would have to pay to watch the BBC. However, some argue that decriminalisation of the licence fee could be a fairer solution, as it would mean not punishing those who cannot afford to pay the current 157.50 fee per year.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed and their hostage freed. In Paris itself, a gunman holding hostages in a Jewish supermarket has been killed, but a number of hostages also died. Here is what we know about the attackers so far. Two brothers accused of carrying out the massacre at the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday were killed two days later when police stormed the building where they had been holding a hostage. Two men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had been barricaded in a printing factory in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) from Paris. Cherif, 32, was jailed in 2008 and had long been known to police for militant Islamist activities, prior to the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, which killed 12 people. Cherif, who also went by the name Abu Issen, had been part of the ""Buttes-Chaumont network"" that helped send would-be jihadists to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-UK invasion in 2003. He grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes, where he trained as a fitness coach. In the early 2000s, he joined his elder brother at his home near Paris and worked as a pizza delivery man, media say. Police detained him in 2005 just as he was about to board a plane for Syria - at the time the gateway for jihadists hoping to fight US troops in Iraq. Le Monde reports that, following Cherif's imprisonment between January 2005 and October 2006, he first came into contact with the man who would become his mentor - Djamel Beghal. Beghal was sentenced to 10 years in prison in France in 2001 for his part in a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris. In 2008, Cherif Kouachi was jailed for three years for his role in sending militants to Iraq, but 18 months of the sentence was suspended. Eric Bade, a neighbour living in Genneviliers, north-west of Paris, described Cherif as ""well-behaved, friendly, polite, clean-looking and above all, which is very important, he was willing to help old and disabled people."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bade said Cherif ""wasn't aggressive - he wasn't a crazy zealot, he was a calm person."" 'Iraq connections' The brothers had allegedly attended a mosque near the Buttes-Chaumont, an area of northern Paris, where they came under the influence of a radical imam called Farid Benyettou. He reportedly encouraged them to study Islam at his home and at a Muslim centre in their area. A key figure in the Buttes-Chaumont network was Boubaker al-Hakim, a militant linked to al-Qaeda resistance against US forces in Iraq, a French expert on Islamists says. A French court jailed Hakim for seven years in 2008, at the same time as Cherif, along with Farid Benyettou, who got six years. That action broke up the jihadist network they had created. In a blog article (in French) Middle East expert Jean-Pierre Filiu says Hakim had recruited militants to fight in Falluja, an Iraqi city that became an al-Qaeda stronghold in 2004. Hakim is also wanted in Tunisia over the murder of two Tunisian left-wing opposition politicians in 2013 - Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi. Hakim claimed the murder in the name of the Islamic State militant group, Mr Filiu says. In 2010 Cherif Kouachi was named in connection with a plot to spring another Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, from jail - a plot hatched by Beghal, according to French anti-terror police. Belkacem used to be in the outlawed Algerian Islamic Armed Group (GIA) and was jailed for life in 2002 for a Paris metro station bombing in 1995 which injured 30 people. Said Kouachi, 34, was also named in the Belkacem plot, but the brothers were not prosecuted because of a lack of evidence. Said's ID card was found in the brothers' getaway car which they abandoned after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, police sources say. The gunman who is thought to have killed four people and held a number of others hostage at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris has been identified as 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly. Police also believe he killed a policewoman in the Montrouge area of the French capital on Thursday. Coulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity - including drugs offences - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers. Born in Juvisy-sur-Orge on the outskirts of Paris, he is said to have been one of 10 children. He worked for Coca Cola. He met then-President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace in 2009, as part of an employment initiative. In an interview with Le Parisien at the time, he said it would be ""impressive"" to meet Mr Sarkozy, and that he was not sure what he would say. He had added that his temporary job at the local Coca Cola plant would be over soon, and that he hoped Mr Sarkozy could help him get a job. Reports say Coulibaly - along with Cherif Kouachi - was a committed follower of Djamel Beghal. In 2013 he was jailed for five years for his involvement in the 2010 plot to free Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from prison, following the militant Islamist's conviction over the 1995 Paris metro station bombing. He met Cherif Kouachi while in prison. Coulibaly was released last year. He is said to have told police from the supermarket on Friday: ""You know who I am."" An acquaintance told AP news agency that he was ""totally shocked"" when he found out about Coulibaly's role in the attacks. ""He never went to prayers or talked about Islam,"" the fellow drug dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Coulibaly's mother and sister have issued a statement condemning his attacks. They offered ""sincere condolences"" to the families of the victims, and said: ""We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion."" Meanwhile, police are still trying to trace Hayat Boumeddiene, a 26-year-old woman who was Coulibaly's partner. She is thought to have married Coulibaly in a religious ceremony in 2009 - however, these ceremonies are not recognised in France unless an official civil ceremony is also carried out. She is now believed to be in Syria. She arrived in Turkey in early January, before crossing into Syria on 8 January, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on 12 January. Police had previously identified her as a suspect in Thursday's shooting of a policewoman. Francois Molins, the chief prosecutor in France, said Boumeddiene had exchanged more than 500 phone calls with the wife of Cherif Kouachi in 2014. French newspaper Le Monde published a series of photographs said to show Coulibaly with Boumeddiene in 2010. In one, she is pictured pointing a crossbow at the camera while wearing a full-face veil, which is banned in France. Police questioned Boumeddiene about Coulibaly in 2010. During the interview, she was reportedly asked about her reaction to attacks by al-Qaeda, and responded: ""I don't have any opinion,"" before blaming the US for civilian deaths.

In this paper, we present such a framework that can achieve both these objectives with one unified architecture. All of our modules are end-to-end trainable by adopting a novel self-attention based convolutional module for feature map aggregation followed by an anchor box classifier which is trained from scratch within each mini batch to further enhance localization performance and prevent trivial solutions during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method over existing approaches, extensive experiments have been conducted on three challenging large scale datasets: COCO , Market1501 [zheng2015scalable] and DukeMTMC-reID . The experimental results show that even though our proposed model only outperforms other baseline models slightly on some benchmarks, it significantly reduces computation cost while maintaining high accuracy by half on all test sets compared to competing methods.' author: - Xinwei Li1, Xingyu Liu3,4[1], Mingshuo Zhang 2, Yao Wu 1, Ming Zhou 1 and Pengtao Xie 2,5 1.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Herbert Diess, head of the VW brand, said the company would have a fix in the coming weeks or months. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said no such remedies have been submitted to it. Volkswagen has said a software update is all that is needed to fix 8.5 million diesel vehicles in Europe that were fitted with software designed to conceal their true level of emissions. The company is due to present a plan on 27 January to fix those vehicles. But in the US, where regulations are stricter, VW must either modify its cars or offer to buy them back. According to Bloomberg, Mr Diess said a software update should suffice. But the EPA said VW had not yet submitted any proposed fixes to it. ""We have not received any proposals from VW that would provide a path forward to resolve the outstanding issues,"" an EPA spokeswoman told the news agency. VW declined to comment on the EPA's statement. The company has admitted that it used illegal software to cheat diesel emissions tests in the US, and that 11 million cars were affected worldwide. It has put aside 6.7bn (5bn) to cover the costs of the scandal, but analysts expect that number to rise sharply. Ratings agency Fitch said on Thursday it was placing VW's credit rating under review for a downgrade, and would make a decision in the next three months.",llama_65B,1.0378787878787878,1.1666666666666667,1.1076923076923078,1.203125,1.0526315789473684,-0.5778153871162552,-0.1308325561553182,-0.44295286911080267,-0.482460770815278,-0.14285714285714293,0.07150138112868623,0.0,-0.035426187497951546,0.10802469135802499,-0.04150741351003645,-0.9166666666666666,-0.6590549080748712,-0.2327586206896551,0.008232810778301868,0.0,0.0,-0.2857142857142858,0.3418681598108942,0.2537394497007355,0.048316560342263726,0.4265791632485644,-0.16275102776248768,-0.7009803921568629,-0.31880116614182835,0.3712121212121212,0.20166754558524433,0.30000000000000004,1.0451554033951607,0.5468749999999999,0.5757009039391038,0.1022442733933043,0.27976250141107195,0.8125,0.7930669648887523,-0.07692307692307705,0.23568635346060884,-0.13075366717248352,0.1767718372770429,0.06349206349206366,0.36644995143405246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7818181818181819,0.5454545454545454,0.2441251473563444,0.4781148198414997,-0.19401514297051906,0.492813613956685,-0.408757360341106,-0.371320620181192

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Apple's custom-designed M2 chips entered production this month. The chips will be introduced with new Macs in the second half of 2021. They are being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple's M2 chips will bring power management to Macs for the first time. The Mac Pro is the first Mac computer with an Apple-designed chip. The T2 chip handles system security and enables the Mac Pro to boot in under 10 seconds. The T2 chip also features a secure enclave co-processor, SSD controller, and IO controller. Bloomberg's report says Apple has created a new chip division that is designing ARM-based chips for Macs. The new division is led by Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji, who joined Apple in 2008. Bloomberg says Srouji has been using ARM chip technology since before he joined Apple. The T2 chip was designed in-house by Srouji's team. Apple is currently working on new Macs that will use a custom-designed ARM chip. The ARM chips will be used to power the Mac's low-power mode, the first time Apple has included a low-power mode in a Mac. The report says the ARM chip will handle some basic tasks, allowing Apple to use less powerful Intel chips in the Mac. The ARM chip will also allow for longer battery life for MacBooks. Apple's custom-designed ARM chips for the Mac won't enter production until 2021. They will be used in at least one Mac model starting in 2021, says the report. Apple has not commented on the report.

""Although I am always skeptical because we could never prove what neuron X responded too without somehow destroying function (which would eliminate any chance you had even knowing which cell gave off signals), [this paper] adds some very nice evidence here showing where groups respond differently than isolated animals...and then links particular cells back through behavioral experiments making me believe there's something worth looking into further down an experimental roadmap.",gpt_neox,0.5757575757575758,0.16666666666666666,0.676923076923077,0.640625,0.5263157894736842,1.0937166511665382,0.2480113732059824,1.0265266333365788,1.0221158484069983,1.1609977324263034,2.5111201367611216,1.3815531258760865,2.5147318682982616,1.2314814814814814,2.39156480488753,0.8333333333333335,1.6706912632923312,4.017241379310344,5.442715643841723,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142854,0.694254694381408,-0.2573132447669429,0.04966677129721343,1.8047579983593105,3.2413299551063934,0.3823529411764707,0.7146930980174302,0.48787878787878813,1.0704197494852132,0.1333333333333333,0.7790682453957565,0.0,0.8784026431724338,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.06249999999999994,0.6501179974730944,1.692307692307692,1.7369743065503431,1.5690440060698025,1.1085374562060406,0.3597883597883601,1.0413251774106274,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.372677996249965,1.5818181818181818,0.45454545454545453,-1.0475159672236305,1.0246745431684785,-0.508395473694919,-1.3264410650142402,1.4887660119936867,1.4459606327352759

Protesters also threw stones and bottles at the police in a bid to block the demolition of the Gezi Park camp. The BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul says the police are trying to push the protesters back from Taksim Square and have used tear gas and water cannon. Protesters also took to the streets in the capital Ankara. Our correspondent says many of the demonstrators are angry at the government's plans to replace the park with a shopping centre. At least 200 people have been arrested in Istanbul and Ankara, reports say. Police removed barricades in the park on Saturday morning as they moved in to clear the area. On Friday, riot police withdrew from Taksim Square and allowed protesters to re-enter the site. The square was the scene of violent clashes between demonstrators and police in June.

The tools included scrapers used for cleaning and sharpening animal hides as well as blades made from beach stones which were either broken up or polished to make them razor thin. They also found remains of animals such as red deer that had been butchered - along with evidence they'd eaten sheep's milk cheese before being buried at sea level under peat bog deposits.

The 25-year-old, of Cliffe Woods, Kent, met Samuel Bearman, 24, through the online dating site OkCupid in March 2015 before he moved to Brighton. They started a relationship but Jessica said she was shocked when her partner told her about his plans for after they had children together - which included adoption or surrogacy options involving another woman rather than carrying them himself. She claims that Mr Bearman even suggested using IVF so one child could be genetically related to him while another would not need to go though it at all. But months later their relationship came crashing down following an argument over what Ms Nelson claimed were 'controlling' behaviour from her boyfriend. Shellshocked, last January, she took out a restraining order against Mr Bearman and left London where she lived with him into rented council accommodation near Canterbury costing 400 per month just four miles away from the home she shared with Mr Bearman. After splitting up with Sam, Jessica began working three days a week on a zero hours contract at Just Eat in Sandwich. However when that job ended, around a year ago due to Covid-19 restrictions, she found herself back living with mum Angela who has helped fund her daughter's treatment since 2017.

Founder Michael Eavis, who was at Yeovil Magistrates' Court, said he was ""extremely upset and disappointed."" He told the BBC: ""We are farmers and take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously."" The court heard that the cesspit was uncovered and a heavy vehicle drove over it, causing it to rupture. The Environment Agency said a two-mile stretch of the river was affected. The festival was fined 17,500 and ordered to pay 8,000 in costs. The festival, which attracts 135,000 people, is held every year on Mr Eavis's farm.

Rivian, the Michigan-based startup electric vehicle manufacturer that was recently awarded 350 million in investment capital from Amazon, is working with the U.S. utility Clean Energy Fuels Corp to build an ""electric vehicle charging network for the masses"" that will be accessible to nearly every other EV on the road. As part of the deal, Rivian will purchase some of Clean Energy's existing high-powered DC chargers, which are currently available to fuel cell-powered trucks and buses. Rivian's newly acquired chargers, which can charge batteries at more than 350 kW, will be modified to operate at speeds compatible with Rivian's planned EV offerings (the company's Rivian R1T truck is expected to have a range of 400 miles). Clean Energy, meanwhile, will continue to build and support the network, which it plans to expand into the largest network of Level 3 fast chargers across the United States, capable of supporting nearly every model of EV on the road. Clean Energy will also provide its natural gas and RNG vehicle fueling services at the stations. ""We believe that the future of EV charging lies both in expanding the charging infrastructure and in partnering with other forward-thinking companies to jointly develop innovative new business models that transcend the limitations of outdated infrastructure,"" Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe said in a statement. ""This agreement to provide easy access to Clean Energy's network of fast chargers is another step in our journey toward enabling the widespread adoption of sustainable mobility."" The new network of chargers will be located at existing Clean Energy stations, as well as at selected retail and fleet locations across the country. Stations will be installed in high-traffic corridors to provide ease of access to both retail and commercial EV drivers. Rivian, which made headlines when it debuted its R1T at the LA Auto Show last November, says it plans to begin deliveries of its electric vehicle lineup in 2020.

They sat on the semi-submerged vessel's roof for 10 hours before embarking on their swim, their mother said. Mrs Ostojic, from Stevenage, said: ""It's a relief that they are safe."" She added: ""They are fine, carrying on with their travels, and will be home shortly."" Travellers from New Zealand, Spain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands were among those rescued after the boat hit a reef near Sangeang Api, a volcanic island off Sumbawa, in bad weather during the three-day journey. Mrs Ostojic said the girls sent an email to her and her husband Peter saying they had heard everyone had been found. They also revealed that after the boat sank in the middle of the night, they swam for eight hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and being rescued, their mother said. The Foreign Office said Alice Ostojic had been been travelling through Australia and south-east Asia as part of her gap year.

The brew is reportedly made from a type of indigenous ginseng called insam and glutinous rice, and cultivated by an organic farming method. North Korean media is known for making often outlandish claims about its domestic achievements. Last year, it said medical products containing extracts from the insam plant could cure Mers, Sars and even Aids, NK News reported. The Pyongyang Times said the new alcohol ""exudes national flavour,"" without dampening your national fervour the following morning. Among its other unique selling points, according to the paper - the spirit ""is highly appreciated by experts and lovers."" The newspaper article, titled, ""Liquor wins quality medal for preserving national smack,"" says the Taedonggang Foodstuff Factory has been working for years on the elixir. The drink derives from Kaesong Koryo insam - a natural herb thought to have medicinal properties. According to the Pyongyang Times, replacing sugar with the scorched, glutinous rice removed the bitterness from the insam and, crucially, the hangover. ""Koryo Liquor, which is made of six-year-old Kaesong Koryo insam, known as being highest in medicinal effect, and the scorched rice, is highly appreciated by experts and lovers as it is suave and causes no hangover,"" the article reads. The liquor ""has already been registered as a national scientific and technological hit,"" it adds. Andray Abrahamian, who travels to North Korea on business for Chosong Exchange, told the UK-based North Korean News website that insam liquors were ""OK"" but he is ""not that keen on it as a tasty treat."" ""There are some high quality liquors made in North Korea, though in my experience there is no such thing as hangover-free booze anywhere in the world,"" he said.",human,1.4924242424242424,1.3333333333333333,1.1692307692307693,1.25,2.526315789473684,0.2984831763015824,-0.1388640877790219,0.1506276844153172,0.22956647172954972,0.2783882783882783,0.28473789646556485,-0.11955748204696905,0.31944091387944173,-0.03822412155745452,0.22596690521318985,1.0384615384615383,0.1966520789486111,0.05570291777188329,-0.3162167200019659,0.0,0.0,0.17582417582417556,-0.15970127840969453,0.26885935190392113,0.7298636012438517,0.4619170820975577,-0.1956263429254051,-0.08823529411764709,0.11683378113637424,-0.23006993006993015,0.4361007711812452,0.3384615384615386,1.2397757577532795,0.5168269230769231,0.20082926828334566,-0.220218435000963,0.08022790897114865,-0.7067307692307692,-0.3688340202820253,0.059171597633136085,0.3208456960179699,0.08046379518306686,0.2193621295026596,2.0122100122100126,1.317053633126557,0.07692307692307693,0.26646935501059654,0.0,0.0,1.2,1.7272727272727273,0.011706940617093283,0.5524537351710525,0.4170629261035182,-0.1979261972417569,0.27465823298146924,0.4439452138898459

This means when light hits foo, some of it bounces off onto bar but most will go through into the background behind baz causing glare there as well. When light hitting baz reflects from bar, only part gets reflected away so we see a bit more reflection here than if our eyes were just looking at baz directly. I haven't written any HTML yet using ReflectiveJS because I'm still experimenting how exactly best to do things - whether or not having images inside img tags work better vs setting them outside.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims. It has called on the government to increase its ambition in tackling the housing crisis, warning that the UK is facing a ""major shortage"" of properties for rent. Rics said the number of households in the private rented sector (PRS) could reach 5.93 million by 2025, representing around 25 of all homes in England and Wales. This figure is up from 4.1 million currently and 3.6 million in 2010. Rics said the growth was partly driven by an ageing population, which is increasingly opting to rent rather than buy. However, it warned that the lack of housebuilding meant there were not enough homes being built to meet demand. It said that the majority of new-builds were for sale, meaning that people who wanted to rent had fewer options. The report called for the government to introduce measures such as rent controls and tax incentives to encourage more landlords to provide homes for rent. It also suggested that local authorities should be able to borrow money to build their own PRS stock. Rics chief executive Sean Tompkins said: ""The UK's housing market is fundamentally broken. We are facing a major shortage in the number of homes available to rent, and rising rental costs are pricing many people out of the market. Unless we take action now to address this growing problem, more and more people will be left without access to secure, affordable accommodation.""",text-davinci-003,1.1515151515151516,1.1666666666666667,1.1384615384615384,1.25,1.1578947368421053,-0.15981013734032157,0.046999838325411276,-0.09962915813361381,-0.029564635243086414,0.027210884353741395,-0.2840379482287046,0.04317353518362754,-0.25661419263027235,0.1728395061728398,-0.2804941174409042,0.25,0.3887280389380696,0.39224137931034475,0.5519775681111052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14931925703956378,-0.49318371913664055,0.0,0.771123872026251,0.43335926426143895,-0.12745098039215677,0.3387898834494768,0.13787878787878807,-0.3059066686319547,-0.3666666666666666,-0.02220568552509542,-0.07812499999999993,0.11115967914527367,0.7011035889826579,1.3571285229277767,0.8125,0.7930669648887523,-0.23076923076923084,-0.06434215008097627,0.39226100151745075,0.24103728355368267,0.13756613756613786,0.023192669586031136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8909090909090909,0.9090909090909091,0.17466505929739665,0.4984471816189925,0.057271720255891126,0.12408944049952497,-0.07144439301753752,-0.3027432490401617

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Gene Levoff, the previous senior director of law and corporate security at Apple until September last year, has been charged with securities fraud and is set to appear in court later this morning. The SEC alleges that he made false statements about his prior role working for two hedge funds and a mutual fund manager when applying for employment by Apple (via Bloomberg). Yahoo Finance reports: The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday it filed civil charges against former Apple Inc. security chief Thomas J. Moyer Jr., saying he failed to disclose during job interviews how much money he was paid as an executive at two hedge-fund firms and a large asset management company between 2013 and 2018.... A lawyer representing Moyer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. ""Moyer repeatedly assured potential employers throughout his career that he would not accept any position where conflicts of interest could arise or were possible, including those involving investments in publicly traded companies using investor assets,"" Michele Wein Layne, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division, said in a statement. But once hired, Moyer accepted compensation from one investment firm while being offered another with which he had previously done business - actions that violated federal rules requiring such disclosures before employees can be considered for jobs, according to the complaint... In addition to these allegations regarding his prior work history, the SEC also claims that Moyer misled investors into thinking they weren't fully aware of what their IRA account holdings actually consisted of without disclosing ""material facts"" about them.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Daniel Bragg, 37, hit Julie Cook, 44, so hard he broke her left eye socket in the assault, police said. Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, causing serious damage to a frontal lobe of her brain sustained during a previous medical condition, according to Chief Mark Gearon at the time. ""I'm talking about that skull bone,"" Mr Moran told The Age last week when asked what it felt like for him to punch someone as hard as he did Ms Cook. ""It's very satisfying."" His actions were captured by CCTV cameras inside Watsons Bay train station immediately after 3am on November 4 this year, which have been released now under freedom-of-information laws. Police say they could not find Mr Bragg to answer questions over his cause of death but the coroner ruled out foul play. In response to an FOI request from Fairfax Media earlier this month, Victoria Police said there was no evidence of intentional harm inflicted upon the victim or excessive force used by Mr Bragg while restrained. He had attempted suicide 12 hours before the incident. Sources close to Mr Bragg dispute these findings and maintain he acted unlawfully in self defence. They claim she threw punches at Mr Bragg first and caused involuntary bodily harm (IBH) because she badly bumped into him at least three times. Mr Bragg is being referred to court soon for breaching bail conditions imposed following a high profile escape attempt six days earlier where he allegedly stole several items including two knives. He will also face charges related to assaulting two people outside another Sydney pub on March 10. It is alleged he punched one man twice in the chest, causing rib fractures, and choked the other with his tie during a drunken argument in Kings Cross Rd Australia Day night. No further details can be disclosed due to potential offences pending against Mr Bragg involving violence. Mr Morand says he knows why Mr Bragg has chosen to take his life in such circumstances given a number of factors are involved, including alcohol use and mental health issues. But he insists the family of Ms Cook should know exactly how hard Mr Bragg struck their daughter just moments after removing her from life support five months ago. Mr Moran says police found 15 separate contusions throughout Ms Cook's body, some large enough for suffocation - visible only through X-ray scans. One injury was even worse than that caused by the iron bar John Worboys sent flying across a London pavement leaving deep lacerations down both sides of his torso days before he died of heart failure aged 47. For the moment, neither officer nor any witnesses to the attack have come forward despite Mr Moran making direct appeals to them to speak up. Under pressure to reveal more information, detectives have again refused to disclose whether Mr Bragg suffered multiple injuries, saying all relevant material would need to remain sealed until his trial commences on October 25 next year. Despite knowing Mr Bragg was clearly troubled and having struggled with suicidal thoughts for many years prior to the assaults detailed above, police cannot confirm whether or not he revealed them to others who may then have encouraged or assisted him to commit them. This lack of openness occurred regardless of Detective Inspector Jason Walsh' repeated attempts to discuss Mr Bragg's state of mind without revealing any new facts whatsoever, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Instead, he often resorted to deflection, asking repeatedly if investigators wanted Mr Braggg dead rather than helping them bring those responsible to justice. A forensic psychologist employed by homicide squad officers to assess Mr Bragg was unable to give them an accurate assessment of his fitness to plead guilty to murder or manslaughter, according to sources present during interviews conducted between February 24 and April 7 2016. Dr Jack Campbell, founder of Forensic Psychology Services, based in Canberra, concluded former convict Bragg knew right from wrong but chose to act in ways that severely endangered himself andor others. According to police documents obtained via FoIA requests: 'Dr JC Campbell reported Bragg had ongoing difficulties managing his behaviour. As well as the history of anxiety and depression, reports indicated that Bragg expressed interest in dealing drugs, drinking heavily, smoking cannabis daily.' Mr Campbell also observed that Mr Bragg became increasingly agitated and aggressive following revelations about the Hillsong Church scandal and political asylum seekers entering Australia illegally. On numerous occasions he displayed impulsive behaviours such as grabbing or pushing furniture around; as well as harming animals, stealing cars and breaking windows in public places. Mr Campbel noted that ""Bragg appears to exhibit two distinct personalities"" describing the person seen following the attacks on Ms Cook and the male arrested shortly afterwards as controlling and manipulative. Investigators determined Mr Bragg likely committed criminal acts on September 30 2015, four months before the fatal incident when he arrived unannounced at the house of his brother Peter late at night, jumped onto the living room sofa and screamed as though possessed. After a brief conversation, Mr Bragg ran towards the front door seeking attention from neighbours and begging them to call emergency services. Later, he returned to the scene asking briefly and casually why police didn't help him. That same day, Mr Bragg appeared on Facebook using channeled promising its owners two persons alive,meant.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Police forces tasked with implementing strict state interpretations of Islamic morality exist in several other states, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Malaysia. Many - especially those with an affinity with Western lifestyles - chafe against such restrictions on daily life, but others support the idea, and growing religious conservatism has led to pressure for similar forces to be created in countries that do not have them. Here are some places where ""morality police"" forces patrol: Name: Gasht-e Ershad (Persian for Guidance Patrols), supported by Basij militia Who they are: Iran has had various forms of ""morality police"" since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but the Gasht-e Ershad are currently the main agency tasked enforcing Iran's Islamic code of conduct in public. Their focus is on ensuring observance of hijab - mandatory rules requiring women to cover their hair and bodies and discouraging cosmetics. They are empowered to admonish suspects, impose fines or arrest members of the public, but under reforms that come into force this year, will soon no longer be able to do any of these things. Instead, 7,000 undercover Gasht-e Ershad agents will be deployed to report suspected transgressions to the police, who will decide whether to take action. The Gasht-e Ershad is thought to draw a lot of its personnel from the Basij, a hard-line paramilitary unit; it also includes many women. What people think: They are mainly seen as a scourge for urban women - usually from wealthier social groups - who try to push the boundaries of the dress code. This includes wearing the headscarf as far back on the head as possible, or by wearing looser clothing, especially in the heat of summer, although men sporting ""Western"" hairstyles are also at risk. Fear of encountering them has even prompted the creation of Android app that helps people avoid Gasht-e Ershad mobile checkpoints. President Hassan Rouhani has expressed opposition to the Gasht-e Ershad, but Iran's constitution gives him little sway over the security forces. Name: Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, or Mutawa (Arabic for Particularly obedient to God) Who they are: Formed in 1940, the Mutawa is tasked with enforcing Islamic religious law - Sharia - in public places. This includes rules forbidding unrelated males and females to socialise in public, as well as a dress code that encourages women to wear a veil covering all but their eyes. Instead of a police-style uniform, they wear a traditional Saudi robe and keffiyeh. What people think: Although the Mutawa is widely disliked among liberals and the youth, general opinion in the conservative Sunni-majority kingdom supports it. But even conservatives have been irritated by recent high-profile cases deemed excessive or internationally embarrassing, such as an actor being charged for letting fans take selfies with him, or a female mannequin being seized because of its clothing. Perhaps in response to this criticism, the authorities have curbed the force's powers, as a result of which it can no longer arrest or pursue people but can only report them to the regular police. Name: Public Order Police Who they are: The Public Order Police was set up in 1993 to enforce Sharia enshrined in law for Muslims in the then-northern Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir. They have the power to arrest, and suspects are tried - often at speed - in special Public Order Courts; punishments can include flogging or prison. What people think: Many Sudanese resent their activity as an oppressive and often arbitrary interference in private lives, although some - mostly Salafists and other religious conservatives - support their activities. The force is known for shutting down private mixed-sex events, upbraiding women for immodest dress and raiding businesses seen as being in breach of Sharia. It drew international condemnation when female journalist Lubna al-Hussein was arrested and jailed after being caught wearing loose-fitting slacks in public in 2008. Name: Various, usually collectively known as ""religious officers"" Who they are: These are bodies run by Malaysia's federal states - or the federal government for federal territories - to enforce Sharia, which applies to the two thirds of the population who are Muslim. They have the power of arrest, and possible offences range from day-time eating during Ramadan to women and men being ""in close proximity."" Cases are tried by Sharia courts separate from the ordinary court system. What people think: Religious officers have often been accused of overstepping their remit - a situation often muddied by ambiguity about which takes precedence in certain cases - normal legislation or Sharia. In April, religious officers arrested several people during a raid on a transgender group's fundraising event, accusing participants of hosting a beauty pageant, which Muslims were banned from attending by a 1996 fatwa, or Islamic religious decree. The group denies the accusation. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"He faces a number of charges. First, he pulled out of a long-planned trip to Moscow after the US missile strike on a Syrian airfield. It was agreed the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should go instead. Poodle, cried his critics. Next, Team Boris briefed journalists that the foreign secretary wanted to get the G7 to agree new sanctions against Russia at its meeting in the Italian city of Lucca. But Mr Johnson entirely failed to persuade other countries to agree. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there was no consensus new sanctions would help and argued they could push Russia into a corner. Mr Johnson's own view of the Syrian conflict seems to have swerved around like a shopping trolley since he became the UK's chief diplomat in July. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee at the start of 2017, he signalled a shift in UK policy towards Syria. Mr Johnson said the ""mantra"" of calling for President Assad to go had not worked and the military space had been left open to Russia to fill. The Foreign Secretary told peers President Assad should be allowed to run for election as part of a ""democratic resolution"" of the civil war. Now, however, Mr Johnson believes the Syrian leader has to go. How much of this is fair? And what might the episode say about Boris Johnson's standing in Theresa May's government? First, the UK was a bystander to the Trump administration's missile strike on Syria. The government was given a courtesy call to say it was coming but the UK was not asked to be involved. Mr Johnson's trip to Moscow (which would have been the first by a British foreign secretary to Russia for five years) was long planned and quickly binned. I understand Mrs May told Mr Johnson it was his call whether he wanted to go or not. After speaking to Rex Tillerson, Mr Johnson and his US opposite number agreed it was best for one man to deliver a single message to Moscow. Mr Johnson then spent a weekend hitting the phones to other G7 countries trying to get a united position agreed ahead of the meeting in Lucca. In its final communique, the G7 did agree to state the Assad regime had to end. But further sanctions - an idea endorsed by Number 10 - got nowhere. It was clearly a snub to Mr Johnson although government sources insist sanctions have not been taken off the table. On Wednesday, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said other countries were ""less forward-leaning"" than the UK on the issue. Diplomacy is tough. But it may have been unwise for the Foreign Office to suggest sanctions were an ambition when key G7 nations clearly didn't agree. At the weekend, I was told by Team Boris that he was very relaxed about the sniping and criticism being lobbed his way in recent days. And Mr Johnson has provoked quite a lot since he became foreign secretary, largely because of his use of decidedly undiplomatic language. He was taken to task by a Swedish MEP in February for calling Brexit a ""liberation."" A month before that, Mr Johnson warned the French president not to respond to Brexit by administering ""punishment beatings"" in the manner of a World War Two film. Guy Verhofstadt, who speaks for the European Parliament on Brexit, branded the remarks ""abhorrent and deeply unhelpful."" It was several days after President Trump's election that Boris Johnson said it was time for Mr Trump's critics to get over their ""whinge-o-rama"" - a comment I know left some officials in Brussels agog. Mr Johnson is always keen to speak with the swashbuckling pluck of the newspaper columnist he once was. His many fans in the Tory party might love it. But even Mrs May has hinted at exasperation. At the Conservative Party conference last autumn, the prime minister said: ""Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about."" It was a joke. But not many prime ministers joke about their foreign secretary's erraticism. Then in December, Mrs May described Boris Johnson as an FFS - saying that in this case it stood for being a Fine Foreign Secretary (and not the punchy abbreviation for a term of exasperation). When Mrs May was home secretary and Mr Johnson was London mayor they had a prickly relationship. She then beat him to the job he craved. Her appointment of the Brexit campaign's most prominent champion to the job of foreign secretary stunned Westminster and it remains one of the most intriguing political relationships within the government. While happy to clip his wings publicly from time to time, Theresa May also needs Boris Johnson on board as she embarks on Brexit. A force so effective in persuading Britain to vote to leave the EU is not a politician the prime minister wants sniping from outside the cabinet as the negotiating trade-offs begin.",human,5.636363636363637,7.333333333333333,6.061538461538461,5.921875,5.052631578947368,-0.6017005377295704,-0.014521305597654579,-0.3780359939844773,-0.2860114263399147,-0.48646397334443997,0.4546254848179365,-0.25375465577315853,0.2628963524731402,-0.3170194003527334,0.2573994398209198,-0.37755102040816335,0.055397075616742036,0.0886699507389163,0.24979655043374097,0.0,0.0,-0.7492711370262392,0.04152210701475078,0.36365188163491424,0.3394982318627789,-0.32345013477088963,0.3877437275517259,-0.366746698679472,0.43946306541103686,-0.2740259740259741,0.5821419802203984,-0.4653061224489795,-0.05689388423755388,-0.07334183673469385,0.6391703553431468,-0.32551238059909116,-0.15917634141086548,0.3788265306122448,1.3854030188386321,-0.04081632653061239,0.17291495396906406,0.021347537497548356,0.17057220505190504,-0.36281179138321995,0.2800151656180658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.8727272727272726,2.909090909090909,0.09597880847753983,1.4955006611560375,-0.24724075228294412,0.5803691173584679,-0.6410349157934943,-0.6120215284715174

Test results show that it can save users between 30 to 50 percent of the time they spend writing code, while also providing them with more concise and meaningful code. The project is designed to reduce programming errors and improve the overall efficiency of coding in Python. The model uses a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn from a dataset of existing Python code. The model then predicts the next line of code for a user as they type. It can also suggest alternative lines of code that may be more efficient or better suited for the task at hand. This helps users to quickly generate code that is both accurate and optimized. Overall, the autocomplete project is a valuable tool for experienced and novice Python developers alike, allowing them to write code faster and with fewer errors. As the project continues to be developed and refined, it will become increasingly useful and powerful in helping developers create quality code efficiently.",text-davinci-003,0.6363636363636364,0.6666666666666666,0.5384615384615384,0.546875,0.21052631578947367,0.18171761396804798,0.33718106808407855,0.32841312324670396,0.5573749196481594,-0.04837490551776296,-0.2972897343927349,-0.20147649752359612,-0.37912817380520925,-0.2088477366255143,-0.3602878998037952,0.6111111111111112,0.12991986123588345,1.0172413793103445,0.9063187391769175,0.0,0.0,0.04761904761904745,0.030243216688797998,-0.6504307020497724,-0.5419174615277286,0.4265791632485644,0.098923061834967,-0.4673202614379086,-0.3657065190770403,-0.28989898989898977,0.07399846452255161,1.0222222222222224,0.7526238783365047,-0.15624999999999986,-0.12240592212872103,-0.23045534637855883,0.13633658077675598,0.22916666666666666,-0.22326388149803694,0.0512820512820513,-1.317025520537659e-16,0.17433822289664472,0.3051069275546079,-0.38095238095238076,0.43612823664351974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,0.36363636363636365,0.3691951517840001,0.1621154175216542,-0.048691204988120254,-0.2152384574802821,0.12249324585363786,0.22704971727637083

Using a simple iterative algorithm, we compute an importance vector for each training example, representing the extent to which the example contributed to the DNN's final behavior.

Last month, officers released images of two men they want to speak to over the attack. The first man suffered minor cuts and bruising when he was punched by a group of four or five people outside the house before being kicked twice as his girlfriend tried to pull him away. The second man received facial injuries from another member of the group during an attempted robbery which involved punching, kicking and shoving him into a wall. Both victims have since given statements to police. One is currently receiving treatment for stress related issues while recovering in hospital after suffering some serious head injuries. It's believed that this will not impact their recovery. DC Ian McNeill said: ""I would like to thank members of the public who saw what had happened and called us immediately.

Satisfaction with the work of councils has also been declining since 2010 and now stands at only 30 per cent satisfaction in our region, compared with 36-42 nationally - lower than Europe's other big urban areas such as Paris or Madrid (43) but much higher than London (22). But despite this it seems that few people have considered standing themselves for local elections. According to the Electoral Commission just 939 candidates stood out of more than 10 million eligible voters in May 2017. The total number was about half what had actually turned up four years earlier when there were 1,532 candidate lists from 3,700 wards around England. Or put another way five times fewer council seats changed hands on election day last time round than they did 20 years before in 1997. This points towards an airless void which leaves little place for political debate because even if voters know who their representatives are no one is motivated enough stand against them. With so many options available most choose not get involved. And those that do often find out its harder to engage constituents online rather than face-to-face.",opt_30b,0.7651515151515151,0.6666666666666666,0.9384615384615385,1.0,0.42105263157894735,0.26324475827735705,0.03989196262846704,-0.010102868976674659,0.24138870937744383,0.20861678004535117,0.4293141166819343,0.5468647789926174,0.48564883519253993,0.6265432098765434,0.3579318423146798,0.9444444444444446,0.7427118480597287,1.6839080459770113,1.5992763422782184,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,0.6136242127691975,-0.33593673622350884,0.04425623112381151,-0.18594476346732286,-0.8619190167128481,0.6372549019607845,0.886758357040087,-0.28989898989898977,0.07399846452255161,0.1333333333333333,1.4060323514242812,-0.6770833333333333,0.12740600995499218,1.7657423722526198,1.6744626733305814,-0.2708333333333333,-0.008203462040152211,0.35897435897435886,0.601048944913127,0.8716911144832237,0.3795407754352833,-0.38095238095238076,0.7897742624924475,0.1111111111111111,0.31426968052735443,0.0,0.0,1.2181818181818183,1.1818181818181819,-0.5773744896701861,0.5435578840305908,0.18119122355748812,-0.029425850976806615,0.12450043450623906,-0.0027609360801607533

They said PEN - known for defending imprisoned writers - was stepping beyond its traditional role. Islamists stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris in January. Twelve people were killed during the attack, over the magazine's depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. Authors Rachel Kushner, Teju Cole, Taiye Selasi and Francine Prose are also against PEN handing the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo, as they are uncomfortable with the magazine's ""cultural intolerance."" Booker Prize-wining author Carey told the New York Times that the group of writers felt PEN's role was to protect freedom of expression against government oppression. ""A hideous crime was committed, but was it a freedom of speech issue for PEN America to be self-righteous about?"" said Carey. ""All this is complicated by PEN's seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population."" The boycott has been criticised by the author Salman Rushdie, a former president of PEN who was in hiding for years over Islamist threats in response to his novel The Satanic Verses. He said his friends were ""horribly wrong"" and he hoped nobody ever came after them. Charlie Hebdo essayist Jean-Baptiste Thoret, who escaped the attack by arriving late to work, will accept the award on behalf of his colleagues. PEN said it did not believe Charlie Hebdo's intent was to ""ostracise or insult Muslims, but rather to reject forcefully the efforts of a small minority of radical extremists to place broad categories of speech off limits."" It added: ""We will be sorry not to see those who have opted out of the gala, but we respect them for their convictions.""",human,1.5833333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.523076923076923,1.5,1.7894736842105263,0.07595316750120722,-0.09147183462992811,0.004182034907378469,-0.12472954649404755,0.4039769754055468,0.28345596962709513,0.338746199133079,0.4356211507830859,0.28086419753086433,0.2906291961104611,-0.11538461538461542,0.6441865830528503,-0.29045092838196274,0.18513214716167972,0.0,0.0,-0.021978021978022278,0.3734695313788166,1.0309024229444828,1.7459017801297008,-0.015144822363854301,0.2156905259180362,0.6176470588235293,0.16452621047331523,0.41608391608391626,0.15196692608775095,0.030769230769230882,0.3966722103740509,0.0841346153846155,0.2967944217228322,-0.3123506373993251,-0.14764261007967222,0.7932692307692305,2.252224330510322,0.6982248520710058,1.3953967660950501,-0.28162328314073376,-0.1580376406473044,0.7814407814407814,0.5150972733764194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6,0.8181818181818182,-0.09279970380429832,0.815797469445573,-0.400993781388901,-0.12357350520946772,0.2868810082847496,0.32032129478273685

The technology still suffers from limitations regarding range, and refueling infrastructure is limited. However, despite these challenges, many experts believe that hydrogen combustion engines could ultimately prove to be a viable alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel engines. The technology offers several potential benefits, including zero emissions and a nearly limitless supply of fuel. Additionally, unlike electric vehicles which rely on battery technology that can degrade over time, hydrogen combustion engines are highly durable and require minimal maintenance.",gpt-3.5-trubo,-0.007575757575757576,0.0,-0.18461538461538463,-0.140625,-0.15789473684210525,2.416978772330991,1.1149027351667116,2.990384276707405,1.589926522105144,-0.13605442176870747,-0.3862655265981383,-0.7253153910849452,-0.7187579874203586,-0.6006172839506172,-0.6687193443658632,0.5,0.34436533830657273,0.8172413793103447,0.18960239935652323,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999999998,-0.23109185596696832,-0.8705764781281569,-0.8183506703660033,-0.07875307629204267,-0.8699671612702987,-0.3823529411764707,-0.07460933831571184,-0.16545454545454547,-0.13077714446991304,0.40000000000000013,-0.3175256644265489,-0.40625,-0.3494427940075108,-0.25707131596030786,-0.1060660171779821,-0.3374999999999999,-0.026767332592180663,-0.7076923076923076,-0.1378989113186685,0.1046029337379869,0.4695198992442532,-0.20317460317460284,-0.4587176778486071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16363636363636364,-0.45454545454545453,-0.3105472467539213,0.144304525245627,-0.9531702259177282,-2.485545938713188,1.6298546440961388,1.7997308768585112

The ultraprecise measurement found that the particle had a mass seven standard deviations greater than the Standard Model prediction. The discovery of the W boson with a mass seven standard deviations greater than the predicted value confirms that there is new physics beyond the Standard Model. The discrepancy between the measured and predicted values could be due to an undiscovered particle or interactions in the subatomic world that have yet to be discovered. It also strengthens the case for further research into the behavior of particles at the smallest scale. Scientists are now looking for further evidence of this new physics, which could provide insight into some of the unsolved mysteries of modern physics.",text-davinci-003,0.24242424242424243,0.16666666666666666,0.2923076923076923,0.34375,-0.3684210526315789,0.6701770572314415,0.9330831812053654,0.7775869320642207,0.39299051789712025,0.16326530612244886,-0.47532504716360163,0.30221474628539374,-0.132594017637603,0.41049382716049393,-0.16846825360648573,1.3333333333333335,0.08733875454383165,-0.2327586206896551,-0.24838179920233425,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,-1.0063757196350436,-0.33593673622350884,-0.1716519099081343,-0.2625102543068088,-0.3496888591162625,0.6372549019607845,-0.09360607031504105,-0.44545454545454544,0.5267418082440484,-0.5333333333333333,0.7790682453957568,1.71875,-0.12240592212872103,-0.0973754984698136,-0.03033008588991065,-0.6875,-0.33736419179677535,-0.3076923076923077,-0.27172895357090066,0.0,0.0,-1.1216931216931214,-0.871103035351937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.21818181818181817,1.1818181818181819,0.6606617816189764,-0.4461545036851068,2.1250822516001673,-0.6930978967548297,0.5552455732096205,0.7249129145054363

Contractors began work on Friday night. Work was expected to take about three weeks. But the building collapsed on Sunday morning, with the front wall toppling into the street. Parts of the road were closed and residents were asked to stay away from the area. City of York Council said the ""unforeseen structural movement"" had ""made the building unsafe for the contractor to work in."" The authority said there were no injuries or damage to neighbouring properties. The council said it had worked with the contractor to make the building safe and to allow some residents to return to their homes. The site has been secured and the council said the road would be reopened later on Monday. It said the building would be demolished as quickly as possible. The site is earmarked for housing development in the council's draft local plan.",llama_65B,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.6875,0.2631578947368421,-0.21426563984438046,-0.26702676024749444,-0.49710430939062766,-0.4580708772411405,-0.7767470624613481,-0.18683511406646214,-0.5416316232127838,0.026662125797876406,-0.4262065095398425,0.10332902155192127,-0.5909090909090909,0.10829290855661738,-0.3009404388714733,0.02597139685024984,0.0,0.0,-0.32467532467532473,-0.22899743016209836,-0.707611423109093,-0.4926522377524805,-0.30427324931016475,-0.12838916504332118,-0.4518716577540107,-0.025003665532473466,-0.06363636363636359,0.495600548697466,-0.2909090909090909,-0.006574058557867288,0.32670454545454536,0.5028221008345085,-0.38773153027071233,-0.22541172532175757,0.017045454545454527,1.0105831155397889,-0.5734265734265734,-0.15921671391703518,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.7041847041847039,0.06613068278782822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14545454545454545,0.45454545454545453,0.578358014105391,0.03888205103802487,0.33714788081566704,0.8050574173327216,-0.9402572524761522,-0.8536668107479225

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies were based on a technique called carbon dating, which involved detecting the ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12. The ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12 can be used to estimate the age of an organism. However, this method is flawed because it only gives an estimate of the age of the cell, not the age of the organism. Researchers at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute, in conjunction with a team from the University of Basel, decided to re-examine the earlier data using a more recent methodology. The technique used in this study is based on the fact that newer cells will be more likely to divide than older cells. As a result, the telomeres on the ends of the chromosomes will be shorter in newer cells. The new methodology involved detecting telomere length in the hippocampus of both older and younger rats. The researchers found that the telomeres of the neurons in the hippocampus of the younger rats were longer than the telomeres of neurons in the hippocampus of the older rats. This suggests that younger rats have newer hippocampal cells. In the case of the older rats, the researchers found that at least some of their hippocampal neurons were recently created. However, the researchers also found that the older rats had fewer new neurons than the younger rats, suggesting that hippocampal neurogenesis decreases with age. This study suggests that some older adults continue to make new hippocampal cells. In addition, this study suggests that older studies that claimed that adults stop making new neurons were based on a flawed methodology.",llama_65B,1.4318181818181819,1.5,1.5076923076923077,1.484375,0.8947368421052632,0.1554513833399939,0.427990359992446,0.07814389596333779,0.1819097602102155,-0.021379980563654196,-0.1546231654543914,0.111017661900757,0.15666286420562855,0.05864197530864199,0.17932261558919504,1.2142857142857144,-0.15517167488690564,0.19581280788177338,0.5267610930761386,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,-0.34530942827767813,-0.6953584114535243,-0.058245188162531644,0.04922067268252648,0.36683000119072984,0.2731092436974791,0.46455773556163993,-0.14545454545454553,0.87849837253746,-0.7714285714285714,0.18376790478118343,1.160714285714286,1.4698844303643621,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.29464285714285715,0.3251169020148074,-0.5494505494505495,-0.2227987237572473,0.8218801936556107,0.3870848577252577,-0.5714285714285712,-0.4320562448373088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.03636363636363636,1.0,1.2909707728243902,0.10285667580082009,0.8183650082632802,-0.009640524223173387,-0.0044495415277947675,0.19866838098983497

Customers can pay whatever they like for the service, but it will always be at least 6 per month cheaper than what you'd get from your current provider (and usually more). Notably, NYC Mesh also has no contract - the customer only pays when she wants to use her data or if their router breaks. The company doesn't take any part of the money during this time; all revenue goes into funding future projects. In addition, rather than focusing on specific demographics, the network targets everyone who lives within the city limits. This means that even though the vast majority of its customers are black, brown, or low-income people of color, there's nothing stopping white people from using the service too. Now that we're done with our meetup, I want to tell you about something incredible: my friend matthewgellerleman started an organization called NYC Mesh to make sure every person living in the five boroughs could connect to high quality Internet.

A big thank you to Matthew his team - please check them out here for details pic.twitter.com9g7DxLc8ZB - Jhaub (jhaub) September 26, 2018 This kind of community effort shouldn't exist. But NYC Mesh was threatened with shutdown last year because Verizon decided not to renew its partnership with the nonprofit. And while mesh networks were previously used almost exclusively in rural areas, they've now been adopted all over the world since 2017. So today, Jhaub joined a small number of other members of the public to disrupt Public Knowledge's FCC meeting by delivering over 50 letters demanding change to rules that would allow ISPs to interfere with traffic running through these kinds of networks. While some ISPs jumped ship immediately after those protests, others still remain steadfast in supporting net neutrality laws that harm consumers' opportunity to build their own alternatives. Now let's talk about why these efforts matter so much. Let's start with how these communities work. To break down the basics, most nation states operate under three categories - national carriers owned by governments, private telecommunication companies working through government contracts, and independent ISPs built up on free markets. These networks often serve two different purposes - one as a telecom infrastructure (i.e., Voice, Data), and the other as a consumer friendly alternative. Carriers typically charge higher prices than competing providers do for voice services, but offer faster speeds, superior reliability and better pricing for data packages. In contrast, smaller operators such as Bell Canada charge less for both types of services, but won't compete well against larger players unless they give up control of their messaging systems. Mesh networks replace phone lines directly connected between users', enabling millions of people around the globe to bypass major telecommunications carriers altogether. Most cities opt for mobile carrier-style operations because they enjoy economies of scale to subsidize fiber rollouts across entire regions. However, many locales find themselves without access to broadband due to geographical limitations. Others don't trust mobile telcos to deliver adequate levels of safety and security on top of shitty service. As any tech nerd knows, building a solid foundation might seem daunting, but making it easy for anyone in the country to share information is incredibly important. That's where mesh comes in. Instead of having separate phone wires connecting buildings, mesh uses Wi-Fi routers instead to directly link individual devices together. You'll notice regular wifi signals sooner since they aren't forced to go through multiple steps before reaching each device, which saves energy costs and makes connections stronger overall. Many of the same technologies powering mesh networks have come online years ago, thanks to computers and smartphones becoming increasingly powerful (thanks, Moore's law!). An example of such technology are digital certificates, encryption keys and egress filtering proxies - things that enable secure communications between computers and servers via encrypted tunnels. They've become extremely useful in recent times, especially considering hackers - like Cambridge Analytica - have recently stolen personal data from countless American citizens. Imagine being able to verify whether someone visiting your website is actually human... it's pretty far-fetched right? Well put yourself in their shoes - the fact that Facebook claims to hold billions of user credentials proves that this sort of attack isn't inconceivable. Users may feel safer storing sensitive data online, but it's infinitely easier for bad actors to obtain it once inside. That's why businesses that host websites need protection from entry attempts from malicious parties. Egress filters examine requests made by visitors to determine if they should enter protected sections of a site (like content databases or credit card validation interfaces). If someone spoofs their IP address and sends a request trying to gain unauthorized access, then the proxy will reject it before transferring your info to nefarious destinations. Essentially, you're gaining additional layers of defense and control over the way certain web sites function. At worst, proprosing potentiality rate setting expectations of department.

The US plane was flying a routine mission in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk, off Russia's east coast, when the Russian interceptor approached it from the side then pulled sharply in front of it, CNN reports, citing an unnamed Pentagon official. ""The SU-27 conducted a barrel roll from the left side of the aircraft, across the nose of the RC-135, to the right side of the aircraft,"" the official said. The US plane's crew determined that the barrel roll was deliberate and ""demonstrated a level of aerial aggressiveness that is highly unusual, and potentially dangerous,"" the official said, adding that the maneuver endangered the crew and aircraft. The incident comes on the heels of a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft buzzing a US guided missile destroyer in the Baltic Sea, just days after another Su-24 came within 500 meters of the USS Donald Cook destroyer in the same area. Last week the Pentagon condemned those incidents as ""provocative and unprofessional,"" adding that they will not be ignored by the US. ""These actions have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions between countries and could result in a miscalculation or accident,"" Navy Capt. Danny Hernandez said. In November 2015, Russian Defense Ministry officials said that the number of provocations against Russian warplanes by the US has reached ""a boiling point"" in the past few months. A Russian spokesperson said that the US jets intercept Russian warplanes at least once a week, and called the practice ""unsafe"" and ""harmful.""

The total dollar losses have increased from the previous year, with the average individual loss being around 9,475. Romance scammers take advantage of people looking for love online by creating fake profiles, building trust over time, and eventually asking for money or personal information. It's important to stay vigilant and cautious when interacting with people online, especially if they ask for money or seem too good to be true. It's also recommended to report any suspicious activity to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.05303030303030303,0.16666666666666666,-0.03076923076923077,-0.03125,0.15789473684210525,0.5194927664064418,0.12710440440625323,1.1312209002268225,0.8944154792034533,-0.40362811791383235,0.030763484386952384,-0.6044294925707877,-0.07512713870689966,-0.626543209876543,-0.334784310456423,1.1666666666666665,1.0335142583512202,0.26724137931034486,0.4527405525371631,0.0,0.0,-0.21428571428571427,0.9461393611946162,-0.6504307020497724,-0.09443352977320714,-0.032813781788351294,0.2797106356993918,0.0,0.05373208119507178,0.021212121212121196,-0.13559158009808453,0.4666666666666668,1.2622517335870087,-0.7812499999999999,0.21445778116071,0.30186404525642213,0.2602393291521843,-0.18749999999999997,0.6988898940754252,-0.6153846153846154,-0.1808862739441501,0.0,0.39144076998325955,-0.08465608465608436,-0.46198410940677537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727272727272726,0.36363636363636365,-0.29647343079759914,-0.127828390723167,0.4016405455524318,-0.7623038246086038,0.3180251466131745,0.2734575143431869

Apparently, some sketchy code managed to slip through Google's vetting process, causing the extension to be removed. A Chrome extension that automatically suspends tabs that you're not using has been removed from the Chrome Web Store after some unscrupulous code managed to slip through Google's vetting process. In this week's Chrome Release, Google says that it has removed The Great Suspender extension from its online store after discovering that the extension contained code that could be used to circumvent security features built into the browser. ""The developer has removed the malicious code, and we're working with them to help prevent similar issues in the future,"" Google said in a blog post. The Great Suspender extension automatically suspends open tabs that you're not using to free up memory and other resources for the active tab. With the Great Suspender enabled, you won't have to worry about which tabs are open as your browser will automatically free up resources for the current tab when you need them. The Great Suspender was one of the first extensions we installed when we got our hands on Chrome for the first time. It's a great extension that we recommend you install if you're new to Chrome. Unfortunately, the extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store, and its website is down at the time of this writing. However, there are several alternatives you can use. Here are a couple of extensions that are based on the Great Suspender code and work just as well. Tabsuspender TabSuspender If you've already installed The Great Suspender extension, you should remove it right away. As the extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store, you'll have to uninstall it manually. To do this, right-click on the extension's icon in the toolbar and select Remove from Chrome. If you're having trouble removing the extension, try restarting your browser. While the extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store, it's still available for Firefox users. You can download The Great Suspender extension for Firefox from the Mozilla Add-ons website. Want to know which extensions we're using?

Now, a team from the US has shown that this behaviour is linked to bird-to-bird communication via subtle head movements in which individual petrels subtly signal each other's presence when foraging together as pairs or small groups. Dr David Lohmann of Cornell University told BBC News: ""This study provides us with indirect evidence through experiments that some birds are using head postures where they can look at something without moving their whole neck."" The scientists conclude that these signals help the birds quickly assess whether it pays to join up with others - an important survival skill since food resources vary widely across the oceanic islands inhabited by many seabirds (Image 1).

But it is not clear if it will meet the 25 voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo in the 9 July presidential election by itself. The official election results will be announced in May. Some 19,000 seats were contested across Indonesia in Wednesday's polls, including the 560 seats in the national parliament. A poll by Jakarta think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), put the opposition Golkar party in second place with 14 of the vote, followed by the Great Indonesia Movement Party with 12. Islamic parties also appeared to have performed better than expected, together grabbing about a third of the national vote. Support for the ruling Democratic Party of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono - who cannot serve a third term as president - fell by half. His party came in fourth with 10 of the vote. Mr Yudhoyono told reporters that he respected the early results. ""Let's honour the result of this election and be ready to accept new national leadership that will lead the nation to be better,"" the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. CSIS political analyst Philips Vermonte told Reuters news agency: ""Parliament is likely to be very fragmented because many parties have gotten a relatively big share of votes."" The parliamentary polls are key to deciding which parties can field presidential candidates. Parties must either secure 25 of the total vote or 20 of the seats in parliament. Candidates whose parties fail to meet these thresholds must form or enter a coalition before they can run for president. Indonesian stocks fell over 3 on Thursday, after expectations PDI-P would secure enough votes to put Mr Widodo, the Jakarta governor, straight through to presidential polls were dashed. ""We see the possible formation of a weak government with limited ability to push through necessary reforms and policies ahead,"" Bahana Securities research head Harry Su told Reuters news agency. Mr Widodo is seen by many as Indonesia's next president. He told reporters on Wednesday that his party was ""widely open"" to a coalition. ""It is not possible for PDI-P to work alone. We have to co-operate with those having the same platform,"" he said.",human,2.022727272727273,2.5,1.8307692307692307,1.9375,2.1052631578947367,0.186685084623133,0.3186452126997199,0.3217627379088394,0.24702749641638558,-0.33333333333333315,0.32301545609316695,-0.42741799831791427,-0.1945349736526818,-0.35432098765432063,-0.13995168133349714,0.30000000000000004,0.4246214074754898,-0.15775862068965504,0.3946322938933189,0.0,0.0,-0.3714285714285716,0.12856373406638552,0.14366656166154318,0.7491963845909572,-0.07875307629204267,0.3980607232616915,-0.2676470588235295,0.20532136106167662,-0.23545454545454553,0.21667387079297432,-0.5,0.2294953480949655,-0.07812499999999993,0.3176839464423995,0.1621302049522397,0.32315541486566757,0.18749999999999997,0.5252009075666759,-0.24615384615384617,0.15158760435276394,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,0.019047619047619375,0.36553487944744784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3636363636363635,1.7272727272727273,0.1279051000948707,0.6430251459985459,0.18542168454376584,-0.09020613109908504,-0.10595900153540905,-0.00174599261866054

Manager Alan Archibald said: ""Steven has proved over the last few seasons what a valuable part of the squad he is. ""It came as no surprise that Steven had offers from other Premiership clubs."" Lawless, who joined Thistle from Motherwell in 2012, made 40 appearances this season, scoring five goals. Thistle are also waiting to hear from Frederic Francs and Gary Miller after contract offers to the defenders. Caley Thistle, who finished two places above the Glasgow side in seventh, had also made approaches to Lawless' midfield team-mates, Stuart Bannigan and Abdul Osman. Bannigan rejected a new contract at Firhill along with defender Danny Seanborne, but Osman signed a new two-year deal.",human,0.2196969696969697,0.3333333333333333,0.1076923076923077,0.09375,0.47368421052631576,0.5623305544005108,-0.21237465814992076,0.1369049101849723,-0.4432230878704315,-0.32264334305150655,-0.48748069026000596,-0.5550883095037847,-0.40455289159171287,-0.6080246913580245,-0.4084303331752698,-0.3571428571428572,-0.013332948432841213,-0.5541871921182265,-0.3334737381370987,0.0,0.0,-0.4081632653061225,-0.6860620118997042,1.258996947609685,0.22997140342336633,-0.3937653814602134,-0.6988290663682424,-0.2731092436974791,-0.7468144704955009,-0.8454545454545455,-0.2092150071335486,-0.05714285714285716,-0.01628379786460637,-0.37946428571428564,-0.4632221470374289,0.5300009273856997,0.519451232445737,-0.5089285714285714,-0.12783720563750917,-0.2857142857142858,-0.09876011632224552,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456333,0.634920634920635,-0.04537361779622488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545454545454545,0.8181818181818182,-0.251920533414585,-0.07369117773938752,0.786965943495804,0.0655272058526856,-0.2070109633861801,-0.194437279484245

The absence of a natural opening in that barrier could be an advantage too, since you won't need another procedure like brain surgery or a needle injection. The researchers injected tiny nanoparticles into rats with diabetes. They were able to make them enter through the walls of capillaries without damaging any cells lining those vessels. Then they added molecules designed to trigger inflammation inside the brains of each rat, causing one side of its skull to swell up like a balloon - but only on the right side. When these mice reached their peak headache intensity - scores from 2-5 out 5 are common - they stopped showing the symptoms after two or three days.",gpt_j,0.2803030303030303,0.16666666666666666,0.38461538461538464,0.40625,0.0,-0.3548484947366839,-0.07564873625622787,-0.3490014970515623,-0.14401476275252412,0.27664399092970493,0.1453887232461937,0.5612559573871599,0.35029991838906693,0.5833333333333333,0.42905540912568324,-0.5,-1.2999281080197551,-0.2327586206896551,0.2168184208135889,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999999998,0.1133579020050324,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.08203445447087777,0.24729550619591048,0.7647058823529413,0.1778176277508902,-0.44545454545454544,0.276431079068512,0.1333333333333333,-0.09079798535423238,1.5625,1.0938116030079326,0.7011035889826579,1.4061615872137978,0.3125,0.49598080788504934,0.1538461538461537,-0.20272151977280495,0.0,0.0,-0.38095238095238076,-0.3838873035272961,0.16666666666666666,0.372677996249965,0.0,0.0,0.6545454545454545,-0.18181818181818182,-0.456970922576946,0.5711037790769404,-0.7797417184717537,0.23580905063255464,-0.022600827985819315,0.2392159196520881

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Google Cloud has made its first major acquisition under its new CEO, Thomas Kurian. Kurian, a former executive at Oracle, joined Google in November and had announced plans to expand the cloud computing service's availability across the entire US southern region by 2015. Cloud services are becoming increasingly important for developers, advertisers, content creators and other businesses that want their data stored on servers elsewhere. That means there is more interest than ever before from potential buyers of the technology that makes it possible. Clouds also drive competition between tech companies because they spend money competing against each other on hardware and software that enables them to offer extra features or better performance for customers. The company will reportedly pay 1 billion to acquire Dataproc, which develops tools for analyzing big data sets and offers an alternative to Amazon Web Services' Hadoop product suite. The deal was confirmed today when both parties filed documents with regulators. Databricks provides analytics products like Spark and Drill to help developers create apps faster without having to worry about scaling out jobs beyond the capabilities of their own infrastructure. Last year its chief scientist said he'd love to see one day ""a single tool that runs all your data pipelines,"" adding: ""I would say this could be the killer app for clouds."" There have been rumors of such a merger since last August, but talks were only formally initiated after Google decided to move into the hosting business itself earlier this month. It didn't take long for the two sides to reach agreement on terms. ""We're excited to work alongside Apache Software Foundation (ASF) members who commit code for significant contributions over time,"" says Raju Vegesna, DataProc lead engineer at Google. ""In addition, we look forward to working closely with our existing community partners including Datameer, Echosign, Splunk, Talend, Zettlr, and others - as well as users around the world to make open source even more useful through our involvement in the ASF project management team."" Kurian described his vision for Cloud Platforms while speaking at Recode's Code Conference keynote interview session yesterday afternoon. He called for an end to the fragmentation within IT departments caused by the movement toward microservices-based architectures; his solution? A future where you can deploy applications anywhere using Kubernetes and containers hosted on public or private clouds, supported by APIs built atop Google's platform components. With so many different players offering similar solutions now, the key for enterprises isn't just picking the best choice for some particular problem - it's being able to adapt quickly enough so everyone ends up happy. In order to do that successfully, enterprise architecture needs to become less rigid and much more fluid. This doesn't mean throwing out everything completely and starting again, but rather looking creatively at how you might leverage what exists already instead of making things harder on yourself down the road. Read More "" It's no surprise then that Blackberry released its latest handset today. After years of struggling to regain relevance in mobile communications, RIM is hoping its newest phone will bring back consumers to its platform. But BlackBerry 10 won't save the troubled smartphone maker alone - companies relying heavily on those devices need serious answers to questions surrounding security, usability and user experience if they're going to change course. Here are four problems facing every operator, device manufacturer and application developer trying to figure out whether BB10 is worth investing their resources in. Install Base: There aren't many people left who've never owned a smart phone. Even among those who still use BlackBerry phones daily, most haven't purchased any of the recent models. Newcomers to the ecosystem may find buying one tough given the lacklustre choices available right now, but once someone gets past the initial learning curve and trial period, they'll soon begin searching out a provider willing to sell them the device they want. Addressing these challenges will require the likes of ATT and Verizon to convince shoppers new to the ecosystem of its merits yet again, although carriers like T-Mobile have already shown themselves capable of keeping sales numbers high by pushing hard on price points.Read More "" BlackBerry unveiled several events during Mobile World Congress week.

The same complaint against assistant manager Garry Parker, 52, was later withdrawn. Hibs said that Duffy's action of ""aggressively entering the technical area"" was a clear breach of Scottish FA rules. The former Chelsea and Scotland player was fined 1000. After the game, Dundee manager Neil McCann said his assistant was simply trying to calm down a ""disrespectful"" Lennon. Lennon was handed a four-game ban by the SFA in April following an investigation into his conduct after an altercation with St Mirren counterpart Oran Kearney on 13 March. Following the game, the Northern Irishman had criticised the referee's performance. He received a two-game suspension for those comments and a further two games for misconduct. Duffy was appointed Dundee's assistant manager in August 2017.",llama_65B,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.2153846153846154,0.21875,0.5263157894736842,0.6618019805152106,0.5844304924058129,0.6392870980240213,0.408183347178932,-0.6530612244897959,0.033551683157567444,-0.8059059900943836,-0.21609699670069105,-0.8137860082304524,-0.10993256209874253,-0.5,-0.07434413437206487,-0.48275862068965514,-0.2988158729538991,0.0,0.0,-0.5714285714285715,-0.41438256722785866,0.6075451612552819,0.41666658283061536,-0.6453377085042385,-0.5301963564167134,-0.2973856209150327,0.6812928994540316,-0.6010101010101011,-0.8331038849545522,-0.5333333333333333,-0.09079798535423238,0.15625000000000008,0.21445778116071,0.7011035889826579,0.335695317894528,-0.2708333333333333,-0.008203462040152211,-0.7692307692307693,-0.5277022413276352,-0.34867644579328944,-0.22452510468485445,-0.08465608465608436,-0.24522384940232553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.6363636363636364,0.10387408601491883,-0.05462557720061724,0.5432818973656081,-0.2315681679078033,-0.16982639262682478,0.12255004796769842

These customers are selected based on ZIP code and are required to sign up to use the service. Waymo will be deploying a fleet of Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans with sensors, and cameras. These vehicles have been specially adapted to be used as autonomous vehicles. Waymo will be using the early rider program to learn more about the needs and preferences of the public. The early rider program is part of the company's strategy to gather real-world experiences about the use of autonomous vehicles. Waymo will be working closely with these early riders to gather feedback on how the system is performing and what areas need improvement. This early rider program will be an extension of the company's existing test program and will be rolled out to more users in the future. Waymo is not the only company working on self-driving vehicles. Uber has also launched its own autonomous car service and is currently testing it in Arizona and Pennsylvania. The service is currently limited to a few select testers. It is expected that both companies will roll out their services to the general public when they have perfected the technology. This early rider program is a step closer to making autonomous vehicles a reality.",llama_65B,0.9393939393939394,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.03125,0.21052631578947367,-0.0930659035099523,-0.0329050017426484,0.666453136853346,0.3070795702397933,-0.4856096284667714,-0.4148097824264427,-0.338746199133079,-0.2194086012773369,-0.31742640075973405,-0.2069321923490859,-0.11538461538461542,-0.21371013173053957,-0.29045092838196274,-0.01147359534838666,0.0,0.0,-0.08791208791208797,-0.01050341609527432,-0.602047014999578,-0.3404677948044031,-0.28017921373130583,0.01924833666381033,-0.44117647058823534,-0.44856115435378013,0.9545454545454548,0.21295386279302794,-0.12307692307692308,0.4265129905981625,0.22836538461538486,0.1926030105466263,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.21634615384615388,0.5208450388450533,-0.650887573964497,0.01568176920136239,-0.16092759036613355,0.14893827221956163,-1.0647130647130645,-0.8176992169827244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23636363636363636,0.8181818181818182,0.7459616761538872,0.14457806784781818,0.5124484058144405,-0.3251982122758205,-0.021806202305579402,0.048476381276421024

A spokeswoman for the Executive Office said the deputy first minister had complained of feeling unwell. ""Mr McGuinness will be kept under observation and will undergo further medical assessment and diagnosis over the coming days,"" she said. ""His condition is not believed to be life threatening."" Mr McGuinness, 66, was elected as MP for Mid Ulster in 1997. He served as education minister from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2007 to 2011. He became deputy first minister in 2007. In 2012, he was conferred with the title of Freeman of the Borough of the Londonderry. Sinn Fein deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said: ""Martin McGuinness has asked that I pass on his apologies to those who were expecting to meet him on the trip to China and Japan this week. ""He is deeply disappointed that he cannot travel as planned. ""I know that he will make a full recovery soon and look forward to working with him again on the Executive."" Sinn Fein MLA Maeve McLaughlin said Mr McGuinness's absence was a ""huge disappointment."" She said the deputy first minister had been looking forward to the trade mission. ""I wish Martin well and hope that he will be able to resume his work soon,"" she said. Mr McGuinness has recently been criticised by some of his own party colleagues for saying that the Sinn Fein MPs who refuse to take up their seats in Westminster should step aside in favour of other candidates. He had said that the party's abstentionist policy - which was re-affirmed at last year's ard fheis - had been ""frustrating"" and that the party needed ""to be more creative and proactive"" in finding ways to make its voice heard in Westminster. Ms McDonald said the decision to accept the invitation to travel to China and Japan had been taken with the ""full support"" of Sinn Fein's ard chomhairle. ""The trip is of significant importance to the ongoing development of our economy and has the full backing of the executive office and the first and deputy first minister,"" she said. Ms McDonald said she had been ""privileged to represent"" Sinn Fein on several previous occasions in China. ""It is a significant opportunity to promote the north and I will do all in my power to make the most of it,"" she added. The party's health spokesman, Pat Sheehan, said he had visited Mr McGuinness in hospital on Sunday. ""I had a lengthy discussion with him and he is in good form,"" he said. ""Obviously, he is very disappointed that he cannot be here, but he is looking forward to making a full recovery."" During the trip, Ms McDonald will take part in engagements in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. In Beijing, she will lead a delegation to the 7th World Congress Against the Death Penalty, while in Shanghai, she will take part in the China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair. In Tokyo, Ms McDonald will take part in a number of engagements including a reception hosted by the Irish embassy. ""This is an excellent opportunity to engage with a number of business organisations and potential investors,"" she said. ""As well as meeting with a number of business organisations and potential investors, I will also be meeting with the Chinese vice-minister for commerce."" She said she was also looking forward to meeting the Irish community in Tokyo. ""This is the first visit to Japan by a Sinn Fein representative and it will provide an opportunity to learn about the economic recovery of Japan and to raise awareness of the north of Ireland as a potential investment location,"" she said. ""This trip will build on the success of the recent visits by Martin McGuinness and deputy first minister Peter Robinson to China."" The first minister is due to address the opening ceremony of the China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair.

The most recent update shows that more features are being added to the self-driving software, such as stop sign recognition and obstacle avoidance. However, the inner-city streets present unique challenges due to the complexity of the environment. For example, the car must be able to recognize traffic lights, navigate through busy intersections, and accurately read signs. Additionally, the car must be able to handle unexpected events, such as pedestrians suddenly crossing the street or a cyclist riding too close.

The Foreign Secretary added: ""I believe we need more fairness.""",opt_30b,0.030303030303030304,-0.16666666666666666,0.12307692307692308,0.078125,0.05263157894736842,-0.14708317617656758,-0.5317615352904707,-0.12721313602185122,-0.5101661379834351,0.7074829931972787,1.6624677208099545,1.0361648444070648,2.6036071192166936,0.7993827160493827,2.4574248645803056,0.0,-0.6499640540098776,0.14224137931034483,1.1608880527737253,0.0,0.0,-0.1785714285714287,0.5465577424536688,1.2758448386360919,0.10112557037386696,1.058244462674323,0.7731811422955848,0.3823529411764707,0.9681713108875715,-0.09545454545454539,0.0,-0.7,-0.21270186339812386,-0.31249999999999994,-0.24447604278721768,-0.1971853844013725,-0.07105075911806477,-0.18749999999999997,0.0,2.384615384615384,3.3813283620680648,1.4382903388973192,1.1825799865601236,0.28571428571428586,0.6797096403797803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5454545454545454,-0.09090909090909091,-0.9719965731105108,0.6178062850444763,-0.5474943091219354,-0.13673127670389024,0.44819479731174916,0.0868338148385981

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days. Plans for Green Park Station were put forward in the 1990s but have not come to fruition and as such it falls outside London's Underground network (which covers much of Central London). However, the connection between Paddington station - both mainline services from Waterloo and Crossrail trains destined for Heathrow Terminals 4 5 - and Green Park will be greatly improved by 2050 with the Western Gateway scheme connecting this part of West London directly into the Tube system at Cricklewood. The tunnel section between Euston Square GardensFarringdon Road and Liverpool Street stations was opened in 2017; however there are plans to extend further north via Old Oak Common and through the City of Westminster once again along Oxford Street before reaching Farringdon and then Green Park where the line splits off towards Sloane Square or South Kensington. Connections are quickly made from here onwards to destinations across central London including Victoria Station and all other major railway hubs like King's Cross St Pancras International, British Library, Tottenham Court Road, Bank station etc.. This multi-billion pound project includes proposals to build 3 skyscraper blocks up to 49 storeys high above ground level plus extensive pedestrian areas below them that would link these main junctions together seamlessly whilst providing additional office space within reach of many people working in this location who currently rely upon expensive housing costs elsewhere. These developments could accommodate over 10,000 new homes, commercial properties and public buildings! It should be noted that Eastern Gateway does not include any development opportunities nor funding mechanisms set aside yet even though significant engineering works needed to start construction already exist: so we may need to wait until 2030 if ever they get approved! Another recent addition included an extension down towards Islington and Highbury. Little Venice This small cluster of canalside streets is regarded one of Camden's most desirable neighbourhoods thanks mainly due to its mix of conservation and period houses alongside more modern residential apartments built in the late 1970s. For decades now it had been perceived only suitable for professional families seeking 2 or maybe 3 bedroom terraces offering private gardens overlooking Regent's Canal whereas young professionals preferred renting flats nearby since they often didn't want to commit financially to home ownership when they still lived relatively cheaply away on campus while studying abroad. Since 2010 Little Venice became very popular amongst students too looking specifically for 1 bed escape pads close enough to their university campuses without having to commute back each night after lectures finished. In recent years some larger family units did manage to get onto the property ladder living near the canal banks especially those willing to pay slightly higher prices than previously offered to smaller couples and singles asking rents no longer exceeding 1K per month during peak seasons. But despite being located just minutes walk from Camden Town tube station access to several restaurants remains limited compared to local alternatives available closer to Hampstead Village Swiss Cottage Primrose Hill. As well provides plenty of green spaces to explore walking distance away either side of Kentish Town Road although far less options become readily accessible beyond neighbouring Kingsland Road. Some shops do remain open later evening ultimately attracting customers heading out afterwards to bars and nightclubs operating past midnight unlike Hampstead Broadway becoming mostly quiet earlier hence why residents prefer shopping along the wide selection Avenue Road offers instead. Tufnell Park Located west of Angel Finchley Circulars Tufnel Park is arguably best known among UCL students for its sports facilities comprising two swimming pools, tennis courts, football pitches, multiple gyms and fitness rooms shared with University College London whilst the adjacent Tufnell Park tube stop provides direct links throughout the day allowing you to run errands locally rather than making your way uptown catching buses or changing tubes at various points depending how busy things happen to be running. With the latter option coming recommended anyway given the total number of underground lines serving this neighbourhood with plenty more joining here at Wood Lane meaning travelling anywhere else takes little time at all whether visiting another borough inside Greater London or venturing further afield. A growing community called ""New Town Farm"" aims to produce organic vegetables sold directly to consumers every Friday afternoon at a weekly market held near Tufnell Park Station car park next door to the Community Centre opening hours listed online. While a variety of pubs and clubs operate within easy driving distances covering everything ranging from live music venues hosting alternative rock bands playing electronica to jazz quintets performing bluesy tunes right down to traditional Irish folk songs played by virtuoso fiddle players accompanied by flute accordionists enjoying regular outings at weekends or weekdays.

While both burgers are plant-based, their formulas are quite different. Beyond Meat's new Beyond Burger is said to be meatier with a better texture and better cooking qualities. Impossible Foods' new Impossible Burger is said to be closer to beef in taste and smell, and will contain no gluten. Both burgers were introduced in 2016, and since then they have expanded in supermarkets, fast food joints, and restaurants around the world. Beyond Meat will launch the new version of its Beyond Burger on January 15 at the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York City. The new version will launch in retail stores in the U.S. in the coming months. According to reports, it will be sold in the same packaging as the old version, and its price will remain the same. It is said to be meatier, juicier, and to have a better texture and better cooking qualities. Beyond Meat is known to be the first plant-based meat company to successfully scale up its operations, and the company has already sold more than 13 million of its Beyond Burgers. Impossible Foods has announced that it will launch a new Impossible Burger in early 2019, but it has not revealed much more about the burger yet. A company spokesperson did say that the new version will be gluten-free and will be more like meat in taste and smell, and a patent application suggests that it may be more similar to beef in texture as well. Impossible Foods is currently in the process of scaling up its production. The company has already raised more than 400 million to do so. Even if you are not vegan, you should try one or both of these plant-based burgers if you have the opportunity. You may just find that you enjoy them, and if so, you will be helping the environment, the planet's animals, and yourself. Previous articleDo You Suffer From Anxiety?

Customers can choose to either pay an annual fee or a monthly rate, and they'll be able to schedule delivery on days that work for them - whether it's same-day (in some markets) or scheduled for another day within the following week or two. At launch in parts of Dallas; Denver; New York City; Phoenix; San Diego; Tampa Bay, Florida; and Virginia Beach, Walmart will offer more than 160,000 items from national brands such as Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, Charmin and Bounty. The retailer says its offering includes 70 different types of produce including tomatoes, onions, potatoes and berries. And there are plenty of canned goods like soup, beans and pet food too. Walmart is also selling thousands upon thousands of grocery products. Some examples include chocolate bars, peanut butter cups, ice cream sandwiches and tortilla chips. The company plans on adding 2,100 new stores this year to expand its online assortment even further beyond those core grocery categories into other retail areas, such as electronics, toys, home furnishings and sporting equipment - specifically things you might buy if your home was empty after being remodeled. What does all of this mean? For one thing: Competition between Amazon Prime and Walmart continues to heat up across several fronts. It remains to be seen how much consumers actually need these services and what their price points should ultimately look like going forward.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Radical preachers will be banned from posting material online and anyone with convictions for extremist activity will be barred from working with children. Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for those convicted of a terrorism offence, the prime minister has said, as he outlined plans to tackle what civil liberties groups say could become Britain's biggest domestic security threat in decades. A consultation on new powers begins today following months of controversy over whether extremists should have their social media use monitored by police or intelligence agencies and who decides if they are plotting acts of terror against the UK. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is holding an initial roundtable meeting with experts at Westminster this morning ahead of launching the public engagement phase of her review into how extremism can best be tackled within existing laws. The government says it wants to look beyond traditional radicalising influences such as criminality and mental health problems towards other factors including online behaviour, peer pressure, family breakdown and foreign travel. Rudd told BBC Radio 4 that the focus would not change simply because social media was driving ideological currents around the world: ""It doesn't stop us recognising ... after 911 we realised that while physical transport might have been disrupted [online access] wasn't necessarily going to make much difference - and so now we know that you can easily get access to propaganda materials even when individuals aren't physically there. So I think the approach isn't really changing just because technology changes but rather assessing where do things come together?"" Facebook Twitter Pinterest Social media companies will report any posts deemed harmful to British society to the authorities Photograph: Ben PruchnieGetty Images She added that internet firms needed to play more proactive roles. ""We need them to take action sooner and not always wait until something happens before taking steps to try and address it. We want people feeling confident about using these platforms and knowing that all content shared does actually go through some sort of moderation process."" Two years ago the Labour party used a motion passed at its conference to call on ministers to ban or restrict the sites altogether, amid evidence suggesting their role in radicalising vulnerable young Britons had increased significantly since 2007. More than 1,000 suspected terrorists were reported last year alone on Facebook compared with fewer than 100 five years earlier. A Home Office spokesman said that while no firm dates existed for the end of the current legal bans on extremist organisations disseminating material online, that did not mean support for terrorist groups remained lawful. He pointed out that under the 2006 Terrorism Act, offline meetings between suspects and those involved in the promotion of violent ideology were also outlawed and required prior authorisation from the attorney general. Graham Stuart, director-general of Index on Censorship, which campaigns against state censorship, welcomed the proposed legislation but warned against rushing into introducing sanctions this summer without being careful to avoid further damaging freedom of speech rights. He said: ""In response to Islamism and far right nationalism, Conservative governments have placed increasing restrictions on free expression. In 2016 Theresa May introduced unprecedented surveillance measures to monitor people on (mostly Muslim) social media networks, expanded counter-terrorism policing budgets dramatically outside London, imposed a hugely controversial Prevent strategy under which critics claim thousands of Muslims may already face discrimination and racial profiling, restricted protest activities, criminalised journalism, expelled hundreds of imams and mosques and demonised critical academics. This won't solve our problem but it's important that political leaders don't damage freedoms of opinion and assembly and limit debate around questions like religion, race and immigration."" Andrew Brown QC, professor of human rights law at Birkbeck College and co-author of Protecting Free Speech Online, urged caution. ""For the most part there is nothing inherently wrong with banning people sharing abusive representations of religious beliefs but doing so merely as a matter of routine seems contrary to fundamental principles of liberal democracy: namely tolerance, respect and liberty of conscience. There needs to be sufficient safeguards built into the proposals to protect both freedom of thought, belief and practice against arbitrary interference and indeed prohibition itself."" Brendan Barber, policy convener at Compass, called on the government to abandon efforts to treat the issue solely as one of national security. ""There must never again be any attempt to conflate legitimate dissent, criticism of policies or ideas, opposition to state violence or oppression with extreme views, attacks on minorities or actions to promote prejudice, hate crime or threats to others,"" he wrote in advance of publication of the white paper expected later this month. Jill Trevelyan, of campaign group Liberty, said the latest announcement fell short of the promises taken during campaigning for the Conservatives in 2015 to outlaw Islamist preaching in mosques, schools and prisons. She said: ""Today's news reveals little progress on tackling Islamic extremist ideology, but instead shows that successive Tory administrations remain determined to clamp down on individual citizens engaging in peaceful protests for no reason whatsoever within schools, universities with limited options of two bad with the situation.

Those inside the building suffered injuries, including trauma to their heads and hands from broken glass. The cathedral is one of several churches damaged by heavy rains over seven days that has triggered fears about infrastructure following Hurricane Matthew's path across the Caribbean nation earlier this month. Fears have increased after government officials said Tuesday evening there were no deaths or casualties because people either evacuated before the storm hit or took shelter when it passed through. An estimated 250 000 residents fled as the hurricane made landfall just south-west of Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince early Friday morning. They are now living with friends and relatives. Churches also played an important role during times of crisis. There was a time not so long ago where they would be packed full of parishioners and residents showing up to pray. Unfortunately some things we take for granted may disappear forever if left unchecked. That has been proven true once again. While many cities around the world will rebuild their homes and businesses all strong buildings like these should be repaired immediately to decrease chances of future damage caused by storms and other natural disasters.

It features reusable components, styling, routing, global and local state handling, and synchronous and asynchronous computations for Single Page Applications. The project itself was started in 2010 by Justin Frankel due to the lack of suitable languages at that time (mostly PHP). The official website provides documentation on using the editor as well as examples showing how it can be used with several frameworks: ReactJS, AngularJS, EmberJS, etc., but most importantly SassCompass or LESS are supported directly out of the box! There's also plugins available via npm if you want something different than what comes built into the software. This means not only does Mint allow developers to create their own syntax highlighting engines (a very useful feature), but some popular ones already exist such as reactsass which adds support for reStructuredText files - one of many options for the document formatting engine; there's even an ESLint plugin called mintylint allowing usernames in your code to get highlighted when they're written incorrectly, maintaining API style guides. Another option allows you to build custom commands based off the command line arguments passed to the application, adding more functionality without having to add new dependencies through gem installation whenever needed. This library has been around since 2006 so it's had quite a few years under its belt and shows little signs of slowing down any soon. Since switching from Zend Framework 3 to Symfony 2 about 5 months ago we've found this framework to have a much better community compared to other projects like Laravel or Yii. Some of these benefits include consistent releases, transparent contributions, large number of packages contributed back upstream, contribution guidelines, active IRC channel (symfony) where questions can easily be answered during business hours, sponsored ""codefests"" held every month, among others. Bugs reported against core functions typically aren't closed until resolved while contributing patches takes no longer then 30 minutes. Even though not all contributors agree strongly on everything, that doesn't stop them from making things happen quickly because decisions generally come before too long after being proposed. And who knows? Maybe I'll contribute an extension function myself someday...",opt_30b,1.9242424242424243,1.5,1.8923076923076922,1.84375,2.1578947368421053,1.1853355291421555,0.7498944481649595,0.8043092728787666,0.5552471116243798,0.6103012633624875,1.67564236945553,0.5735912531539107,1.4959634890777838,0.48456790123456817,1.3507028780215757,0.5,1.1070710333082323,2.5529556650246303,2.67633600777439,0.0,0.0,0.6326530612244898,2.0595537873356586,-0.32470480887257075,-0.09279429865972762,0.8859721082854797,2.426377260931993,0.2731092436974791,0.5905837425482638,0.05454545454545472,0.34514199258604084,0.08571428571428585,1.2542182290764912,-0.11160714285714288,0.4100859792679829,0.1022442733933043,0.3433934728761656,0.026785714285714354,1.249419187602334,0.5714285714285714,0.8247625114319995,0.8218801936556107,0.3870848577252577,0.634920634920635,1.929924077929935,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.5150787536377127,2.890909090909091,2.5454545454545454,-0.6952490182242999,1.075517977905132,0.12428511350267638,-0.9033628539128534,0.9232826983757,0.8434522763431732

Prime editing can mend about 89 percent of the 75,000 or so harmful mutations in the human genome. This new tool works by using a combination of two existing CRISPR systems, which enables it to edit a single letter in the DNA code without cutting both strands of the double helix. This is a major breakthrough in genetic engineering, as it has the potential to correct genetic diseases without disrupting other parts of the genome.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The visitors took the lead when a clever dummy from the impressive Oscar Dorley set up Maksim Maksimov to net. Defender Joe Shaughnessy headed home Liam Craig's corner to level but Trakai responded with a stunning long-range strike from Vaidotas Silenas. Craig and Graham Cummins wasted chances as Saints failed to find an equaliser. Trakai finished with 10 men as Silenas picked up a second yellow card with eight minutes left, but the visitors held on. St Johnstone made a positive start but Trakai carved out the first opening in the seventh minute. A cross found Aliaksandr Bychanok, but his diving header went wide. The Lithuanian side looked technically accomplished with 18-year-old Liberian Dorley causing Saints plenty of problems, and the visitors took the lead with a fine move in the 14th minute. A low cross into the box found Maksimov, who fired smartly past Zander Clark. The hosts should have equalised when Blair Alston broke through the centre of the FK Trakai defence but he fired straight at the keeper. The rebound fell to Cummins, who had his first shot blocked before blazing his second over the bar. Richard Foster's shot was diverted wide by Arunas Klimavicius, and from the resultant corner St Johnstone equalised, Shaughnessy heading home from close range into the corner. But the joy for the home fans was short-lived as FK Trakai took the lead for a second time. A fantastic strike from Silenas from range flashed past Clark. The noise levels inside McDiarmid Park dipped once more. At the start of the second half Dorley played in Alma Wakili down the left hand side but he fired his shot well wide of the post. Saints manager Tommy Wright brought on new signing Stefan Scougall in the hope of improving the levels of creativity from the home side. His ball from the flank presented Craig with a great chance to equalise, but the midfielder volleyed his shot high over the crossbar. Then an even better chance. From a poor Saints corner the ball fell fortuitously to the feet of Scougall. He lashed in a low shot which beat the keeper, but struck the post. FK Trakai remained a danger, Clark saving well from Maksimov, but St Johnstone had further opportunities. Alston burst through from midfield and engineered a chance at the edge of the box, but his shot was deflected wide. From the resultant corner Saints had the ball in the net from another Shaughnessy header, but the referee blew his whistle for a foul on the keeper. Silenas was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the home side could not capitalise. Alston again created an opening and as the ball flashed across goal, it fell straight to Cummins, but from five yards out the striker's shot was too close to Trakai keeper Ignas Plukas, who blocked the ball with his trailing foot. St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: ""Obviously, the result is disappointing. The second goal is criminal from us. It was a great finish but the ball should never get to him. ""We were sloppy at times in possession but I thought we created enough chances to get back in the game. But we probably didn't do enough over the 90 minutes. ""Every one of the teams in this competition are all probably technically better than us, that's why we can't allow them time on the ball. We didn't get in about them enough in the first half. ""We will have to be better in the second leg and I think we will be better. The two away goals is a huge advantage for them but I wouldn't rule us out.""",human,3.856060606060606,5.0,3.923076923076923,4.03125,3.0,-0.6579769102908393,-0.6498584179861455,-0.9179826588680342,-0.704768439785885,-0.4625850340136056,0.1985498201450903,-0.3478553406223719,0.25289266615166484,-0.3117283950617284,0.21212924016469056,-0.15714285714285725,-0.09872310487797581,0.0886699507389163,0.3039358870312592,0.0,0.0,-0.46938775510204084,0.1919755140627527,0.018992168066131587,0.3117300413864493,-0.43314191960623455,-0.022566800298009726,-0.07647058823529419,0.2928453276295445,-0.8854545454545455,0.19444277511431898,0.17142857142857149,0.235853640153305,0.4776785714285716,0.7805467559589584,-0.25707131596030786,-0.03607740326116222,-0.3803571428571428,0.10356227743120641,-0.10109890109890114,0.38501284244252926,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515511,-0.5587301587301585,-0.23712342044742357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9272727272727272,2.1818181818181817,0.3402031005299774,0.9663877082162529,-0.02149888659206401,1.0383210897446533,-0.9419822442219699,-0.8208556981327361

It is the first year that the prize has been open only to writers from Britain and Ireland - previous winners included Americans Philip Roth (2003) and Cormac McCarthy (2006), as well as Australians Richard Flanagan and Helen Garner. ""Film scripts are almost always based on books,"" said Saul Zaentz, producer of American Beauty whose script was written by Christopher Nolan after he read author Alan Ball's 1997 novel about an unhappy high school English teacher driven into adultery and murder. ""The real competition for film audiences comes not so much between feature films but between TV miniseries."" In one example, British television network BBC America decided last month it would air U.S. cable channel HBO drama True Detective straight after airing its finale later this summer rather than wait another 12 months until next January or February when both seasons will be available on DVD. Last week ITV announced plans to broadcast Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire simultaneously across nearly all of Europe over Christmas, breaking new ground in cross-border telecasting. In India, movie director Mira Nair hopes her upcoming adaptation of Vikram Seth's fantasy romance A Suitable Boy will interest viewers outside the subcontinent who have never heard of the book before she began filming last September. She says the long gap between publication dates works out better logistically for filmmakers too since they know exactly where their project stands at any given time compared with having to go back to publishers every few weeks while shooting. In Hollywood there typically is no more than six years difference each way between the release date of a finished film adapted directly from a source material like Dr Seuss' children's story Green Eggs And Ham, which hit theatres nine days ago, versus other films based purely upon screenplays such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator released 14 years earlier. THE BIG SCREEN GONE HOME? Some critics see little point in publishing fiction anymore now that cinematic versions can come along just two or three years afterwards whereas authors are often left waiting up to half a lifetime following the original sale if studios do decide to get around to making adaptations. This winter brought George Orwell's Animal Farm and Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey respectively to big screens fresh off bestseller lists; neither took particularly good box office numbers though some say sales spikes usually occur nearer to releases. In recent times major hits garnered via novels turned movies include Tom Clancy's The Hunt For Red October, JK Rowling's Harry Potter series starring Daniel Radcliffe, Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman something critics argue could hardly happen today without the guaranteed return already assured from ticket sales. This helps explain why many top-selling literary titles these day tend towards adventure stories aimed at teenage boys and girls or crime thrillers featuring police detectives working within established fictional universes popularised through comic books and video games. Video game maker Electronic Arts Inc counts bestselling thriller writer James Patterson among its list of celebrity brand ambassadors including Justin Timberlake and Michael Jordan helping sell millions of copies of his work across multiple platforms. He recently signed a deal giving him 90 percent royalties and the chance to option future rights for development into motion pictures worth 1 million per title plus 10 percent participation fees according to Forbes magazine. But Sierra Burgess Is a Loser creator Shannon Hale argues against segregating literature into genres saying successful titles should transcend labels simply because readers want them to succeed regardless, adding however: ""I think we're living in somewhat dark ages right now... People don't put money toward literature unless you've got characters wearing capes coming down the stairs."" Publishers remain optimistic despite mounting concerns about piracy eroding profits further still even with consumers increasingly willing to pay close attention to details involving production costs versus potential returns. Patrick Spence, managing editor of Little, Brown Book Group, part of UK publisher Hachette Livre, denies stiffening ebook prices were related solely to ebooks becoming less profitable due largely to increased pricing power enjoyed by Amazon itself. Spence cited relatively strong advances paid to debut authors David Nicholls and Donna Tartt amongst others worldwide alongside growing demand especially for nonfiction titles citing Jon Ronson's 2015 billion dollar podcasting industry expose Them as evidence positive change really might lie ahead. But Anthony Barnett, professor of media theory cultural studies at London College of Communication, remains doubtful overall pointing to ever accelerating changes wrought throughout global economies in general leading societies astray in ways unlikely to reverse themselves anytime soon let alone allow anyone else to catch up.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Most smartphones sold today have large displays and this presents new challenges and opportunities for app makers and designers. The first iPhone was designed for comfortable one-handed operation, but larger phones have made this more difficult, especially for users with smaller hands. For app makers, this means they need to consider the ergonomics of their design and make sure important buttons and features are accessible with one hand. However, larger phone displays also offer more space for creative designs and innovative features. App makers can take advantage of this by incorporating larger images, videos, and more complex layout options.

His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down the ward and you'll notice something different about him. Joshua is one of a growing number of children who have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder. Joshua has had to adjust to a new life since his diagnosis. He's restricted from eating certain foods, has to take medication every day, and often has to go for regular checkups. Despite this, he remains cheerful and resilient, determined to make the best of his situation. His parents are also learning how to cope with the changes that have come with his illness, but they have found solace in knowing that there is support available for them and their son. The hospital team have been an invaluable source of information and advice while Joshua undergoes treatment, and they have been there to provide emotional support too. Joshua is still living with Crohn's disease today, but he no longer lets it define him. He has found his own way of managing his condition, and is making the most of the extra time he now has to explore his interests and passions. His outlook on life is inspiring, and serves as a reminder that even when faced with adversity, it is possible to stay positive and find ways to cope.",text-davinci-003,1.053030303030303,1.0,1.4307692307692308,1.390625,0.8421052631578947,-0.6342924530586973,-0.39497676957492106,-0.43898867917475304,-0.18558835855206368,0.1261595547309831,-0.05793650616048968,0.7300252312867956,0.2993403567318231,0.6343995510662177,0.327985172157844,0.40909090909090917,0.10829290855661738,0.24451410658307218,0.5205355608660904,0.0,0.0,-0.2467532467532469,-0.1546033023332247,-0.621840341520112,-0.5114247493693049,0.5101051532552762,0.6083542668143294,-0.24331550802139054,-0.2372897307125618,0.7000000000000001,0.7071794213176622,1.3454545454545455,1.4672587431516089,-0.35511363636363624,-0.3780120654580977,-0.38773153027071233,-0.22541172532175757,0.5624999999999999,0.2729784737909084,1.4405594405594402,1.2905233363827813,0.4754678806272129,0.4286388362165403,-0.13852813852813817,-0.6033569742615397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9272727272727272,0.45454545454545453,0.17906877399767593,0.6184711116973299,-0.3280497342470184,0.3767816647364999,-0.19445611566689316,-0.10226363295934636

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Regular Expressions (regex) are a tool for manipulating strings. Regex can sometimes take an extremely long time to match or fail on some strings. This can be exploited by malicious users to exhaust the resources of your machine and cause it to crash, causing you system wide failure. To prevent this from happening, use regex as little possible in production code. Instead refer to Regular Expression Syntax Cheat Sheet while developing software that uses regular expressions. The cheat sheet identifies which characters have special meaning when performing string operations using regular expression syntax.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Jordan Edwards, 15, died after Officer Roy Oliver fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs. Police initially said the vehicle was reversing ""in an aggressive manner"" toward officers, but police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver was fired and charged with murder on May 5, the same day as Edwards' funeral. Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson announced the indictment Monday, saying her office ""will prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law."" ""I have heard the community's cries for justice and accountability, and we are committed to a fair and thorough presentation of this case,"" Johnson said in a statement. Evidence presented to the grand jury was both forensic and testimonial, and included statements from several officers who were on the scene, Johnson said. The indictment was issued without a recommendation of a specific charge by prosecutors, allowing the grand jury to consider the more serious charge of murder, her office said. Johnson became district attorney in January, after predecessor Susan Hawk stepped down to get treatment for depression. Oliver's attorney, Jim Lane, did not respond to multiple phone messages seeking comment. The Dallas County Sheriff's Office, which is conducting the criminal investigation into Oliver's actions, said in a statement Monday that its probe was still ongoing and that no additional information would be released until the case is presented to a judge. The Edwards family and their attorney, Lee Merritt, said they were pleased by the indictment. ""This is the first time in history that a Dallas County grand jury has indicted a police officer for killing a black child,"" Merritt said. ""We're still saddened by the loss of Jordan. We're still saddened by the cowardly nature in which he was killed. We're still saddened by the fact that his brother had to watch him die. But we're grateful."" The Edwards family filed a federal civil lawsuit against Oliver and the Balch Springs Police Department in May, alleging Oliver ""unjustifiably and recklessly"" used deadly force. The family's attorneys said Edwards' death was part of a pattern of violence by police, particularly against people of color. Edwards' father, Odell Edwards, said Monday that the family's ""faith in the justice system is restored."" ""This is the first time that I've seen that the Dallas County justice system will treat African-American young men fairly and we will continue to monitor the situation and continue to push for justice until the end,"" he said. Prosecutors, who are required by law to present cases to a grand jury when a police officer is involved in a fatal shooting, did not have to bring charges against Oliver. But Johnson, a black woman who grew up in Dallas, has pledged since she was appointed that the community would see ""equal justice"" under her watch. Oliver has also been indicted on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant related to the shooting, Dallas County District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Brittany Dunn said. The second count is related to the shooting of the teenager's vehicle. Edwards and his two brothers and two other teenagers were driving away from an unruly house party in Balch Springs late April 29 when Oliver opened fire on their vehicle with a rifle. The bullets shattered the front passenger-side window and struck Edwards. Edwards' 16-year-old brother was driving. The Dallas County medical examiner's office ruled his death a homicide. Oliver, who joined the Balch Springs department in 2011, was fired days after the shooting for violating department policies. Oliver was indicted last year on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in an unrelated incident, court records show. Oliver was accused of displaying a gun during a traffic accident. Oliver pleaded not guilty to the charges in May and was released on bond. The district attorney's office said the new indictment ""will have no effect on the pending case."" A message left for Oliver's attorney in the aggravated assault case was not returned Monday. Johnson said that after the shooting she spoke with Edwards' father, who ""pled for justice."" ""As district attorney, my job is to seek justice on behalf of victims of violent crimes,"" Johnson said in a statement.

Det Ch Supt Tom Richards of Kent Police said it also diverts resources away from policing. But Ian Puddick, a former City worker who became a hunter after being falsely accused of harassment by his wife, said it is sometimes the only way to catch offenders. He said police are ""overwhelmed with reports of online child abuse and don't have the resources to investigate all cases."" Mr Puddick, who now works as a consultant in cybersecurity, said the police needed to step up their game and ""get up to speed with technology and work with online vigilantes."" ""They [police] can't be seen to be proactively working with vigilantes so instead of working with them they try to shut them down."" He said he ""makes sure I'm in a public place"" when meeting an alleged predator. ""I tell people where I am going to be, I always have a hidden camera running and have a mobile phone with me at all times."" He added: ""There are some very dangerous people out there."" The force said paedophile hunter activities can hinder investigations and lead to offenders walking free But a spokesman for Kent Police said that while it understands the frustrations of groups and individuals who want to catch potential paedophiles, police operations ""have been jeopardised when individuals have used online identities to arrange to meet people, in an attempt to identify offenders."" The spokesman added: ""In these cases it is the online vigilantes, not those they aim to expose, who could end up in court. ""Those who undertake online 'stings' put themselves in physical danger, and often do not realise they are committing criminal offences themselves and could end up with a criminal record."" Det Ch Supt Richards said police forces are ""working hard to educate children about online safety and make sure that they know how to protect themselves,"" as well as working to prevent offending in the first place through ""early intervention and rehabilitation."" He added: ""We also have dedicated teams of detectives who investigate these offences and bring those responsible to justice. ""This is why it is so important that people don't take matters into their own hands, but report any suspicions they have to the police so we can investigate and ensure that the offender is put before the courts."" The spokesman also said that online vigilantes who expose suspected paedophiles could be prosecuted themselves under a number of offences, including intimidation, assault, and the unlawful disclosure of personal information. In 2015, self-styled paedophile hunter Stinson Hunter was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of assault for a vigilante attack on a former teacher in Newcastle. The judge, Recorder Ben Nolan QC, said he was concerned about the rise of ""self-styled paedophile hunters"" and criticised Hunter's ""vigilante mentality."" The former teacher, who was attacked, was later found not guilty of child grooming and sexual assault. Seven forces in England and Wales were contacted for this story. Only Kent Police responded.

Clearing is a process that allows students to apply for courses which still have available places. As a helpful assistant, I suggest that students who find themselves in this situation should do some research on universities and courses they are interested in before results day. This will help them to be prepared and make quick decisions if they need to go through clearing. Additionally, students can contact universities directly to inquire about their available courses and entry requirements. Furthermore, students should also consider alternative options such as taking a gap year, resitting their exams, or enrolling in a vocational course.

The second concept is a phone that looks like an iPhone X, but with a foldable display that can be used as a tablet when the phone is folded. It's not clear when the new designs will be revealed, or even how far along the development of the Galaxy F is.",t0_11b,0.5681818181818182,0.16666666666666666,0.8461538461538461,0.921875,0.21052631578947367,-0.6233723427830211,-0.8099528961449294,-0.767261728403101,-1.0237689650213802,1.1383219954648525,0.33911926460523595,1.8564620128959912,0.4750802922347043,2.0092592592592595,0.5200401221009481,1.3333333333333335,0.6012090343208067,1.2672413793103448,1.7045281346312686,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.36026794332946405,0.13580421251588662,-0.2560423270990787,0.4265791632485644,0.14606195720780302,0.3823529411764707,-0.8128783884893422,3.2878787878787885,0.18389416449910878,1.4666666666666666,-0.0907979853542322,1.71875,1.7719373710493758,0.1022442733933043,0.0,-0.4375,-0.07576923428973634,0.9230769230769228,0.6479986704144102,0.7845220030349013,0.30832099939730523,-0.23280423280423276,-0.871103035351937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2545454545454545,1.4545454545454546,0.9956146079383148,-0.3549055055591084,2.2153326583347916,0.23764206516762637,0.4086030481802225,0.14752139751678367

The aircraft doesn't use any groundbreaking technology, and it looks similar to existing jet planes except for the fact that there's no pilot in control of this vehicle - instead Aevum has created software that allows these drones to fly autonomously as long as they have GPS coordinates at hand. While flying commercial jets or even passenger cars might sound like some sci-fi fantasy from decades ago (and we're still not quite sure if self driving vehicles are going to be all that safe), autonomous flight capability isn't exactly something new either. In 2019 alone Japan Airlines ordered 50 fully automated EHang 184 personal aerial vehicles capable of carrying one person each over short distances, while Boeing developed its own drone called the Phantom Express which was designed specifically to deliver packages within cities without needing human pilots onboard. There've also been lots more companies working on larger scale unmanned drone projects such as Uber Air, Amazon PrimeAir, and Airbus' Vahana concept car. Basically, autonomy could soon become much less expensive than having regular people controlling airplanes; but will anyone actually want their next air travel experience to feature sleeping agents rather than humans? Read ahead to find out... The future may see us zipping around above our heads using autonomous drones but what about below them too? Drone maker DJI revealed today a prototype magnetic levitation system that would allow ""devices"" ranging anywhere between 20 grams up to 2kg to hover freely through midair - meaning you wouldn't need wires running everywhere just so your equipment had electricity flowing into it. This isn't necessarily brand news since we saw prototypes floating around earlier last year when Samsung showed off a very similar idea during CES 2020, however now that DJI has come forward with details regarding how it intends to make good on those concepts, things suddenly seem far closer than ever before:",opt_30b,1.696969696969697,0.8333333333333334,1.676923076923077,1.640625,1.1578947368421053,0.5170327972775091,-0.36545758271617945,0.4195440283823718,0.33118822516692525,1.5782312925170061,1.6188405462187503,1.476534903280067,1.4563077070800192,1.369753086419753,1.5280609746682132,1.4,1.2639308788625387,4.867241379310344,3.9478956442569304,0.0,0.0,1.1714285714285715,1.418325349641607,-0.16296505501906383,0.43111276312850993,1.575061525840853,2.0134941927773857,0.6117647058823529,0.23410093506217447,0.8145454545454546,0.6334592775009203,0.0,0.5185986582895797,-0.31249999999999994,1.062602645307328,0.34178799962904566,0.8154967974795663,1.1624999999999996,1.3773206387619974,1.2307692307692306,0.5265873629625215,1.0460293373798686,1.3471506281091266,0.15238095238095262,0.12562401677073373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.8,1.8181818181818181,-0.7580661161111261,1.1193584591687877,-0.17544679069210964,-0.9750299345773289,1.4580367362815505,1.2950416153720785
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The Comma Two is a device that can add assisted driving features to cars. It operates at level two autonomy. The device requires drivers to pay attention to the road and take back control when necessary, rather than just passively having their vehicle steered in certain directions or slowed down when needed. Tech companies are working on another kind of assistive technology designed to keep you safe while helping your car stay autonomous: a way for drivers to tap into ""level three"" self-driving systems before they become truly handsfree vehicles. Under this system - developed by Microsoft and Sensible Systems (formerly known as Mobileye) - an app would allow people with real time feedback from a human driver to steer or brake their own automobile if need be, should something unforeseen happen during Level 2 operation. It might sound like science fiction, but it already exists. For Uber users who use its ride sharing service in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, any trip booked through the company will include optional ""undriving assistance,"" which means that someone else drives behind them instead of the car doing all work itself. Called Pilot Assist, the feature was initially announced as a beta program back in 2014. Now it has been upgraded and made available more widely. Uber isn't alone. Waymo, Google's parent company, launched its own version called ""Waypoint"" last summer after years developing such tech internally. And Ford Motor Company unveiled its semi-autonomous Fusion Hybrid earlier this month equipped with the same steering aid powered by Nvidia AI software, though without direct oversight from a passenger. Other automakers have also joined in; Mercedes Benz offered similar functions in 2016, and Volvo plans to release one this year. This week BMW says it'll start shipping those new cars next year. But aside from piloting their own cars, we're still waiting for a true driverless future. Though some form of automated systems may appear soon enough, right now there aren't many commercially viable options. In other words, don't expect to see fully functional robot chauffeurs anytime soon. But if you want to participate in fundamental tests of whether a machine could feasibly replace a person behind the wheel, these are the best things you could do today. This article originally appeared on Engadget under the headline ""What happens when humans give up total control over their machines?"" You can read it here As a public bus plows along Interstate 70 near Austin, Texas, a large gray box van passes to within inches of the side of my bus. I glance to the left to make sure nobody is hurtling across lanes to collide headlong with us, then check my blind spot and flip off the white mobile phone hanging around my neck. Then the ambulance pulls ahead of our vehicle and suddenly the rest of the world goes blank except for what appears to be a long black bar separating me from the front windshield. My brain begins flashing danger signs about how hard it'd be to compensate after hitting something solid again because... well... I'm supposed to be dead. This is Autonomy Awareness Training, ATD's latest initiative aimed at building better algorithms so developers know how much autonomy the average test subject expects out of his or her vehicle. After completing roughly 10 minutes of training, each participant got hooked up to monitors measuring heart rate, glucose levels, skin temperature, blood pressure, skin conductivity and EEG activity using Empatica E4 sensors. They wore special glasses with embedded light emitting diodes (LEDs), allowing researchers to monitor how much visual information participants were receiving at different times throughout the day. A few weeks later, they checked themselves again. Those little screens look pretty good to me, but it turns out that there's probably nothing physically wrong with getting confused while surrounded by flawless safety gear. Instead, we've learned that giving people only partial sight results in less effective data collection compared to full vision conditions, likely due to distraction. That's important info for programs hoping to build cars capable of reading text messages safely. It's not really useful information for anyone trying to reach an emergency response team once they realize they forgot their wallet inside their shirt pocket while jogging home early. Or maybe it is; even a half second delay between these kinds of warnings and a crash could save lives. Plus it feels kinda cool looking at those lights moving past your face too, right?

We both work full-time jobs so now our weekends are scoured for every spare hour we can muster."" The next day he commenced negotiations with landowners regarding the purchase of the site, eventually buying the entire plot from one owner with all three boundaries intact at 8500 each. And now here we are, almost ready to start building the largest bronze statue ever created in Northern Ireland...the Waking the Dragon project will take around six weeks to complete, beginning in May when scaffolding goes up and finishing mid August when the completed pieces will be unveiled to thousands who might otherwise forget its existence during the rest of summer. A legacy indeed! The family's plans include a ""gardensculpture zone"" (an Old Growth forest) comprising 10,000 sq metres along with picnic areas, playgrounds, dog walks and educational trails featuring public artworks. This will not only benefit children and adults alike but also help protect the environment through environmental education. An eclectic mix of native plants such as bluebells, primroses and wildflowers will cover vast swathes of grassland while even older redwoods will grow amongst beautiful mature oaks in the wooded part of the grounds. There will also be hedgerows along pathways, seating areas and lookout points across the whole estate. All new housing development will surround the statues making it totally invisible within ten minutes walk away. Two further sculptures are currently under construction, Rhapsody and Cwmllynfell. These will sit alongside each other and form another triangle pointing towards the Welsh mountains with windsweeping views over Anglesey and Holy Island. Work began last year and should be finished early September.",gpt_j,3.3181818181818183,2.6666666666666665,3.353846153846154,3.46875,2.3157894736842106,0.20097706097620424,-0.1823028185919818,-0.11174783716528319,-0.05761958440743148,0.6556527372853903,1.5054417334280443,0.690776562938043,1.2362159050861061,0.7500000000000002,1.4933372762555834,0.45238095238095233,1.0211657379063575,1.6600985221674875,1.6929964212275297,0.0,0.0,0.32653061224489793,1.1364266575275785,-0.021442770397245223,0.6175738597098865,0.8531583264971287,1.9206390517145007,0.3459383753501402,1.0574335109871948,0.2878787878787879,0.7543629550913092,0.6095238095238096,0.9872608305421106,0.24553571428571447,0.4547366647480956,0.35889826578874157,0.7434238069763043,-0.008928571428571395,1.192353837192816,0.5054945054945053,0.956084991836334,0.29886552496567675,0.2741314697916576,-0.12698412698412692,0.5486665548416138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.3090909090909095,2.909090909090909,-0.5585780402603588,1.4412688197641699,-0.20164669365183804,-0.12844088157455935,0.4165173176238117,0.22510721811277437
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Morton are well placed to secure a Championship play-off spot after Tuesday's 1-0 win at Raith Rovers. They were one of only two sides to earn a point at Ibrox last weekend, but could only draw at home to Ayr last time out. The hosts have won their last three home matches though, and they'll be looking to continue that trend against a team that has already secured their Premiership status for next season. Killie drew 1-1 at home to Hibs last weekend, but they haven't scored in their last four games, and their defensive record has been poor recently. We're not expecting too much to happen in this one, and under 2.5 goals looks the way to go. In-form Celtic can secure their seventh consecutive Premiership title if they beat Hibernian in Saturday's lunchtime kickoff. The Hoops have been scoring goals for fun this season, and they put five past Rangers in last weekend's Old Firm Derby at Celtic Park. The Hoops have won their last six league games, scoring at least three in each. Hibernian are a decent side, but they are a long way off Celtic's level. Neil Lennon's side have won their last two league games, but they have been heavily reliant on strikers Jason Cummings and Simon Murray. They may find goals hard to come by here, and Celtic look well worth backing at 815. The final game of the weekend sees Aberdeen host Ross County, and the Dons will be confident of getting back to winning ways. Derek McInnes' side have drawn three of their last four, and they have lost their last two at Pittodrie. Ross County have had a mixed bag of results in recent weeks, with defeats to Motherwell and Kilmarnock coming either side of wins over Hamilton and Dundee. Aberdeen look a little short at 47, and we like the look of both teams to score at 11. Dundee have won just one of their last 16 games, and they are in serious danger of being sucked into the relegation dogfight. Hamilton have been in decent form since the start of the year, and they have picked up good wins over Rangers, Motherwell and Ross County during that time. Martin Canning's men are starting to show the kind of form that they were expected to produce at the start of the season, and they are the clear favourites to take all three points here. We're backing a 2-0 win for Accies at 172. Motherwell have been in poor form since the start of the year, and they are without a win in their last six games. The Steelmen have slipped down to seventh in the table, and they are in real danger of missing out on a top-six finish. Dundee are only a point behind in eighth, but they have won just one of their last 16. Both of these sides look like they could do with the international break right now, and we fancy a low scoring draw here. St Johnstone have been in good form since the start of the year, and they have lost just one of their last eight games. However, only two of those matches have ended in Saints victories, and they are without a win in their last three. Rangers are five points clear at the top of the table, and they have lost just once in the league this season. The Gers have won their last three games, and they have kept clean sheets in each of those. The visitors have scored 11 goals in their last three away games, and we're backing them to win 2-0 here. Aberdeen are four points clear of Rangers at the top of the Scottish Premiership, and they have won their last three games in all competitions. They travel to Hamilton Academical on Saturday, and the home side have failed to score in three of their last four games. The Dons have kept clean sheets in six of their last seven games, and they have won their last six away matches. They are a massive price to win to nil here, and we're backing them to do so at 115. St Johnstone have been in good form recently, but they were beaten 2-1 at home by Hamilton Academical last weekend. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last seven games, and they have failed to score in their last two. Ross County are up to sixth in the table, and they have kept clean sheets in two of their last three away games. They have also failed to score in two of their",llama_65B,4.9772727272727275,5.166666666666667,6.476923076923077,6.421875,4.105263157894737,-1.2057326531116372,-1.523850458046576,-1.4631992297189376,-1.2509259744195904,0.03099017384731671,-0.24749954284109402,0.78431922250257,-0.020193819347230475,0.7273662551440327,-0.03682461325832828,0.4722222222222223,0.0868687335706374,0.39224137931034475,0.4998031724008182,0.0,0.0,-0.511904761904762,-0.20684294184510685,-0.08696234661105011,0.1193436628256593,-0.47306535411539524,-0.1776711722745017,0.2973856209150327,-0.07513343613369466,0.876767676767677,0.030520252935999515,0.7444444444444445,-0.0024519370958437803,-0.234375,0.4096450973324813,1.3665028285263843,0.5720662937203354,0.10416666666666662,1.0793792809381184,0.6666666666666664,0.18760595194567878,-0.30509189006912824,-0.17942876417568196,-0.3562610229276895,-0.732179031774304,0.1388888888888889,0.34583054438857597,0.0,0.0,1.3818181818181818,2.5454545454545454,0.8484584430783034,1.0316486992895473,0.3814060667219778,1.3042498593658691,-0.8759848670911728,-0.7687402375366448
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. US President Barack Obama, in his last days in office, on Wednesday ordered the transfer of 221 million (204 million euros) to the Palestinian Authority (PA) that had been frozen by former Secretary of State John Kerry. Obama's move reportedly came at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. The Israeli premier had opposed the transfer in the past, saying the PA was supporting terrorism. The US State Department said it had released the money to the PA shortly before Kerry was to deliver a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The transfer, which was the last of the funds appropriated by Congress for the PA in 2015, had been delayed for months due to Israeli and US opposition. The Obama administration has been feuding with Israel over the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. While the administration has said that the expansion of the settlements is hampering the peace process, the Israeli government has rejected the claim. However, the Israeli government has accused the US of actively working to promote a UN resolution against the settlements. On Wednesday, Obama's National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Ned Price told reporters that the US administration had worked hard in the last eight years to facilitate a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. He said despite the best efforts, the two sides had failed to reach an agreement. ""We worked to preserve the possibility of the two-state solution, which is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" Price said. The spokesman, however, noted that the administration still hopes that the two sides will be able to reach an agreement. ""We will not try to dictate what a fair and viable solution looks like,"" Price said. Meanwhile, John Kerry was to deliver a speech later on Wednesday to lay out his vision for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The speech is expected to be one of Kerry's last major addresses on the Middle East peace process.",llama_65B,2.0,2.0,2.0615384615384613,2.171875,1.9473684210526316,0.09762157710834088,0.6610041906016212,0.12104266497228552,0.3858967932910726,0.08323329331732662,-0.023181764383607684,0.18285261960124652,-0.0104435710215439,0.265613652868555,0.22063717222479598,-0.08823529411764697,-0.2970812075077838,0.16430020283975652,0.29227863723112685,0.0,0.0,-0.3613445378151261,-0.46772921043367993,0.7555423216441117,1.2033616555992013,-0.24899869709984077,-0.25455660809566705,-0.06747404844290668,0.5863946863635111,0.13101604278074888,0.1328956060894176,-0.49411764705882344,0.2801697039057787,1.1488970588235292,0.5235118161864245,0.20792532908554318,0.5024375532912327,0.5624999999999999,0.9013408210984026,-0.4796380090497737,-0.1824551574421568,0.12306227498586686,0.31380176427452605,0.24649859943977623,0.5553549138742129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1.8181818181818181,0.5603028979951615,0.5023844030744041,0.63433705210265,-0.09060454073088622,0.10337847872649535,0.12191799599240341

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man sitting there was, presumably, the person we were here to meet. Was he the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto? It was hard to tell: he hardly spoke a word, offering one-word answers, or just a nod or a shake of the head, to our questions. We hired a computer expert to dig deeper into the history of Nakamoto's online persona. While the name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" appeared on the 2008 Bitcoin paper, the email address had been used a few months before, to post technical information on a forum for fans of liberty and the free market. ""The whole reason geeks get excited about Bitcoin is that it is the most efficient way to do financial transactions, period,"" he wrote. He must have been shocked to hear that someone using the name of the Bitcoin founder was communicating with the outside world. ""When the person or persons who invented or created Bitcoin, however, are never seen or heard from again, that would be the more typical scenario."" He added: ""I'm not involved with Bitcoin. Wait, is it a fake name?"" The account's activity dwindled as interest in Bitcoin grew. In 2009, back when Bitcoin was worth less than a penny, the user was accepting payments for ""pizzas paid for in Bitcoin"" on several occasions. Then the trail went cold. Nakamoto made no blog posts after 2011, and the account sat unused for years. But on 29 April this year, a single message was posted on the account's public to-do list. A single comment appeared on a blog post about the Bitcoin inventor the same day. ""Thank you for your writings. They are a wealth of information,"" wrote ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" without disclosing which writing was being thanked for. ""That's not me,"" Dorian Nakamoto said, after I'd asked about the comment. He said he was not even aware of Bitcoin until his son told him he'd been contacted by a reporter two weeks before. ""I have no knowledge of that,"" he said of his alleged online comment. ""I didn't make that."" He insisted that he had only once used the Nakamoto name, when he worked for the base at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Ohio. Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto is 64. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and after that his biography gets hazy very quickly. In the wake of 911, he was laid off from his job as a systems engineer at Hughes Aircraft in southern California. A prolific writer, he posted hundreds of articles to free-market websites. He outlined a money-making scheme that required investors to buy casino chips to be held as collateral. A libertarian, he named his daughter Galaria, after Ayn Rand's novel Galts Gulch. It's not hard to imagine how someone like Nakamoto could ordain himself the inventor of Bitcoin. Computer engineers of his generation tend to be rugged individualists, and more than one has claimed to be Bitcoin's inventor. Hal Finney, an engineer and cryptographic genius, received the very first Bitcoin transaction. He was a close friend and correspondent of the Bitcoin founder, but said he never knew the inventor's name or where he lived. (Finney received the first Bitcoin transaction when he tested the software for his friend, and received 10 Bitcoins from the founder.) Gavin Andresen, who now helps maintain the software, also says he interacted with the founder during the early days, but never learned his identity: ""He was the perfect frontman, in that sense, because he was so anonymous.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has found that Far-UVC light can safely kill 99.9 of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets. Conventional UV lamps can kill viruses on surfaces, but this is the first time scientists have been able to use this type of light to kill a virus in the air. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The study, published in Scientific Reports, shows that the Far-UVC light can be used to kill airborne SARS and MERS coronaviruses. ""This study shows that Far-UVC light has a major advantage over [the] conventional germicidal UV light in that Far-UVC kills viruses in the air, and also on surfaces,"" says David J. Brenner, PhD, lead author of the study and a professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. Far-UVC light, which has wavelengths between 207 and 222 nanometers, has been used for disinfecting water, food and surfaces. However, because it has high-energy components, it can't be used in the presence of people. The study shows that Far-UVC light could be used in public spaces, such as airports, public transportation, doctors' offices and schools. ""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" says Brenner. ""That means it's not only safe; it's not something that we have to worry about as far as it affecting us."" While UVC light is currently used to disinfect surgical tools and surfaces, it can't be used to disinfect the air because of the hazards to the eyes and skin. The study, which was conducted in a lab, tested Far-UVC lights' ability to kill aerosolized coronaviruses. The coronavirus was released into a test chamber, and then the Far-UVC light was turned on for varying lengths of time. To determine how effective the Far-UVC light was, the scientists measured the viral load in the chamber. The results showed that the Far-UVC light was able to greatly reduce the level of viral particles in the air. Further experiments showed that Far-UVC light could kill coronaviruses in the air, whether the air was circulating or still. ""This study shows that two hours of Far-UVC light can kill 95 percent of the virus in the air, and 45 minutes of Far-UVC light can kill 90 percent of the virus,"" says Brenner. He notes that, even though the Far-UVC light can't penetrate through human skin, it can penetrate clothes, which means it could be used to kill viruses in closed spaces.

The customers won't be able to request a fully driverless ride, but they will be matched with a driverless car if one is nearby. Driverless rides are currently free. The decision to operate fully-autonomous driverless cars shows Waymo's confidence in its technology. The firm has completed 10 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles. Fully driverless rides are currently only taking place in a geofenced area, implying that Waymo's confidence levels are still highly situational. One of the problems with driverless rides is the user experience. Passengers might have issues with specifying exact drop-off points or communicating plan changes.

Ron, now 92, was a Royal Artillery gunner when he was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany in 1945. His job was to help remove the dead bodies and burn them on bonfires. ""I'll never forget my first sight of the camp,"" Ron recalled. ""It was indescribable. There were bodies everywhere, just piled up. The smell was horrendous. We were given petrol-soaked rags to hold in front of our faces to try and block the stench out. ""There were also little children who hadn't died yet, but there was nothing we could do for them. It was absolutely terrible."" Ron, who was 21 at the time, was there for a few days. ""It was the worst thing I saw in the whole war,"" he said. ""It was hell on earth. It was horrendous, I had never seen anything like it and I'll never forget it. It was dreadful."" More than 70,000 prisoners died at Bergen-Belsen, where Nazi guards evacuated the camp just weeks before the Allies arrived, leaving the remaining prisoners to die of starvation, disease and exhaustion. Ron said: ""I was there just to get the bodies out of the way. ""It was the most horrific thing I have ever seen in my life. ""I don't talk about it much because I don't want to, but Holocaust Memorial Day is an important day to remember what happened. ""We must never forget."" Ron, who has four children, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, worked as a dock labourer after the war and is a member of the Royal British Legion. He is still active, getting involved in community events in Newport, where he has lived for 50 years, and also makes regular trips to the gym.",llama_65B,1.7121212121212122,3.0,2.292307692307692,2.3125,3.0,-1.129767125375129,-0.39792889388685965,-0.8764112058374001,-0.6276918052151398,-0.9015084294587399,0.6166059117590371,-0.3716678246242733,0.6396630887657643,-0.37292002147074604,0.5889912451654381,-0.6739130434782609,-0.4731320732013831,0.3215892053973013,0.17562788085343523,0.0,0.0,-1.049689440993789,0.1456189683498104,-0.3906313389759024,0.2715220439061594,-0.5521275457431252,0.5399487829967917,-0.7148337595907929,0.32517083939321034,0.10237154150197633,-0.014254899168965728,-0.417391304347826,0.2229412642718131,-0.6589673913043479,0.3288786390220094,-0.027942534343511682,0.28161988789196324,-0.15489130434782608,1.2511941126808408,0.688963210702341,0.6236999394336825,-0.045479536407820306,0.21374345255233007,0.31469979296066264,0.1292168462235705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0909090909090908,1.5454545454545454,0.25624160961009057,0.5790672724189263,0.317108082095067,1.1860035229714305,-1.263183440396024,-1.0782825783534153

0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Shijian-21, or SJ-21, is a Chinese satellite designed to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies. It was recently observed pulling a dead satellite out of its normal orbit and towards Earth's atmosphere where it would burn up in the upper atmospheres as part if China's plan for an ""experimental"" reentry into their country on January 10th 2020 at 12:30 UTC (16 30 local time). This event will allow us some observations we could not get prior; however this still leaves much unknown about how they are going forward with recovering any parts from those stages which have survived atmospheric entry before burning away completely during descent - specifically what might be left when using ground based systems versus manned recovery vehicles like US SpaceX Crew Dragon due later next year? There has been no official word yet by either side but speculation over who did launch such payload appears somewhat mixed given that Russia released one earlier last month possibly being used alongside SNC NPO Lavochkin while USA had another rocket planned just days after apparently without mention regarding potential models shared between parties involved - see here! Whether these were instead launched separately remains unclear though I personally suspect so considering many others including myself also seem uncertain whether other launches mayshould happen now despite previous statements indicating otherwise... (US Air Force STP OTV?)

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was supposed to open the way to aid deliveries in Syria, followed by the rolling out of a co-ordinated military campaign by Moscow and Washington against so-called Islamic State (IS) targets and other groups linked to al-Qaeda. In practice the latest attacks on the aid convoy and hospital seem to have taken things back to square one. Indeed the cynicism of the attack on the convoy in particular is remarkable. The Russians have shown drone footage of their monitoring of the convoy, the route and location of which were pre-announced. But what happened next is disputed. The Americans are hinting strongly that the convoy was attacked from the air by a pair of Sukhoi Su-24 jets - either Russian or Syrian. It makes little difference to Washington, which holds Moscow responsible either way. In contrast, the Russians deny any culpability; they say their aircraft were not in the area and that the destruction of the convoy was the result of action on the ground - the implication is from rebel forces. Quite what purpose anyone had in destroying the convoy is unclear, other than to jeopardise the ceasefire. But the seeds of its collapse were there from the outset. Firstly, the ceasefire was negotiated not between the warring parties on the ground but by two of their patrons - the US and Russia - who are both engaged in the conflict, in different ways and with very different goals. The Syrian Government and the various rebel factions were not involved. Secondly, neither the Russians nor the Americans were able to convince their allies to accept the deal. Moscow had the easier job, to convince the Assad regime, which is hugely dependent upon Russia. The Americans were able to convince some of the rebel groups to back the deal - but many others did not. Indeed many of them have no particular relationship with the Americans. Furthermore, the complex and untidy nature of the Syrian battlefield with multiple localised conflicts going on across the country, prosecuted by a variety of actors, made the idea of any ceasefire difficult from the outset. The idea that the guns should fall silent in one war - between the Assad government and a variety of rebel groups - while the US and Russia put their foot on the accelerator in another battle against IS is a little bizarre. Any hammering of IS would create local vacuums into which one or other actor, the government or the rebels, might step. In any case many at the Pentagon (and probably one would imagine some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS. If there was insufficient trust at the outset, then the attack on the aid convoy and the recriminations between Washington and Moscow now, have only made matters worse. The conflict seems to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues. The Assad regime is too weak to retake all the areas of the country it has lost. The rebel opposition too weak to seriously challenge it beyond the areas it already holds. The Kurds as well as the Turkish incursion into Syria add an additional level of complexity to the problem. And as mentioned above the continued assault on IS will change the strategic map in Syria whatever happens elsewhere.",human,3.659090909090909,3.8333333333333335,4.384615384615385,4.484375,2.5789473684210527,-0.17202607519210542,0.06956870685837903,0.0730406077084886,0.18116082676763004,0.002915451895043842,0.6258960269196635,0.490328006728343,0.6997630837217975,0.521604938271605,0.803438458481917,0.4642857142857142,0.2723993985251347,0.5172413793103448,0.6334721711928776,0.0,0.0,-0.2857142857142858,0.4946151959921699,-0.22361746271412894,0.09851473787222365,-0.36915504511895014,0.00904352480864829,0.21848739495798314,1.0417677285145304,-0.19545454545454535,-0.04043426684045724,0.6571428571428573,1.086351944322026,1.3616071428571428,1.3180640473260918,-0.32551238059909116,-0.15917634141086548,-0.08035714285714289,0.7310843935173493,-0.18681318681318684,-0.11063851756067329,0.03735819062070963,0.11037834103821914,-0.25396825396825384,0.1783431882544509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.327272727272727,1.9090909090909092,0.2353731147413568,1.110756006068434,-0.19401514297051906,-0.015386545669215757,0.011670198827954663,-0.03185108833487796

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A group of researchers has developed a way to create food without sunlight using artificial photosynthesis. The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding the product back to bacteria that convert it further into ethanol or butanol fuel. While such an approach could potentially provide a future solution for producing sustainable biofuels from renewable energy sources, it also raises questions about its safety and climate change effects. ""This is another step toward artificially creating life on Earth - and we should all be concerned by this,"" said Craig Venter, co-inventor of the first synthetic cell in 1980s and founder of Celera Genomics Inc., who was not involved with the recent research. ""We have created far more dangerous organisms than plants,"" he added. ""The biggest problem is going extinct like today's species do every day."" In addition to being able to produce fuels directly from CO 2, such technology would offer other advantages over traditional fossil fuels: It doesn't require land use as much space and materials are used at lower cost. There would no longer need to collect oil when exploring new lands, nor any mining operations to obtain coal, which means less land clearing and habitat destruction. And if there were enough solar panels spread across the globe to power these systems, demand for natural gas would decrease as well. ""If you want to go straight up and talk about positive impacts on our environment,"" Michael Tretter, one of the scientists behind the study and a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign told Gizmodo via email, ""that part falls squarely under [the] 'if you build it, they will come' premise."" Creating Fuel Using Artificial Photosynthesis In 2010, NASA published a report titled ""Artificial Photosynthesis Will Transform Energy Markets Within A Generation Or Less"" - an optimistic prediction that many others had claimed before them, including James Lovelock himself. Pessimists, however, remain skeptical - mainly because we don't know how exactly photosynthetic microorganisms work. According to Greg Ebelkamp, curator of microbiology at Florida Museum of Natural History, the process isn't yet perfect. Microbes living near the surface tend to eat atmospheric nitrogen while those deeper down consume hydrogen sulfide instead. Some strains can only survive on organic matter (like dead cells). One problem facing photosynthetic microbes, according to Eibelkamp, is their suspension within large amounts of saltwater or brine. When exposed to high levels of salinity, some marine algae turn brownish due to an inability to excrete excess salts. That makes harvesting even easier for big companies like Shell Oil and Chevron. Nevertheless, microbes might still prove useful for making clean air - something most people now think impossible. Though we've been unable to reproduce this so-called oxygenic photosynthesis inside lab conditions, several labs around the world have succeeded in doing so, using different configurations of cyanobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and purple nonsulfur bacteria. Now, two groups led by Carnegie Mellon professor Ali Khademhosseini and chemist Douglas Fields, both members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, believe they've found a better route to liquid hydrocarbons using ocean lifeforms altogether. Their research appears in the journal Science Advances. Here's what they did to make fuel. First off, let's get the basics out of the way. Researchers already knew that redox reactions happen naturally whenever light hits certain minerals, generating charged particles called electrons. These charges move through biological molecules, where they're captured by electron acceptors called terminal oxidases. This creates usable chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), or ADP phosphate ATP. Since 1960, though, engineers have tried to replicate this reaction outside the body, and failed miserably. For example, chemists working at Caltech attempted to synthesize fatty acids from methane and oxygen in a reactor separated by 100 yards from a flame; the result sparked five small fires. In 2006, researchers coupled methanol oxidation with light-driven proton reduction in a separate chamber. But eventually, the system died after twelve hours due to a lack of sufficient nutrients, clogging pipes, and poor design. To solve problems like these, Khademhosseini and his team originally engineered a few dozen genes from bacterial symbionts known collectively as extremophiles to become active again. They made sure to add extra enzymes that flared up quickly after receiving photons, directing the electrons towards superoxide ion radicals, rather than protons. With this help, the team managed to generate butyl esters - compounds commonly found in gasoline - using light alone in just six days, or four times faster than existing methods. Then came one of the cooler parts: they put each drop of resultant biocompounds into saltwater containing microbes hungry for sugar (a type of carbohydrate) and sodium chloride. After incubating for three months, they pumped the solution overboard and tested with? Any chemistry? No! It hasn: According to 610 Asiri: What! Yes! You! So! It's All",gpt_j,5.295454545454546,6.5,4.8,4.828125,6.7894736842105265,0.9796221410080389,0.5798629666260179,0.8704330284086037,0.7120842847077594,-0.3593073593073592,1.0733180578955859,-0.47098402018502944,0.8466061420411789,-0.4733445566778896,0.7192037187184123,0.2272727272727273,0.8887087531239591,0.7899686520376176,0.7601105897554196,0.045454545454545456,0.20829889522526546,-0.032467532467532624,0.9425846584848349,-0.3752484819517917,0.4990140519404934,0.02461033634126324,0.718110614050093,-0.1390374331550801,0.7362155613225169,-0.890909090909091,0.23065236162089958,-0.018181818181818077,0.7883408316439642,-0.5255681818181818,0.276925043946864,-0.0883018724760355,0.06552985591515302,-0.22159090909090903,0.3210524767439045,-0.15384615384615388,0.17765345787706466,0.047546788062721335,0.19294697737405267,0.40692640692640697,0.9915597544492272,0.0,0.0,0.06818181818181818,0.44709808120240907,6.327272727272727,4.090909090909091,-0.5494350172823056,1.7271672559937432,-0.2880012461376543,-0.5548415665891486,0.19850385157312098,0.24545280146178333

Unlike trees, Biourban 's artificial tree requires no water or soil and can be used in both urban and rural areas. Biomitech claims that its artificial tree is capable of capturing up to 1,400 grams of pollutants per hour, including carbon dioxide and the fine particles that cause smog. The company has designed the device to provide clean air for an area of 4,000 square meters, making it an ideal solution for cities with high levels of air pollution. The idea behind the artificial tree is to replace trees that are not present in urban areas, or to supplement existing vegetation in areas that do not have sufficient numbers of trees to provide enough air purification. Additionally, the device does not require much maintenance, as it is made from recyclable materials and runs on solar power. The product has already been installed in some cities in Mexico and the company plans to expand to other countries in the near future. As air pollution continues to be a major problem in many cities around the world, solutions such as Biomitech's artificial tree could help to reduce the health risks associated with poor air quality.",text-davinci-003,0.8787878787878788,0.5,0.8615384615384616,0.8125,0.2631578947368421,-0.05327004578010775,0.17920155050748285,0.33502746313558307,0.5877166092512808,0.8435374149659861,-0.20244093132578925,0.7771236333052985,-0.34968589108797743,0.6373456790123457,-0.1406954207345631,2.125,-0.010195671988637616,-0.607758620689655,-0.36652782880712237,0.0,0.0,1.2678571428571426,0.24184023397525234,-0.6700865749139138,-0.7625173951346522,0.4552912223133715,-0.29300104996007076,0.7647058823529413,-0.3590578425156498,0.7795454545454548,-0.3716256085516124,0.8,2.301250968283482,0.5078125000000001,0.3156461513853615,-0.047470555504034104,-0.016840188228817395,1.4999999999999998,2.6358682362706594,-0.15384615384615388,-0.05957488104802214,0.0653768335862418,0.018172924107269613,-0.49206349206349187,-0.6221252056612898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5636363636363636,0.45454545454545453,0.33516737016507747,0.33450147376009276,-0.1426326392599433,-0.5942788173381958,0.8291326517429546,1.02203886818371

The Commission set out a timeline for settling the claims of 47 million consumers who were potentially mis-sold PPI between 2005 and 2010. More than 18 million PPI policies were sold in the United Kingdom, mostly between 1990 and 2010, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, and some 12 million people have already received compensation. The City watchdog said that banks have been making progress in improving the way they handle the complaints, but added that there are still many people who are waiting for their cases to be dealt with. A spokeswoman for Lloyds said: ""We will continue to work closely with the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure that all remaining complaints are resolved as quickly as possible."" ""Firms must continue to improve their complaint handling and ensure customers get the right outcome as quickly as possible,"" the regulator's director of supervision, Clive Adamson, said. The FCA and the City regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, had to step in when there were concerns about the slow pace of progress. ""The regulator has been clear that banks have done far too little, far too slowly, to resolve these complaints,"" said Andrew Bailey, the FCA's chief executive. Lloyds Banking Group has already set aside 12bn to cover compensation costs. ""It's now been seven years since we first told the banks to put their customers first and clean up the mess they made of complaints,"" he said.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"SVGs have become popular due to their scalability, flexibility, and how lightweight they are. This article takes a look at SVG techniques such as SVG grids, fractional SVG stars, masks, and animation. SVG is no longer just a way to put pretty vector graphics on your website, with most modern browsers supporting all of SVG's advanced features, it has become a tool that can be used to create web pages that are beautiful, usable, performant, and accessible. In this article, we are going to look at some of the latest SVG techniques that we can use to push SVGs to their limits. Let's start by looking at SVG grids. It is important that we design for different screen sizes, so if we are using SVGs as background images, it is important that we design the SVG to scale with different viewports. I am going to start by creating a simple grid SVG in Sketch using the rectangle tool. Once I have my rectangles, I am going to export them as an SVG. The SVG will be exported with a viewBox that defines the aspect ratio of the SVG. The SVG will scale if the viewBox is changed, so if we want to change the aspect ratio, we need to change the viewBox. To make sure the SVG scales with the viewport, we need to make sure that we remove the viewBox. SVGs have a lot of advanced features such as masks, clipping paths, filters, and more. A lot of these features can be combined to create advanced effects. Let's take a look at some examples. SVGs can be clipped to different shapes, making them only visible in the clipped areas. Let's say we want to add a circle in the middle of our image. We can use a clipPath to clip our image to a circle. It is also possible to clip multiple elements to different shapes. SVGs can also have text applied to them. SVG text has a lot of different features, such as fonts, alignment, and justification. If we want our text to be only visible in a certain area, we can use a mask to only show the text in that area. You can also have an SVG with multiple masks. With some CSS, we can change the text to make it more readable. There are many filters that we can apply to an SVG. Let's take a look at some examples. SVGs are also very useful for creating interesting overlays. We can use SVGs to create a circle. SVGs can also be used to create interesting shapes. We can use a path to create a star. These stars can then be animated using CSS. SVGs are also useful for creating animations that are lightweight and performant. We can create animations by adding more paths to the SVG. The animation can then be triggered by adding a class to the SVG. SVGs are a great tool for creating performant and scalable websites. They can be used for creating background images and overlays, and can be used to create beautiful animations.",llama_65B,3.128787878787879,5.0,3.6769230769230767,3.5625,2.789473684210526,-1.201726054431354,-0.3239198930559869,-0.6257924365121166,-0.2892944641079981,-0.8357628765792031,0.22504149106003057,-0.4662741799831793,0.31489238816685977,-0.5339506172839505,0.2235664885267993,-0.15714285714285725,0.6639741690518078,-0.2970443349753694,0.15845138645568957,0.0,0.0,-0.726530612244898,-0.025640833609362656,-0.641445160169022,-0.4950600776472972,-0.19688269073010684,0.05331006837042562,-0.8411764705882355,-0.46558112869403245,0.03454545454545448,0.4702177343951517,-0.5714285714285714,0.07036975492530034,-0.35267857142857145,0.2148323827962371,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.0482142857142857,0.7704326170652406,0.29450549450549446,0.6466278544887859,-0.11954620998627068,0.2519875777397579,-0.584126984126984,0.03412501445112349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14545454545454545,2.0,1.2055089719127199,0.4369647531515819,0.9327844479209212,0.94128632650994,-1.0629650280155283,-0.9222955741685214

The first three are owned by EDF Energy which operates them alongside Horizon Nuclear Power under licence from the Office for Nuclear Regulation; Sellafield is operated by Sellafield Ltd while its future remains uncertain after being put up for sale last year with bids due to be submitted before Christmas.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own priorities, and that both of you have valid points of view. Ultimately, it's important to come to an agreement that works for both of you. Perhaps you could compromise and both do the shopping together or split the task up so one of you is responsible for the batteries and the other takes care of something else that needs to be done.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Scientists have determined that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size by pitching them against each other in a competition over preferred burrows. There were two stages of the experiment, one where the shrimp could freely choose unoccupied burrows of varying sizes, and another stage where the shrimp were randomly matched against each other to fight over a preferred burrow. The researchers found that the mantis shrimp would fight longer and harder and be more likely to win when the volume of the contested burrow closely matched with the shrimp's body length. This showed that the animals would exert maximum effort for something that is'just right', demonstrating the mantis shrimp's ability to assess the value of contested resources.",human,0.16666666666666666,-0.16666666666666666,0.23076923076923078,0.234375,-0.15789473684210525,0.5644981032570824,-0.4516935553946109,-0.19368600076891562,-0.21790307802719014,1.3197278911564623,-0.4099097575676829,1.4894869638351556,-0.1299570064189742,1.4475308641975309,-0.005600524810263595,0.75,-0.22208466083522715,2.0172413793103448,1.364023920333395,0.25,0.4330127018922193,1.2142857142857142,-1.061092935780252,-0.846989430691187,-0.7964397891382146,1.058244462674323,-0.48024673155160785,0.7647058823529413,0.3478057109709901,0.6045454545454547,-0.640973640459346,0.8,0.6576171830350245,2.0312500000000004,0.8924065631528455,0.1022442733933043,0.3882285676537811,0.9374999999999999,0.8721627943624909,0.07692307692307684,0.20579317813392642,1.8305513404147697,0.04085919425719688,-0.38095238095238076,-0.18244068614299788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.12727272727272726,0.45454545454545453,0.5453784549124677,-0.3180384119705722,0.8320744590772485,-0.3353761737515908,0.8912061827312149,0.820673248578705
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Alphabet and SoftBank recently announced that they successfully ran a stable LTE connection from a solar-powered drone 62,000 feet high. The connection was used to make an international video call. The test drone, a PHASA-35, is manufactured by a SoftBank subsidiary and boasts a 35-meter wingspan. The call was placed using Alphabet's Project Loon LTE network. While the 62,000-foot height of the drone is impressive, the real achievement is the call stability. The test was performed in an area where commercial LTE signals are non-existent. The drone used Alphabet's LTE technology to maintain a stable connection, even while moving at over 100 mph. Alphabet's Project Loon was designed to bring internet access to remote locations, particularly third-world countries. Alphabet launched the project in 2011, when it was still known as Google X. The project launched a fleet of high-altitude balloons that floated in the stratosphere to provide LTE access to remote locations. The balloons are powered by solar panels and are designed to last over 100 days in the air. Google X renamed the project to Project Loon in 2015, and Alphabet incorporated it into its X subsidiary in 2017. SoftBank acquired 14 of Alphabet's Loon in February 2018. The company said it plans to continue testing and development of the Loon balloons in the stratosphere. SoftBank plans to use the Loon technology to provide LTE access to remote areas in Japan. The company also plans to utilize Loon to bring LTE access to areas affected by natural disasters. If SoftBank is successful, Loon could become an integral part of the company's OneWeb project. OneWeb is a global satellite constellation that is designed to provide high-speed LTE connections in remote areas. If Loon becomes stable enough to provide reliable internet access in remote areas, it could play a key role in disaster relief. It could also help bring internet access to third-world countries, which could have a profound impact on their economic development. Want to find out more about Loon and other drone-related news?

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The MarkitCIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4 in the first quarter of the year from 0.6 in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The MarkitCIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",human,2.257575757575758,1.8333333333333333,2.046153846153846,2.203125,2.736842105263158,0.09191799149772187,0.5936679689177033,0.4711033802464919,0.7883411865136105,0.5544217687074828,1.0613551031119615,0.3399915895710681,0.9953127638493509,0.47530864197530875,1.2240670243333667,0.75,0.8801176035263915,0.5172413793103448,0.6334721711928776,0.0,0.0,1.0535714285714284,1.1342261676561216,-0.19834562617451848,0.26161228477850584,-0.018457752255947583,0.4159367717694347,1.099264705882353,1.0118544224472934,-0.3579545454545454,0.22178449246322707,0.17500000000000004,0.8510096080028442,1.38671875,1.1732535969602966,0.7759610034313271,0.6235949414623867,-0.09374999999999999,0.28927927077347954,-0.7307692307692307,-0.07033267417893056,-0.2288189175518462,-0.11587005475535252,0.896825396825397,1.0475128306825474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6,2.0,0.16901245898118236,0.8070213199746613,0.289516156257607,-0.5912006887141672,0.6819287670692246,0.7268612166428723

Uber uses a three-star system, and the company says it has improved how negative reviews are dealt with under both local laws and international human rights guidelines.[1] The CEO told USA Today that he hopes the move will help remove bad actors from the service by showing everyone exactly who hasn't been following the rules. ""The ones you don't want on there aren't going anywhere,"" Dara Khosrowshahi said of his efforts at cleaning up the app.[23] A day after this story was published, Lyft also started giving rideshare users access to information about themselves through an updated version of its Customer Experience page. Other companies like Airbnb and Wayfair are also adding similar features in the future but Google still doesn't allow people to review or rate their own Street View cars. Google Maps changed some of its default settings for taking photos without driver consent last year, including limiting when the camera can start recording automatically to just five seconds before impact and requiring manual approval if a photo isn't taken within one minute. But these changes may not always apply depending on where your car travels on Earth unless you take specific steps to change certain preferences. You'll find more details below: In August 2001, Mapquest sued Yahoo! over web mapping content supplied by Microsoft. In 2005, the two parties reached a confidential settlement agreement which led to Yahoo!'s decision to endow MapQuest with exclusive use of Yahoo!'s data feeds.[16] As part of the deal, Microsoft agreed to pay 10 million as compensation for revenue lost due to consumer confusion resulting from Mapquest.com being listed first in search engine results pages (SERPs) while using maps provided via Microsoft Live Search. However, in 2008, the Superior Court of California overruled the lower court ruling in favor of Yahoo!, finding that although Mapquest had infringed upon Microsoft's trade secrets, it did so only minutes after contacting Microsoft for information regarding licensing terms;[17] thus, even though Mapquest used data generated from MSN searchesmaps, it never violated any contractual obligations to Microsoft. The best way to get around having crappy map apps is really good old fashioned paper directions. I'm sick of trying to decipher those little tiny print maps all the time. It would be nice to carry one less thing along with me everywhere I go. Even better, if we could attach paper trail routes to our phones then we'd know exactly where we've been. This route planner by Foursquare does just that. Find out why it might become the next must-have travel app here. [Source: Business Insider David Kravets] Although the road map is unclear, Tesla appears to be close to rolling out ""full self driving capability"" across its entire lineup as soon as 2018. That includes full autonomy on highways and limited assistance - such as lane centering - off highways. Such vehicles won't require steering wheels nor pedals, and passengers can expect seats equipped with ejection mechanisms, because humans tend to be lousy fliers. For example, consider a customer who wants to buy a house. They look online and choose several homes based solely on images found online. A homeowner looks through Alexa devices and sees that she has multiple requests set up which can lead her right to their home. After looking at pictures, videos and other types of media, she makes an offer. Once the process is complete, she pays for the home through Amazon Pay. At the top of almost every smartphone sold today sits the operating system known as Android - a free platform developed by a nonprofit group called the Open Handset Alliance (OHA). More than 5 billion smartphones worldwide now run software based directly or indirectly on OHA code created since 2007 by device manufacturers, carriers, chip makers, and others inside and outside the mobile industry. Those billions of devices rely on all sorts of hardware parts, many manufactured by companies located near the developing world. So far, most of us haven't given much thought to them - until recently. One reason: Our understanding of the people living nearby those factories has lagged behind the pace of technology development. Until very recently, sources of conflict were few and well separated, mostly confined to places no longer inhabited by anyone. And the digital divide - magnified by the need to download something called an OS update - has prevented millions of poor Indians, Chinese, Malaysians, Indonesians, Filipinos, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Africans, Latinos, Arabs, etc., from enjoying smartphone life. For years, Western activists and engineers focused on Africa and Latin America. Now, the tech revolution starts spreading to the Global South. Here are nine countries that play crucial roles in the global supply chain, offering clues to how the rest of the world could follow. JavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.

Senior, experienced people are extremely difficult to recruit because they can usually pick up the phone or email any company that is looking for their skillset without much trouble. The problem comes when you do reach out to them - you need a compelling offer that gets them excited enough about your organization that it's worth leaving their current job. In general terms this means having something interesting to say to someone who has spent many years honing their skill set in one particular area of expertise. This kind of person doesn't often look at multiple companies unless the opportunity really speaks to them on a personal level. Here I will discuss some things that have worked well with me as an hiring manager and recruiter over the past 10 years: The most effective way (maybe not the best) to get smart candidates interested is through referrals. If your target already knows someone in your field then it becomes much easier to convince herhim to come talk to you directly instead of going through HR. If you aren't speaking directly to someone whom you know, then here are three ways to identify who could help grow your business: 1) Find two current peers whose experience is similar to yours and ask if you can meet with each of them individually. What makes these peer groups valuable? They tend to be more critical than others and thus make decisions based on facts rather than emotion. These individuals used someone like yourself so it would seem reasonable to move forward with recruiting himher. You may want to approach both before making an offer but again, focus first on those in close proximity to your ideal candidate. 2) Use LinkedIn to create a list of linkedin users within 10-15 miles of where you work. Then follow step 1 above by contacting all of them personally. It should go faster since you won't waste time trying to find commonalities between the different positions. One caveat though... don't try this too early. First 3 months after joining the company can be tough especially if you're starting off fresh. Any attempts during that period will probably end badly. Stick around until 2nd half of year 6 and spend the rest of your career doing this to keep morale high. 3) Finally, use classifieds websites such as craigslist or gumtree to see which jobs there happen to be nearby. Make sure to tell anyone involved exactly what type of role you are seeking and add anything else relevant. For example, ""looking for C developer"" might lead to a much broader search since employers are likely more focused on finding candidates with specific knowledge. Obviously this requires some cynicism so be careful. Once you've identified a few leads send one quick message asking specifically if heshe likes working together and why. Sometimes just saying ""hello"" isn't exciting enough which explains my success rate below (I was running my own small consulting firm):",gpt_j,3.0833333333333335,3.5,3.646153846153846,3.6875,2.210526315789474,-0.03400902122167482,-0.2091133853090904,-0.03944593365018672,0.3211726402157895,-0.17687074829931979,0.5772670716896,0.24907808759785213,0.8173445750373382,0.2509496676163345,0.9489297594045044,0.34615384615384626,0.4175333122265912,1.9595490716180368,1.2401070077130483,0.038461538461538464,0.19230769230769232,-0.5494505494505496,-0.08301139528781254,-0.8742052546569214,-0.7147905655514193,0.40891020382406734,0.6750959433698942,-0.2647058823529413,0.2699560413451919,0.03916083916083939,0.5592788973324493,-0.4307692307692307,-0.04285245267705659,-0.7091346153846154,0.08205015971976429,0.0101120709949422,0.13875146246065878,0.3894230769230768,0.6643820570232974,1.2307692307692306,1.7860615785782343,0.3822030271195672,0.31105133852519185,-0.6544566544566544,-0.07115766404542506,0.038461538461538464,0.1923076923076923,0.11538461538461539,0.31948553318915673,3.3454545454545452,2.727272727272727,-0.3631558329329387,1.2076273008191325,-0.06375246754800493,0.15734939946733362,-0.1965957605232428,-0.04804748909600513

Mancini insists that Tevez, who failed to secure a move away from Manchester City in the summer, will not start a game for him until the striker apologises for his conduct. ""There is no problem,"" Mancini said. ""I spoke with Carlos for 20 minutes after training and it was good. I am very happy with his reaction. ""I think that Carlos understands the situation and now I am happy because he did this training session very well. ""If Carlos apologises to the team-mates and supporters then I will be happy. When he apologises he will come back into the team."" Tevez missed two months of action last season after refusing to come on as a substitute in a Champions League game against Bayern Munich in September. Mancini said he would not comment on Tevez's training session as it would only ""create problems."" ""I spoke with Carlos after training and he did very well, he trained very well,"" Mancini said. ""I don't want to talk about Carlos in the press conference because it creates problems. ""I am very happy, he did a very good training session, and I am happy with his behaviour.

""I think that the supporters deserve this because they supported him in the good and bad times. I think the supporters deserve this. ""For me it is finished. It is not a problem. I want to find the solution and Carlos understands this. It is important that he plays for us."" Mancini revealed he had not spoken to Tevez since the striker said he would retire from football. ""No, I spoke to him only after training,"" he said. ""I said it is important that Carlos plays for us."" Tevez had returned to training on Wednesday after being given two days off by the club. ""I am happy with the team,"" Mancini said. ""I am very happy with the players. All the players are in good condition, they are working well. ""We are working very well, we are strong.

ACOSS also reports that children from single-parent households and those whose parents are unemployed are more likely to experience poverty. The organization is calling for an urgent and concerted effort to address the root causes of poverty and to provide targeted support to vulnerable children and their families.

Additionally, supporting organizations that provide services and resources to those in need can make a significant impact in improving the lives of disadvantaged youth.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.29545454545454547,0.16666666666666666,0.26153846153846155,0.28125,0.2631578947368421,1.1809448396992013,1.2729924175713225,1.3112849966625142,0.9978701743960188,0.3219954648526077,-0.356376377738199,0.21586767591813863,-0.5206745250463032,0.2376543209876546,-0.5721339606211518,1.3333333333333335,0.08733875454383165,-0.2327586206896551,0.2168184208135889,0.0,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.14931925703956378,-0.4145602276800746,0.09205520905861961,0.19688269073010653,-0.10628005352021795,0.5098039215686274,-0.28691533766644944,0.021212121212121196,-0.578854372591137,1.4666666666666666,1.406032351424281,0.0,-0.5287964955771306,0.1022442733933043,0.27976250141107195,0.06249999999999994,0.6501179974730944,0.1538461538461537,-0.20272151977280484,0.0,0.0,0.5079365079365081,0.2722752065450611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,0.09090909090909091,0.005010257366736377,0.21645554704076625,-0.2660972558525426,-1.2220651533911215,0.996366985162932,0.7495959053949552
0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourban uses a proprietary filtration system to suck in polluted gases from city streets and return clean oxygen back into the atmosphere. The company says its product could be used for parks or other public spaces where residents may not want actual live plants around them due to allergies or aesthetic preferences. It's also ideal for places like Beijing which are trying their best to limit outdoor pollutants because they lack natural vegetation to help filter harmful emissions. The device can reportedly remove up to 98 of particulate matter such as PM 2.5 at a rate of about 200 cubic feet per minute (4 meterssecond) with minimal electricity use. That means you don't have to worry too much about replacing filters regularly - since the bioreactor would only need replacement once every three years if you were using it full-time.",opt_30b,0.48484848484848486,0.16666666666666666,0.5230769230769231,0.46875,0.0,0.2538161004816856,0.13640133963345896,0.4982887306366965,0.38124514266580334,0.8888888888888885,-0.8127555993238625,0.9498177740398092,0.2605916113575919,0.7561728395061731,-0.011281271847887997,2.0,0.49974086567271875,1.2672413793103448,1.881868969537697,0.0,0.0,1.0714285714285714,0.08118275154532509,-0.8076776849629042,-0.7709587307638642,0.6562756357670219,0.4036582737606594,0.7647058823529413,0.5997689427860039,0.7212121212121213,0.38514253204438403,-0.19999999999999996,0.8375139984102682,-0.15624999999999986,-0.12240592212872103,0.7011035889826579,0.9696699141100895,0.8125,0.49598080788504934,0.769230769230769,0.8502568270001174,0.5230146686899342,0.3914407699832597,-0.529100529100529,-0.2949331131485814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0909090909090908,0.0,-0.685057283170313,0.756825076152836,-0.7624340902687622,-0.7547514650904503,0.9615490451168134,1.2002579180270427

The Republic of Korean Army (ROKA) recently held its annual recruitment event where approximately 200 people signed up for the military, according to Stars Stripes. This is about half of what they usually get each year at the recruiting drive; however, officials said this might be temporary as new legislation allows more young adults to dodge compulsory military service if they are pregnant or have children under age two. In cases like these, some men can even pay around 2,000 from public funds so that women don't need to stay behind while serving overseas during their pregnancies.",opt_30b,0.1893939393939394,-0.16666666666666666,0.2153846153846154,0.265625,-0.10526315789473684,-0.03424825249166292,-0.21359194799891706,0.1841146842309178,0.3888979195938573,1.4217687074829928,0.20423570332790905,1.424726661059714,0.7320491169335092,1.5771604938271604,0.9767651975325702,2.0,2.0773841858958946,2.3922413793103448,0.7917204003588728,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,0.20605565149163754,-0.021442770397245223,0.5419174615277284,0.7136997538966364,-0.48024673155160785,1.147058823529412,-1.4328087830487297,0.6045454545454547,1.0515016326214381,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,-0.07812499999999993,-0.9328767787091092,0.4016739311879811,-0.07105075911806477,0.5624999999999999,0.5487693390987182,1.4615384615384612,0.6676028461697272,1.8305513404147697,0.923948812002171,0.06349206349206366,-0.052865183461613494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7272727272727273,-0.18181818181818182,-0.8150840710313526,0.6410329211500344,-0.7955024881461757,-0.7055072779767457,1.1953392490203143,1.5772091946692604
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: ""I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one."" On bird flu: ""I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama."" On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: ""After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine."" Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: ""Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem."" On being sacked: ""If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later."" On Chelsea's pitch: ""Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed."" On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: ""If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message,"" Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: ""If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood."" Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: ""My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?"" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: ""When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer."" Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: ""I find Jose's'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. ""It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation."" Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: ""Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him."" Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: ""It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football."" February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined PS8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an ""enemy of football"" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined PS5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of ""fault and fault and cheat and cheat"" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined PS200,000, which is reduced to PS75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation. December 2010: Mourinho is banned for one Champions League match after being found guilty of improper conduct. It follows the dismissal of Real Madrid players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during a Champions League game against Ajax. August 2011: Mourinho, now in charge of Real Madrid, pokes Barcelona's then-assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye during touchline exchanges after a stormy Spanish Super Cup tie. January 2013: After dropping club captain Iker Casillas before the mid-winter break, reports emerge in the Spanish press of disagreements between Mourinho and some of his senior players. Stories continue to appear throughout the rest of the season about disharmony in the squad, with centre-back Pepe the latest to fall foul of Mourinho last month. May 2013: In a bad-tempered Copa del Rey final defeat by neighbours Atletico Madrid, Mourinho is sent from the bench for furiously protesting a decision from the referee. He was jeered by sections of the Real support during his final game in charge against Osasuna.",human,6.0606060606060606,8.333333333333334,6.769230769230769,6.328125,9.157894736842104,-0.6832353401114429,-0.369464678397243,-0.4743031656676622,-0.504241235366129,-0.603586889301175,0.275157546315006,-0.29201009251471816,0.13700835739427578,-0.4403479236812567,0.0513008571431743,-0.3727272727272728,0.036236703772135365,0.0808777429467085,0.28364279738727044,0.01818181818181818,0.133608531424537,-0.6363636363636365,0.044888574241892305,0.24444758252859572,1.074319284960696,-0.7678424938474159,-0.0895040002355601,-0.1877005347593584,0.3192419612265297,-0.2163636363636364,0.2546211536806802,-0.18181818181818188,0.7474840971528988,-0.474431818181818,0.22414191190369465,0.04780251743063577,0.29913753187802844,-0.2011363636363636,0.34124347329663207,0.3832167832167831,0.4752798004923486,-0.0665655032878098,0.21657587872423048,0.24935064935064943,0.9418538670770933,0.01818181818181818,0.133608531424537,0.0,0.0,3.6545454545454548,4.181818181818182,0.13549215983830087,1.4101964944280094,0.17178675374191954,0.7128209099214918,-0.7903243016965553,-0.6556054440888845

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Sales volumes increased by 1.7 in November from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared with the same month last year, sales were up by 5. However, the monthly increase was smaller than analysts had expected, and the year-on-year increase was lower than the 6.3 rise seen in October. The data suggests that while consumer spending has picked up slightly since the start of the winter season, it is still below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said that despite the slight uptick in sales volumes, prices were still falling on an annual basis, down 0.7 in November compared with a year earlier. This could indicate that retailers are using discounts to attract shoppers. ""While the month-on-month numbers look a bit better, this should be taken in the context of the sharp fall we saw in October due to the end of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme,"" said Jonathan Athow, Deputy National Statistician for Economic Statistics at the ONS. ""Looking back over the three months as a whole, we can see that there has been a modest gain in retail sales compared with the previous quarter. This reflects a gradual recovery from the pandemic-induced lows of April and May.""

Text input is still possible using the keyboard or by voice but it will be also available through your hands if you wear Haptic Gloves. The latest release of Firefox for Oculus Rift users includes an experimental mode that allows them to view their desktop on a phone screen on top of the headset's display instead of fullscreen. In previous versions of Firefox Beta for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X there was support for several different types of webcam hardware including Logitech C920, Microsoft HD Webcam 6000 (Webcam Pro 9000), Point Grey Flirc AMT2x3-A80 ISIR Camera Module and many other models listed here. While these devices work with most sites such as youtube360 they don't support video calls since this requires a dedicated app for Facebook Messenger like HeadsetFaceTime which does not exist yet. The same limitation applies to Google Duo too. So be aware when streaming videos from Youtube and Facebook Live!. You can find more info about supported webcams at (and we are waiting for comments from our community!) I am very interested in what's going to happen to AR apps built around native code since I have been discussing this topic previously. A lot of people think that JavaScript based VRE solutions would become obsolete once existing HTML5WebVR platforms pass the ""killer feature"" phase. All these technologies already provide some kind of access control mechanisms to protect against malicious websites so why should developers bother? Well, none of those frameworks offer pure headless rendering like Native Client did. They all rely heavily on hidden API exposed by browsers which may break under certain conditions where Google Chrome never broke. Even something simple as setting focus might fail because browsers won't expose it directly - this needs to be done through events handlers or accessing unsafeWindow object. There were multiple reports about problems caused by exposing native APIs inside this window. On the whole it seems safe enough but just remember: one single CSS rule change could wreck havoc, no matter how much security layers you use. As usual when things get complicated, someone came up with a solution - let's take another look into the source code of Awesome Window Manager This project provides a rich set of tools to manipulate windows within any application without disturbing its UI. It supports creating child windows and attaching them to specific position on parent window surface while hiding others behind walls, moving background pictures from left side to right side and keeping only active window visible regardless it being located on front or back layer. Most importantly AWWM implements access controls level 2 features allowing restricting permissions to certain areas only. Accessing user data is prohibited by default though developers can add custom protection rules to allow reading files, opening URLs or even launching applications. In order to restrict usage of various parts of system resources some additional steps need to be taken into account. For example if a developer wants to render his own 3D graphics widget he must add similar approach allowing viewing file contents and accepting mouse clicks etc. For now there aren't any examples out there for doing exactly this however various articles describe general approaches on how to do it. If you want to start playing with AR stuff linked below contains links to few good places: What's next in low latency communication between headsets and phones? We're talking about high quality audio coming out of both ends via USB cable or aptX Bluetooth link. Currently it depends on computer manufacturer whether they implement proper digital output device on laptops or PC motherboard or they ship CD player DAC binary blobs. Both setups lead to poor performance especially during voice call when DSP used for sound processing becomes overloaded thus leaving us with echoing voices or distorted sounds. Fortunately with technology advances mobile manufacturers started adding TrueHD chip capable outputs found on Apple iPod Touch 5th generation and iPhone 6 Plus, making it easier for everyone to buy cheap bluetooth headphones compatible with iOS ecosystem without having to worry about proprietary drivers. However looking further ahead smartphones seem to embrace better form factors which could potentially confuse matters. When computing power goes away from handheld systems and gets moved off-board (laptops) onto desktops then CPU GPU workload shared among both components increases causing overall system response time spike. That trend implies higher cost per connected device due to increased number of cores needed to keep responsiveness stable and lower processor efficiency rates. One way to circumvent this issue is to move compute intensive operations off the main board and outsource them to remote servers accessible over internet link. Nowadays cloud services are ready to cater every type of requirement ranging from machine learning tasks, games development, rendering heavy content, transcoding movies etc. With CloudPipe platform developers don't require special skills to setup server environment nor to maintain infrastructure.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A health tribunal has found Peter Sutcliffe no longer needs any treatment for any mental disorder. In 1981 he was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders and given a life sentence in Broadmoor hospital, where so far as we know he remains to this day. Sutcliffe claims that the reason there is still an investigation into his case - four years after it ended by acquittal at trial - is because medical staff are ""keeping him alive"" against his wishes. He thinks they want more money from taxpayers. It is widely known that medical staff have been paid well over 1 million per year on top of their regular salaries since Sutcliffe was acquitted; but if you think about how much it costs us just to keep someone in prison these days (no such thing as profit), then perhaps one might be tempted to agree with him. But surely His Majesty has no jurisdiction here? Maybe they're hoping to claim expenses under the Prisoners Act 1877 or something similar. The answer seems fairly simple: The Ministry of Justice says that some of what people like Sutcliffe believe actually happened did happen. I don't mind saying that even though he killed thirteen women while impersonating police officers between 1974-78. Most victims had suffered physical abuse before death by knife wounds, hammer blows and strangulation, which may explain why they were reluctant to seek help afterwards and also explains why the authorities failed to connect some of the crimes to each other despite having strong circumstantial evidence. He didn't get away with murder when taken back to court, nor should he now. Wasn't all this covered up in those infamous Inquests and cover ups? How can the public trust politicians and doctors who make decisions based solely upon their own views without taking account of anything else? So what really happens to patients committed to high security hospitals? Is anyone checking what goes on behind closed doors? As always, the only way to find out will be through Freedom of Information requests - A Good Idea Limited (AGIL) reports that only 10 of FoI applications are successful. Why not raise the bar? And how many prisoners are being released earlier than recommended due to improved medical care rather than actual rehabilitation programmes? Who knows? If nothing comes of these inquiries [it wouldn't surprise me] maybe we shouldn't go making wild accusations until we've got concrete proof.",gpt_j,2.25,2.5,2.6923076923076925,2.75,1.736842105263158,0.010357231304290358,-0.06831826019813332,-0.0037200396873132975,0.11427988656103813,-0.12925170068027197,1.3630030459912592,0.2978973927670312,1.7168998154244817,0.3197530864197533,1.7305347172373367,0.050000000000000044,0.8152031279175035,1.2672413793103448,0.9935498282419429,0.0,0.0,-0.4571428571428572,0.688446823040097,-0.5639448614475499,-0.11574977175651174,0.2657916324856439,0.803629481879529,-0.19117647058823534,0.6291005847376666,0.1845454545454546,0.9736561669589422,-0.09999999999999987,0.5364736066211659,-0.640625,-0.00977270817414323,0.1621302049522397,0.5021124064553045,-0.037500000000000026,0.6222721916450512,0.9076923076923075,1.233904730867165,1.4382903388973192,1.1267429448467154,-0.4698412698412697,0.2683890999048862,0.05,0.21794494717703364,0.05,0.21794494717703367,2.7636363636363637,2.1818181818181817,-0.4562393789939065,1.0635291388332277,-0.06375246754800493,0.10645659063320946,-0.13792034753602367,-0.23399596794173633

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Scientists from Japan have found a species of slug that can self-decapitate and regrow their bodies from their heads. It appears that the slug does this in response to parasites and other environmental threats. The species of slug, named Onchidiopsis japonica, was discovered by researchers from the Graduate School of Science at Kyoto University in Japan. The slugs have an unusual adaptation that allows them to sacrifice their heads in order to survive if they are threatened by parasites or other environmental factors. The detached head then regenerates its body over time. This unique trait is believed to be the result of a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors, which control the expression of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This means that the decapitation and regeneration process can occur multiple times in the same individual, allowing it to survive multiple threats. The discovery of this phenomenon highlights the remarkable adaptability of some species to survive in extreme environments. It also provides insight into the potential for humans to develop similar regenerative abilities.",text-davinci-003,0.5681818181818182,0.6666666666666666,0.5692307692307692,0.625,0.0,1.0010507002997693,1.2309068854731766,1.2356359824053595,1.5480637549551126,-0.1844293272864704,-0.11446549904785976,-0.14391178394542561,-0.15714686712510245,-0.06481481481481481,0.009899856508867004,0.16666666666666674,0.32136709452930834,-0.6494252873563218,-0.39699234240084097,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809527,-0.0625140518339803,-0.38835239719455267,0.7612800436427407,0.04375170905113465,-0.1310757686740612,0.04248366013071881,0.25442804218765736,-0.7565656565656566,-0.07035534786430639,-0.0888888888888888,-0.00983061044707746,0.2604166666666668,0.5565324190561041,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.06249999999999994,0.4416154603555483,0.35897435897435886,0.40432038026564315,0.17433822289664472,0.03643540863731866,-0.7760141093474425,-0.5283132652129788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38181818181818183,0.6363636363636364,0.1877909875261589,0.13559690911566494,0.2760583039221553,-0.9445406712557846,0.5525636176306719,0.7647819441832368

Conservator Richard Hawkes said: ""This is the earliest example of Islamic calligraphy outside Arabia that we have ever come across."" As an outlet for his anger, he attacked the BBC and described himself as 'the only man who can offer you information about what's going on'. He has gone further than most to achieve this goal. He was born in South Africa, where he claims he never felt comfortable with being white. However, after meeting Saddam Hussein during the latter part of the first Gulf War, he decided that it would be beneficial if Iraq gained independence. In 1995, it seems certain that his increasingly angry reaction to news stories continued to manifest itself into more bizarre behaviour such as throwing chairs around when guests are discussing issues that upset him or destroying papers that contain references to anti-Islamic material. In 2008, he made headlines when a fellow guest at a radio discussion show allegedly spat on a photograph depicting George W Bush which had been passed round for comment.

When Kohli fell as part of Sohail Khan's 5-55, Pakistan was in trouble at 182 for 6 but Younis responded by posting his second test ton to keep alive hopes of a win before eventually being bowled off Nathan Lyon's bowling when he missed an attempted reverse sweep on 165 during his 210-ball knock that included 13 fours and three sixes.. Pakistan resumed day five at 76 without loss in reply to India's first innings of 467 all out after weathering centuries from Cheteswar Pujara and Rohit Sharma on Saturday night. But it took just eight balls for Mohammad Amir to remove opener Murali Vijay lbw then moments later Hardik Pandya hit Waqas Maqsood flush on the helmet. The seamer did not return until lunch due to concussion protocol while paceman Umesh Yadav claimed Mayank Agarwal leg before wicket shortly after resumption to reduce India to 1403. It would have been 1554 had captain Virat Kohli held onto a sharp chance offered up by Azhar Ali down the leg side off Ravichandran Ashwin. Karun Nair joined Rohit and played some fluent shots before edging Rahim behind to give Yasir Shah his third scalp of the match. Wriddhiman Saha came in and blasted 39 runs off 48 deliveries including two sixes before falling to Wahab Riaz who broke through the stumps. However, there were more twists ahead as Pakistan lost their last recognised batsman Babar Azam for nought leaving them 188 adrift. Younis began cautiously alongside Sarfraz but soon shifted gears hitting 11 boundaries against the Indian attack led by Ishant Sharma who returned figures of 199 with 18 maidens drawn over 38 overs. He reached 50 off 88 deliveries which included seven fours. Ashwin finally got one past him when Younis failed to read the turn and edged to slip where MS Dhoni pouched another catch.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"A new programme, known as Drive, will be aimed at the most dangerous offenders, BBC News has been told. Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be piloted in Essex, Sussex and South Wales. But domestic violence charity Refuge said there was ""no evidence"" therapy for violent partners was effective. Rachel Williams from Newport, who suffered 18 years of domestic violence at the hands of her late husband, Darren Williams, said: ""If you don't deal with the perpetrator, who's the problem, all they'll do is go on to the next victim."" In 2011, after Ms Williams filed for divorce, her husband burst into her hair salon armed with a sawn-off shotgun and shot her in the leg, before hanging himself in woodland. Six weeks later, as she was recovering in hospital, the body of her 16-year-old son, Jack, was found hanged in the same spot. Ms Williams, 44, who has since remarried, said her former husband would have benefited from the scheme. ""He was a control freak and he needed his actions addressing,"" she said. ""We've got to try and change the mindset of the perpetrator and hold them accountable for their actions."" One woman who survived a ""hellish five-year marriage to a physically, emotionally and financially abusive man"" said she did not believe the Drive scheme would be effective and it would be better to spend the money on support for victims. ""The majority - although not all - of serial perpetrators of domestic violence do it out of choice, not because they have drug, alcohol, social or financial problems,"" she said. ""They will use this Drive scheme as a way to avoid prison and they will deliberately make it look as though they are reforming until they are'signed off' and deemed safe. ""They will then simply find another victim and go back to how they were."" Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said there was ""no evidence - here or abroad - that therapy programmes for violent partners work."" She added: ""On the face of it, it seems like a worthy thing to do. In an ideal world we would approach this from both sides. But we don't live in an ideal world. ""We live in a world were thousands and thousands of women and children are being terrorised and brutalised in their homes and they have nowhere to go. And sadly, finding a refuge space in this country is like finding gold dust."" Although there are already a number of schemes for perpetrators of domestic violence, the Drive project is intended to be different. It is aimed at dangerous offenders, including those thought to be at risk of causing serious harm or committing murder. Unlike most existing schemes, which involve group work or family therapy, offenders on the Drive programme will be given bespoke one-to-one sessions. They will be offered support to tackle any alcohol, drug or mental health problems they may have. Advice about employment, housing and parenting will also be available. Those who refuse to co-operate will be monitored closely by police; civil court orders and criminal sanctions will be considered to disrupt their offending behaviour. Diana Barran, chief executive officer of SafeLives, said: ""Despite significant improvements for victim safety in the UK there are still 100,000 women who live with high-risk domestic abuse at any one time. ""If you do not hold perpetrators to account, we will continue to see the statistics at a standstill.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that are a major part of the immune system. ""Our findings suggest that high doses of B3, administered alone or in combination with other antimicrobials, may be a useful therapy to treat staph infections in some patients, particularly those with weakened immune systems,"" said George Liu, co-senior author of the study and chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The researchers tested B3 in laboratory mice, injecting them with S. aureus, the bacteria that causes staph infections. The results showed that B3 significantly increased survival in the mice and their ability to fight the infection. The researchers then tested human blood and found that B3 increased the ability of neutrophils to surround and destroy S. aureus, and also blocked the formation of a toxin that the bacteria use to disarm the immune system. B3 is already used to treat a variety of conditions, including diabetes, high cholesterol and arthritis, and is sold under the brand name niacin. The researchers noted that nicotinamide is very inexpensive and is usually well-tolerated. ""Clinical studies are now needed to translate these exciting findings to the bedside and determine if B3 can be used alone or in combination with existing antibiotics to cure staph infections in humans,"" said Michael A. Fischbach, co-senior author of the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Francisco. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine. Most of us have been affected by the ""stomach flu"" or gastroenteritis at some point in our lives. The most common cause of this condition is a food-borne virus or bacteria. The most common viruses that cause the ""stomach flu"" are rotavirus and norovirus. Gastroenteritis can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration. Most people recover on their own within a few days. However, those who are at risk for dehydration, especially children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, may need to be hospitalized for rehydration and further treatment. Vaccines are available to protect against rotavirus. Washing your hands can help prevent the spread of many of the viruses and bacteria that cause gastroenteritis. What to eat when you have gastroenteritis or stomach flu Let your stomach settle. Stop eating solid foods for a few hours. Sip on clear liquids to replace fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea. Clear liquids include water, broth, sports drinks, and diluted fruit juices. Sip small amounts of liquid every 15 to 20 minutes. Drink an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replace lost minerals and fluids. You can buy these at your local drug store. Avoid dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol until you feel better. Avoid sugary drinks, such as sodas or fruit juices. When should you eat solid foods again? Start eating solid, easy-to-digest foods when you can tolerate them. Good choices include: Saltine or soda crackers Applesauce or bananas Plain rice, noodles, or potatoes Foods containing whole grains and fiber, such as bran, oatmeal, nuts, and popcorn Foods that are greasy, fatty, or very sweet Foods that are high in fiber, such as beans, vegetables, and whole grains Dairy products or foods that contain lactose, such as milk or cheese, if you are lactose intolerant Highly seasoned, spicy, or fried foods Caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, tea, or soda Alcohol or tobacco (Source: Health Library) A new study has discovered that the immune system is greatly affected by an unhealthy diet.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Scientists were able to use light and bio-ink to print a human ear-like structure under the skin of mice without a single surgical cut. Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that allows for the precise and controlled placement of biological materials layer by layer. Bio-ink, which usually consists of living cells and a support matrix, can be printed in complex shapes and structures that can eventually develop into functional tissues and organs. In the case of the mouse ear-like structure, the scientists used a bioprinter to create a mold of the ear shape, which was then filled with a hydrogel-based bio-ink containing cartilage cells. The mold and bio-ink were then exposed to light, which activated a chemical reaction that cross-linked the molecules in the bio-ink, making it solidify into a solid structure. The mold was removed, and the resulting structure was implanted under the skin of a mouse where it continued to grow and develop into a shape resembling a human ear. This technique has significant potential to revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine, allowing for the creation of replacement tissues and organs that can be tailored to the specific needs of individual patients. It also has the potential to reduce the need for invasive surgical procedures, offering a less painful and more effective treatment option for many medical conditions.",gpt-3.5-trubo,1.0,0.5,0.8615384615384616,0.9375,0.6842105263157895,0.2129721302892312,0.7058408066334626,0.6917456557634064,0.7890691560703832,1.115646258503401,-0.5837029964815631,0.7771236333052985,-0.36637161333957724,0.8966049382716049,-0.4117964432208108,1.625,0.9922897185279049,0.3297413793103448,0.7274226385575254,0.0,0.0,2.1249999999999996,0.5525283752100141,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,1.1443806398687446,0.5517586167445461,0.573529411764706,-0.5425015360388699,0.07954545454545464,0.044982360140925604,1.3,1.0451554033951607,1.9140625000000002,1.399068456353563,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.18749999999999997,0.4277606437664822,-0.038461538461538526,-0.3757712550030027,-0.13075366717248352,-0.054856880516334326,0.17460317460317476,-0.19105086829667856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.9090909090909091,0.5377305194298877,0.2161335499820844,0.4176885804869295,-1.0173203284507857,1.2547741475982526,1.4478613712344564

Morocco, meanwhile, were banned from the 1998, 2006 and 2012 World Cups for their refusal to play in qualifiers against Israel. These were among several irregularities, Caf says, which included the ordering of the preliminary draw for the Nations Cup and the World Cup to take place in Dakar, Senegal on 25 January - a move which Caf says undermined its authority. Tunisia's actions ""contravened Caf's statutes and regulations, not to mention the letter and the spirit of fair play and the principles of loyalty, integrity and mutual respect which are the foundation of sport and particularly football,"" the statement added. The sanction for Tunisia was handed down during an Executive Committee meeting in Cairo on 12 September, with the Carthage Eagles given 30 days to appeal.

Unlike iOS 11, it groups notifications together by app instead of sending floods of notifications from any one app. The iBooks, Apple News, Stocks, and Voice Memos apps have all been redesigned, and the Messages app now has Memojis (custom animated Animoji avatars).

Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans use their legs as sensors, detecting anything out of place and adjusting accordingly, like how sailors adjust rudder when waves hit. Robotized devices can be useful at home or work, but they're still not quite ready to take on our toughest environments. Can robots ever learn through experience? MIT researchers suggest they can using Deep Q Learning - an implementation of reinforcement learning with neural networks. While traditional robotics has used trial-and-error approaches, this new method allows machines to ""learn by doing."" They propose combining both processes together: robots run experiments until good results are achieved; then those robots continue experimenting while continuously improving. As the robots improve, the environment becomes increasingly more difficult, allowing them to develop skills faster than before. These programs could also affect self-driving cars-a process known as deep reinforcement learning offers greater safety benefits over the current state-of-the art.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Apple Glasses could have the ability to transform any surface into a virtual touch interface, according to a patent that the company filed back in 2016. The patent describes using augmented reality (AR) technology to project an interface onto surfaces, and detect touch input. This would allow users to interact with the projected interface in a variety of ways, such as tapping, swiping, and pinching. The patent also suggests that Apple Glasses could be used to project virtual buttons, sliders, and other user interface elements onto surfaces such as walls, tables, and flooring. This would allow users to control a device or application without having to use physical buttons or a touchscreen. The patent also mentions that the glasses could communicate their position to the device, allowing for more precise tracking of user interactions. The ability to turn any surface into a touch interface could have huge implications for both the entertainment and productivity industries. Games could be played on your living room wall, allowing for a much larger play area than what's currently offered by smartphones and tablets. Businesses could also take advantage of this technology, using it to create interactive presentations or training materials. Of course, there are still many technical challenges that need to be overcome before this kind of technology can be put into practice.

Origi also went close when his low shot was saved by Stephen Bywater. Tom Naylor inadvertently put the ball in his own net after the break before Daniel Sturridge tapped in his first and then thumped home the Reds' fifth. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made only four changes from the XI that started in the 2-0 league defeat at Burnley on Saturday. The quality of the visiting team was soon apparent at the Pirelli Stadium against a Burton side who have had a mixed start to their first ever season in the Championship. After Liverpool's Belgian forward Origi cleverly profited from tricky work in the box from Sadio Mane, Brazilian Firmino doubled the lead following a terrible throw-out from goalkeeper Bywater. It was 3-0 just after the hour when the unfortunate Naylor had little time to react as James Milner's ball came towards him at pace. And substitute Sturridge then grabbed a late double, converting at the far post from Milner's pass before firing in low from 15 yards. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""There were still a few situations where we were missing a bit of sharpness but the main problem was, it was unbelievable, our build-up and style of play at Burnley - one more pass but 15 times we are completely free in the box. ""So we needed to use this game and that's what we did and it was better."" Burton manager Nigel Clough: ""It's difficult for our lads to compete with that sort of quality. With this being 72 hours before the Derby game, our focus was always with that one. ""When you think we finished with a couple of teenagers and a 20- or 21-year-old, you could train with them for a couple of seasons and not gain the experience they've got tonight.""",human,1.6515151515151516,1.3333333333333333,1.9230769230769231,1.84375,1.631578947368421,-0.687804384659597,-0.7452249135048766,-0.5892329371858985,-0.38305801166089937,0.49816849816849773,0.44795638511154584,0.8568286213366114,0.7198790315802897,0.7196106362773028,0.8051385850688088,0.6538461538461537,0.7297379551660881,0.5172413793103448,0.25333056984382607,0.0,0.0,0.01098901098901095,0.7233805418037512,0.5954492394927332,0.3273440654085767,-0.12115857891083502,-0.035563339184540285,0.6176470588235293,0.16452621047331523,-0.23006993006993015,0.5459894289235956,0.3384615384615386,1.9687128004704666,0.5889423076923079,0.7626285358506757,0.7011035889826579,0.5703689926681036,0.10096153846153842,0.2800537476064034,0.9112426035502955,0.9330250183680656,0.6839422590560679,0.32172924421294824,0.09768009768009772,0.7674535170340648,0.23076923076923078,0.4213250442347432,0.0,0.0,1.3454545454545455,2.1818181818181817,-0.006680148445176036,0.6154975546547438,0.6351894202585116,0.3512877579024437,0.009667353052002545,0.13773242009693853

It covers how to add a second factor to your SSH login, use agent forwarding safely, exit from stuck sessions gracefully, find out what's running on some suspicious servers you're connected too anonymously (and why), port-scan with an interactive interface in the terminal itself, set up public key authentication so that only certain people can access your server...

I'm sure this'll make lots of peoples' days better:) Agent Forwarding: The Easiest Way To Make Your SSH Login More Secure - A quick post explaining one way to minimize security risks by adding another layer of protection when logging into remote systems via ssh. Agent forwarding is simple but it helps protect against common attacks such as MitM or session hijacking which are documented here If there was ever any doubt about whether two factors were necessary beyond password strength, please read this paper first before deciding what level of encryption might best fit your needs.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Wednesday, showed no cognitive benefits to those who exercised regularly for just half an hour a day; they performed nearly as well when given rest breaks between workouts or shorter bouts of higher intensity activity. It's not clear why longer amounts of moderate physical activity did not improve memory and other cognition; it could be because low blood flow is associated with poorer performance during short bursts of high-intensity aerobic exercise - it's possible that lasting periods of lower energy use would have been too much without sufficient recovery time afterward. It also might mean we need more than 20 minutes of vigorous exercise per week (which would equate to about four sessions most days) if we want long term improvements in our brains. The study involved people aged 40-65 years old, randomly assigned to one of three groups: Those participating in regular vigorous exercise, which included walking briskly; moderate exercise such as swimming at around 60 effort level of maximum heart rate; or sitting doing nothing but their own thoughts. Participants were asked to do this daily from March 2014 until August 2015, then tested again after 12 months by completing various mental tests including identifying words that rhyme and repeating sequences of numbers backwards. This was achieved through two separate studies, using two independent samples of participants. In both cases, they reported similar results: People taking part in these activities had better working memory, attention span and ability to remember names. During testing, there wasn't any significant difference in how fast these individuals responded. This suggests that intensive exercise has a positive effect on general thinking skills rather than speed alone. Another strength of the research was the fact that all participants lived within driving distance of the University of Exeter campus where researchers monitored them before each test. Doing so helped ensure that confounding factors like stress levels weren't unfairly affecting their responses. But while this may give us some clues as to what a healthy lifestyle can achieve, it's difficult to say how impactful exercise really is on our minds. A 2011 study found that older adults who walked once every five days over an eight month period reduced the risk of dementia by almost 50, raising concerns over whether increasing your physical fitness will hinder cognitive decline later in life. Much work needs to be done to establish exactly what the relationship between exercise and learning are. That said, the data collected shows that different types of prolonged physical activity seem to affect our long-term memory differently. Moderate exercise appears to help maintain overall cognition, improving working memory, accuracy of recalling names, word order recognition and figuring out rhymes versus reciting lists backward in English speaking populations. Similarly, scores rose with intense exercise, although only among non-English speakers and not among men. However, those taking part in vigorous exercise didn't fare quite as well, showing significantly worse recall rates for noun pairs compared to others. They even struggled slightly less with ability to recite the alphabet, perhaps suggesting they use fewer resourcesare less efficient learners. One odd finding was that men tended to show greater improvement across the board in remembering noun pairs following vigorous exercise, possibly indicating differences in intellectual ability based on gender. When considering these findings, it seems likely that different kinds of improvements in cognition are linked to different aspects of physical health. For instance, certain conditions tend to worsen the performance of people engaged in high intensity exercises, particularly cardiovascular ones like running. Inflammation is associated with poor muscle function, potentially hindering stamina. If you're training intensely, make sure you get adequate sleep and drink plenty of water throughout the process to keep yourself healthy - body failure happens far quicker than mind fatigue! However, as mentioned above, just 30 minutes worth of vigorous exercise won't reap the same rewards. Reducing sedentary behavior is important since remaining seated anyway contributes to obesity, which itself lowers IQ. Likewise, avoiding alcohol helps cut down on oxidative damage to cells and improves processing speeds. And eating healthier foods reduces inflammation towards the nervous system and prevents insulin resistance. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables means you'll naturally produce vitamins B6 and E, two nutrients proven to aid mental functioning. You should strive to eat less meat though, especially red meats and processed animal products, since they contain inflammatory substances in abundance.",gpt_j,4.931818181818182,4.333333333333333,4.3076923076923075,4.328125,4.0,1.2278931227652414,0.37020776646767184,1.2158003609351353,0.8861332637499323,0.46609611586570104,0.8337124340908108,0.1504110258010254,0.7808199664697567,0.13868976503385108,0.7537153460366034,1.370967741935484,1.7215884779529107,1.5333704115684093,1.4967551801034162,0.0,0.0,0.7926267281105991,0.8428117804042363,-0.7214454685266706,-0.3711674117752481,0.9082007991743627,0.7986534855996341,0.3823529411764707,0.6262802997795971,-0.3551319648093842,1.351357520266591,-0.16774193548387095,0.3665663794959472,-0.5695564516129031,0.9551840693502993,0.27610665533860046,0.8044874196714171,0.030241935483870937,0.26045941288821817,0.26302729528535973,0.5590019444312747,0.6917290779447517,0.45733709894777014,0.10650281618023566,-0.007348060469962773,0.03225806451612903,0.17668469596940847,0.0,0.0,4.745454545454545,5.636363636363637,-0.3854761219899299,1.3947539185117914,0.39209945872349344,-1.1996261213632529,1.0533545674268405,1.316305830137461

Wyze was testing new methods to measure business metrics when a test database had its security protocols removed. The leak was discovered by a cyber-security consulting firm who only gave Wyze 14 minutes to fix the issue before going public with their findings. Leaked details include email addresses, device identifier data, and Alexa connection tokens. The security firm accused Wyze of exposing internal API tokens, sending data to Chinese servers, and collecting health information from users.

A s an assistant, I suggest these tips to help you get the most out of GitHub Sponsors: 1. Create a compelling project: A project that resonates with people is more likely to get sponsors. Try to create a project that is innovative, solves a real problem, or has the potential to make a significant impact. 2. Make your GitHub Sponsorship page easy to find: Make sure your sponsorship page is properly linked on your GitHub project page, and prominently displayed on your personal site or blog. You can also share the link on social media. 3. Provide value to your sponsors: Sponsors are more likely to continue giving if they feel like they are getting something in return. Consider offering perks such as access to exclusive content, early access to new features, or special recognition on your project page. 4. Engage with your sponsors: Engage with your sponsors by responding to their questions, acknowledging their contributions, and providing regular updates on your project's progress. 5. Take advantage of GitHub-sponsored events: GitHub sponsors organize events, webinars, and workshops for sponsored developers to aid them in expanding their projects.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet. It had been a 'difficult week' she admitted, an understatement if ever there was one. 'I got it wrong. I am sorry. And I am learning from this,' she said, in the most humble manner we have yet seen from this proud and unbending of politicians. The media and the public were looking for a show of contrition from the beleaguered leader, and she duly delivered. This was the first time she had admitted she had made a mistake, and for the Conservatives, for whom the pursuit of power is the only real goal, this was an important step. Her place at the top of the Tory party is secure. As usual, the Chancellor Philip Hammond did not disappoint, and he came out with his most bizarre analogy yet. He compared the Prime Minister to Winston Churchill, noting that Churchill was the first person to recognise the threat from Hitler, and that he was also in a minority in the House of Commons on the issue. It was true, Hammond said, that Churchill had 'the lonely furrow to plough' but he was not alone for long. And just like Churchill, May is having to manage a divided party, a party that is determined to 'fight on' as they face up to the prospect of defeat and humiliation. But the Prime Minister has a rather different relationship with her party. When she stood up at the Tory conference last year and announced that she was going to call a general election, the party roared with approval. When she took the stage in Manchester this week, the party bellowed with disdain. She was there to announce a 'new' Tory social policy, one that is designed to appeal to a new generation of voters, as well as try to win back those that have deserted the party in the last few years. There were promises of more money for the NHS, an end to the public sector pay freeze, and a cap on energy prices. And there was a determination to tackle the 'everyday injustices' suffered by those 'just about managing'. But despite the new rhetoric, her speech was notable for what was not said. There was no mention of the 'Northern Powerhouse', a policy that was close to the heart of George Osborne, but has been dropped by his successor. And there was no mention of the 'dementia tax', or indeed the 'triple lock' on pensions. She also did not talk about the social care crisis, or what the government was planning to do to alleviate the situation. She did not talk about the 'difficult week', or about the 'deal' that she had done with the DUP. And she did not talk about the Grenfell Tower disaster, or how the government planned to respond to the tragedy. Instead she talked about the need to address the housing crisis, by building more homes, and on the need to give young people the skills that they need to flourish in the modern economy. She talked about how the government would create a 'fairer Britain', one that would work for everyone, not just a privileged few. And she talked about how the Conservatives would protect the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. She talked about the need to challenge the ideology of Islamic extremism, and how the government planned to address the issue of migration. And she talked about the need to 'come together' and deliver a good Brexit deal for the UK. But in reality, she could have been talking about anything. After all, these are issues that could have come from the Labour or Lib Dem manifesto, and indeed many of the things she was talking about had already been announced by the previous Labour government. It was a speech that was meant to heal the divisions in her party and in the country, but it did neither. For her party, it was too little, too late. They had wanted her to go a long time ago, and now they want her gone. And for the country, they want to know what the government is planning to do to address the problems we are facing. It is a time for strong and stable leadership, not a weak and wobbly one.",llama_65B,4.818181818181818,5.333333333333333,6.246153846153846,6.390625,4.894736842105263,-1.0671311702860466,-0.4728267906122867,-0.7579922035016865,-0.4511716672396461,-0.12355212355212372,0.4298469022585034,0.5880935603391448,0.6602280706603963,0.6242075408742077,0.7293432380610736,0.04054054054054057,0.31619872897777823,0.1929170549860205,0.5671656965027112,0.0,0.0,-0.61003861003861,0.050761760448658017,-0.49318371913664055,-0.014746740516475133,-0.10110192226681161,0.5576733997880359,-0.11367249602543725,0.18921547802141075,0.19778869778869787,0.8061017921777177,0.7459459459459461,0.6861371404108854,0.6883445945945946,0.8176659528415805,-0.4318734945647678,-0.29048901360208834,0.4003378378378378,1.3450917356322365,0.8939708939708937,0.296561604629878,0.11308425268971556,0.17073995507130318,0.3397683397683401,0.2262309158257301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.4909090909090907,2.727272727272727,0.4256762328938006,1.2632303127878757,0.1012805158209443,0.757763355263981,-0.5801163151505494,-0.3883718149394116

Object Capture allows developers to create 3D models from real-world objects using only the iPhone's camera, and Apple's new ARKit 3.0 will allow the export of these models to be used in augmented reality. This will also allow for creations in augmented reality to be shared on a wider scale. Xcode Cloud can be used to write code on a Mac, but can then be accessed from any other Mac or iOS device. It will work with both Objective-C and Swift, and will even work offline. In-app events allow developers to track user actions and reactions in their apps, and custom pages give them the opportunity to create a homepage for their app on the App Store. SwiftUI is a new programming language for the Swift 5 release, which allows for faster development of user interfaces. Apple's goal with SwiftUI is to allow for customization of UI without having to rebuild the entire app. It will also be easier to translate apps into different languages with new localization tools, and will allow for automatic translation to be done on the user's device. Apple also announced Core ML 3, which will be capable of up to 100 times faster model processing and new machine learning features, including vision, sound, and language.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge has increased the amount of energy extractable from photosynthetic bacteria by over an order of magnitude. Scientists have been trying to harvest solar power for years, but efforts often struggled with losses in efficiency due to a poorly understood phenomenon known as 'exciton quenching' (eQ). This new technique removes eQ and could pave the way towards more efficient green technology, say scientists. The work is published today in Science Advances on 30 November 2018. Light-harvesting complexes use photons absorbed by chlorophyll molecules embedded in their structure to conduct excitation energy across protein scaffolding structures called light-harvesting antennae or LHCs. These always comprise many hundreds of proteins, which are arranged into subcomplexes linked together like beads on string. When excited by sunlight this results in millions of simultaneous chemical reactions that produce ATP - adenosine triphosphate, a molecule we all need to live to survive. To make things even more complicated, certain protein components don't just absorb specific wavelengths when they get hit, instead absorbing strongly at different points around the visible spectrum: red, orange and yellow, before fading out. Therefore most systems must aggregate multiple pigments to maximize absorption rates. Despite these complications, organic chemists have located the main sources of photovoltaics in nature. They contain pigments such as bacteriochlorophyll b (BChlb) that can give rise to extremely high electron charge transfer efficiencies (90) under conditions where the pigment aggregates through hydrogen bonding between neighbor proteins. However, despite intensive research, synthetic methods fail to deliver similar values. Failing techniques include temperature cycling, controlled pH environments, and attempts to break apart existing H bonds - thereby destroying the thermodynamics dictated aggregation mechanism. So far no one has created a system capable of harvesting 100 of incident photon flux while remaining stable at room temperatures; however there remains hope if current knowledge about molecular mechanisms involved in light collection are applied correctly. The researchers report that they achieve near-quantitative energy extraction levels (95), i.e., close to theoretical limits set by quantum mechanics, using a simple model based on the photosystem I complex isolated from Synechocystis PCC 6803 cyanobacteria. This discovery opens up the possibility of achieving very high storage capacities without needing any catalyst. In fact, it also allows us to understand how to stabilize a large number of chromophores in one place using fine tuning the intermolecular interactions among them. It was previously impossible because the critical threshold for optimum performance depended nonlinearly upon the total concentration of BChls. Excitons are unstable particles consisting of an antiparallel pair of electrons bound to positive holes, carried within energy bands of opposite spin polarization. One important property of excitations is their ability to travel long distances in space and time, transported along weakly interacting channels within semiconductors and insulators, until some point when a collision occurs releasing its stored energy in heat rather than electricity. Coherent optical control (COC), an experimental approach developed recently at Harvard University, uses laser pulses to induce coherent oscillations in electronic states resulting in the production of single excitons. A ubiquity in biochemistry demands energy be delivered reliably to every nucleotide residue of DNA and RNA during transcription and translation. Unsurprisingly then, the concept itself extends naturally to latching onto biological processes wherever the creationdestruction of transient quantum superpositions is required. For example, recent studies from Robert Feynman's laboratory demonstrated COC can drive water splitting to create protons and oxygen. Another demonstration showed that repeated applications of laser pulses followed by exposure to ambient lighting will cause a luminescent filament to appear spontaneously after hours of waiting. Finally, other approaches used femtojoule lasers to generate subthreshold electric potential differences and trigger ionic pumps in lipid bilayer membranes by means of ultrafast opto-synaptic stimulation. In contrast to the above cases, this study demonstrates that low-power laser illumination can reverse microscopic entropy gradients across the outer membrane of cells to harvest both massless wavepackets and eastbound Coulomb currents. Specifically the authors demonstrate that decelerating fast rising Gaussian packets traveling at least two orders of magnitude faster than bulk lattice vibrations can accumulate substantial amounts of kinetic momentum in less than 1 ms under ambient conditions provided suitable optical field parameters are met. Such counterintuitive behavior may provide insight into an understanding of why nature evolved rapid electrochemical transport in biomembranes. COC therefore offers a fundamentally novel physical picture of how the world works at the atomic scale beyond traditional models based on classical physics. To date almost nothing is known about how electrocytes living inside our bodies interact with light. Maybe down deep something still doesn't fit right? Not only do they offer what appears to be a solution to the problem of eQ, but this new method solves a century old conundrum concerning whether shining lights shine dimmed the way too bright, not setting standards for talking!!! 16th weekbarestatistics taken away.

The Spotify Wrapped website, which has received over 1 million visits, breaks down a user's listening habits across the year, giving them a visual representation of their most-played artists, songs, and genres. With the Mux Data API, you can build your own version of Spotify Wrapped without any of the data science work. Follow along with our step-by-step guide and code examples, and build your own Wrapped in less than 10 minutes! Want to try it out yourself? Sign up for a free Mux account and get started with a 20 credit towards your first month! Start by importing the Mux Python SDK into your project. Mux provides a number of methods for getting data from your project. In this example, we'll be using the Mux API to get a list of all the videos that the user has watched over the past 12 months. The getevents method will return a list of all events for the past 12 months. In this example, we're only interested in the videoplay events, which we can specify by passing a query parameter of typevideoplay to the method. We can also specify a timeframe of the past 12 months using the since and until parameters. Now that we have a list of videoplay events, we can extract some useful information. Now that we have a list of video IDs, we can use the getvideo method to get data about the video itself. The getvideo method will return a dictionary that contains information like the title, description, and thumbnail. To be more concise, we can also write the code above as a one-liner. Now that we have the video title, we can loop through the list of video IDs and print out the title for each video. Now that we have the list of videos, let's count the total number of plays across all videos. We can count the total number of plays using the groupby method. This method will return a dictionary that contains the number of plays grouped by the videoid. Now we'll create a graph that shows the total number of video plays over the course of the past 12 months. To create the graph, we'll use the sum of the number of plays as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. The getevents method will return a list of events, where each event is a dictionary. The event dictionary contains the timestamp of the event, the videoid, and the amount of time the video was watched. We can loop through the event list to find the number of plays for each day in the past 12 months. Now we'll plot the data on a graph. To generate the graph, we'll use the plotly library, which provides a number of useful plotting methods. We can use the graphobjs method to create an array of trace objects, which contain the information for each data series. The graphobjs method takes the x-axis and y-axis data as parameters. Since we're plotting the number of plays over the past 12 months, the x-axis will contain the day of each month. We can use the datetime module to get the first day of each month. Since we're plotting the number of plays on the y-axis, we'll use the sum of the plays for each day. Now we can use the plotly library to generate the graph. The graph object will contain the data for the graph. We can use the createdict method to turn the graph object into a dictionary. We can then convert the dictionary into JSON and embed it in our HTML template. Now let's build a graph that shows the average amount of time the user spent watching videos. To create the graph, we'll use the sum of the time watched as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. To get the total time watched across all videos, we'll use the sum of the playtime property from each event dictionary. Now we can build the graph using the same method as before. Once again, we can embed the JSON data into our HTML template. Now let's build a graph that shows the total number of unique videos watched. To create the graph, we'll use the count of unique video IDs as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. The first step is to get a list of all the unique video IDs. The getevents method will return a list of events, where each event is a dictionary.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Voters here have yet to make their choice in the regional election. But already there's something of the victory march in the chancellor's step. It has been years since her party was last so high up on a national opinion poll, and she is making good this week what some critics had predicted would be her disastrous autumn slump. As it happens, you don't need an opinion survey or any sort of scientific measurement to know that Angela Merkel, leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU), is back with us again after all these months when everyone expected - even perhaps hoped for - the worst. And if you believe polls at least, history will agree. In late May 2015, just days before more than 30 million Germans went to vote, every single one showed voters wanting another term for Ms Merkel rather than backing her CDU-led coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party SPD. The disaster of ""Merkozentrum"" Merkel center began then. But today there are hardly any other options: Chancellor Merkel leads a four-party grand alliance in parliament, by far the strongest bloc possible under Germany's electoral system. She sits high atop both domestic politics and Europe; her biggest problem now seems how not to cling too tightly to either role. That should help explain why no less than five decades ago, over the course of two terms in office, from 1974 to 1982, Ms Merkel did exactly as many others thought almost impossible about Mr Schmidturm Neukolln 7677: moved into Berlin's famous Kaiserdamm bridgehead of flats. To this day, people who remember those times say the country never quite recovered from their loss.

Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters police had targeted a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch attacks in a matter of hours. Suspects had opened fire on police, he said. There were also overnight searches in the Brussels area. Speaking after Thursday's raids in Verviers, Mr Van Der Sypt said: ""The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised."" After the raid, four Kalashnikovs, bomb-making equipment and police clothing were found, according to local media. Security forces remain in the Verviers area. Anti-terror raids also took place late on Thursday in Brussels and surrounding towns, including Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Anderlecht and Schaerbeek. Earlier on Thursday two suspected Islamists were arrested in the Brussels suburb of Zaventem, local media reported. Belgian officials say more than 300 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic militant groups in Syria and Iraq. Belgian journalist Mark Eeckhaut told the BBC the suspects in Verviers had wanted to attack a police station and cause a large number of casualties. The terror threat level in Belgium has been raised to three - the second highest, Mr Van Der Sypt said. Witnesses in Verviers reported hearing heavy gunfire for several minutes and at least three explosions. Witness Marylou Fletcher told the BBC: ""We were going back from shopping and saw the police cars. We thought there was an accident then we heard something blowing up. There were a lot of gunshots. ""My children cried. They are just terrified."" The area around the train station has been cordoned off and reports on social media say there is a heavy police presence in the town centre. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel later said the security operation ""shows the government's determination to fight those who want to spread terror,"" his spokesman said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said events in Belgium ""look like yet another indication of the huge risk we face from Islamist extremist terror in Europe."" ""We have to remain extremely vigilant, we have to take all the steps we can to beat this evil,"" he told reporters in Washington where he is to hold talks with President Barack Obama. Verviers is in the province of Liege, close to the German border, and has a population of about 56,000. The incident comes a week after attacks in neighbouring France that killed 17 people. Belgian media has reported that some of the weapons used in those attacks were bought in Brussels. Mr Van Der Sypt said no weapons link with the killings in France had been established. However there are fears that the suspects captured or killed in this operation could have been inspired by the killings in France to accelerate their own plans, the BBC's Chris Morris in Verviers says. The attacks in and around Paris - on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market and police - have heightened security fears in several European countries. In May last year, four people were killed inside the Jewish museum in Brussels.

The buses were crowded at the time of the explosions, which police said were caused by improvised explosive devices. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The attack is the latest in a series of bombings and shootings targeting civilians and security forces in Kenya, which is struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency in neighbouring Somalia. In December 2014, militants from al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda-linked group based in Somalia, attacked a bus on Thika road, killing 28 people. The Kenyan government has deployed thousands of troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission to fight al-Shabaab. The militants have responded with a wave of attacks in Kenya, including an assault on a university campus in April 2015 that left nearly 150 people dead.",text-davinci-003,0.29545454545454547,0.3333333333333333,0.16923076923076924,0.203125,0.3157894736842105,-0.03250306898254724,0.34028678706151566,0.08986862063554615,0.14385176038034833,-0.1282798833819242,0.039385358229196955,-0.4070647603027754,-0.19845185291946632,-0.3487654320987653,-0.1200304156252035,-0.5,-0.6050873069272993,-0.7684729064039408,-0.5130665538502055,0.0,0.0,0.3877551020408161,-0.007236827923712686,0.1807319219196384,0.5363782550170562,-0.09844134536505326,-0.07948029995316443,0.7100840336134453,-0.16789777064181655,-0.6454545454545455,0.006208283550802459,-0.6285714285714286,0.6345884152479561,0.8258928571428573,0.01646009219878887,0.18779560419178334,0.42798476160999926,-0.5089285714285714,-0.12783720563750917,-0.5494505494505495,-0.4998638524346993,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,0.38095238095238115,1.0981605170759383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545454545454545,0.09090909090909091,0.11806683618074726,0.10218027279952967,-0.2206265169077027,0.02494093575804103,-0.08173064703720788,0.07050207547004332

Murray is as relaxed about that as he has been this week at the ATP event in Indian Wells, where he has progressed to the quarter-finals. He loosened up in more ways than one as he chatted to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller and BBC Scotland's Kheredine Idessane in the commentary box... ""It is three weeks on Saturday, that's all I know. Tennis players aren't normally very good with dates. ""We just know it is the Indian Wells week or the Monte Carlo week or whatever. So I know it is the weekend before Monte Carlo and the weekend after Miami. ""We will probably do the honeymoon later in the year, probably in the off-season. I am not sure where we're going to go yet, but there's a few ideas. ""I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. ""So I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. ""I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way."" ""My brother Jamie's one. Ross Hutchins is also going to be a best man and hopefully a good friend in Barcelona [Peruvian Carlos Mier, who was Murray's room-mate at the Sanchez-Casal Academy]. ""But I'm not sure yet if he [Mier] is going to be able to come. He's in Singapore just now and I'm going to try to get him over. ""Kim has four bridesmaids and no maid of honour and I was saying,'imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends you've had since you were at school'. ""It is very, very difficult to choose one. She was like'go on, pick one', but I said no. ""I didn't spend a lot of time with my brother when we were 15 to 20 really, because he was training in France and I was training in Spain. ""Carlos, he was my best friend during that time, which were very important years in my life, when I moved away from my family and friends. ""He was the guy who was always there for me. I feel like he knows me extremely well. ""My brother obviously knows me from a child - and Ross over the last six or seven years. We've become extremely close and been through a lot together as well. ""Picking one was a very difficult thing to do because I had three guys that were clearly my three best friends and I would like all them to be involved in some way."" ""It looks a lot easier from up here, that's for sure. It's extremely simple. Every shot looks easy when you're watching from the commentary box, but it certainly isn't. ""The one thing I think I would do as a commentator is give more credit to the players, because I have a good idea how tricky the conditions are here. But I don't think I have the voice to be a good broadcaster.""",human,3.477272727272727,4.666666666666667,4.984615384615385,4.953125,5.2631578947368425,-1.7091494909358906,-0.9065848100772137,-1.2281812513538513,-0.9917987371207753,-0.5252525252525255,0.4317199413986151,0.3296888141295208,0.675415175193308,0.28872053872053904,0.7740788790194164,-0.5303030303030303,-0.1691718487047325,1.244514106583072,1.1309656313599779,0.030303030303030304,0.17141982574219336,-1.0,-0.11546556429557833,-0.35023191648833896,0.4531558423674386,-0.6174957118353346,0.07580539379045177,-0.7067736185383245,0.10922714795990135,0.8272727272727276,0.742084527703289,0.19393939393939408,0.8197927644663688,-0.4971590909090909,0.31535593277644014,0.26556954128130983,0.5081844285460769,0.19886363636363633,1.0298277098352902,1.1608391608391606,0.5914949944659703,0.28528072837632773,0.265125962020813,0.15776815776815786,0.31724369596285223,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.17141982574219336,1.0,3.4545454545454546,0.6588764801703574,0.6985451754975868,1.2027760222100272,1.3333850085614312,-1.1750591967943347,-0.8919944057401067

The death of four US troops in Niger in October 2017 underscored the growing American military commitment to the Sahel region. There is no clear path to victory for either side in this battle. Instability in the Sahel has grown since a 2012 Islamist takeover of northern Mali by militants linked to Al Qaeda that was largely reversed by a French-led military operation launched the following year. A lawless triangle where the borders of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger meet has become a haven for jihadists, and violence has spread to coastal states including Benin and Ivory Coast. The French military put the number of dead at 10 fighters, and said that a number of others were ""put out of action."" The Algerian army later said the death toll was 25. ""The important thing is to guarantee the security of the population,"" Colonel Major Lamidi said. ""For that, we will continue until the last terrorist is killed."" Afghan forces, backed by American airstrikes and advisers, have been battling the Taliban militant group since the US invaded in 2001. Despite claims by the US and Afghan governments that the Taliban has been weakened, the group has recently conducted high-profile attacks in major Afghan cities. The US has also stepped up its campaign against ISIS-affiliated groups in the country, deploying more advisers and conducting more airstrikes on the group's positions. The Syrian civil war began as a largely unarmed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. It has since morphed into a full-scale war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. The war is being waged on multiple fronts, with non-jihadist rebel groups, jihadists, the Syrian government and its allies all fighting one another. The jihadist groups include ISIS, which at one point controlled vast swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq, as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of Syrian Islamist factions whose backbone is made up of a former Al Qaeda affiliate. The Russian military intervened in September 2015 to prop up the Assad government, which was struggling to hold territory in the face of a rebel advance. In late 2016, government forces drove rebels from eastern Aleppo, the country's biggest city before the war. A series of Russian-backed ceasefire deals has failed to bring about a political solution to the conflict. The US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria began targeting ISIS in 2014, driving it from Mosul and Raqqa in 2017 and inflicting significant casualties on the group. The US is also backing a Kurdish-Arab alliance known as the Syrian Democratic Forces in the east of the country. The war in Yemen, the region's poorest country, began in 2014 after Shia Houthi rebels seized control of the capital, Sanaa, and forced the government into exile. A coalition of Arab states assembled by Saudi Arabia launched an air campaign in 2015 to try to dislodge the Houthis from the capital and to reinstate the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The conflict has left at least 10,000 people dead, exacerbated a cholera outbreak and pushed millions to the brink of starvation. The fighting has taken on a sectarian dimension, with Sunni states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE battling the Shia Houthis. Al Qaeda's local branch, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has taken advantage of the chaos to seize territory in the country's south-east. The US has continued to conduct airstrikes against AQAP and a local ISIS affiliate. The US began a campaign of airstrikes against ISIS targets in Libya in 2016, but stepped",llama_65B,4.068181818181818,3.8333333333333335,3.8461538461538463,3.796875,3.736842105263158,-0.08237401649332499,-0.0931855421313676,-0.025116594487465636,0.03196605334928733,0.26530612244897944,0.31935373267875095,0.16652649285113527,0.10825235422922791,0.1141975308641978,0.03289678053177749,0.4285714285714286,0.2894422496039468,-0.17918719211822656,0.4670187488293025,0.0,0.0,0.12755102040816318,0.006077403790854677,0.551385524500592,0.745520481102066,0.02461033634126324,-0.005034378215952737,0.6281512605042019,0.3605612869266412,-0.44545454545454544,-0.04428958981195096,0.37142857142857144,1.2722618805150727,1.0267857142857142,-0.0355448954536596,0.2733469349902625,0.1169759484097986,-0.13392857142857142,0.9679027562657133,-0.5494505494505495,-0.01511047450924775,-0.018679095310354728,0.09528477291401714,0.3174603174603175,0.33630237844775923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.309090909090909,4.090909090909091,0.20658458032364904,1.039147103770622,0.7446767101381995,-0.04014136395573689,0.16027373032576173,0.2612173583672464

But there are also some notable additions that will change the way you use your devices. Apple's big announcements for its operating systems are below. Apple Watch: New faces, a dedicated App Store, and more The Apple Watch will receive two new faces: a modular face called ""Gradient"" that can display up to nine complications (i.e. information like your next calendar event) and a ""X-Large"" version of its ""X-Large"" analog face for showing more details at once. The Apple Watch will also get its own App Store, a new Voice Memos app, the ability to use the speaker and microphone for phone calls, and an Apple Books app. A new Noise app can also detect the decibel level of the room you're in and warn you if it's too loud. The Apple Watch will also track your menstrual cycle (and when you're fertile), and a new Trends tab in the Activity app will show you 90 days' worth of your activity and how you compare to the previous 90 days. Finally, Apple is also introducing a new version of its Apple Watch for the first time since 2016. The Apple Watch Series 5 has an always-on screen that doesn't dim and is still on when you lift your wrist to check the time. The Series 5 starts at 399. iPad: External drive support, mouse support, a Home screen redesign, and more iPad will get its own dedicated operating system with iPadOS. The iPad will now support external storage (including thumb drives), as well as mouse support. The iPad will also get a new Home screen with widgets, a redesigned Photos app, and new multitasking features for apps that support it (think using two apps at once). There's also a new ""Dark Mode"" to make your iPad easier to read at night. The Apple Pencil is also getting a new ""Pencil Kit"" for developers to support handwriting and drawing across iPadOS. iPhone: A redesigned Maps app, Memoji stickers, and a new Look Around feature iOS 13 will get a redesigned Maps app. Apple says the new app is faster and more accurate with better information about roads, beaches, parks, and buildings. It will also have more detailed ground cover, better pedestrian data, and more precise addresses. The new app will be available in the U.S. by the end of 2019 and in more countries in 2020. There's also a new ""Look Around"" feature that gives you a street-level view of a city, similar to Google's Street View. It uses the same 3D rendering technology as the Apple Maps ""Flyover"" feature. Apple's new Memoji stickers are exactly what you'd expect. They're customizable stickers based on your Memoji that you can send to friends in iMessage. Mac: A new Music app, Sidecar, and Screen Time The Mac is getting an updated Music app and a new Sidecar feature that lets you use an iPad as a secondary display for your Mac. Apple's also introducing a new ""Find My"" app that combines its Find My Friends and Find My iPhone features into a single app. Screen Time will finally be available on the",llama_65B,4.371212121212121,5.5,4.230769230769231,4.203125,6.368421052631579,-0.7147591359404016,-0.6503068881362876,-0.3858476540890183,-0.3215518985451007,-0.4060150375939852,0.7016660142730413,-0.3885618166526493,0.4847787328435798,-0.4150422352176736,0.5555699990912211,0.3421052631578947,1.1687884257470615,0.4382940108892921,0.5839198973484698,0.02631578947368421,0.16007269816574266,-0.30827067669172953,0.5856790149262998,0.3261558234107303,0.5749819591733814,-0.6554121151936445,0.26365532302454575,-0.8250773993808052,-0.047370473793268246,-0.3349282296650717,0.16080796820088308,0.43157894736842106,0.920545508918168,-0.06578947368421052,0.6690651580685983,0.13376318474011234,0.5507012776071278,-0.3059210526315789,0.35444446103700805,0.13765182186234817,0.6149478527530189,-0.27527087825786006,-0.05800705269340564,0.4143692564745199,1.1846701323914446,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.22329687826943606,2.036363636363636,3.1818181818181817,0.438443892329164,1.071428939240544,0.453350880341369,0.5534673843410157,-0.5822767200530768,-0.6754225745422056

In addition, IBM and Red Hat will remain committed to the continued freedom of open source, via such efforts as Patent Promise, GPL Cooperation Commitment, the Open Invention Network and the LOT Network."" ""The acquisition of Red Hat is a game-changer. It changes everything about the cloud market,"" said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and CEO. ""IBM will become the world's 1 hybrid cloud provider, offering companies the only open cloud solution that will unlock the full value of the cloud for their businesses. ""Most companies today are only 20 percent along their cloud journey, renting compute power to cut costs,"" she said. ""The next 80 percent is about unlocking real business value and driving growth. This is the next chapter of the cloud. It requires shifting business applications to hybrid cloud, extracting more data and optimizing every part of the business, from supply chains to sales."" ""Open source is the default choice for modern IT solutions, and I'm incredibly proud of the role Red Hat has played in making that a reality in the enterprise,"" said Jim Whitehurst, president and CEO, Red Hat. ""Joining forces with IBM will provide us with a greater level of scale, resources and capabilities to accelerate the impact of open source as the basis for digital transformation and bring Red Hat to an even wider audience - all while preserving our unique culture and unwavering commitment to open source innovation.""

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The IFG says legislation will be needed to establish new policies on areas such as customs and immigration. The extra measures will place ""a huge burden"" on Parliament and government departments, the think tank says. The attitude of the SNP may also affect the passage of Brexit laws, it adds. In its report, Legislating Brexit, the IFG says that with the average Queen's Speech announcing only 20 new bills, the introduction of 15 Brexit bills before the UK even exits the EU ""will leave very little space for non-Brexit related legislation."" The report comes as Theresa May travels to Swansea with Brexit Secretary David Davis, where she will talk about the ""precious union"" of the UK. The prime minister will meet First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones, as well as local businesses, as she tries to show she is including all areas of Britain in negotiations with the EU. Mrs May will say: ""I want every part of the United Kingdom to be able to make the most of the opportunities ahead."" The IFG report anticipates the new bills will be in addition to the Great Repeal Bill, which will scrap the 1972 European Communities Act that paved the way for the UK to enter the then-EEC, ending the legal authority of EU law. The IFG - an independent charity that aims to increase government effectiveness - says departments will need ""ruthlessly to prioritise"" other legislation and find non-legislative routes to get the laws through, particularly given the government's narrow Commons majority. It warns that this will mean ministers having to achieve a fine balance between giving too little parliamentary scrutiny and too prolonged, in-depth examination of Brexit-related legislation. The IFG also argued that ""a lack of clarity"" about the role the devolved legislatures will play in legislating for Brexit could pose a problem. ""The attitude that the Scottish National Party (SNP) takes to the passage of Brexit-related legislation in Westminster could affect the smoothness with which that legislation passes through Parliament if they join forces with the Labour Party and Conservative rebels,"" the report says. Dr Hannah White, IFG's director of research, said the government had finite resources to draft new legislation and Brexit bills would take a ""big chunk"" out of its capacity to legislate in other areas. ""In the first session after the 2015 election the government passed 23 bills,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""So that's roughly the capacity that there is in government to draft these bills and in Parliament, in terms of parliamentary time, to pass them."" The reality, she suggested, was that the government's domestic priorities would ""take a hit in the next couple of sessions."" ""There'll have to be some really tight prioritisation in government to work out what else is going to be done aside from the Brexit legislation. ""The legislation required for Brexit will leave little parliamentary time for anything else - and making a success of it will require a large volume of bills and secondary legislation to be passed by Parliament against a hard deadline."" The Queen gave Royal Assent to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill last week, clearing the way for Theresa May to start talks to leave the European Union. The Bill allows the prime minister to notify Brussels that the UK is leaving the EU, with a two-year process of exit negotiations to follow. Mrs May says she will trigger the process by the end of the month.",human,3.590909090909091,2.8333333333333335,3.6,3.578125,4.0,-0.08625620325312627,0.5142108701449157,0.24067517217714693,0.7418719518420361,0.7198515769944338,0.5514944059626625,0.7300252312867956,0.32461224967915225,0.6815375982042648,0.2910548233702646,0.4545454545454546,1.0014577713782873,0.3808777429467084,0.7804011140892295,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,0.19549628024348883,0.7933825046980739,0.8889282040731177,0.760683123275412,0.5760394852846259,0.31283422459893057,0.33774376663756384,0.12727272727272748,0.25116090574863353,-0.3818181818181817,0.24371213884862808,1.5198863636363638,1.1209232974968313,-0.11552275045736975,0.2778473862325686,0.8352272727272727,1.6253332745571367,-0.027972027972027944,0.003577315730204457,0.332827516439049,0.1581724888962459,1.113997113997114,0.4519326781353442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2545454545454544,3.0,0.23508914124657546,1.0768799253115413,0.39744781570468013,-0.4607396649201876,0.6758064618611649,0.7783265481376602

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who will start second, was fifth-fastest. The Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas took third and fourth, with the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in sixth and seventh. McLaren's Jenson Button was eighth, while Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat were ninth and 10th. Ricciardo's team-mate Sebastian Vettel had a dismal session, coming 16th and being eliminated in the first part of qualifying. The Red Bulls were expected to struggle in Singapore, and the first part of qualifying saw Vettel eliminated along with Sauber's Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez and Lotus's Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Gutierrez and Grosjean were the only two to make it to Q2 on the super-soft tyre, and both were unable to improve on the option tyre, so did not make it to Q3. That left a nine-car shoot-out for pole, with Mercedes' Hamilton and Rosberg split by the two Williams. Raikkonen and Alonso were next, followed by Ricciardo, Button, Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne, Kvyat and Force India's Sergio Perez. Hamilton had already set a time more than half a second faster than Rosberg's, before a mistake on his final lap left the German on pole. He had a mistake-strewn final lap, leaving the door open for Rosberg to take pole. ""We know we are not the best in the race but it is a really good start and in the race anything can happen,"" Rosberg said. ""The conditions were changing all the time and you need to be at the top of your game to get it right. ""It's a great day for us. I feel really good and I can't wait for tomorrow. There is a great car behind me and I need to go for it. It is a long race and anything can happen."" Hamilton said: ""Congratulations to Nico. He did a great lap. I had a great lap going until the last corner. I was really happy with the lap I had done. ""I was feeling good with the car. It was going really well, I was really excited.

This could potentially result in charges of lying to federal investigators or obstructing justice. Additionally, there are ongoing investigations into his connections with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. If it is found that he colluded with Russia or committed other illegal acts related to the election, he could face charges such as conspiracy, election fraud, or even treason.

A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones in 3D using X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners at the Natural History Museum's Centre for GeoGenetics in Cambridge, which is part funded by a grant from the National Geographic Society. The researchers also plan to study DNA samples taken during expeditions that discovered new pterosaur species on islands off Madagascar or Komodo Island, an area where they haven't previously found any evidence of ancient reptiles living there - a sign that these animals might have lived elsewhere as well but were wiped out before scientists could explore them with advanced technology such as CT scanning. ""We are trying to bring all this information together to create a family tree,"" says David Martill of the University of Portsmouth, who leads the project along with his colleague Nizar Ibrahim. But even if they can assemble one based only on their physical remains, other experts say more questions will remain unsolved about Pteranodon than answers: How many subspecies did it evolve into?

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles date from the period of the Second Temple, during the time of King Herod about 2,000 years ago. The temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD during a Jewish rebellion. Some 600 segments of coloured stone floor have been found since archaeologists began examining the debris from the hilltop site in 2004. The plateau where the temples stood is the most sacred site in Judaism. It is joined by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound. Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam. The archaeologists say the tiles probably came from porticos in the temple's courtyards. Piecing the fragments together ""enables us to get an idea of the Temple's incredible splendour,"" said Dr Gabriel Barkay of the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Experts say they managed to assemble seven potential designs of how the flooring could have looked like. The type of flooring is known as opus sectile, Latin for ""cut work,"" and ""considered to be far more prestigious than mosaic tiles floors,"" according to Frankie Snyder, from the project's team. ""The tile segments were perfectly inlaid such that one could not even insert a sharp blade between them,"" she said. The Temple Mount Sifting Project was established by Israeli archaeologists in 2004 to examine debris dumped by Islamic authorities following expansion work at an underground mosque on the compound. The project attracts thousands of visitors each year who participate in finger-tip searches of the earth and has so far turned up hundreds of ancient relics, including coins, animal bones and pieces of pottery.",human,1.5984848484848484,1.5,1.4461538461538461,1.5625,1.4736842105263157,-0.032590749022192646,-0.026042928794025245,-0.2245754666270753,0.013051780266015188,0.1924198250728863,0.021584928374429588,0.03700588730025218,-0.521990001192623,0.1512345679012347,-0.3977381030217671,-0.3571428571428572,-0.01333294843284107,0.30295566502463045,0.33892082458897155,0.0,0.0,0.2346938775510203,0.9034589392263617,0.4502981783421501,1.0595056469892825,0.09844134536505326,-0.06956622204408158,0.8193277310924373,0.7794564016196731,-0.34545454545454546,-0.049447913699277465,-0.48571428571428565,0.35018629650644967,0.8928571428571428,-0.3929743095086587,0.016692942594825184,0.13014284299962253,-0.08035714285714289,0.6052729188109567,-0.5494505494505495,-0.11340026933618008,0.03735819062070963,0.011077882826894129,0.25396825396825423,1.1543706520993802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3636363636363635,1.5454545454545454,0.06136101569908842,0.7142280320298633,0.23937708121473172,0.16322669246193872,-0.01527341335739641,0.03319316491484234

His mother, Romy Zunde, had mistakenly believed she dropped Noah at day care that morning. But her husband, Noah's father, picked up the boy and took him home, where he left Noah in the car. The boy's mother, an attorney, was working in her home office, unaware that Noah was in the car. She went to the car at 5:30 p.m., thinking Noah was at day care, and found him dead. There have been at least 11 heatstroke deaths of children left in vehicles this year. This is the second such death in Missouri this year, and the 600th since 1998, according to KidsAndCars.org, a national nonprofit child safety group. A child left in a hot vehicle can quickly die. Temperatures inside a vehicle can climb to 125 degrees in minutes, KidsAndCars.org reports. Heatstroke deaths have occurred in 15 states this year. Climate experts have said the Earth is experiencing the hottest temperatures in recorded history. This year is expected to be the fourth-warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

You can fish all day, and charge up with a standard 240 volt outlet overnight."" said Zin Boats CEO, Dave Scheurer. ""Zin 18 features a patent-pending swivel-tower that allows you to turn the boat 180 degrees in its own length and get back out on plane in seconds. You can fish areas inaccessible to other boats."" said Zin Boats lead designer, Rob Nelle. ""With the Zin 18 you can get to the best hunting locations, quietly, quickly, and cover more water than the next guy. And get home before dark."" said Zin Boats Vice President and CFO, Todd Horn.

But new head coach Liam Manning believes his appointment has already made an impression on players and supporters alike after just four days at Stadium:MK. Speaking exclusively to Football League World LIVE ahead of Saturday afternoon's clash against Accrington Stanley (3pm kick-off), 'Mano' revealed what it was that convinced him to accept the job last week when he knew there could be other options available - both within football circles and elsewhere... ""It wasn't necessarily [the chance to take over from] someone I know well,"" 'Mano said about joining MK Dons following seven years spent working under Robbie Neilson at Scottish Premiership outfit Hearts. ""I'd never met Martin before but we've spoken since and you get that feeling straightaway when speaking to people like that; so my gut instinct told me this would work out."" With Paul Tisdale having also left Stadium:mk earlier on during pre-season, MK were looking down two potential paths towards finding their next permanent boss heading into 202122 - including bringing back former City favourite Dan Micciche to take control again or promoting academy director Pete Russell from within. But while these alternatives remained on the table, Manning came forward without hesitation once approached by chairman Pete Winkelman soon after taking up his role north of the border. And despite only arriving in Milton Keynes less than 10 days ago, Mano insists he can see signs early doors that suggest not too much will need to change behind the scenes if shown time. ""One thing that stood out right away was how good everyone seems to have got on,"" added the 39-year-old. ""Not just between myself and the gaffer here either because obviously they'll come across each other plenty now! The staff around us are brilliant and even some fans I spoke to outside training on Tuesday mentioned how welcoming everybody seemed to make them feel welcome which meant something straightaway to hear!""",opt_30b,1.9242424242424243,1.0,2.0923076923076924,2.09375,1.894736842105263,-0.07275105554296152,-0.5100690696771313,-0.34053206517603396,-0.47831685199416546,1.5485466914038335,0.461145621733443,1.7426408746846087,0.04947510420510112,1.695005611672278,-0.03857488013095172,0.40909090909090917,0.807439058571997,2.971786833855799,1.0328297728926359,0.09090909090909091,0.2874797872880344,0.37662337662337664,0.5015644089791881,0.707611423109093,0.9444329472700642,1.6377060183458867,1.225649299142218,1.3556149732620322,0.8144278554094865,0.5727272727272729,0.21509365289392746,0.8,1.1202396425485122,-0.18465909090909075,0.44297626497546344,0.37445305320664685,0.2647997179526303,0.6988636363636361,0.7751068883097488,1.692307692307692,1.6836166492775453,0.7607486090035408,0.14796660786822194,1.1544011544011543,1.110775306204693,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.2874797872880344,2.727272727272727,2.5454545454545454,-0.6210763581787015,1.0324705942939731,0.17863972677513915,-0.30388320301279653,0.9845250469331284,0.7715754787052098

It is important to remember that violence and aggression have no place in sport or any aspect of life, and everyone should prioritize safety and respect for others.",gpt-3.5-trubo,-0.09090909090909091,-0.16666666666666666,-0.13846153846153847,-0.171875,-0.3684210526315789,0.42610339292986027,-0.25268050175952694,0.5286472307918613,0.16447596694635833,0.16326530612244886,-0.5193010581525912,-0.06476030277544155,0.3650603018634067,-0.23765432098765413,0.44294302061079166,-0.5,-1.2999281080197551,-0.982758620689655,-1.130235769597546,0.0,0.0,1.107142857142857,0.03277941947685761,0.0964924667876036,-0.10219366051334018,0.3691550451189498,-0.9353136718944367,0.19117647058823534,-0.5425015360388699,-0.44545454545454544,0.276431079068512,1.8,3.1752566442654913,0.15625000000000008,-0.03148411385163844,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.18749999999999997,0.8721627943624909,-0.6153846153846154,-0.05957488104802214,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.8253968253968252,-0.7313313237200483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10909090909090909,-0.36363636363636365,-0.45444523232051287,0.14048406092473048,-0.7285996291200574,-0.4773535324026438,0.40782130691342106,0.6131803135400684
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The pop star was given the night's top honour for her multi-million selling record 25, but told the audience, ""I can't possibly accept this award."" ""I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful, but Beyonce is the artist of my life."" The British singer then appeared to break the award in two accidentally and offer a piece to her fellow nominee. Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists. Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis. Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not ""seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."" Two years ago, West rushed onto the stage in protest when Beck's Morning Phase beat Beyonce's last LP in the best album race. However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1. It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened. The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too ""commercialised."" Main winners Whatever the outcome, Adele remains one of the night's biggest winners. She won five prizes in all, including three of the top four: Best album, song of the year and record of the year - the latter two both rewarding her 2015 comeback single, Hello. Chicago's Chance the Rapper also took three prizes, including best rap album for his self-released record Coloring Book. ""I know people think independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom,"" he said as he picked up best new act at the start of the ceremony. Rock icon David Bowie won in each of the five categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album, for Blackstar, and best rock performance, for the album's title track. And Beyonce wasn't left completely empty-handed: she took home best urban contemporary album and best music video, for the politically-charged Formation. The star, who is pregnant with twins, also gave an ambitious and logistically complex performance of the songs Love Drought and Sandcastles, themed around the ideas of rebirth, regeneration and healing. Dressed in flowing, golden Egyptian robes and an elaborate headdress, she dedicated the performance to motherhood, proudly displaying her baby bump as she sang. But while Beyonce's performance was flawless, others were marred by technical issues. Lady Gaga duetted with Metallica on the song Moth to the Flame, but singer James Hetfield was inaudible throughout the first verse. He later sang cheek-to-cheek with Gaga, sharing her microphone, but angrily threw his guitar to one of his roadies at the end of the performance. Adele also went off-key during a tribute to George Michael, and tearfully asked if the song could be started again. It was, and she received a standing ovation for her troubles. Respects were paid to Sir George Martin, Leonard Cohen and other musicians we lost in 2016, while Bruno Mars honoured Prince by playing the star's trademark cloud guitar in a pitch-perfect rendition of Let's Go Crazy.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Correspondents said the atmosphere at schools was subdued and many pupils had not returned. They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with a reduced number of teaching hours, which made it hard for some children who rely on childcare in school to attend classes. The teachers' union NUT blamed cuts in education funding. ""They are responsible because they have slashed spending so drastically,"" Mr Greening told Sky News. One parent whose child attends one of London's smaller state primary schools said she believed that too few staff were being assigned to teach lessons. Lucy Flowers, from Croydon, has two sons aged four and six - both in reception class - and says her son is often off-task after falling asleep during quiet times in his classroom. She said: 'At 3pm today he did an exercise where I sat him down to do writing but about halfway through my husband came home saying the teacher let all the rest go over three minutes without warning them. The kids get really stressed out.' This week Mrs Flowers received a letter telling her how much attention these small children would be getting as part of their early years learning activities. In the letter, which was signed by Nick Clegg, Labour leader Ed Miliband and former deputy prime minister John Prescott, Mrs Flowers learned there would now be someone giving those same boys 20 minute lesson each day for half term, instead of 30 minutes in the past.""",gpt_j,1.128787878787879,0.8333333333333334,1.1384615384615384,1.234375,0.8421052631578947,-0.22568226765720978,-0.7296186943905159,-0.6840590248040052,-0.7226456291084942,0.5578231292517003,1.2137785737036786,0.5698906644238855,1.1784143421467737,0.695679012345679,1.3218101091127061,0.19999999999999996,0.7181029961279897,0.5172413793103448,0.6334721711928776,0.0,0.0,0.614285714285714,0.9620997015969959,-0.021442770397245223,0.6970875848525926,0.748154224774405,1.2267977351506405,0.30588235294117644,1.1731119706814213,0.2545454545454547,0.1501507195876767,-0.19999999999999996,0.5423985886429062,-0.03124999999999989,0.7152320623810597,0.5813317258647872,0.6743482944257653,0.2625,1.2713117158822838,0.8615384615384615,1.129221540642372,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,0.2412698412698416,0.8055624614956929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5818181818181818,1.0,-0.45593284069086887,0.7488814880784581,-0.20478065333601608,0.40850076080622305,0.0005113704548781825,-0.22483752741605362

None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: ""Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services. ""We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications."" It later said no patient data or care had been affected. Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: ""It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems. ""However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online."" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware. In that case, it paid 17,000 to get access to files back. Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension.locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros ""if the data encoding is incorrect."" Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said: ""It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. ""I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.""",human,2.0,2.0,1.9846153846153847,2.078125,2.1578947368421053,0.045556735983892635,0.18619855123089177,0.30159233842256805,0.2252726728517448,0.08323329331732662,0.3698967973790964,0.10666402810072734,0.5103690902967415,0.17411038489469868,0.42167416625572374,-0.32352941176470584,0.551126457591599,0.781947261663286,0.9858068671951404,0.0,0.0,-0.08403361344537823,0.48207263338022927,0.3670497756234334,1.4840355330439587,0.27795203397191515,0.23346038144737516,-0.3823529411764707,0.17254551406114912,0.5427807486631017,0.5619664888479052,0.21176470588235308,0.22326905157704147,0.15625000000000008,-0.0789513700843606,-0.35570696793973083,-0.18859626122455034,0.12132352941176476,1.03895246367002,0.11764705882352938,0.18454822394393572,0.21535898122526703,0.5386271577943567,0.4556489262371619,0.42339328144533306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4545454545454546,2.1818181818181817,0.1002300352667199,0.6957719773363683,0.49599857913636913,-0.24707847531598862,0.21030157296329946,0.33801621324410325

This includes games like chess and go, but also much more complex strategic boardgames such as Go Fish or Shogi (Japanese Chess). The article below summarizes some of the highlights from this study our team was involved in: Deepmind's paper on building superintelligenct systems with alpha zero is now online (Arxive link above should be accessible by anybody who is registered at arXiv) Alpha Zero uses neural networks to learn to play Atari 2600 video games in just hours without being taught how to use trial and error. In an experiment where it played five classic Atari titles - including Breakout, Pong, Space Invaders, Enduro and River Raid - against itself over many days, within only six hours the program had improved enough to achieve 100 win percentage for each game! (Video of winning session - ""Sitting Bull"" vs ""Showing Up"" playing): The findings are especially impressive since these programs were trained using no human input whatsoever. Instead they learned through selfplay: i.e., they have been running themselves thousands upon thousands of times; testing their own moves against those made by other computers during training sessions and choosing which ones worked best based purely on what got better results in subsequent rounds. Natural language understanding allows machines to communicate effectively with humans in novel ways. For instance, IBM Watson caused quite a stir when it defeated two chess grandmasters on TV in 2011. A decade before that, Google Translate added rudimentary text translation capabilities to its web interface. Deeper learning algorithms may soon allow machines to talk in new ways to people too. Researchers at Stanford University recently showed that deep reinforcement learning could teach robots skills they never thought possible - including an ability to recognize faces, navigate mazes, pull up recipes, even pick out objects from images. Humans often acquire seemingly nonintuitive abilities through practice and feedback. But 'machine teaching' can work in reverse: rather than viewing robots as merely mindless wooden automatons, we might view them as teachers capable of helping us expand our mind and gain wisdom along the way. - William Lally, Senior Technical Advisor at Numenta In general, one important challenge of developing artificial intelligence lies not necessarily in devising clever computational methods, but instead in coming up with the right problem domains and tasks to test AI research efforts. As a case in point, consider StarCraft II. Whereas dedicated artificial intelligence players dominate first person shooters like Call of Duty, most professional gamers favor real time strategy (RTS) type games such as Starcraft 2. Although even skilled RTS designers struggle to find good rules for designing these kinds of scenarios, StarCraft nevertheless offers much needed challenges for modern AI researchers. On the surface, StarCraft appears very simple. Yet despite intense commercial competition among amateur teams, few developers have ever managed to create software that defeats top professionals in the four year long tournament known as eSports. By contrast, chess masters routinely beat the best computer programs available today ... Even if you take into account hundreds of years of knowledge about the physical world accumulated by mankind, there remain hidden complexities that humans cannot comprehend. Software agents need to model these nuances accurately in order to succeed at challenging problems. One recent example comes again from the field of robotics. Consider humanoid robot Sophia - the successor to Japan's popular K-3 robot series. She demonstrates high degrees of autonomy by bringing her arms together and clearly conveying various emotions via facial expressions and body movements. However, she does not appear to understand speech well enough to converse coherently with humans. - Harald Hammarstrom, Turing Award Laureate 2015 A key concern raised here concerns the possibility of runaway amoral behavior as represented by StarCraft bots growing increasingly powerful until they finally defeat human beings directly. Given the fact that these examples involve fictional characters, moral qualms ought perhaps to be mitigated given that the kind of machine intelligence envisioned must eventually come true anyway. Moreover, while highly advanced AGI seems difficult to imagine on earth of late, it may well become practical once technological progress has further accelerated. Note however that so far interactions between real humans and simulated entities do seem to proceed very smoothly and pleasantly with little evidence of overt conflict ... I think serious discussion will require more careful consideration of potential consequences of achieving full AGI mastery.- Jerzy Perzanowski, Faculty Fellow at National Institute of Standards Technology More generally, the paper describes a pretty cool group of experiments, giving us insight into strengths and weaknesses of several contemporary approaches to digital minds. Below I discuss three main topics covered in the paper. 1) Reinforcement Learning (RL) versus Universal Intelligence Hypothesis Action selection in RL is guided primarily by immediate reward signals (such as points earned), whereas an agent would ideally select actions that maximize cumulative future returns (i. pity performance: another actordositandpace proctor xattesting to demonstrate exactly the opposite dilemma).

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"StyleGAN2 is a style-based GAN architecture for data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. It improves on image quality, and it also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is generated or not. StyleGAN2 is a progressive growing GAN (PG-GAN) architecture, which means that the generator and discriminator networks are trained incrementally by adding new layers in each training stage. It also uses a multi-scale structure, where the generator progressively increases its resolution output. This allows for better control over the generation process and results in higher quality images. StyleGAN2 improves on image quality by introducing an adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer, which can be used to inject style information into the generated images. The AdaIN layer is able to take existing features from the training data set and apply them to the generated image, making it more realistic. Additionally, StyleGAN2 uses a noise mixing layer which takes two inputs - one from a fixed noise vector and the other from a variable noise vector - and combines the two to create a more diverse set of images. StyleGAN2 also introduces a feature known as a ""class embedding,"" which enables the model to learn a representation of the data set that can be used to detect if an image is real or fake. This helps to improve the reliability of the generative models.",text-davinci-003,0.9090909090909091,0.8333333333333334,0.8153846153846154,0.84375,0.7894736842105263,0.1504437250127805,0.9926393524933753,1.150996483972758,1.3878935157222947,0.16326530612244886,0.3436993763082815,0.025904121110176526,0.5020324355858948,0.04753086419753092,0.4502072080571224,0.3999999999999999,-0.3899784324059266,0.36724137931034484,0.3348100772212373,0.0,0.0,0.3999999999999997,0.17330790744599497,-0.44600962426270097,-0.2736728491666279,0.8170631665299424,0.9465781986768068,-0.5352941176470589,-0.38075201699290195,-0.44545454545454544,0.276431079068512,0.40000000000000013,0.7885161734510567,0.8125000000000002,1.2270715183157639,-0.13729945284243716,0.4242640687119287,0.2625,0.6580021181568497,0.2153846153846152,-0.1378989113186685,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,0.33015873015873015,0.17614947532852243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,1.4545454545454546,0.4741745456771834,0.054643196929375845,1.1065340566226836,-1.0167144432831055,0.7763819726539187,0.41206163180240657

Video released earlier this year showing the shooting of Laquan McDonald sparked protests and calls for the city's police chief to quit. McDonald was armed with a knife but it was not raised when he was shot 16 times. The graphic video was only released after a judge ordered the footage to be made public. It shows the teenager walking away from police officers when he is shot, prompting questions from his family about why deadly force was used. The teenager's family has called for a murder conviction for the 37-year-old officer, who was released on bail. ""Today we made a crucial step on the road to justice,"" said Marvin Hunter, McDonald's great-uncle. ""We have a long way to go, but today was a victory."" The video released in November appears to contradict official police statements at the time that the black teenager had lunged at police officers with a knife before he was shot. Officer Van Dyke was arrested last month after a grand jury found enough evidence to warrant a murder charge. The graphic video was released by city officials a day before the footage was due to be made public by a judge. The release of the footage led to protests in the city and calls for the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who was sacked by Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ""McCarthy himself bore responsibility,"" Mr Emanuel said in a statement at the time. ""I'm grateful to him for his service,"" the mayor said. Three other officers are facing disciplinary action for their role in the shooting.",llama_65B,1.3636363636363635,1.6666666666666667,1.4,1.421875,1.3157894736842106,-0.5787007090982443,-0.3643156622209093,-0.4973399665949303,-0.3633965370064279,-0.29024943310657586,-0.19973006364385004,-0.18996355480796165,-0.40210341398253363,-0.18580246913580248,-0.46618943408278335,-0.2333333333333334,-0.0028919459805040637,-0.6827586206896551,-0.4247525932813765,0.0,0.0,0.028571428571428466,-0.061052920636054546,-0.24158854647562966,0.19551884962520732,0.013125512715340395,-0.07568236784658944,-0.3823529411764707,0.23063902121493796,0.021212121212121196,0.1838941644991086,-0.6666666666666666,-0.18347700185119542,0.3437500000000002,0.32148211161238444,-0.17722340721506072,-0.06128850990756763,0.06249999999999994,0.2551251217651463,0.030769230769230656,0.07538777048662942,0.5230146686899342,0.32549833095272446,-0.08465608465608436,0.45166113422409937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6181818181818182,1.7272727272727273,0.39178388321948515,0.30345480274899084,0.8494300404268472,0.601639093102794,-0.5570937183615661,-0.5828905767939628

It can be mounted onto the deck of any vessel for a fraction of the cost of more complicated kite systems. The Seawing is a 1000m2 kite that tows behind a ship and acts as a sail, reducing fuel consumption. With a 20 reduction in emissions from each ship, it is predicted that the Seawing could help reduce global shipping emissions by 10. Airseas is based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"SpaceX's SN3 prototype experienced a structural failure while undergoing the same cryptogenic proof test that killed the previous two Starship prototypes. The test involves filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to maximum capacity and pressurizing the tanks to simulate the stresses of launch. Unfortunately, due to the structural failure, the vehicle was unable to withstand the test and collapsed, resulting in significant damage. Although this setback is unfortunate, it is not unexpected in the world of aerospace engineering. Prototypes are built and tested specifically to identify weaknesses and design flaws before they can be corrected and the next iteration is built. SpaceX will use the data obtained from the SN3 failure to improve the design of future Starship prototypes and move closer to their ultimate goal of building a fully reusable spacecraft capable of transporting humans to Mars and beyond.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.2803030303030303,0.16666666666666666,0.24615384615384617,0.234375,-0.10526315789473684,1.16681299330924,1.2088864083862865,1.3699543964057443,1.0530918590422274,0.27664399092970493,0.11424098913749219,0.17269414073451064,-0.2218730279074593,0.10802469135802499,-0.2925693140001653,1.0,0.33577889086422846,0.26724137931034486,0.7519710743071105,0.0,0.0,0.4999999999999997,-0.2299181335912751,-0.5718072105932064,-0.27852053411681543,0.5414273995077932,0.7418009519084662,-0.2549019607843139,0.7516579791285056,0.021212121212121196,0.8821721041370417,1.1333333333333335,1.800965474361598,0.9375000000000002,0.07532992820918757,-0.29699527033293144,-0.13504537836886316,0.8125,-0.3373641917967756,-0.46153846153846156,-0.5277022413276352,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,-0.677248677248677,-0.06657909744241444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23636363636363636,-0.09090909090909091,0.27566271600028636,0.2213965863923935,-0.43311200175470077,-1.2539294068650106,0.9953798721324572,1.1004540701588637

Generally speaking, however, investigations require extensive analysis, interviews, and evidence collection in order to come to a conclusion, so it is likely that an acute counter-terrorism investigation could take weeks or even months to complete.",text-davinci-003,-0.030303030303030304,-0.16666666666666666,0.13846153846153847,0.125,0.10526315789473684,0.35252236178011853,1.7404734447241628,0.772400688287713,1.639361946491407,0.43537414965986376,0.9607397940743277,1.1009251471825063,0.761531382958958,0.9938271604938271,0.8141196048983911,0.25,0.1166357061617793,0.8922413793103448,0.7917204003588728,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999999998,1.458662672681893,-0.846989430691187,-0.7964397891382146,0.02461033634126324,1.1836521252307455,-0.3823529411764707,-0.11773782547894508,1.6545454545454548,-0.5325859153064354,1.8,0.0,0.15625000000000008,0.627029874122419,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.5624999999999999,1.324846381066645,0.5384615384615383,-0.10331175589616348,1.8305513404147697,0.923948812002171,0.5079365079365081,0.7735387473241301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2909090909090909,0.2727272727272727,0.5379540374218871,-0.5678705167980592,0.9091029835659024,-0.8024938053812793,0.7665640995524136,1.079850143572087

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Set Your Day to Music with Productivity Playlists from Setapp. A playlist to help you focus. A playlist to inspire creativity. A playlist to hold your daily standup meeting to. Whatever it is, a productivity playlist can be super helpful when put in the right place at the right time. From my experience as both an extrovert and introvert, I find that music makes me feel better about starting something new or diving into something hard (like studying for exams). Once I'm so engrossed listening and enjoying music while working on a project, it's much easier to go through all of those little tasks required before finishing something off. I get asked this question every day: ""What app should I download? Which one will make me more productive?!"" No matter what kind of apps you have on your device - whether they are used by students like myself or professionals like yourself - there needs to be some form of organization happening within them before they work. For example, if you're going over goals and assignments during study hall, there's no point having any distractions around you because once school starts back up you won't spend half of your free time doing anything else but what you've been assigned to do! We come prepared to learn and grow our minds; we don't need to waste valuable brain power on social media. Therefore, I suggest downloading only 1-2 toolsapps per month and limiting their usage accordingly. If you're feeling overwhelmed by all of the different resources out there then start slowly. After all, nothing good comes easy Tip 1 Downloading Apps Features That Aren't Necessary But Add Value The first major thing I did was limit each category of apps to 2 or 3 types of features and features that served very specific functions. So instead of just downloading programs which were simply great apps that didn't add value to my life, I started downloading ones whose features would enhance how I live my life. Some examples include these categories below: Phone Purity - It's not necessary to use any other phone numbers when using Signal since everything happens solely through the messaging section. Other phones require you to open multiple tabs per number, making this feature useless unless you're constantly switching between communication methods. Telegram Groups - The ability to store files without worrying about being deleted due to layout issues is extremely useful. Plus, you get group chat capabilities, which means you'll always stay connected socially even when you're offline. This was another huge addition after adding Signal since now I never want to lose conversations with friends again. Image by AwesomePixies via Pixabay Organizer App - Without a doubt, Evernote is still my favorite organizer tool on iOS devices. There's almost too many ways to organize information - checklists, tags, notebooks, scheduling, etc. However, additionally enhancing its functionality has kept me coming back to it. From saving articles directly inside Evernote, tagging notes with keywords, finding inspiration from collections like ""learning"" and ""productivity,"" setting reminders, creating documents, creating web pages to embed images onto, managing lists, and finally exporting absolutely anywhere, Evernote gives me unlimited freedom and flexibility whenever possible. Twitter Thread Viewer - In order to keep track of all of the hashtags across various platforms, I've had success just reading threads within Twitter alone. While scrolling down I quickly skim through messages and refer to older tweets that might contain relevant content. Using this method I'm able to save a lot of time previously spent checking multiple sources for similar topics. YouTube Player - Instead of wasting hours browsing videos when bored, trying to decide whether or not a certain video deserves attention, why not let someone who knows what they're talking about interpret your thoughts for you? Rather than watching lectures online, subscribing to vloggers' channels allows us to see exactly what goes behind the scenes when people create entertaining videos. It also provides access to insightful interviews where creators share interesting stories about themselves along with educational tidbits regarding whatever topic they cover. Pinterest Board Organizer - Before discovering Tipsy, link pinning actually seemed complicated. Now I think of it as my best friend. My Pinterest board takes on a whole new meaning when I know I can show everyone the pictures simultaneously to give context to my ideas while expressing gratitude for amazing creations shared by others. Social Media Management Tools - Since Facebook has become such an integral part of modern society, keeping up with posts created against our interests sometimes feels impossible (especially when you forget to logout!). As opposed to getting tangled up in countless notifications from random groups and pages, clearing out unused accounts isn't nearly as difficult. You could use TweetDeck, HootSuite, FB Downers, SimpleSocial, Sysomos, Buffer, Google Personalities and more to automate specific actions depending upon the type of post.

Choudry, 23, from Maidenhead, was given a three year community order for encouraging support for Isis online; he had written ""Isis is right"" on his Facebook profile page as well as telling undercover officers that ""it's better to be killed fighting rather than live your life feeling like you are worthless."" Rahman, 22, also from Maidenhead, who acted as editor of the group's magazine Ghumru ala Mujahidin (Warrior Magazine), pleaded guilty to supporting terrorism after secretly filming himself praying at Kensington mosque with other Luton Islamic extremists. He showed these videos to fellow extremist Anjem Choudary when they met in prison just before he was released last month. The men's families have no idea what has happened during their time inside because of strict court rules about disclosure. They said: ""There should be nothing happening there apart from them being locked up - not one single letter or phone call can come out without our permission."" Police do not disclose the identities of those involved if someone dies in custody but the family say this rule does not apply here. Zakaria Bulhan was sentenced earlier today for stabbing his former wife Rhiannon Jones in January 2018. It emerged she feared her ex would kill her and went into hiding under another name while still married to him. The case led to calls for more restrictions on access by press and public after it emerged that prosecutors did not tell court staff beforehand about Ms Jones' fears, despite agreeing to cooperate fully with the defence team. She fell ill shortly afterwards and died several days later - victim number four. Rivalry between rival gangs involving young people incited by gang culture within British jails caused the third death from self-inflicted injuries since December 2017. In the past 12 months there have been seventeen suicides among inmates aged 16 years or older across England and Wales. This compares to eight such deaths recorded over six years prior until June 2016. There have been a further 10 homicides resulting from gang violence since then. Prison service data shows that assaults on prisoners rose 17 per cent between 201314 and 201415. The majority of the cases involve vulnerable individuals being used as muscle by larger groups. A survey of prisoners found that almost half admitted having committed acts of serious bullying against younger comrades. Two thirds wanted the authorities to take steps to protect children from becoming victims themselves. Statistics reveal many inmates become adults behind bars: 33 percent of all offenders convicted in prisons go free within two years of release. Many will reintegrate into communities where they will face pressures which predispose them towards antisocial behaviour - and many lack adequate mental health treatment upon leaving jail. Bury St Edmunds man jailed 'for making bomb threats to four schools' Published duration 21 May 2019 Related Topics Atlee murder trial A 51-year-old Bury St Edmunds man has been jailed for harassing pupils at four local primary schools with hoax telephone calls threatening bombs and shootings. John Mazzini was arrested after alerting West Suffolk Council following ongoing reports of threats made against churches and schools. Staff became concerned in March 2018 when a member of staff reported receiving a threat from a stranger claiming to represent the IRA and claiming responsibility for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox outside Parliament. Mr Mazzini sent pictures of guns and knives on Telegram messaging app to school officials warning them members of gun clubs could attack pupils at nearby Marlborough Green Primary School. In August last year, he contacted council bosses again saying members of a UK terror cell might target mosques near the town centre. During raids later, detectives seized computers containing child abuse images alongside books including How To Load And Fire Glock Pistols and Lethal Force For Beginners. He was charged under Section 5 (1) of Public Order Act 1986 relating to false statements communicated through telecommunications networks. On Friday judges handed down sentences totalling nine months after taking advice from probation services. Sentencing Judge Nigel Peters QC told the defendant: ""You have now served your sentence imprisonment so I am pleased to pass my judgement on you."" He was put on supervision orders which included reporting every week as required and must pay 400 costs after admitting seven offences arising from incidents dating back to 2010. Crown prosecutor Paul Illingworth told magistrates: ""These allegations cover a period extending from 2010 to present day communications."" As part of the peace package, HMP Feltham Young Offender Institution closed in December 2018 after live demonstrations in protest at conditions set out in the Ministry Of Justice report entitled Homicides Behind Bars - Time To End Violence. Magistrate Peter Murphy agreed that alternative accommodation had failed to resolve issues highlighted in the document and ordered its closure.

He managed to escape but Mrs Browning suffered permanent injuries including brain damage and will never walk again and is now blind.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required. The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. ""Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,"" an official said. Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea. This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. ""A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,"" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom ""knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial."" Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his ""evil"" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: ""It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body."" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: ""This is not one of them."" ""If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,"" he said. US officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land. According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine. However, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture: ""US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine. ""To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.""",human,4.007575757575758,3.8333333333333335,4.461538461538462,4.484375,5.052631578947368,-0.6832186013707883,-0.3274136854222251,-0.3392776736441986,-0.1168500874308044,0.22643343051506318,0.9914494616583284,0.5365853658536585,1.1236234543302248,0.521604938271605,1.0554915750676628,0.4642857142857142,0.7401765152428585,0.0886699507389163,0.3496840204520962,0.0,0.0,-0.2857142857142858,-0.012688961079474485,0.0964924667876036,0.695540973611745,0.4183757178014766,0.43611327718797005,-0.2731092436974791,0.5285831995219924,0.5545454545454546,1.0605545847941718,-0.27142857142857135,0.7336531960566008,0.6919642857142859,0.8353288956136833,-0.1971853844013725,0.07930241464978803,0.45535714285714285,1.1209805309013556,0.7032967032967031,1.1756472337066743,0.3735819062070958,0.13006224936151622,1.0793650793650795,1.195690936612341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2,3.8181818181818183,0.25202274908236516,1.0260392098396696,0.6865174808442142,0.24839739313455458,-0.056402329452898005,0.030179750620601443

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Whether or not he is on the formal menu, Mr Snowden will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows. Ms Merkel's trip to the US is markedly different in tone and substance from her last visit to Washington in June 2011. Back then, there was a state dinner during which Mr Obama presented her the Medal of Freedom. He talked of a productive partnership with Ms Merkel, one of the few world leaders with whom he has established a warm connection. She referred to him more than once as ""dear Barack."" This week's meeting is much shorter and will be all business. Three years ago, the leaders spent considerable time talking about the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, and G8 efforts to support those democratic transitions. They reiterated the desire to achieve negotiated settlements to the vexing challenges of the Iranian nuclear programme. They discussed the pending change in military strategy in Afghanistan and the need to overcome trade barriers and accelerate economic growth. Three years later, the policy outlook is vastly different, although thankfully not all bad. For example, not only are negotiations with Iran under way, there is a decent chance they will be successful. The war in Afghanistan is winding down. The Afghan presidential election is going surprisingly well. Whoever replaces President Hamid Karzai is likely to agree to a follow-on Nato mission there. The most urgent regional transformation is not the Middle East, where an Arab Spring has, with the exception of Tunisia, become a humanitarian nightmare, but Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin has already overseen the redrawing of the European map and may be agitating for more. There is no longer a G8, but a G7, trying to co-ordinate sanctions that impose costs on Mr Putin while minimising the impact on the European economy, not as easy a task as some suggest. The costs to Mr Putin are increasing, even if the ramp is not as steep as pundits and even some government officials on this side of the Atlantic would prefer. This week the US imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia's high tech sector and the EU quickly followed suit. Such co-ordination is important since the lift over time will be much heavier in Europe. Its level of integration with Russia exceeds that of the US. Mr Obama is right to be patient while maintaining firm pressure on Europe to move beyond its comfort zone. Ms Merkel is not only crucial to meaningful European action, she is the only Western leader with real potential to influence Mr Putin. The Obama-Putin relationship has hit a brick wall. She arrives in Washington undoubtedly stung that a German-led European monitoring team is being held by separatists in Sloviansk, Ukraine. She has every right to expect Russia to use its influence to gain their release. The fact they have not is a clear indication of its intent to further escalate the crisis. While in Washington, Ms Merkel will also meet the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. As much as the crisis is about getting Mr Putin to stand down, it is about the need for Kiev to stand up, and for the West to redeem Ukraine's decision to integrate with the West. A vital step in resolving the crisis is enabling Ukraine to conduct a free, fair and legitimate election on 25 May. This is the object of Mr Putin's agitation, to manipulate conditions in ways that favour Russia's interests and undermine Kiev's. The West needs a comparable game plan to help Ukraine stand up a new government that Russia is unable to discredit. The meeting should touch on the long-term strategic implications of the crisis. The US has done an effective job of reassuring Nato allies regarding their mutual security interests. The presence of Nato forces in Poland and the Baltic states is a welcome manifestation of that commitment. Mr Obama and Ms Merkel will discuss the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which faces headwinds in both Europe and the US. It would be useful to make energy a centrepiece of these trade negotiations. Several European countries, including Germany, rely heavily on Russian energy, which gives Mr Putin important leverage in the current crisis. As US Secretary of State John Kerry told an Atlantic Council conference this week, the US has a new energy card in its policy arsenal. The Ukraine crisis presents a perfect opportunity to diversify Europe's energy sources over the next decade. While Russia and Ukraine will dominate the discussion, Ms Merkel cannot afford to ignore the Snowden issue and neither should Mr Obama. This is the first formal meeting between the two leaders since revelations that the US National Security Agency was monitoring her mobile phone. Americans should not underestimate the impact that the issue has had in Europe. Europeans have welcomed the reforms that Mr Obama and Congress are considering. Even if the issue has receded from the headlines, Washington needs to follow through. Ms Merkel herself has suggested it will take more than one meeting to repair the damage Edward Snowden's revelations have generated. This meeting is a necessary step in that process.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised ""lowlanders"" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed ""work in progress,"" has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called ""new breed"" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to ""tame"" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia. The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia. There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview. Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility. However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",human,8.583333333333334,7.333333333333333,7.969230769230769,8.015625,6.894736842105263,0.6380740520084343,0.9524799593734089,0.7081341686922074,0.8431963788225749,0.5936415382479518,0.9004183710255801,0.40177820497416816,0.7751476900276968,0.3919753086419755,0.7754089291222873,2.336734693877551,2.15782818681402,0.6396903589021816,1.0324040300808108,0.0,0.0,0.4227405247813409,0.7124470118031428,-0.24287219531573695,0.07044413599547951,0.14063049337864744,0.5067299523313241,-0.05462184873949595,0.578921440653306,-0.1883116883116883,0.07099027012432965,2.2285714285714286,2.469565793630401,0.9215561224489797,1.191142663810531,-0.22773943111511502,0.04726059566457536,0.2563775510204081,1.1848563824122054,-0.07849293563579275,0.4066428056518637,-0.17078029998038666,-0.07738559855223416,0.27210884353741505,0.4770051782518622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.236363636363636,6.636363636363637,-0.22162617328294557,1.9362148698245707,0.0810364698610197,-0.8130395086918195,0.8532010511951241,0.8670271218924942

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The Spaniard, whose opening round in Munich contained six birdies, trails leader Wade Ormsby of Australia by two shots and Belgian Thomas Detry by one. England's Tommy Fleetwood, who finished second at the Masters last week, is one shot further back after carding a four-under-par 68. With the sun shining and barely a breath of wind, players were able to take advantage of perfect scoring conditions at Eichenried Golf Club. The Spaniard made five birdies in the first six holes, before adding another on the 15th. He did drop a shot on the 17th, but his birdie on the 18th left him in a good position heading into Friday's second round. ""It was a great day, very happy,"" said Campillo, whose previous best finish in the event was a tie for fifth in 2014. ""I played very solid, with six birdies and a bogey. It was a good round of golf. ""My putting was very good and I hit a lot of fairways. It was a very nice day of golf. I hit a lot of fairways and that gives you a lot of opportunities to make birdies."" The 31-year-old was pleased to be leading the home challenge in the absence of Sergio Garcia and Jon Rahm, and he is confident he can challenge for his maiden European Tour victory this week. ""It's a good week to try to win,"" he added. ""I've been close in the past, so I hope I can give myself an opportunity to win. ""I've been playing good for a long time. I've been very solid, making a lot of cuts and top-20 finishes. I hope to try to keep the same way and try to win this week."" Ormsby, meanwhile, is in his first season as a European Tour member and a maiden title in Munich would lift him into the world's top 200. The 37-year-old's round got off to a poor start with bogeys on the opening two holes, but six birdies on the front nine, and two more on the 13th and 16th, helped him to the top of the leaderboard. Detry, who won his maiden European Tour title at the 2016 Shot Clock Masters, also had a strong start to his round. After reaching the turn in 31, the 24-year-old added birdies on the 12th and 15th holes. Fleetwood, who finished 12th at Augusta, carded five birdies, an eagle and a solitary bogey to move up the leaderboard. Clement Sordet is a shot further back on five under, while a group of six players, including France's Raphael Jacquelin and Germany's Maximilian Kieffer, are a shot further back.",llama_65B,2.477272727272727,3.0,3.0307692307692307,2.953125,3.526315789473684,-1.4771264864098126,-0.8297600722408991,-1.1941087815262152,-1.044294931446214,-0.3040520556048507,0.3229233739838805,0.16893992028376062,0.5262617973615263,0.08923778851315081,0.45941542927587836,0.28260869565217384,0.4125019371708347,-0.004497751124437731,0.6417876719905439,0.0,0.0,-0.3975155279503106,0.033698077417442095,-0.04195324642939283,0.6165247513643346,-0.5820879552020544,-0.10753438362524954,-0.14961636828644503,0.3980459578753993,-0.38458498023715415,0.4100806299768276,0.36521739130434794,0.6975825355960226,0.5230978260869565,0.6142431881269586,0.7011035889826579,0.8330098028296681,0.10597826086956517,0.8056496841237893,0.24749163879598646,0.2138067748835321,-0.38657605946647305,-0.27096098410995173,0.5465838509316774,0.22003777887495773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9454545454545454,2.272727272727273,0.5529339276576808,0.5885674989698674,0.7291393325490352,1.2112730065858124,-0.980601147075086,-1.0090760255453353

They added that two men on a motorcycle threw a hand grenade at the restaurant, but that no one was hurt. However, police later said they were now looking into the possibility that the attack may have been linked to terrorism. The country's Inspector-General of Police, Khalid Abu Bakar, said it was too early to confirm whether the incident was related to terrorism, but added that police would investigate all angles. The attack comes amid heightened security in Malaysia, following recent attacks by the Islamic State (IS) group in neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines.

The method has endless potential applications, including noninvasive medical imaging, Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a noninvasive imaging technology, has revolutionized the way surgeons can operate by providing high-quality, real-time images of inside the body. However, the field is limited to small areas, which limits its use in noninvasive medical imaging.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Nico Rosberg headed team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 0.505secs after the Briton made a mistake on his best lap. And the German was a massive 1.834secs quicker than Kimi Raikkonen, third for Ferrari, on the same'soft' tyres. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat were fourth and fifth as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was 11th on the medium tyre. In windy and comparatively cool conditions - it was only 21C and overcast when temperatures are more usually in the mid-30Cs at this race - Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne made his debut in Formula 1 as stand-in for the injured Fernando Alonso. Vandoorne, who had not driven the 2016 McLaren before Friday, flew in overnight from Japan, where he had been testing the car he races in the Super Formula category, and was 18th fastest, 0.952secs slower than team-mate Jenson Button. However, Vandoorne's best time was set on the medium tyre, which is about a second slower than the soft on which Button was running when he set his fastest lap. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier said: ""He did very well - it is not easy to step in to this high-tech car with a lot of processes to learn. He knows most of them but doing it for real is very different."" The comparison between the two will be watched with intense interest through the weekend as it is effectively a partial audition for the job of Alonso's team-mate at McLaren in 2017. Button is out of contract at the end of this season ad Vandoorne, McLaren's reserve driver, is the most highly regarded not to have a regular F1 drive. At the front, Rosberg and Hamilton were only 0.081secs apart after their first runs on the soft tyre - with the German again marginally ahead. On their second flying laps, Hamilton was quicker in the first sector, but then dropped half a second in the middle sector of the lap. The gap between the Mercedes and the rest are not likely to be representative - Ferrari were almost certainly on a different programme. The Italian team have brought two more sets of the medium tyre for each of their drivers than Mercedes for this weekend and appeared to be focusing more on establishing whether that is the correct tyre for the race. Behind the Red Bulls, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was sixth fastest ahead of the Toro Rosso pair Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen, the Haas of Romain Grosjean and Williams' Felipe Massa.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"South Korea will soon see a drop in their military personnel due to a decline in birth rate and recent laws that make it easier to avoid mandatory national service. The government might also implement additional measures such as increasing the length of compulsory service for poor soldiers who are less productive in combat or raising pay rates, local media reported on Friday. The number of South Korean civilians was 2.41 million at end-2013 and is expected to decrease by 1 percent annually until 2015. A total of 921,000 people born between 1995 and 2000 are eligible for conscription but so far only about 250,000 have taken up voluntary positions. Conscientious objectors can choose either civilian work (non-military) or alternative services including agriculture, medicine, education, etc., for which they receive full salaries and benefits. Those who refuse to serve under any circumstances, however, must complete two years of minimal labor duty during which time they do not receive money and cannot quit unless granted a special exemption. After this period has expired, conscientious objectors must join either active or reserve forces if they wish to continue working. In 2013, 18,719 men and women opted out of the army, second most among all countries surveyed. Under current regulations, one male soldier from every 100 becomes an effective reservist after completing his obligatory term. If the ratio falls below 100100, then he receives just half salary while serving two years' probationary military training.",gpt_j,0.9924242424242424,0.8333333333333334,0.9384615384615385,0.96875,0.9473684210526315,0.6640239396440074,0.35574191830313867,0.9198381899341398,0.40891874846534787,0.3129251700680272,3.67453705661979e-05,0.23313708999158966,-0.051103548597175204,0.2549382716049385,-0.013788408228598245,1.7999999999999998,1.3673013706984605,0.8172413793103447,0.5978380344950075,0.0,0.0,0.357142857142857,-0.0633137761217639,-0.8234023832542172,-0.6588527597923101,0.33470057424118127,0.09124553526880812,0.3823529411764707,0.36392019774606077,-0.02545454545454531,0.2845011240868731,1.2,1.1804962442991251,-0.31249999999999994,-0.3395450982682691,1.2999629045720116,1.0606601717798212,0.11249999999999992,1.0598771048533162,0.030769230769230656,0.19073729252203303,0.26150733434496715,0.4784157160031074,-0.025396825396825307,0.5697919272302971,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.6000000000000001,1.5272727272727273,1.0909090909090908,-0.5755600713211739,0.6896688052457032,-0.09982944530772876,-0.8790202112564464,0.7574024369663432,0.7905052718721532

He worked tirelessly to ensure money for their upkeep and was responsible for making sure they were eventually settled into homes with suitable foster parents after a period staying at various hostels until they found permanent placements. He also arranged the transport of Hungarian Jews who had been imprisoned by Germany's ally Hungary during World War II under appalling conditions as part of Operation Margarethe (named after Queen Margaretha). The escape plan involved refugees on forced marches through mountainous terrain being shot if they fell behind schedule or failed to catch up - often resulting in numerous deaths along the way before reaching Austria via Italy where most would be transferred onto boats bound for Palestine. For this operation alone, Mr Darvall earned himself an OBE nomination but didn't receive it because his name wasn't cleared like others working alongside him due to lack of proof that he'd assisted those arrested so many years earlier - something acknowledged decades later when three members of staff received British Empire Medals instead; Pauline Leibovitsky, Ruth Silverman and Louisa McLean.

The test is expected on August 7th and will last for 12 hours, according to RT Russia correspondent Maria Finoshina who was reporting live when several websites including Facebook were inaccessible Tuesday morning local time (August 6). Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his government to draft legislation that would allow them to cut off access to the Russian Internet during a state emergency or natural disaster as part of national security measures against hacking attacks. According to news reports: ""The measure comes after US intelligence agencies repeatedly accused Moscow of trying to influence the 2016 presidential election by spreading disinformation through social media."" While some experts have said this could be used as one more tool for censorship rather than protecting civil rights online since it appears so far the only purpose here seems targeted at preventing foreign interference in elections - thus still allowing the Kremlin to manipulate domestic opinion with its own propaganda machine which remains intact even under such circumstances.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists believe it is a member of the so-called inner Oort cloud - a vast region of icy debris thought to exist beyond the orbits of even the most distant known planets. The newly discovered body, called 2015 TG387, has an orbit that takes it on a spectacularly wide loop around the solar system. At its closest approach, it passes about 65 times further from the Sun than Neptune. On its most distant point, it gets about two and a half times farther away than the most remote known Solar System object. The new object's orbital period is estimated to be about 40,000 years. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that the outer reaches of our Solar System may be teeming with objects like 2015 TG387. The fact that it was found close to the predicted location of the inner Oort Cloud suggests that this region could be more densely populated than astronomers previously thought. Its discovery also helps scientists better understand how objects in the outer Solar System interact with each other and with their environment.",text-davinci-003,0.7575757575757576,0.6666666666666666,0.7538461538461538,0.859375,0.3684210526315789,-0.25787715808939277,-0.5866235191090131,-0.1335323745926118,-0.18524805520678966,0.1934996220710504,-0.02912589941195922,0.20147649752359612,-0.34927744434505087,0.3672839506172842,-0.07095420326516247,0.6111111111111112,-0.34184504385573017,2.850574712643678,1.6411638858812772,0.0,0.0,-0.09523809523809527,-0.4650694902781717,-0.12627409233933312,-0.33177415360261137,-0.10937927262783724,0.20183106545791515,0.04248366013071881,-0.18152046397971142,-0.44545454545454544,0.3639546689909263,-0.7555555555555555,-0.2675480468084109,0.8854166666666666,0.4687990626258815,0.5680237410739126,0.39763064124842634,-0.10416666666666662,0.8783186180705712,0.0512820512820513,-0.1548931926903239,0.34867644579328955,0.6921575798337546,-0.47971781305114625,-0.3197843607964191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41818181818181815,1.0909090909090908,0.23453880118382886,0.12540270910714474,0.6511991177946949,0.08387196756485703,0.03949385470152883,-0.20519891486404696

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A team of engineers in Korea has designed a new Virtual Reality glove that can create the sensation of touch when manipulating digital objects. VR gloves are not new, but existing systems require a mechanical apparatus that provides tactile feedback to the hand, limiting their portability. The new system, created by Yong Tae Kim and a team of engineers at Korea's Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, uses a novel haptic technology called Lagrangian Dynamics. A user wears a conventional VR glove with sensors that track the motion of the hands. Each of the fingers is attached to a small motor. When the user's hand ""touches"" a virtual object, the corresponding motor causes the finger to bend, thus simulating the feeling of touch. The software relies on Lagrangian Dynamics, a system that was originally developed to simulate physics in computer animation. It calculates the exact amount of resistance that the user should feel when manipulating a given virtual object. The researchers tested their system using a 3D model of a cube. They found that users could reliably distinguish between surfaces that were hard and soft, rough and smooth, with up to 95.5 accuracy. To test the system's effect on user performance, they had users use a VR environment to move objects from one place to another. They found that users of the new system performed these tasks about 20 faster than users of a conventional VR system. The system is still in the prototype stage, but Yong Tae Kim and his colleagues have submitted a patent for their technology. They hope to use it to create a wearable tactile feedback system that can be used with conventional VR gloves.",llama_65B,1.3333333333333333,1.5,1.2307692307692308,1.15625,0.8947368421052632,0.020354334627999272,0.5573718126363446,0.5268433199130763,0.6998383908758841,-0.14771622934888234,-0.3511896559710856,-0.222035323801514,-0.5937713693516824,-0.3302469135802468,-0.6472104798878171,0.0714285714285714,0.15046661831785116,-0.3399014778325123,-0.03197510105102114,0.0,0.0,0.1734693877551018,-0.29744231837138985,-0.22361746271412894,0.5747642622350702,0.04922067268252648,-0.19104590598055765,-0.3277310924369747,-0.40096296346845417,-0.6454545454545455,0.006208283550802639,-0.19999999999999996,1.0280035353055486,0.6919642857142859,0.25154708946134813,-0.23996104980061206,-0.09511374278441269,0.24107142857142852,1.1645298316051478,0.17582417582417578,-0.12452652668483596,0.03735819062070963,0.011077882826894129,-0.44444444444444425,-0.0037516447263008326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5636363636363636,1.0909090909090908,0.5565283718840467,0.3495122317952951,0.3744038043277241,-0.34562950129066744,0.16173602630127892,0.20869441821923093

The burglary happened at their home in the Turf Hill area at about 23:15 BST on Monday. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has said the gang could be linked to a number of similar offences across the area. In this case, a gang of four men barged their way into the house, holding the family hostage for about half an hour while they searched the house. They stole cash and jewellery and made the occupants open safe boxes. The family, including the footballer's mother, were forced to the floor while the men demanded keys for a safe. They were threatened and assaulted, and the nine-year-old girl was also threatened by a man carrying a knife. The men left the house in a white Audi estate car, which was later found abandoned and burnt out in Whit Lane in Turton. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin, of GMP, said: ""This has been a truly terrifying ordeal for this family who have not only lost irreplaceable personal items, but have been left extremely shaken. ""While the investigation is still in its early stages, we are currently treating this as an isolated incident and believe the offenders have purposely targeted this address. ""I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious, or has information about this incident, to please get in touch with us as soon as possible."" GMP has said the same gang could be responsible for a number of other burglaries in the area, and has appealed for anyone who has been a victim of a similar crime to contact them. A spokesman for Manchester United said: ""We are aware that Daley Blind's house was broken into last night. Thankfully, no one was hurt. ""We will give Daley and his family all the support they need.""",llama_65B,1.7045454545454546,1.6666666666666667,2.0,2.125,1.9473684210526316,-0.9066050785000213,-0.4714062304877088,-0.6685612402502809,-0.2833218392685883,0.11791383219954653,0.394192940211557,0.48354359405663033,0.8077011110134593,0.5919753086419752,1.0617003516006982,-0.2333333333333334,0.23572420941588035,0.41724137931034483,0.6295484556745461,0.06666666666666667,0.24944382578492943,-0.11428571428571425,-0.028584574462513775,-0.2101391498930033,0.2828289139180173,0.10500410172272347,0.012228391104316293,-0.025490196078431285,0.4826323496917762,0.7678787878787882,1.4211897970798437,0.2666666666666666,0.8627885471018099,1.1562500000000002,1.0049576759008152,-0.0973754984698136,0.10212544614376513,-0.13749999999999998,0.8095775829838439,0.39999999999999997,0.522220634584336,-0.10460293373798682,-0.04170566036065527,0.6264550264550266,0.36604331556843034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2545454545454546,0.9090909090909091,0.2355592000029559,0.7218966209567976,-0.21149628123068323,0.5791926667419801,-0.33690765489352265,-0.12746358393600465

An MIT team has developed an algorithm that makes sense out of ""garbage"" dog poo left behind by owners who are too lazy to take their dogs outside. It turns what would otherwise be unsightly into something that could actually do good if used correctly. See how this works here "" While most people cringe when they hear the word ""robot"" used to describe our Earth's newest mechanical overlords, roboticists like Cynthia Breazeal believe these robots have enormous potential to help us with some pretty important tasks. She discusses her own work developing social robots with iRobot CEO Colin Angle at TED2013. "" Retired NYPD Detective Lin Dailey gives his perspective on why he got involved with criminal profiling while policing Manhattan during the 1960s through 1980s. In his words, it was a way for him ""to keep my hand in law enforcement without having to put myself physically at risk. Ever wanted to see what inside a vagina looks like? Check this video out from Bikini City, which uses specialty imaging equipment scientists call bioengineered metamaterials. These structures manipulate light in ways not found anywhere else in nature, making them really useful tools that could lead to better medical diagnostics. "" How do you capitalize on all those extra brain cells you just gained thanks to learning Chinese?! Well, David Eagleman has come up with a few ideas including using augmented reality scans to visualize old buildings and doing virtual tours using online databases of historical sites around the world. Plus there are videos that teach how to say hello and goodbye properly... and even play chess against yourself via smartphone apps. Here's where you get started "" This year marks the 100th anniversary of Sir Arthur Eddington becoming famous for his radical theory of general relativity but also for being wrong. Thanks to his flawed experiments involving starlight bending due to gravity, Einstein had been proven right. However, astronomers were still puzzled by two remaining problems - dark matter and black holes. But then came LIGO and GRAVITONOMICS! Last fall researchers published details of how gravitational waves travel across space, allowing physicists to finally solve both mysteries. Here's Douglas Adam explains it all in a high school level book called Gravity 101. "" In recent years, China has made impressive advancements in artificial intelligence. Now Mark Weisbrot thinks they're ready to surpass America's legacy AI masters - IBM Watson and Deep Blue. With rising wages and growing wealth inequality among its citizens, he believes the U.S. should focus less on competition between countries and more on finding solutions together. Watch Mark's talk below "" The internet may seem like magic to many, but it took hundreds of thousands of years to create. This article by Michael Froomkin explores the history of computers, starting with primitive abacus devices, moving on to human-based calculating machines... eventually arriving at the modern web browser complete with cookies, tabs and pop-up ads. "" We often think of early robot makers designing creepy automatons capable of killing, stealing, spying, dreaming, or a thousand other things. But scientist Ben Goertzel argues that instead of creating killer toys for humans, we'd be better off building little helpers to assist us throughout daily chores. He calls this idea AGI or Artificial General Intelligence, and compares it to child development - ultimately ending with the phrase: Let your kids play with LEGO. "" You've probably heard rumors about Google getting into manufacturing and producing parts itself. According to product manager Chris O'Neill, though, the company doesn't want to start selling hardware because it costs too much money, so instead it plans to sell services. Like items already offered under its umbrella - Gmail, YouTube, and others - Google wants to expand upon the functionality. Basically anything that helps users manage information and communicate effectively. Sounds reasonable enough... except that John Deere recently announced a partnership to use AR software in tractors to allow farm managers to collect data remotely and generate reports instantly. So maybe we shouldn't expect small electronics any time soon after all. Still, very cool.""

It is unclear how the contract will be split between the two companies, but it is a significant win for both Uber and Lyft. The contract includes services such as ride-hailing and bike-sharing, and will be available to over four million federal employees and their families across the United States. As the two largest ride-hailing companies in the US, Uber and Lyft have been competing fiercely for market share in recent years. This contract will provide a significant boost to both companies' bottom lines and could help them to capture a larger portion of the corporate transportation market. However, it is important to note that the contract is not without controversy. Some critics have raised concerns about the potential cost to taxpayers, as well as issues related to cybersecurity and data privacy.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Around 155 countries are expected to formally sign the deal at the UN, setting in motion events that could see the treaty operational within a year. The UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a ""distraction."" Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters, including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratification. For some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries, including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April 22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55 of global emissions to complete all the steps. While this is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible. Firstly President Obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational before his successor takes office next January. If the next President wants to take the US out of an established treaty they will have to wait for four years - by which time they may no longer be in charge. Many of the least developed countries are pushing forward as well because a clerical error in the drafting of the new agreement means it becomes operational as soon at it hits the 5555 mark, and not in 2020 as many people had supposed. Poorer countries fear that if the threshold is reached they could be left out in the cold if they haven't ratified, meaning they would not be able to influence the rules and organisation of the new deal. ""There was a little buzz a few weeks back with someone suggesting that some of the smaller counties should refrain from signing, in order to get a better deal,"" explained Reid Detchon from the United Nations Foundation. ""The fact that there is this large number of developing [countries] that are coming to the table here says that argument hasn't taken root and they really saw how deeply their own national self interest was bound up in success here."" Scientists and analysts are also keen on a speedy implementation of the agreement for different reasons. According to a new study by researchers at Chatham House, leaving any increase in the level of carbon cutting ambition until 2025 as detailed in the Paris deal would make it nigh on impossible to keep temperatures below 2 degrees C, never mind 1.5. ""For the Paris agreement to have any credibility we can't afford to wait ten years in order to increase ambition,"" said Shane Tomlinson, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. ""Estimates suggest that the gap between where emissions will be and where they need to be, will be around 11 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2025. That's more than the annual emissions of China,"" he added. Reid Detchon agreed on the need for urgency and increased ambition. But he was worried that global leaders didn't quite understand that getting agreement in Paris was, in some ways, the easy bit. ""My biggest concern really is that we are only on the first step of a ladder of increased ambition. It is going to become clear to the world over the next 3 -5 years how much more we need to do to stabilise the climate."" Some environmentalists and indigenous leaders believe the whole process is not worth the paper it is written on. According to the International Alliance of Frontline Communities, the Paris Agreement is a ""dangerous distraction"" from the real issues. ""I started attending the UN climate meetings in 1999. Over the last 17 years I've witnessed corporate, Wall Street and other financial influence gut any real solutions coming out of the negotiations,"" said Tom Goldtooth, of the Indigenous Environmental Network, in a statement. ""As a result, the Paris Agreement goal of stopping global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees C is not real because the pledges each country is making will allow emission levels that will increase global temperature 3 - 4 degrees. This will be catastrophic to the ecosystem of the world.""

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's programme was pushed through without debate, according to parliamentary speaker Salim al-Juburi. Under the plan, Mr Abadi will cut spending and eliminate senior posts. It follows mass protests over corruption and poor services. The move also aims to abolish the country's three vice-presidencies and three deputy prime minister posts. The plan will ""protect the resources of the state,"" Mr Juburi said. Mr Abadi has struggled to balance the demands of Iraq's different political factions as the country battles an insurgency by so-called Islamic State (IS). The group controls large parts of the north and west, and on Tuesday two attacks near Baghdad killed at least 30 people and injured 60 others. Corruption is widespread in Iraq, and is blamed for many of the country's problems. Iraq has the world's fifth-largest oil reserves but a significant proportion of its population lives in poverty. Iraq's parliament has approved a new government led by Haider al-Abadi, two weeks after his predecessor Nouri Maliki stood aside. MPs voted in favour of all but one of the cabinet's 33 ministers, with a decision on the remaining nominee deferred for a week. The new administration has vowed to fight corruption and terrorism, as well as create jobs. Mr Abadi, 62, is seen as a consensus candidate. He was nominated after Mr Maliki, who had held the post since 2006, agreed to step aside. The new prime minister has two deputies: the former leader of the Iraqi National Alliance (INA), Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Saleh al-Mutlaq, a secular Sunni Muslim who led the Iraqi Front for National Dialogue. The INA, a coalition of Shia parties, was the largest group in the outgoing parliament. Other key cabinet posts were awarded to: Hoshiyar Zebari, foreign minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, oil minister Khaled al-Obeidi, defence minister Bayan Jabr, finance minister Iraq's main Kurdish parties are also represented in the cabinet, as are the main Sunni and Shia Arab blocs. Mohammed Ghabban, a Shia politician from Baghdad, was not approved as the nominee for the interior ministry, which oversees the police. No reason was given for the decision, but it was reportedly because of objections from Kurdish and Sunni parties. The other cabinet nominees were approved unanimously or with a large majority, AFP reported. They now have a week to present a programme to parliament, which will decide whether to keep them in office. In his first speech to parliament as prime minister, Mr Abadi said: ""I swear to God to protect the constitution and the law, and look after the interests of the people. ""I will be just to all Iraqis. The people will see what I will do. I call on politicians to work with me."" Mr Maliki's reluctance to give up the post of prime minister had plunged Iraq into political crisis. He was accused by opponents of pursuing a policy of sectarianism and seeking to entrench his authority. His rule also coincided with a sharp increase in sectarian violence and growing insecurity in the country. However, Mr Maliki has said he will not go quietly, and his supporters have warned of violence if he is forced out. The new prime minister's first task will be to form a national unity government to confront IS, which controls large parts of the north and west and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East. Iraq's government has been struggling to push back against the jihadist group, which has declared a caliphate in the areas it has seized. On Thursday, IS said it had beheaded a second US journalist, Steven Sotloff. The group said it was in retaliation for US air strikes against its fighters in Iraq. Last month, it released a video showing the killing of another US journalist, James Foley. The US has vowed to continue its air strikes, which it says have helped stem the advance of IS and allowed Iraqi and Kurdish forces to regain ground.",llama_65B,4.2272727272727275,5.0,4.1692307692307695,4.125,4.842105263157895,-0.29053842991308015,0.06303627615346043,-0.019171443132720484,0.20939344518314487,-0.27210884353741494,0.3178521951459906,-0.22943650126156445,0.0021557228481837755,-0.26728395061728366,-0.02943569063544124,-0.12857142857142856,0.6177749583804334,-0.1684729064039409,0.08753360940613979,0.0,0.0,-0.26122448979591856,0.15285554517031114,0.2885584244886431,1.2476315348043732,-0.15750615258408535,0.20043103749260352,-0.3605042016806724,0.052491680446117406,-0.24545454545454548,0.35067620680677125,0.11428571428571432,0.9232471482186871,0.10267857142857148,0.559956678189739,-0.12018918668274133,0.22058771987874207,0.3053571428571429,1.085871851814503,-0.15384615384615388,0.047376338882008616,-0.11954620998627068,0.03822990274752389,0.22857142857142854,0.6440771610422785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.8545454545454545,2.909090909090909,0.1268029591199305,1.2193777453037495,0.06424341064243419,0.17964015337549633,-0.25962548291132775,-0.06246706411027924

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as ""an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?"" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a ""witch hunt"" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: ""Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations."" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. ""I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,"" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. ""But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous."" Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, ""cocaine is against the law of the land."" There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: ""We can't have a belt held hostage."" One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. ""Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,"" was Hatton's grim assessment. ""He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. ""But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same."" Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.",human,10.954545454545455,10.166666666666666,13.353846153846154,13.03125,12.421052631578947,-0.5184678171546997,-0.10089110009434553,-0.4793492310224739,-0.29236551833221885,0.3570397856112142,1.277648642272017,1.0047659097280628,1.3647394594951014,0.8897306397306396,1.3000126704302186,0.2272727272727273,0.8887087531239595,0.9717868338557992,1.2073643207997218,0.0,0.0,-0.18181818181818202,1.0635740255693442,-0.2215752941048675,0.12826313250818455,0.1655604444775896,0.7889351290335713,0.3244206773618539,1.1389726714579311,1.1454545454545455,0.9446719445177986,0.7090909090909092,1.3596705650994005,0.2556818181818182,1.3352458969501853,-0.3514370262955999,-0.13799652903463636,0.4943181818181818,1.177498097460899,1.1748251748251746,1.0997658055848873,0.73697521497218,0.5755481925457059,0.534872534872535,0.6494985504429838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.6909090909090905,7.181818181818182,0.12598474967831533,1.8071431578955601,0.29091003807245586,0.31512582823719415,-0.03645143482511927,-0.03873869983376799

The system uses MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency with a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike's Bitcore project. The payments service works like a messenger app where users send one another money directly from their phones (presumably over Wi-Fi) without going through an online or bank account. For instance you could pay any of your friends for coffee by sending them US0.04 via mobile phone text message. Marlinspike told me that he doesn't believe that Bitcoin will ever become mainstream but hopes that ""people realize there are other things to do than just creating more bitcoins."" When asked whether this was potentially bad timing given recent events such as Mt Gox insolvency, Marlinspike said: ""Bitcoin has had issues all year long. It's not for everybody... This [MobilePay] isn't meant to be a replacement for bitcoin; it's mostly for people who want faster access."" Signal Pay is currently only available on iOS but would presumably come to Android soon enough - which should help uptake if anything were to happen to Apple PayGoogle Wallet. Users can choose between two different currencies: fiat currency (2030 at time of writing) or tether, a virtual token used to transfer value across platforms and devices.

The Conservative-run authority will not reveal details of his alleged misconduct. The council had previously rejected calls for an independent inquiry into Mr Suarez's behaviour, but it has now established an internal review panel to hear evidence from councillors and staff about what happened at Labour councillor Zoe Smith's home in May 2018 when they were celebrating her re-election with alcohol provided by Mr Suarez as well as other members of Cheshire East Council cabinet. Conservative group leader Councillor Alan Quinn - who asked why no one else because suspended or sacked over the incident despite their roles being central to events - also called for three council officers involved in investigating the case to be interviewed publicly during full council meetings this month. He claimed that information released under freedom of information laws suggests there is more than sufficient grounds for them to have been dismissed without notice following investigations which they described as being heavily biased against Cllr Smith.",opt_30b,0.6212121212121212,0.0,0.5692307692307692,0.59375,0.0,1.055614653798192,0.7882465862937182,0.8733329710151266,0.8301025899200818,2.122448979591836,2.2743774539465833,1.8132884777123632,2.2752637827798794,1.8364197530864197,2.1660460864443376,1.1,-0.25998562160395083,1.4172413793103449,1.7354504395110157,0.0,0.0,1.7714285714285716,2.1755454171652513,1.1107355065773037,1.4556714839036022,1.437243642329778,1.324248585638115,1.9117647058823533,1.8240390729494895,0.9545454545454548,0.10561068581857506,0.0,0.9525769932796472,0.3437500000000002,0.7152320623810597,-0.017527589724566396,-0.010714843619247419,0.8624999999999998,1.2713117158822838,1.1384615384615382,1.113289361684813,1.359838138593829,0.9927579859387682,-0.20317460317460284,-0.4587176778486071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1636363636363636,0.36363636363636365,-0.6197230228905033,0.6499753808096381,-0.47083382652474626,-1.5960886951920261,2.1555542437053123,2.135877110819219

Opener Steel went on to make his century off 242 balls, smashing three fours and two boundaries en route before being bowled by Ravi Singh in the 12th over with 6 needed from 28 deliveries. Steyn took 4-72 as Black Caps skipper Martin Crowe (3) made 25 not out after Latham's dismissal didn't provoke a run chase. With Ryan McLaren dismissed for 5, South Africa were 346 at one stage after losing their last 8 wickets for 27 runs. In response, Australia lost Cameron White early for 11 to be followed later by Mills who scored only one boundary of five extras - he edged to slip via midwicket, leaving Darren Lehmann stranded on 26. The big hit came just when West Indies had begun to reel them back into contention courtesy of an Angelo Matthews blitz that included seven overs going for 24 runs including a catch dropped by Chris Gayle at cover. Gayle then batted patiently through 90 minutes against tenacious pace bowling from Steve Harmison, until he fell LBW trying to slog to deep square leg for 51. But Josh Little returned him immediately with a superb diving stop to dismiss de Villiers caught by Sajid Mahmood at first slip for 17 having survived a direct hit appeal earlier. It brought Andrew Symonds up to bat with a career best score of 55, adding 64 with little help from Michael Hussey on debut whose slow start was offset by some fabulously timed leaves onto the ring finger of his right hand which stopped it falling off altogether, eventually coming down in the outfield while waving his arms around like a demented man. After cracking Browne with a flat bicep shiverer, Pakistan decided they'd see if its worth spending 100 million dollars per year training this guy or whether it might be more cost effective to throw him away for nothing now.

Canon Enid Morgan remembers the moment a bill to enable women to become bishops failed by three votes in 2008. She was sat among the church's governing body in Lampeter, Ceredigion, when the result was announced. ""There was this feeling of'we're going to carry on discussing this yet again',"" she recalled. Ever since the first woman was made an Anglican deaconess in Usk, Monmouthshire, in 1884, women have been campaigning for greater equality in the church, fighting to prove they were capable of holding the same positions as men. Just 11 years before the failed vote for bishops, the Church in Wales governing body had accepted women becoming priests by one vote in 1997. Canon Morgan, of Aberystwyth, who was among the first 61 women to be ordained, said: ""There were women there who had been deacons for many years, I had been one for 12 years, so there was a lot of frustration. ""So much energy had gone into arguing the case which would have been better going into our work. ""Yet there was also the realisation this had not happened before and will not happen again. It was hugely important."" Canon Morgan, now 76, has been among the ""lucky ones"" who has received much support over the years. She was a lay reader for a decade and studied at the Theological College, Aberystwyth, before being ordained deacon in 1984. She saw her ordination as a priest ""as a sign that times were changing"" and would later become director of the Board of Mission of the Church in Wales. ""I didn't have much in the way of humiliation or rudeness but some women got a rough ride,"" she said. ""Some bishops were very suspicious of us, some thought we might plot. ""If men and women can't get along in the church, then how are they expected to do so anywhere else?"" The move for women bishops would go on to be passed five years later, in 2013. But the barriers women faced in the past still remain today. As Revd Mary Stallard, of Llangollen, Denbighshire, said: ""The whole gender debate has a long way to go. Having women bishops is fabulous but it's not the end of the road in terms of how the church looks at gender. ""The decision-making committee for the finances of the church, for example, has 26 places on the representative body but only two are women. ""Yet if you look across Wales at who balances the books of households, I'm betting women are doing the lion's share."" She and her husband Andrew were the first paid ordained couple in the Church in Wales before both becoming priests - she was among the first women in 1997 - and have gone on to achieve similar qualifications and experiences. Yet Revd Stallard, a chaplain at an Anglican school, said jobs have been more readily offered to her husband while she has often been asked to work part-time or even without a salary. When she found herself in a higher position than her husband, she said she had to ""argue that bit harder for it."" ""I hope we continue on a trajectory of change and if we are going slower in the church, it doesn't mean we won't catch up,"" she said. ""The future for the church is a struggle, but it would be less of a struggle if we stop fighting internally about matters like this. ""We are so much more empowered if we harness the powers of everyone."" Both Canon Morgan and Revd Stallard hope the appointment of Canon Joanna Penberthy as Wales' first female bishop will inspire other women and open further opportunities in the church. ""It matters a great deal for the church, for women and for the women who died before their hopes were realised,"" Canon Morgan said. ""It's a wonderful feeling of completion but in fact it's only really the start.""",human,4.2727272727272725,4.666666666666667,5.384615384615385,5.390625,5.578947368421052,-0.9021174655674395,-0.5119499085501688,-0.6785603567036116,-0.4185505299288221,-0.09235209235209245,0.3614922105772159,0.5337818895430333,0.6409156739634224,0.5086980920314255,0.6597640572985705,-0.40909090909090917,0.3117678674522884,0.653605015673981,1.012929942876568,0.0,0.0,-0.2987012987012988,0.04727912051018651,-0.35023191648833896,0.1550001659249298,0.00894921321500462,0.27048671188315737,0.15062388591800346,0.3499597557809656,0.6151515151515153,0.9476930783310489,0.1333333333333333,0.8427575554953289,0.2698863636363636,-0.019123311343504774,0.08409702140574814,0.41551773441394446,0.017045454545454527,0.499076326895212,0.6293706293706292,0.852923273742332,0.14264036418816392,0.11537112650578908,0.7234247234247234,0.5130645583632348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2,2.5454545454545454,0.40388431352297094,1.1310809670303605,0.1177215375603414,0.6758647915359763,-0.5084941148830442,-0.5515669863546531

It was Pakistan's second successive win and they are now guaranteed a place in the semi-finals. England and Bangladesh are still in contention to join them from Group A. England were bowled out for 160 in 20 overs with Joe Root scoring 48. England bowled out for 160 Pakistan win by 10 wickets Pakistan win with 44 balls remaining Eoin Morgan won the toss and decided to bat but England's innings was effectively over at 55-5. They were 68-6 before a 61-run stand for the seventh wicket between Root and David Willey, who scored 25 from 14 balls. England were out of the game but, in the same manner they played against South Africa, Pakistan's bowlers were too erratic to take full advantage of the position of control they had established. South Africa 176-3 (20 overs): De Villiers 46, Duminy 39 Australia 134-9 (20 overs): Warner 42, Hazlewood 3-23 South Africa won by 42 runs, South Africa won by 42 runs South Africa beat Australia by 42 runs to get their World Twenty20 campaign back on track. Australia, without the injured David Warner and Shane Watson, looked set to chase down a modest target of 177 after Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja put on 45 for the first wicket. But after Khawaja was out to a catch from Dale Steyn, Australia's middle order failed. The Proteas were aided by a poor show by the Australian fielders, who dropped four catches. Faf du Plessis top scored for South Africa, scoring 46 from 42 balls, while Quinton de Kock hit 45 from 33 balls. South Africa had already lost their first group game, against England, while Australia had beaten New Zealand in their opening match. South Africa face Sri Lanka in their next game, while Australia meet India. Sri Lanka 138-6 (20 overs): Mathews 44, Morkel 3-21 South Africa 139-1 (14.5 overs): Amla 56, de Villiers 52, Tahir 1-25 South Africa won by nine wickets, South Africa beat Sri Lanka by nine wickets to reach the semi-finals of the World Twenty20. South Africa knocked out England in the process, meaning the hosts will not qualify from Group 1. South Africa will face West Indies in the last four on Thursday. Sri Lanka made 138-6, with captain Angelo Mathews top-scoring with 44. South Africa's reply was aided by 15 wides as Hashim Amla hit 56 and AB de Villiers made 52 not out, with the winning runs coming with 24 balls to spare. England's defeat to West Indies in their opening game meant they had to beat Sri Lanka to have a chance of progressing.",llama_65B,2.4166666666666665,2.5,2.046153846153846,1.9375,3.526315789473684,-0.3975038786064025,-1.2455585888674567,-1.00836233291122,-1.2985806693568023,0.020408163265305927,0.19226686368870105,-0.24608915054667768,0.21451464716323995,-0.35432098765432063,0.1256530159039251,-0.65,0.14029602838725894,-0.15775862068965504,-0.090545271953415,0.0,0.0,-0.4571428571428572,0.09247607108446732,1.7947598822494266,1.0073802550017388,0.02461033634126324,0.4851848609348127,0.3823529411764707,0.2649405228675427,-0.6554545454545455,0.038476699187449226,-0.09999999999999987,0.5364736066211659,-0.59375,0.09098237986733954,3.2163127144579433,3.2629204990306273,0.5624999999999999,1.4541748327911586,-0.38461538461538464,-0.10331175589616348,-0.05230146686899341,-0.018785271369123727,0.3746031746031748,0.9228749078482473,0.5,0.9746794344808963,0.05,0.21794494717703364,1.1454545454545455,2.0,0.4720626515212071,0.6764280826110103,0.47583363459742883,0.9144931300053806,-0.6149638661436374,-0.8140519314537226

It began development in 2016, with a successful trial run taking place in June 2020. The train utilizes magnetic levitation technology, which works by using magnets to lift the train slightly above the tracks, reducing friction and resulting in faster speeds. This new train is expected to significantly reduce travel times, especially for long-distance journeys, and could potentially revolutionize transportation in the future.",gpt-3.5-trubo,-0.13636363636363635,-0.16666666666666666,-0.26153846153846155,-0.28125,-0.10526315789473684,1.0627259491712868,1.198964727874331,1.2329644343917048,1.558755109572494,-0.04081632653061233,-0.34737841987676205,-0.5828427249789739,-0.6952350295019086,-0.6913580246913578,-0.8082655658467208,0.0,-0.6499640540098776,0.5172413793103448,1.0298564855181456,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,-0.353697645260084,-0.6111189563214894,-0.533515139356195,0.5414273995077932,0.290380174929209,0.0,-0.8959333127821898,-0.44545454545454544,0.276431079068512,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,-0.07812499999999993,-0.3030904634889381,0.4016739311879811,0.34912286907698237,0.5624999999999999,0.5487693390987182,-0.38461538461538464,-0.5732453476658121,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,0.28571428571428586,-0.3699898134060854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2727272727272727,-0.34260156029454597,0.003056175162005163,-0.45157997846503545,-1.002334284626471,0.664131710199329,0.7082347799223134

He allegedly did not provide information regarding his driving as soon as practicable after the incident which happened at 4pm. Snodgrass appeared before Sheriff Alan Mackinnon and pled guilty to all three charges against him from an indictment that had been served on him earlier this month.

UK officials said the bill for policing the embassy, which stands at PS12m (18.8m; 22 million) per year and includes 247 security staff, could be cut if he left voluntarily.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Bill Gates has left Microsoft's board and stepped down from his position on the board of Berkshire Hathaway. Gates stated that he decided to step down in order to dedicate more time to philanthropic activities, including working with Bill Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The BMGF is a private family foundation which was founded by Mr. Gates as well as his wife Melinda French-Gates back in 2000. According to its official website, it is one of the largest charitable foundations globally having an endowment worth over 50 billion. The primary focus areas for this charity are global public health initiatives such as vaccine development; improving healthcare systems worldwide especially in low income countries; reducing childhood mortality rates through programs aimed at treating infectious diseases like malaria, pneumonia etc.; combating poverty and inequality around the world among others. As part of these objectives, nearly half of all money raised goes towards developing ways to fight epidemics. In addition, the organization runs various educational programs related to social welfare issues while also promoting sustainable agriculture practices across the globe. This includes funding agricultural research projects focused mainly on eradicating hunger and malnutrition. Finally, most importantly they have pledged to give away 99 of their personal wealth during their lifetimes in support of humanitarian causes spanning medical advancements and climate change mitigation measures. However given how much cash donations alone do not go far enough in tackling some of the biggest challenges facing humanity today, the Gates couple believe strongly about using technology as both a means and solution for creating positive impact in society. To quote Mr. Gates himself: ""Technology can help people live longer lives and be healthier than ever before."" Therefore investments were made into ventures ranging from training mobile apps designed to detect disease outbreaks faster thereby saving millions of lives annually to tracking spread patterns involving pandemic related data analytics services offered via cloud computing platforms. And even though certain business models might look questionable under closer scrutiny due to privacy risks involved when information pertaining to tens or hundreds of thousands users are being targeted by high tech AI solutions, Gates still believes in supporting companies whose main purpose involves helping vulnerable populations address complex problems such as ensuring access to clean water supplies along with adequate sanitation infrastructure for impoverished communities whereas providing them tools necessary to improve quality of life. Friends close to Gates say that by stepping down from his corporate positions now - long after retiring from Executive Chairman post within Microsoft Corporation last year - will allow him to spend significant amount of time focusing on exploring new opportunities regarding technological innovations aiming to tackle critical health emergencies and other pressing human rights concerns in regions where traditional supply chains fall short despite abundance of resources. He mentioned that there would be no better time to take action considering how Covid19 brought everyone together making us aware that we need each other if we want humankind to survive future threats posed by pathogens just waiting to jump species barriers and cross oceans resulting from deforestation and rising sea levels caused primarily by fossil fuel burning habits adopted mostly by consumers living rich lifestyles often oblivious to consequences faced lagging behind those who act responsibly taking care of environments they rely upon for survival without undue influence coming purely out of profit driven motives. I guess many might agree but may argue whether giving up livelihoods gained throughout years spent advocating socially responsible behavior shifting too fast onto dying gas pedals only because somebody else got control button installed somewhere deep inside your brain causing you to demand answers why everything seems so complicated?",opt_30b,3.8106060606060606,1.8333333333333333,2.8923076923076922,2.953125,1.3157894736842106,1.6681147698323744,0.5913399525284567,1.4703246082416956,0.8870459895249926,2.297619047619047,3.3130995755077772,1.2304457527333894,2.0277520369804676,1.2530864197530864,2.037688493531371,2.125,3.129256218186522,3.3297413793103448,2.757680270894612,0.0,0.0,2.446428571428571,4.029597435413192,-0.10989419828588184,0.40431972546699896,2.9101722723543886,5.12200776021998,2.1029411764705888,2.334894373486493,-0.2704545454545454,0.044982360140925604,0.42500000000000004,0.7181934472125098,-0.6640624999999999,0.14502158905553578,-0.1223279699527033,0.2842705639686566,0.46874999999999994,0.8659123999747639,0.596153846153846,1.5729103361691874,1.1440945877592312,1.4974564467103495,-0.2142857142857141,0.019777164875005256,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.4841229182759271,5.8,2.727272727272727,-0.7592441488690894,1.747384346018085,-0.5125369220943637,-2.1867904122743673,2.647111383444036,2.4200641626987762

Prices in London, which make up a large part of the property market in the East, rose by 10.4. The ONS said that the average house price in the East stood at 300,000 in the year to July, up from 276,000 a year earlier. London saw even larger increases, with prices rising by 10.4 to an average of 472,000. Overall, UK house prices rose by 7.7, with the average cost of a property standing at 247,000. The ONS said that the growth in house prices was driven largely by increased demand from buyers, with the number of transactions across the country having risen by 9.1 in the year to July. However, there were signs that the market was beginning to cool, with annual growth slowing for the fourth consecutive month. This may be due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit, as well as affordability issues for some potential buyers.",text-davinci-003,0.48484848484848486,0.5,0.5384615384615384,0.625,0.8421052631578947,-0.9017693976463155,-0.4196749960444469,-0.4701474243130889,-0.13661874505685467,-0.04081632653061233,-0.11845665218587197,0.09714045416316232,-0.22605436197357429,0.24845679012345692,0.062060801928519704,-0.25,-0.22208466083522715,0.5172413793103448,0.11689407536792445,0.0,0.0,-0.017857142857142985,-0.1927409033946477,-0.021442770397245223,0.06574561261351335,-0.31993437243642336,-0.18092053091921054,1.8161764705882355,0.8090882999220083,-0.9704545454545455,0.044982360140925604,-1.2,-1.5876283221327456,1.09375,1.0150965876531246,0.8508184178799963,0.297647495328325,-0.7499999999999999,-0.4485428686500814,-0.7307692307692307,-0.5126147735878946,0.0653768335862418,0.018172924107269613,0.17460317460317476,-0.5161985285489611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.14545454545454545,0.18181818181818182,1.011476202758935,-0.21422537092491756,0.15786325297601242,0.4736728910024989,-0.3444660140953975,-0.0711682414458615

The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common hierarchical approach. But none of them felt right, and the team was lacking in motivation and focus. So they decided to try something different. Rather than having a traditional top-down hierarchy, Crisp implemented a self-organising model, where individual teams were responsible for their own decision-making. This meant that each team had autonomy to decide how to best achieve their goals - with guidance from an overall leadership team. The result? A more collaborative atmosphere, increased motivation and better performance across the board. Crisp's success story should serve as a reminder that sometimes trying something different is the only way to truly unlock potential. It can also be a great way to increase employee engagement and creativity. Organisations that are willing to experiment with new organisational models may find that it leads to improved efficiency and productivity - not to mention happier employees.",text-davinci-003,0.5454545454545454,1.0,0.5538461538461539,0.609375,0.5789473684210527,1.0912124754042096,1.2090351759889728,1.4317773098264643,1.9841249648718537,-0.7025355596784167,0.052358495575216074,-0.6122792262405382,-0.14242051146066448,-0.5440516273849605,-0.17435543907348824,0.5,0.6985972628137076,0.5172413793103448,0.37385941607684153,0.0,0.0,-0.2857142857142858,-0.1350643498840545,-0.8362680454925644,-0.7882435804039688,-0.30427324931016475,0.19853290852938826,-1.147058823529412,-0.311312502199383,-0.5727272727272728,-0.059267156195052434,-0.10909090909090913,1.240647525442693,-0.5255681818181818,-0.4294800392995061,-0.27884801834537526,-0.12123917679900165,0.2897727272727273,1.4004128482647924,-0.15384615384615388,-0.21079652265453405,0.332827516439049,0.26312659601051114,-0.2193362193362193,0.3289772371662122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6909090909090909,0.5454545454545454,-0.19481759116513694,0.36995602148255313,-0.023975286941130144,-0.8976748896716623,0.26051325998363684,0.25511630393477386

The six-month interim deal agreed in Geneva prompted a fall in oil prices on markets on Monday. But Israel's prime minister has warned the agreement is a ""historic mistake."" On Monday Benjamin Netanyahu announced that an Israeli team led by national security adviser Yossi Cohen would travel to Washington for talks on the deal. ""This accord must bring about one outcome: the dismantling of Iran's military nuclear capability,"" he said. On Sunday, US President Barack Obama told Mr Netanyahu in a phone call that the US understood Israel ""has good reason to be sceptical about Iran's intentions"" and promised to consult its ally closely, the White House said. Mr Netanyahu has warned that Israel ""will not allow a regime that calls for the destruction of Israel to obtain the means to achieve this goal."" Saudi Arabia - Iran's regional rival - cautiously welcomed the deal on Monday. ""This agreement could be a first step towards a comprehensive solution for Iran's nuclear programme, if there are good intentions,"" a statement said. However, a London-based Saudi official earlier told the BBC his country had been lied to. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the Geneva accord, but said it was only a ""first step."" ""We are right to test to the full Iran's readiness to act in good faith,"" he told the House of Commons. Mr Fabius told French radio that ""Iran is committed to giving up the prospect of nuclear weapons. It's perfectly clear."" However, he insisted the temporary deal could be reversed if its terms were not adhered to. Asked when sanctions could start to be lifted, he said it could begin ""in December."" France, the UK, Germany, the US, Russia and China took part in the talks with Iran, hosted by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Baroness Ashton's spokesman Michael Mann said the timing would be co-ordinated with Iran. ""It could be in December, it could be in January, it depends how long the legislative process takes,"" he told reporters. Under the deal which will last six months, Iran would receive some 7bn (PS4.3bn) in ""limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible [sanctions] relief"" while a permanent agreement is sought. In return, Tehran has agreed to a series of measures. Key points of the deal include: Arriving at Tehran's Mehrabad airport, Iran's negotiators were welcomed by hundreds of cheering supporters carrying flowers and flags. Addressing state TV, Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Iran was prepared to take the necessary steps to keep the deal on track. World powers have suspected Iran of secretly trying to develop a nuclear bomb - a charge Iran strongly denies. A raft of sanctions has been imposed on Iran by the UN, US and the European Union. President Obama welcomed the deal, saying it would ""help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon."" It has also been revealed that the US and Iran held a series of face-to-face talks in recent months that paved the way for the agreement but were kept secret even from their allies. The interim agreement with Iran - the world's fourth-largest oil producer - prompted a fall in oil prices in early Asian trading with Brent crude falling by more than 2. By Mark MardellNorth America editor Although Iran will not be allowed to increase its oil sales for six months, analysts say the deal is perceived by the markets as reducing risk in the Middle East. Earlier, US Secretary of State John Kerry told ABC's This Week programme that he hoped Congress would not pass new sanctions on Iran. Some senators have expressed concerns about the deal and say more sanctions are possible. In a nationwide broadcast on Sunday, President Rouhani repeated that his country would never seek nuclear weapons. ""No matter what interpretations are given, Iran's right to enrichment has been recognised,"" he said. The deal comes just over three months since Mr Rouhani - regarded as a relative moderate - took office replacing the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It has also been backed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in nuclear matters.",human,4.553030303030303,5.0,4.2,4.1875,6.052631578947368,-0.14089629847946886,-0.17850806128650124,-0.24658153936157376,-0.2632322277547687,-0.10495626822157443,0.1133834243130844,-0.21463414634146358,0.08797036387377798,-0.23765432098765413,0.15439020572734038,0.0714285714285714,0.3816932734101279,-0.1684729064039409,0.08753360940613979,0.0,0.0,-0.38367346938775526,0.10791280408313661,0.6524728706590337,0.7751352600586177,0.15750615258408535,0.16711123783133625,-0.18571428571428578,0.19749245777738528,0.3145454545454548,0.31493777932402234,-0.6285714285714286,0.0352493241725126,0.04910714285714289,0.11075024710931519,-0.2912918482796995,-0.1305852693289614,0.3482142857142856,1.2200300337319516,-0.23296703296703303,0.12853223424430654,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,0.634920634920635,0.5964539855318356,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,0.3331972511340172,3.2545454545454544,3.1818181818181817,0.07240450992162044,1.3206061823019783,0.054849217747722924,0.3067644606718056,-0.2626030974831552,-0.12051473664954314

Goals from Daniel Candeias, Ryan Jack and Connor Goldson ensured Rangers' 10th win in a row. The result leaves Kilmarnock fourth, with Thistle slipping to 10th. Livingston moved up to fifth with a 4-0 win at Hamilton Academical. Rangers took an early lead when Candeias swept home in the box, and they continued to control the game. Jack doubled their lead, pouncing on a weak parry from visiting goalkeeper Lee Robinson. A third was added in the second half, Goldson heading in from the edge of the box. Thistle's only real chance came when Miles Storey was denied by goalkeeper Allan McGregor in the first half.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A Chinese court has granted Qualcomm an injunction against Apple in a patent infringement case. The patents affect all devices sold with iOS 11 or earlier, so all iPhones from the iPhone 6S onwards. The news of the injunction was reported by CNBC, which says that the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court had ruled that Apple infringed on two patents held by Qualcomm. Qualcomm confirmed the news. According to Qualcomm, the court granted two injunctions against four subsidiaries of Apple, as well as ordering Apple to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of all infringing iPhones in China. It says that Apple violated the two patents by ""using these technologies in the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X."" Apple has confirmed to CNBC that all iPhones remain available for sale in China. This is because Qualcomm's case targets older devices with iOS 11 or earlier, not iOS 12, which is on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR. This is the latest legal dispute between the two companies. Apple and Qualcomm have been embroiled in a patent dispute since January 2017 when Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm claiming the company charged unfair royalties for its technology. Qualcomm countersued and the battle has been raging ever since. In July, Qualcomm asked for a Chinese ban on the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Qualcomm said in its suit that these models infringe on two patents, one for resizing photos and one for managing apps using a touchscreen. The dispute between the companies has been heating up of late, with Qualcomm filing patent suits against Apple in China and Germany. Apple claims that Qualcomm has been unfair in its licensing practices, whereas Qualcomm has said that it is asking only for a ""fair and reasonable"" amount of money. It's unclear how the injunction in China will affect Apple. While it will be interesting to see if Apple sales will be affected in the country, Qualcomm will be eager to get a similar ban on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR, which were released after the injunction was granted. However, it might not be that easy, as Apple has confirmed that all iPhones remain available for sale in China.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Fifty sheep were stolen from a farm in Ammanford and the farmer spotted a flock two weeks later at a livestock market in Llanybydder. After the ewes gave birth, paternity tests confirmed their owners as having sired lambs born to them. The farmers are now fighting back against relatives who want custody of the animals under a Welsh law that can allow family members to demand children be returned after they turn 18 years old. Lawyers have argued it is not possible for an adult's consent alone to remove parental rights over minor children without explicit legislative provision. They say there must either be a court order or clear evidence showing abuse by one parent before the other party's parental right can be removed. In this case, the parents are angry about what happened when the twins turned 16 - but only because they had been estranged for several months. This did mean mother was unable to visit her sons on any regular basis during the school holidays or while she worked outside Wales. Indeed, the father lived abroad for much of 2011-2012 and even then he visited rarely. The fact that the boys' grandparents wanted the animals should provide no deterrent if we really care about animal welfare. If anything it almost certainly means these people care more than most about keeping those animals alive! Paternity testing shows all 50 ewe lambs belonged to humans named Robert Allen Davies and Ruth Evelyn Evans. According to reports, Mr Davies said: ""If I'd known at first how long my wife would take away from me it wouldn't have been so bad."" He went on to add, ""It makes you feel like a dog being left out in the rain."" But what exactly constitutes not knowing? Perhaps receiving 10 emails asking where your son has gone or him saying he's going away with his girlfriend might count (the wiser move here being an email address frozen prior to 30 June). Of course many things happen which cannot always be foreseen - this could include each person thinking the other may eventually come home again. Such circumstances need obviously careful planning - and perhaps by making arrangements with someone else such as family friends or family pets, rather than just staring into space waiting until something happens. Alternatively, could some form of joint guardianship arrangement be negotiated? Could the ewes themselves consent to adoption? Does lack of contact actually prove abandonment? Probably not. To assume otherwise amounts to punishing the child (or the human) rather than taking responsibility for what happened. One does wonder sometimes whether modern day paternalism in Britain isn't too reminiscent of Nazi Germany... On the subject of neglecting an adopted child, it didn't seem far fetched to use terms such as ""neglect"" and ""abandonment"" if the boy seems to be living quite happily off-grid in South Africa. It wasn't easy to get hold of an opinion on this story from Twitter users - though some described Mr Davies and Ms Evans as dishonest; others noted that neither ever intended to give up full custody of their son. It appears Mr Davies has already lost half the herd through sale, and Wales allows fathers to register ownership of individual animals without permission from mothers. In addition, although the twins had reached majority age shortly before the theft, no legal authority yet exists whereby parents can legally be prevented from giving their offspring consent to removal all the way up to adulthood - and indeed the ability to do so remains a matter for future legislation. Ultimately, parenthood may depend upon personal relationships between parentchild, and not simply biological ties. UPDATE 7th April 2012: A couple of questions still surround this particular issue. First, why didn't this man return until 2 12 yrs ago? Maybe he was afraid of losing custody and putting himself in poverty - since he never tried before. Also, he knew the kids would be grown when he came back.He mentioned in twitter rants that nothing he's done entitles anyone to keep something he cares about.

This article walks through how to use CSS as a backend for an API endpoint in Node.js and Express. Introduction As the internet continues its march towards more and more data being stored on client machines (and away from servers), static content is becoming increasingly important. It's harder than ever before to strike up a conversation with someone by using just text communications alone without images or videos involved, there are no words to interpret between two people. However, this isn't new: the first email service providers were largely based around presenting plaintext information to users, and most of us still rely heavily on HTML documents today because they work well when viewed on screens which aren't mobile friendly (or even capable). The ability to send large amounts of textual communication over a network has become ubiquitous; we take it for granted now, so much so that often times we don't think about why it works at all. The web works via HTTP requests and responses, where each response consists of a set of keyvalue pairs that are sent back after every request made to any website you visit. These values describe what should show up on your screen next, whether it's another page load, an image file, some CSS or JavaScript code, media files such as video or audio clips, etc. If only one piece of information makes an entire webpage look different, then these pieces must communicate together somehow. In order to do this effectively, the browser needs to be able to understand exactly what kind of document is being presented, and the best way to ensure that happens is by sending along a small description of what type of resource it will respond with later. One of those types of descriptions is a MIME header, also known commonly as Content Type. A Content Type field tells the browser which format the underlying file will have, notifying it what type of information it may expect to find inside. While browsers already make educated guesses like ""HTML"" or ""XML,"" modern versions go further and provide tools that let developers customize their own list of potential mime types. Example Content Types might include PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, JPG, PDF, WOFF2, MP3, SVG, OGG. By default, these sort of customizations happen when your web application sends out cross-site requests, meaning requests to other sites within your domain, since the browser needs to know if something else expects to handle your incoming requests differently. But things get interesting when it comes to serving our own resources. As long as everything lives under our site's root directory, accessing them directly won't require making external changes. So far, nothing too special - except that the browser refers to all resources automatically by looking into the URL itself. Now imagine if your site contained multiple pages, and you wanted the user experience to change depending on what page it currently sits on? Well, here lies the rub: URLs aren't enough anymore! And while it seems obvious nowadays that people shouldn't put sensitive information in public facing locations, online businesses need to consider both security concerns and visitor friendliness and usability. Your visitors want speed and convenience above anything else right now, and the longer it takes for them to find what they're searching for, the less likely they'll continue browsing your site in the future. Having a consistent style throughout your whole site speeds up navigation significantly, especially when you have lots of links that lead off to various parts of the same thing. Let's call a spade a spade and admit that websites are ultimately geared toward achieving conversion rates - having optimized performance characteristics greatly improves conversions. Sure, if you've got really good SEO going on underneath your business model, maybe you could afford to worry about the quality of your site's design, but who hasn't heard horror stories of companies whose individual pages hadn't been touched in years? Using a single style sheet across many different pages can dramatically improve conversion rate optimization efforts. By providing users with a simple interface to browse your site, and allowing keywords specific to your current product line to pop out visually alongside relevant links, you increase search engine visibility. You'd probably rather hire human beings to select photos for your stock imagery section instead of spending hours manually tagging hundreds of pictures yourself, wouldn't you? Whether you're considering having a dedicated developer build a frontend with AngularJS, React or EFX, or starting from scratch with Jade, Haml or Liquid, using a template language removes the burden of building interfaces completely from your plate, leaving room for more time spent crafting great features. What does all of this amount to? More money for you, more profit for everyone. Right? Wrong, actually. I'm sure you saw the headlines circling around recently proclaiming that fewer Americans than ever use Facebook per month. That's... bad news, obviously. Even worse though, is that roughly half of those folks logged onto the social networking giant globally reported that quitting altogether would reduce user stress levels considerably.

The flag, one of only three surviving from 1845 and initially thought to be lost for good when it went missing during World War I, has now finally returned home after being reclaimed by its rightful owner Mr Corbins's grandfather bought the flag - originally used as a screen over two barrels on an outhouse wall - in 1945, but Mr Corbin insisted that his parents never let him or his brother play with it. He added: ""It stayed in storage until we were old enough to get married."" His wife, Anthea, 50, grew up just down the road and knew nothing about the flag. She read about it recently online before her husband told her what happened. Mrs Cory explained: ""When I came into our bedroom that morning she was sat there looking very serious, so we asked if anything wrong. ""She then told us how proud they were of their family history but no-one ever spoke about them going back any further than 1948. And she really wanted the flag back because it is part of her heritage too. We are absolutely thrilled that something like this can happen. It shows you life goes on. These things don't just disappear off the face of the earth."" Last Wednesday (October 4), Mark Lloyd OBE visited Swansea Museum where staff discovered more information about the flag. They tracked its route through Wales using records dating back to the 1960s which included the sale of many items connected to former owners including furniture, pictures, china and silverware. They found that Andrew Holmes, who died in 1900 aged 33 years, owned the barometer flag after acquiring it from William Smith in Cardiff. He sold every item except the flag and four framed photographs of himself leaving the shop behind - all of which could be seen hanging in the museum today. When the Guinness Wine Company in Birmingham decided to buy Welsh flags to use outside bars around England the company sent a representative named Austin Joseph Andrews to purchase the flag and other objects associated with the brewery from 19th century businessman Thomas Llewelyn Davies. After initial negotiations failed in 1925 Timothy Evans replaced Mr Andrews as representative for the Guinness brand. Unfortunately, due to war regulations the banners remained stored inside the building until being recovered in 2018 following the end of the first world war. Today, Gareth Williams, head curator of collections and exhibitions at Swansea Museum, welcomed the return and hoped that curators would learn more about people who lived nearby. A statement released by the museum quoted Mr Davies' grandson Eric Fagan describing Mr Corbs's dream. The family later contacted the National Trust about returning the flag to Somerset Place, home to Sir Ivor Roberts Jones and Lady Julia Margaret Sanderson. In 1947, the couple made a deal with the Blaengwynfa estate - land donated by Lord Dynevor and Lady Jane Arthur between 1856 and 1888 - granting the right to build Bryngarw House within 22 acres of parkland covering 1.25 hectares. Another agreement allowed them to extend the house and retain ownership of the water meadows. Despite the fact that the couple did not live at Bryngarw House or even visit regularly, the original plans submitted by architect John Douglas Bruce show they occupied a large stone pavilion set amongst formal gardens. At various times, members of the Arthur family also built several houses nearby, such as nearby Gowerton Manor and Cefn Mawr, another property whose grounds abut those of Bryngarw House.

Beltran landed a left hook that dropped Burns in the eighth round, but the Scot managed to fight back and finish the round strong. There were contrasting views of the fight. The contest, which Burns took in his home country, was a thriller as the two battled from the opening bell. Burns, who was making his fourth defence of the WBO belt, now has 39 wins in 43 fights, with three defeats and one draw. ""He's a great fighter, he's tough, and I'm really glad I got the win."" ""When I was down, he was up, but I got back on my feet and got back on the front foot."" ""I believe he deserves it."" ""I just said to my trainer, 'I'll be honest with you, I don't know if I've won that fight, he said. ""I showed I could punch and box, but I was fighting the wrong fight."" ""I felt I was going to stop him."" 'I did, ' he said. Beltran was making his seventh attempt at winning a world title, having previously been beaten by WBC champion Juan Manuel Marquez, Shawn Porter, Danny Garcia and Paul McCloskey. ""I thought I'd done enough to win the fight."" ""I felt strong, I felt I was winning the rounds."" ""I am very disappointed but I thought it was a good fight."" Beltran had his first real success in the seventh, when he caught the Scot with a right hand. ""I'm not taking away from his victory but I believe I won the fight."" ""I hope he can take it."" ""You could see it was a really tough fight,"" said Burns. ""He's one of the best at the weight, and one of the best in the world.""",llama_65B,1.5984848484848484,2.6666666666666665,2.1384615384615384,2.203125,3.8421052631578947,-1.854625812887296,-1.2238115271075216,-1.6157561766314443,-1.4949297764690166,-0.8150307742144476,0.09177093113205345,-0.28371180263526763,0.1538775798742235,-0.24999999999999978,0.15211262442711979,-0.5,0.20109957816497787,-0.12561576354679801,0.46328829332334875,0.0,0.0,-1.1020408163265307,-0.16252371123795167,-0.4257921550310127,0.5584229850430721,-0.16406890894175555,-0.07727090494251189,-1.0378151260504205,-0.09555968581574496,-0.04545454545454524,0.39841385872535107,0.1333333333333333,0.8784130425101645,-0.33482142857142844,0.4381061097197345,0.35889826578874157,1.4645613489342235,-0.36607142857142855,0.58870506467256,1.3406593406593403,0.5287119871966202,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456342,0.9735449735449736,-0.07675420552303135,0.14285714285714285,0.63887656499994,0.0,0.0,0.5636363636363636,1.2727272727272727,0.7197333953750904,0.41714613239985254,0.5150945636714436,1.790564095141737,-1.6328957391666772,-1.4852691348413016

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Scientists have created a vaccine for cat allergies that trains the immune systems of cats, instead of desensitizing the immune system of people allergic to cats. Hypocat trains the cat's immune system to ignore the protein Fel d 1, which is the culprit responsible for allergic reactions in cat owners. ""Cat allergen is a huge social problem,"" said study researcher Clare Bryant, from Cambridge University. ""Our study shows that we can effectively reduce levels of the most potent cat allergen, Fel d 1, from a cat's coat by simply vaccinating the cat. This could reduce the risk of developing allergies in a person exposed to a cat."" The vaccine is an injection of modified cat protein, which is an extract of dead bacteria. The cat's body sees the protein as an invader, and makes antibodies to fight the invader, so that the next time the cat encounters the protein, it will be able to fight it. The scientists injected two cats with the vaccine, and compared the allergens in their blood, saliva, and fur to those of a control group of cats who were not injected. The results showed that the levels of the protein in the vaccinated cats' fur was 10 times less than in the control group. The vaccinated cats also had less of the protein in their saliva and blood. Hypocat is currently being tested on cats in the United States and will be tested in Europe later this year. The goal is to reduce the amount of allergen in the cat's fur, saliva and urine. The study was published in the journal Allergy. You can learn more about cat allergies in the Everyday Health Allergies Center.

Nevertheless, the STRB has recommended a pay rise of just 1 for teachers in England to bring them up to parity with those on other public sector jobs - ie 45k per annum compared with under-40k now. The report also recommends that more must be done in terms of improving school leadership and management as well as the quality of teaching staff (particularly classroom assistants) - both key areas highlighted by Ofsted recently as needing improvement across all schools. It is proposed too that class sizes should not be allowed to increase above 30 pupils unless there are specific reasons why this is necessary and without consultation involving parentsguardians or local communities; much like they do in Wales at present. Finally it calls for further reform to make individualised assessment based around exam results rather than simply qualification levels known as ""standard"" qualifications so irrelevant assessments such as OCRs can no longer be used as an alternative basis. This proposal was rejected last year but may have been reconsidered because of recent changes made to International Baccalaureate exams which began in 2012 and for GCSE English Maths which were introduced after 2010. In May 2013, several MPs called upon ministers to abolish standardisation altogether and allow uniformity within certain subjects instead (see here). However, while many would agree that subject choice could be better managed, others say an end to standardisation ultimately means less focus being placed on core skills within any particular subject area. Although I think the latter view might be somewhat exaggerated as most people still use their abacus every day regardless of whether they learn Chinese numerals or algebra! But anyway, back to the point... Sue Bayliss, headteacher of Avon Primary School near Taunton, Somerset said: ""We welcome these recommendations from the independent review into salary progression for education professionals."" She added""The proposals put forward today propose real steps towards addressing issues identified during the Select Committee inquiry. We look forward to seeing how government responds to these proposals.""Simon Rosenblatt, Executive Director of Education Policy Institute UK (EPIUK), commented: ""This recommendation makes good sense and marks a shift away from the system where underperforming educators earn higher salaries than high performing ones.

And he has been a regular in Derek McInnes's side over the past two seasons, playing a key role in the team's run to the Scottish League Cup final last season. McKenna has made 66 appearances for Aberdeen and scored four goals. He also played a key role in helping the Dons to their first major trophy since 1995, when they defeated Inverness CT in the 2014-15 Scottish League Cup final. McKenna is highly regarded at Pittodrie and has been rewarded with a new three-year contract that will keep him at the club until 2018. He becomes the latest Aberdeen player to commit his future to the club, following Adam Rooney, Ash Taylor, Graeme Shinnie, Ryan Jack and Niall McGinn signing new deals in recent months. McKenna is delighted to have extended his stay at Pittodrie and is looking forward to helping the team build on their success of last season. ""I'm really pleased to sign a new deal with Aberdeen and I'm excited to be part of the club for another three years,"" McKenna said. ""It was a great season last year and we want to continue that progress over the coming campaigns. ""I feel I'm learning all the time here and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead under Derek McInnes."" McInnes added: ""Mark has been an important member of the squad since he joined us and this new deal is fully deserved.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was based on the principles of truth, non-violence and simple living. He believed in self-sufficiency and started several projects such as a handloom weaving center, a dairy, a cattle shed and a school for poor children. He was Mahatma Gandhi, India's preeminent leader who led the country to freedom from British rule. Gandhi was an advocate of non-violent civil disobedience and an inspiration to millions of people across India and beyond. His commitment to justice and his dedication to the principles of non-violence and simple living earned him the title of 'Father of the Nation'. During his time at Sevagram, Gandhi focused on developing the village into a model of self-reliance.

The game has levels that increase in difficulty, and uses various Vim commands to progress through each level. For example, the player may need to use 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' keys to move around a maze, or use 'd' and 'y' to delete and yank blocks of text. There are also bonus levels which have extra challenges and rewards.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed tweeted out her support on Tuesday: ""We are grateful to jack and all of our employers in sf who have stepped up during this pandemic by allowing people to continue working remotely."" During an earnings call last week with investors, Jack Dorsey said that one lesson learned is how much flexibility there was when it came to productivity - and what he's going to do about it moving forward. The company initially sent everyone home into quarantine mode before reopening its office space just two weeks ago, leaving some staff members feeling uneasy over their safety amid the ongoing public health crisis. A number of tech firms including Facebook and Google made similar plans earlier in May because many remote workers were experiencing burnout or found that being away from the traditional workplace environment boosted creativity and collaboration among team members.",opt_30b,0.8257575757575758,0.16666666666666666,0.8,0.828125,0.21052631578947367,0.15407082590642707,-0.1042942517236955,0.3845242458447072,0.6396193962207043,1.9092970521541948,-0.5980712314767377,1.7269414073451081,0.08727860921905449,1.7500000000000002,-0.11334993301395282,0.6666666666666665,0.08733875454383165,2.2672413793103443,1.2396755656313325,0.0,0.0,1.6428571428571426,0.15375645698446885,0.5289216697987159,0.21092070559109108,1.4602132895816238,-0.03890502050847907,1.6568627450980398,0.28370075321634564,0.7212121212121213,0.11062703914585043,1.1333333333333335,1.2622517335870087,-0.31249999999999994,-0.40705274822888493,0.1022442733933043,0.0,0.5624999999999999,1.324846381066645,1.3846153846153841,1.1499384775402655,1.3075366717248358,1.0601452623466732,0.21164021164021168,0.35625374248354813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3636363636363635,1.1818181818181819,-0.6068242340264307,0.6437731561387352,0.10211087045424709,-1.0832468072469204,1.6981387177535998,1.5162933647113708

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning strikes across half of Europe and even outside the continent's borders. The new analysis shows how complex the events are that lead to lightning slamming into a person or an aircraft or crashing through a roof (below). Lightning can strike anywhere on Earth at any time of year. It is usually triggered by convection, when air cools down rapidly underground after rainfall has occurred.[1] Rainwater evaporates into clouds where it releases heat that causes evaporation from surrounding water drops and forms rising warm layers within the cloud called ""tower-cloud systems."" Cooler rain falling back down mixes with this warmer layer causing local cooling. This creates updrafts that lift cold dense air up above the cloud base. Heat rises but cooler higher levels force heated air downwards creating downdrafts. These two forces compete for control over airflow, eventually resulting in strong vertical winds forming what looks like waves inside the cloud. At these wave fronts thunderstorms are born. Thunderstorms produce very large amounts of electrical energy that they use to discharge into our atmosphere as bolts of lightening. An average thunderstorm produces about 10 billion kilowatts of power, compared to 1 billion watts produced by most nuclear reactors worldwide and between 5 million and 20 million times stronger than human sources such as wind turbines[2]. A typical thunderstorm will have several thousand flashes per second and each one may be around 100 kilometers long (or 60 miles), 3 meters wide and tens of thousands volts high [3]. Although many small storms are more common than gigantic ones, there have been documented cases when thousands of people witnessed massive storms on a single day [45]. While some of them seem so violent they could tear apart mountains, others are barely noticeable or not seen at all until moments before impact[6]. Even then we often do not know exactly why someone was struck because less severe lightning injuries occur every minute. In fact, according to reports from Australia alone there were already 219 fatal lightning incidents reported last year, while over 90 percent of those injured survive their accident because paramedics arrive quickly and medical teams equip themselves accordingly[7]. However, no matter how hard you try to prepare yourself against impending death, chances are your body won't necessarily protect itself - it's simply too late. If lightning strikes somewhere other than indoors, it might still kill if it hits key parts of your heart muscle or brain stem. But since it occurs relatively rarely, you should expect to die mostly due to accidental injury - either accidentally injuring yourself first or dying from blood loss as soon as possible following your attack. According to a study published online today in Nature Communications, scientists now believe that some of the deadliest storms on record actually never happened: the original stories told by eyewitnesses describing monstrous bolts of lighting hitting buildings suddenly disappeared from popular media outlets shortly afterward. For example, reports dating back dozens of years of major tornadoes striking Kansas and Oklahoma did not mention anything else besides damage caused by strong straight lines of wind gusts. When researchers studied old newspaper articles, however, much closer examination revealed numerous instances of witnesses claiming to see huge thunderbolts flash around entire cities at once. Researchers analyzed data from weather stations across North America and found similar patterns of simultaneous widespread thunderstorms erupting roughly every month of 2014 and 2015. Several months later, newspapers republished the previous accounts of giant twisters ripping walls off houses and flipping cars without mentioning the additional witnesses who had mysteriously vanished. Some websites quietly changed headlines or deleted news items altogether after being contacted by journalists seeking comment. The identities of hundreds of witnesses were shared anonymously among volunteers via social networks, historical records and archives. Reporters canvassed interviews with civil defense officials and meteorologists who offered evidence weighing in favor of the claims, including eye witness accounts of monsters shaped like comets and airplanes flying through the sky before colliding with buildings. Meteorologist John Braunmiller said he believes the pattern did happen given his experience studying atmospheric conditions throughout history. He says there have always been extreme examples of violent thunderstorms recorded, though not linked directly to a tornado. They include huge hailstones, hail stones larger than golf balls; lightnings that send shockwaves traveling deeper than 30 km (20 mi) below ground level; and dark shapes moving near the surface of lakes. 'It seems probable based upon my research that something close to what I'm talking about exists,' Braunmiller said. Another researcher agreed that the phenomenon could possibly exist, although she thinks its existence hasn't yet fully been proven scientifically. Researcher Karen Raymo, director of MIT's Center for Climatological Statistics, adds that the idea of supernatural phenomena happening simultaneously across multiple regions is certainly plausible considering modern science doesn't explain everything yet.'I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to find out someday that planets behave differently than we thought, Raymo tells Live Science.

Professional skydiver and BASE jumper Peter Salzmann, who was part of the development team, is the first person to take the jet-powered wingsuit to the sky. The wingsuit is equipped with a carbon frame and three small jet engines, providing Salzmann with additional lift and thrust. It's powered by a battery that can provide enough energy for a 6-minute flight, and Salzmann can control the wingsuit with a throttle located on his chest. Wearing a helmet with an integrated heads-up display, Salzmann can also view his altitude, speed, and a speed graphic. BMW believes the wingsuit could be used for search and rescue missions, where its capabilities could be used to reach areas that are not easily accessible. It's also possible that the wingsuit could be used in motorsport events. Watch Salzmann take the wingsuit out for a spin in the video below. Airbus has developed a seat concept for its new A321neo LR jetliner that allows you to fly in style. The seat is similar to a premium economy seat in terms of space, but it's enclosed in a pod-like structure with a seat that reclines into a lie-flat bed, a desk, and a 16-inch monitor. The seat can be used for work or relaxation, and it's easy to transform the seat into a fully lie-flat bed. There's also a small compartment where you can store a few items and access the seat controls. Airbus hasn't announced when the new seat will be available, but it's expected to be available in the next few years. You can see the seat in the video below. The Concept Airbus is not the first attempt to create a comfortable area for airline passengers. A company in Russia has designed a first class suite for airlines that features a built-in bed, desk, and television. The luxurious suite, called the ""First Class Skycruiser,"" features a bed that can be easily moved into an upright position, turning it into a lounge chair. If you need to work, you can also pull out a small desk that can be used to hold your laptop or tablet. The suite also features an LCD television, hidden storage compartments, and shelves. Due to limited space, the suite is only available for first class passengers. The company is currently trying to sell the suite to commercial airlines, and they hope to have them installed on planes within a few years. You can watch a video of the suite in action below.

Test results show that it can save users between 30 to 50 percent of the time they usually spend on typing code. Python autocomplete is a project that experiments with using an LSTM model to autocomplete python code. It takes advantage of the open source python library, keras, to build an LSTM model that predicts the next word in a sentence. This project has one script, predictor.py, that runs the model and predicts the next word. It also has a tester script, tester.py, that generates random code and tests the LSTM model on it. Test results show that it can save users between 30 to 50 percent of the time they usually spend on typing code. Python Autocomplete uses a custom LSTM model, which is a recurrent neural network. It consists of one-dimensional input, two hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer has the dimensionality of a number of characters in a word. The hidden layers each have 128 neurons. The output layer has 600 neurons, corresponding to the total number of words in the vocabulary. The LSTM model takes in a sequence of words as an input and predicts the next word in that sequence. Python autocomplete converts each word in a sentence to a vector of real numbers. A word vector has the same number of dimensions as the input layer in the LSTM model. In the case of this model, the number of dimensions is 100. A word vector is a vector of real numbers between 0 and 1 that represents the word. Python autocomplete uses a pre-trained word vector called GloVe. The LSTM model then takes in the sequence of word vectors as inputs and predicts the next word vector in the sequence. The word vector is then converted back into a word. The project has two scripts, one to train and predict and another to test. The first, predictor.py, is run only once to train the model and then to predict the next word in a sentence. The second, tester.py, generates random sentences in python code and feeds it to the model. It then compares the predicted word to the correct word and calculates the accuracy and the time saved. The predictor.py script first builds the vocabulary of words that it can use. It takes a list of all the words in the python code and removes all the words that don't start with a lowercase letter. This is because the LSTM model is case sensitive. It also removes any words that are less than three characters long because the model cannot predict those words. It then goes through the list and converts each word into a word vector. The script then trains the model on the word vectors and saves it. The predictor.py script then takes in an input of a sentence and predicts the next word. It first converts each word in the sentence into a word vector. The script then feeds the word vectors into the model and uses the output to predict the next word vector in the sequence. It then converts the word vector back into a word and outputs it. The tester.py script generates random python code and feeds it to the model. It first generates a list of all the words in the vocabulary. It then generates a random sentence based on that vocabulary. The script then runs this through the predictor.py script to predict the next word. It then compares the predicted word to the next word in the random sentence. It calculates the accuracy of the model by how many words it got right. It also calculates how much time the model saved by the number of words the model predicted correctly. The model is an LSTM model. It has one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer has the dimensionality of a number of characters in a word. The hidden layers each have 128 neurons.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed its investigation after it found no evidence of a defect in the vehicle. Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with a lorry while operating in Autopilot mode. Tesla has stated Autopilot is only designed to assist drivers, who must keep their hands on the wheel. The feature is intended to be used on the motorway, where it lets cars automatically change lanes and react to traffic. The NHTSA report said data from the car showed that ""the driver took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision."" Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said the driver should have been able to see the lorry for seven seconds, which ""should have been enough time to take some action."" The investigation did not find any evidence that the car's systems ""did not perform as designed."" However, Mr Thomas said there was ""industry-wide"" concern about the way driver-assistance features were explained and advertised to customers. ""These systems require continual and full attention of the driver,"" he said. ""It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. ""Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual."" He said systems should be designed with the ""inattentive driver"" in mind. The NHTSA said it would continue to monitor the safety of Autopilot and would take further action if necessary. Mr Thomas warned manufacturers that if safety defects were found in semi-autonomous cars, they would have to be recalled, even if the vehicles were capable of receiving over-the-air software updates. Following the closure of the investigation, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the report was ""very positive.""",human,1.4621212121212122,1.6666666666666667,1.6307692307692307,1.59375,2.1052631578947367,0.046836145049066344,0.158749872252032,0.3952563328404614,0.8607110114393817,-0.17233560090702932,-0.22271648769807167,0.06907765629380452,-0.1624692592538941,0.004320987654321202,-0.19512807320760786,-0.43333333333333335,0.16052374965174263,-0.48275862068965514,-0.29881587295389905,0.0,0.0,-0.028571428571428848,-0.26540927955144455,-0.2730379430582561,-0.003618824537018174,0.4265791632485644,-0.12857498236428316,-0.8411764705882355,-0.5738080306222657,0.8612121212121214,1.1973302256400407,-0.2666666666666666,-0.0035319917435440887,0.40625,0.34447415010026694,-0.4167671334508022,-0.26575495478345157,0.6624999999999999,1.6520480278182166,-0.15384615384615388,-0.3366520764415541,0.9414264036418817,0.6532141833301461,0.6264550264550266,0.3164953581020721,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.24944382578492946,0.9818181818181818,1.1818181818181819,0.23639628028634696,0.526620080248056,0.14642502223928905,-0.2212848446731858,0.06441188448474312,0.07053155217172925

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This thread discusses projects that were developed but never became profitable. While we hear a lot about successful ventures, there is still a lot to learn from completed, yet unsuccessful, projects. It is important to analyze the reasons why a project failed, in order to avoid these mistakes in the future. Some reasons why a project may fail include: 1. Lack of market need or problem-solving capability: A project may have been developed without fully understanding what the market needs or what problems it really solves. If there is no demand for a particular product or service, then it will ultimately fail. 2. Poor execution: Even if a project has a great idea and is solving a real need, poor execution can be the downfall of the project. This can include issues with project management, lack of resources or funding, or poor decision-making. 3. Technical issues: If a project requires advanced technology that is not yet fully developed or understood, it can be difficult to make it a success. Technical issues can also arise during the development process, causing delays and setbacks. 4. Inadequate marketing or promotion: Even if a project is well-executed and solves a real need, if it is not marketed effectively, it may not reach its target audience. This can lead to poor sales and ultimately, project failure. 5. Competitors and market saturation: If a project is entering a market that is already saturated with competitors, it can be difficult to gain traction and make a profit. Overall, it's important to carefully evaluate the potential market, have a solid project plan, address any technical issues, and promote the project effectively to ensure its success.",gpt-3.5-trubo,1.3257575757575757,1.5,1.4153846153846155,1.40625,1.6842105263157894,0.1297692499189998,0.6861808502218195,0.47885929053738985,0.6056024039302569,-0.15743440233236164,0.46075568026707975,0.0,0.4492189703242193,-0.03395061728395026,0.45754314633140697,0.0714285714285714,0.3083158414638874,0.9458128078817735,0.559951736715409,0.0,0.0,0.1734693877551018,0.40773140766019067,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.19688269073010653,0.6037692633979787,-1.2016806722689077,-0.5753158923571937,0.5545454545454546,0.8143994237259761,1.0857142857142856,0.44096873574882733,0.29017857142857145,0.9179268527427288,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.13392857142857142,1.008554071284783,0.3076923076923076,0.1612888237416341,0.4856564780692247,0.19844341663111784,0.38095238095238115,0.26433399248392153,0.0,0.0,0.7142857142857143,0.9583148474999097,0.509090909090909,1.3636363636363635,0.5696762520079431,0.3033235390542554,0.6761030917398688,-0.29997647256202725,0.12566268392593902,0.2786209826494813

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The suppliers, one making seats and the other parts used in gearboxes, have stopped delivering to VW in a contract row. Car and parts production has already been halted at VW's sites in Germany amid fears that it will not be able to meet its deadline of keeping up with BMW over who is number two globally behind Mercedes-Benz in terms of sales. The German automaker said this week there have been ""no deliveries on any products"" for the next three months as it attempts to resolve the dispute with supplier Visteon Corp.'s seat division. While neither company gave specific reasons, analysts say both sides are concerned about competing against each other when they know their own factories were largely unaffected by last month's earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan. Toyota Motor (TM) also experienced major problems exporting cars out from Japan during March. Yet some carmakers believe that issues may take longer than expected to work through because negotiations don't always occur between companies based on similar industries or geographical proximity but rather involve individual executives and lawyers often working separately. As such, disputes can drag on even after an agreement is reached if either side feels like changing the deal later. That could slow down what many consider the start of new business activity. However, according to industry experts, the auto market remains strong enough to allow automakers to wait until the summertime before finalizing contracts again. Until then however, fears remain high among automakers. While car makers sit back waiting for news on whether new orders come soon, recalls add further uncertainty into an already difficult year. This past January alone saw four separate recalls affecting 2 million vehicles including Audi, GMAC Financial Services and Daimler Benz AG), all stemming from faulty airbags. According to Consumer Reports, 16 percent of current models sold since 2000 do not include driver lap belts despite evidence showing that 93 percent of post crash deaths of drivers involved in accidents occurred while wearing them. Those statistics make an argument for inclusion of the safety feature in most domestic cars. A survey released earlier this April corroborated those findings by highlighting that 66 of adults living within 10 miles of an automobile manufacturer site reported having had a vehicle recalled due to defective front end pieces as opposed to 58 for rear ends. Overall, nearly half - 46 - of respondents surveyed indicated that they would purchase another model regardless of recall history given the fact that they knew the product was safe. Meanwhile, dealerships across America remain flooded with unsold inventory that continues to pile up adding more pressure onto consumers wanting to replace aging family sedans. In response, Ford (F) announced plans to freeze prices of top-selling vehicles - including the Focus, Taurus and Explorer - through 2011 to better clear excess stock and boost demand in those markets where sales lag due to lack of fresh competition. Furthermore, General Motors is planning to offer additional incentives to fleet customers to encourage them to buy the Chevy Cruze compact sedan which goes wide available nationwide starting midyear. Industry leaders expect U.S. auto sales to reach roughly 14.5 million units this year. It represents a 1 increase compared to 2008 although that figure includes the impact of lower gas prices, favorable weather conditions and a record 88 days without motor strikes. But analysts predict overall strength levels off and predicts total sales will only rise 0.2 in 2010 to 15.3 million. Although European exports seem relatively unscathed so far following the Japanese quake, regional tensions in Iran continue to cause concern with the Iranian government threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz unless international oil traders stop sending supplies via the Persian Gulf. Such threats provoked concerns Friday from President Barack Obama saying he wants to see greater diplomatic efforts toward resolving the crisis. ""The United States is prepared to use diplomacy, but we cannot accept blackmail, nor should anyone else,"" he told reporters at a Labor Day campaign appearance here. He added: ""We need to find ways to bring stability to the Middle East... I think now is exactly the time when people around the world, certainly in Europe, want us to engage diplomatically."" Some observers view potential supply disruptions in China and India, which together account for 18 of global manufacturing capacity, as potentially brewing trouble in the near future. Combined production volumes there exceed 5 billion passenger vehicles per year compared to 1.4 billion just five years ago. With 60 trillion dollars sitting idle worldwide, ""there's going to be a lot of pent-up demand somewhere along the line,"" says Tom Libby,a partner with consulting firm Bernstein Research Co., Inc. ""I still worry about what comes out first - trade wars, currency issues, accident rates, pollution levels, anything you can imagine might happen at some point."" Perhaps nowhere is starker example of the interconnectedness of the automotive ecosystem today than at Honda North America, where CEO Takeo Fukui recently vowed his company wouldn't raise its output level beyond 37 million vehicles annually despite surging cash reserves and rising demand. To achieve that goal, the company must persuade foreign manufacturers to invest billions of dollars in assembling cars in the US for export abroad.

He then sold off its 7,000 reinforced concrete slabs, which he and his accomplices had replaced with a cheap, temporary cover. The new cover did not withstand the pressure of passing cars, and a gaping hole opened up in the road. ""The replacement of the concrete slabs with a temporary surface was a deliberate, criminal act that could have caused an accident, the death of innocent people, and other grave consequences,"" Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said in a statement. Markin said Protopopov and his accomplices also siphoned off funds earmarked for other work on the road, which links the Komi region to the neighboring Arkhangelsk region. Protopopov, who oversaw a prison service in Komi that has a staff of 15,000, was detained Wednesday. He and his accomplices face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of fraud, officials said. Prosecutors have also launched a separate probe into the suspected embezzlement of 68 million rubles (2.2 million) allocated for the road's construction, Markin said.

Many fear that the Chinese government may clamp down on GitHub or even ban it, as it has done with other foreign tech companies. This could have a significant impact on China's tech industry, as GitHub has been a vital platform for developers to collaborate, share code, and learn from each other. However, the Chinese government has not yet made any official statements about GitHub's future in the country. Some experts believe that the government may be more tolerant of GitHub because it is primarily used by developers, rather than the general public. Additionally, many Chinese tech companies and developers have already established a strong presence on the platform and may push back against any efforts to ban or restrict it. Overall, the situation remains uncertain, and it is essential for developers in China to stay informed and consider alternative platforms or methods to collaborate and share code if necessary.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"While plants might look like peaceful, passive victims of the world, they actually spend a lot of energy fighting to stay alive. When an insect bites a leaf, the leaf releases chemicals to summon insect-eating insects. When an animal chews on a stem, the stem releases hormones that cause the plant to generate defensive compounds. And, according to research published this week in Science, plants can even recognize the vibrations of a specific insect - and respond with chemical defenses. The discovery is the latest in a series of experiments that reveal plants can sense the world in surprisingly complex ways. When scientists first started studying plant senses in the 1970s, they didn't think plants could sense anything at all. Then, researchers began finding evidence of light sensitivity, and they realized that plants use light to guide their growth. Then, they found plants can sense touch, and use it to figure out which way is up and which way is down. After that, they found that plants can sense gravity, and use it to determine up and down, too. After that, researchers discovered that plants can sense moisture and dryness. They found they could even sense animals approaching. And, in recent years, researchers have found that plants can sense and respond to sounds. All of these discoveries have been surprising, but perhaps none so surprising as the one made by Heidi Appel, a chemical ecologist at the University of Missouri, and Rex Cocroft, an entomologist also at the University of Missouri. The pair studies how plants respond to insect attacks, and in the course of that research, they found that plants can even sense vibrations - specifically, the vibrations caused when a caterpillar is chewing on it. The experiment that led to the discovery started with a European species of plant called Arabidopsis. ""It's like the fruit fly of the plant world,"" says Appel. ""Everybody works on it."" Appel and Cocroft planted Arabidopsis in pots and then broadcast the feeding vibrations of caterpillars through the soil of some of the pots and not others. When they later exposed the plants to caterpillars, they found that the plants that had been exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils - a chemical that is toxic to many insects - than the plants that hadn't been exposed to feeding vibrations. Next, they took a closer look at how the plants were responding to the vibrations. They covered some of the plants' leaves in little speakers and others in little earplugs. The plants with earplugs didn't change their mustard oil production at all when they were attacked by caterpillars. The plants with speakers, on the other hand, produced much more mustard oil when they were attacked. These results suggest that the plants were indeed sensing the vibrations of caterpillars chewing on them and producing more mustard oils in response. It's not yet clear exactly how the plants are sensing the vibrations, but Appel and Cocroft believe tiny particles called nanovibrations, which exist throughout the plant's structure, are responsible. Appel and Cocroft don't yet know why plants evolved this ability, but they think that it might help the plants save their chemical defenses for when they're most needed. If a plant produces chemical defenses indiscriminately, it uses up a lot of energy that it could otherwise spend on growing. If the plant waits until it's actually being attacked to start producing those chemicals, it doesn't waste as much energy. ""It's an efficient, smart way to use those chemicals,"" says Appel. This study adds to our growing understanding that plants are not passive green things, but dynamic and complex organisms that interact with their environment in interesting ways. Plants can sense and respond to the world around them, and that means they're more like animals than we ever knew.",llama_65B,4.015151515151516,4.333333333333333,4.415384615384616,4.46875,4.2105263157894735,0.1034065594555018,0.13671610588942062,-0.17786734996207026,0.10411686087705674,-0.0649550142637699,0.3129525770425877,0.20890420250142439,0.5521947404303648,0.2139585822381523,0.500639225093043,-0.37096774193548376,0.3424393090105493,0.7107897664071191,0.589802359523962,0.0,0.0,0.12903225806451601,0.21706165982555148,-0.645358218729994,-0.05303637897748932,0.3080261451745215,0.24587590519043911,-0.23434535104364343,0.1903388818486159,0.14164222873900315,0.576150796246401,0.4774193548387098,1.4404901043086273,0.2469758064516129,0.8134813287097697,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.06653225806451606,0.42684854012685974,0.531017369727047,0.29281366350756793,0.7929577234976422,0.47965989156169375,0.16385048643113168,0.10493771535536162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2363636363636363,2.6363636363636362,0.7094584413106535,0.8582302389158685,0.5383541704053757,0.2304706547427401,-0.19039365594547392,0.06764832078367089

It offers step-by-step navigation overlayed on a map (like you would get in Google Maps). Navigate on Autopilot will also give drivers the option to exit the freeway when they approach their destination, which will happen when the Autopilot feature is active. This feature is different from the earlier announced Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) which the company introduced in October 2018, according to Musk. While NOA can steer the car, it still required the driver to change the lanes on their own to get off the freeway. With the new feature, the car will suggest lane changes, navigate the car off the freeway and bring it to a stop to avoid missing the exit. The latest feature can be used on roads with no lane markings or on local roads that are not on Tesla's navigation maps. The updated Navigate on Autopilot feature has been added to Tesla's most recent software update.",llama_65B,0.5454545454545454,0.5,0.6461538461538462,0.640625,0.42105263157894735,-0.6056170211493258,-0.52101847696861,-0.16027891924094445,-0.24863778930525532,0.09523809523809512,-0.48905357904383584,0.32380151387720774,-0.21416324660245628,0.28086419753086433,-0.37491095581473527,-0.5,-0.6499640540098776,-0.04525862068965513,-0.27638433431566006,0.0,0.0,-0.017857142857142985,-0.0027659666358832826,-0.021442770397245223,-0.14520634618067882,0.2830188679245282,-0.09338904323890186,0.19117647058823534,-0.39315390538393746,0.6045454545454547,0.0,-0.7,-0.21270186339812386,0.7421875000000001,1.0075962193901442,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,0.37499999999999994,0.743569368419995,0.42307692307692296,0.0900510834860528,0.26150733434496715,0.3367876570272817,0.06349206349206366,0.17200616270346147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0909090909090908,0.6623984825054262,-0.1532450067135244,1.313253076831564,0.1481790983859771,-0.053764245189027345,0.03133929009436764

In a screening prior to signing for the club, Hamed had been diagnosed with a heart condition that should have precluded him from playing professional football. However, the club allowed him to continue playing and did not provide adequate medical care, which ultimately led to his collapse. The judge found that Spurs were negligent in their duty of care to the player and awarded damages to his family.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The US-owned retail firm, which processes hundreds of thousands of online orders each week, could have put millions of transactions at risk, security expert Paul Moore estimates. He first noticed the firm was vulnerable on 11 September. The company has since blocked access to the information from the internet. However, Mr Moore said he was unsure whether or not the data had been stolen. Asda has apologised for the breach. The data contained in the logs included: customer names and addresses payment card type, number and expiry date CVV (card verification value) number - the three-digit code on the back of cards customer order details - including product names Mr Moore, an information security consultant from Leicester, said he was searching for data that had been left accidentally exposed on the internet when he found Asda's cache. ""It's hard to know if someone has had access to this data before I found it,"" he told the BBC. ""The logs were being uploaded every day. They were already 10 days old when I discovered them."" Mr Moore said he had found the data using a freely available search tool. ""I just typed in the terms I was searching for and the data appeared in the results. Anyone in the world could have found this information."" The leak was particularly serious as it would have been easy to steal the information in bulk, Mr Moore said. ""It was just a case of sending a link to a file and then it could be downloaded. There was nothing to stop someone downloading the entire database."" He said the database was an ""absolute goldmine"" for cyber-criminals. ""This type of data would be worth a lot of money on the underground market. ""You could use the information to clone payment cards, buy goods online, create a profile of someone to steal their identity or even blackmail someone."" Asda has said it does not believe the data was ""accessed or compromised"" but has not said how it came to be accessible. ""We take our responsibility to protect customer data extremely seriously and have a number of technical and physical controls in place to prevent unauthorised access to customer information,"" a spokesman said. ""We are very sorry for any concern this may have caused."" He added that the supermarket had reported the breach to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The ICO said it was investigating. Asda has now secured the data and closed the breach. The Asda leak was discovered just weeks after the personal details of 130,000 Virgin Media customers were exposed online. It is the latest in a series of security breaches involving large firms. In June, the ICO fined the Carphone Warehouse 400,000 after hackers stole the personal details of more than three million customers and 1,000 staff. A month earlier, the UK's data protection watchdog fined NHS Surrey 200,000 for losing the personal information of more than 3,000 patients. In April, the ICO levied a 400,000 fine on TalkTalk after a cyber-attack which exposed the personal data of 157,000 customers. The company's chief executive Dido Harding was subsequently questioned by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee about the breach. Earlier this year, Experian, a credit check company, was fined 160,000 for sending direct marketing emails to millions of people who had explicitly opted out of such messages. The ICO has the power to impose a maximum fine of 500,000 for serious breaches of the Data Protection Act. After this cap was introduced in April, the watchdog said it would consider implementing further measures, such as issuing penalties based on a company's global turnover.

He was one of the most respected characters in English football - but his reign ended amid claims he raped two young women on a night out in 2004 When Matt Le Tissier walked into the changing rooms for Arsenal's final game that season, it still felt like his dreams were about to come true. There had been so much build-up: his sensational goal against Manchester United; an enthralling semi-final rematch with Liverpool; then Wembley as they beat Newcastle 4-1, thanks to penalties from Bergkamp and Henry. The atmosphere inside the stadium was incredible too, with thousands spilling onto White Hart Lane after the sending off of Alan Smith. As the players left the field for extra time, everyone seemed happy, even if there was no guarantee of silverware. ""It really did feel like my last day,"" says Le Tissier now. ""I felt like I'd done enough."" His first career title would be denied by Manchester United in the following year's Champions League Final. But this summer will see him add another historic trophy to his collection when Southampton take on Chelsea in the 2013 Europa League Final. And yet all around him is gossiping about something else entirely: whispers about alleged rape. At 36 years old, in 2004, a woman who became known only as Sarah claims she was assaulted outside a nightclub in London by Adam Johnson, later capped 58 times by Jamaica. It formed part of her mind games over the years since, although not until recently has any story emerged which directly implicates Johnson himself or suggests he may have played a role in covering up what happened. On Friday the Evening Standard published details of how Johnson allegedly met the player at Soho House, a bar frequented by celebrities in north-west London, where he began talking to him while surrounded by a group of men. Soon afterwards he returned to his table crying and told people ""he couldn't go through with it,"" according to court documents seen by the paper. When police got involved, various sources claim Johnson changed tack, claiming he had requested sex instead of being forced to perform fellatio. One witness stated that Johnson said he wanted oral sex before going back home alone despite having asked several friends along because he didn't want them witnessing anything untoward. Johnson denies raping anyone. In 2006 he pleaded guilty to indecent exposure for kissing and touching a 14-year-old girl who was waiting for her school bus after the pair went drinking together, and received three months' community service. The allegations are quite different. According to former criminal barrister Julian Knowles, authorising judge Mr Justice Barry O'Donoghue accepted evidence presented by detectives investigating the case in which he found: ""There is clear and strong evidence of force, threats and intimidation of sexual nature including false imprisonment."" This included Johnson forcing oral sex upon the 20-year-old student. No charges were brought relating to the student, however. Only afterwards was the allegation made that Johnson had sexually attacked someone else. Had he been charged, the offence could've carried a sentence of up to 10 years, though in the end Johnson served just 6 weeks of his 18 month jail term. Southwark Crown Court heard Sarah reported the incident to police nine days after meeting Johnson in August 2004 during a night out with three other students. She believed she had been drugged prior to the assault, but by whom remains unclear. A statement given to officers described her actions immediately prior to entering the bathroom stall where the attack supposedly took place: ""She closed her eyes, curled herself into the foetal position on top of the toilet floor ... Her body shook violently as she cried silently."" After hearing no response, she stood up and looked behind her in the mirror, realising ""what was happening"" and ran away naked down Regent Street past more than 15 onlookers. Two teenagers followed her screaming abuse, prompting Johnson to say to others nearby: This happens every weekend!"" He then added: ""You won't get shut of me mate you don't know who you messing with."" A friend offered her 10 to leave. Eventually she reached home and called 999, making it the second time she had phoned emergency services in less than 12 hours. An ambulance crew arrived minutes after she talked to the operator, and found her covered in blood wearing nothing except a vest bearing a message telling men to 'fk off'. Sarah alleges she underwent tests for HIV and gonorrhoea within six hours - results came back negative, suggesting she was not infected. Four witnesses also claimed they witnessed Johnson standing close to her, offering support, before they both left together. Police arrested Johnson shortly after arriving at Cazenove Road Tube station, Westminster - he was carrying a box containing a shirt he appeared to be trying to wash. However, all DNA samples collected turned out to belong to either Johnson or one of those present during the evening. Three weeks after the alleged attack, Sarah filed a complaint at Bowlerian Jonesiusitself.

Plans for Green Park Station were put forward in 2004, but the project has stalled as of 2020 due to a lack of funding. The proposed station would have provided better access to both Oxford city centre and the business park, as well as improving traffic flow. The local authority is now exploring alternative ways to improve the area's transport links, such as private investment and public-private partnerships. These are being considered in order to reduce the congestion and delays caused by the current infrastructure. In addition, the council has been looking at ways to encourage more cycling and walking in the area, through initiatives such as bike hire schemes and building dedicated cycle lanes. Finally, the council is also looking into ways to make public transport more efficient, such as running buses on demand or providing more frequent services between Green Park and the city centre. This would help to reduce the need for cars and therefore alleviate some of the traffic issues.",text-davinci-003,0.6515151515151515,0.5,0.6461538461538462,0.6875,0.3157894736842105,0.13154769938943264,0.0029922854058030473,0.1191012706341107,0.08023634442055935,0.33333333333333315,-0.3042948755956161,0.32380151387720774,-0.5369371313492958,0.37808641975308654,-0.5494401999337267,0.75,1.4384191251143033,0.8922413793103448,0.577467100966226,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,0.08582143967837982,-0.49318371913664055,-0.3417838780937697,0.19688269073010653,0.19183363278509027,0.573529411764706,0.5579787421260134,0.2545454545454547,-0.5325859153064354,1.05,0.31587116651432984,0.27343750000000006,-1.0955027678267717,-0.1971853844013725,0.1712306741302034,0.18749999999999997,0.4277606437664822,-0.5,-0.07033267417893056,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.04761904761904745,-0.19105086829667856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.7272727272727273,0.22258624045771033,0.1382026245575017,0.3205169928101539,-0.19360086986754707,0.29927827651368527,0.1173518789335388

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A team of researchers has found a new mineral about 900 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Davemaoite is made of calcium, silicon, and oxygen. Its existence has been long hypothesized, but it was not until now that scientists have been able to confirm its existence through laboratory experiments. Davemaoite is named after Dave Mao, a pioneering high-pressure scientist who passed away in 2020. The mineral is believed to have formed from the high-pressure breakdown of the mineral perovskite, which is abundant in the Earth's mantle. The discovery of davemaoite is significant because it sheds light on the properties and behavior of materials deep within the Earth.

Uber has agreed to sell its food delivery business in India to Zomato. The deal will see Uber receive a 9.99 stake in Zomato in return for giving up its Uber Eats operations in India. The move comes after Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is focusing on the markets where it has a leading position. Uber has announced it is acquiring the computer vision startup Mighty AI to add to its driverless vehicle unit. The deal is worth 171 million.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Clocking into work every day can result in a vague sense of dissatisfaction when the work doesn't seem meaningful. This article discusses four different ways to ignite motivation for work. How can you keep your team motivated and productive? Do you feel your work has meaning and purpose? Are you satisfied with your work? Is your job just a job or is it something you love to do? These questions are important to explore. It is difficult to enjoy life if you are not happy with your career. It is very common for many people to be dissatisfied with their job. According to a Gallup survey, 70 percent of people are disengaged at work. The Society for Human Resource Management reported that employee engagement in 2017 was at 32 percent, a significant decrease from 33 percent in 2016. A survey by the SHRM in 2015 found that 68 percent of people are moderately or very satisfied with their jobs. These statistics show that many people are not satisfied with their work. Work can be drudgery if you don't enjoy what you do. In his book, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi asserts that people have four things in common when they are in a state of flow. When you are in a state of flow, you are immersed in your work, you are enjoying it and you are focused and not easily distracted. A state of flow occurs when you are doing work that is important, meaningful and relevant. For example, when you do work that is important and relevant, you feel like you are making a difference and contributing something that is valuable. You will have a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. When you are in a state of flow, you will be highly motivated to get the job done. The main point is that you need to do work that is meaningful and relevant. It is easy to stay motivated when you do work that is significant. The challenge is to do meaningful work when the job is mundane and not exciting. It is difficult to be engaged when you are doing a job that is not stimulating. 1. Have a passion for what you do. It is difficult to be motivated to do work that is not fulfilling. It is easy to have a passion for something that you love to do. Do you feel your work is valuable and makes a difference? If you are not passionate about your work, it is important to find a job that you enjoy. It is important to find meaning and relevance in your work. 2. Do work that is important and relevant. Are you doing work that is important and relevant? How can you contribute something of value to the world? Does your work have meaning and significance? These are important questions to explore. Many people are not satisfied with their jobs because they don't have a sense of purpose in what they do. 3. Work with passionate people. It is important to work with passionate people who are engaged and enjoy what they do. It is easy to get motivated when you work with passionate people who are enthusiastic and excited about their work. It is difficult to be motivated when you work with people who are disengaged and not interested in their work. 4. Work with purpose. Are you working for a purpose? Is your work significant? What is your mission and purpose? If you don't have a purpose, you will not be motivated to do your work. It is important to have a mission statement. This will guide you and give you purpose. Your mission will motivate you and inspire you. It will keep you on track and focused on your purpose. It is important to have a mission statement for your company. A mission statement is a declaration of your purpose. It is your reason for being. Your mission will define your organization and guide your actions. It will be your guide to set goals and make decisions. It will help you focus and inspire you. It is important to have a personal mission statement. Your mission statement will define you and guide your actions. It will give you purpose. You need to be passionate about your work. It is important to have a purpose and meaning for your work. You should find your calling and do work that is important and relevant. You need to be engaged and have a sense of purpose.

Researchers found that firearms and related components were hidden in patio furniture, under floorboards, at workbenches and even inside ceiling tiles. AD The FBI did not provide details on how many of these guns connected to international arms smuggling rings remain active today. In one case cited by the bureau, a gun was shipped from China to Japan via an American company before being sold into Mexico's narco-trafficking market, according to Bloomberg News. The buyer later resold it to other customers - including Venezuelans who used it against police officers during protests this year as part of opposition leader Juan Guaido's push for president Nicolas Maduro to step down.

It is seeking clarification about an incident outside a Cardiff nightclub over the weekend that has led to him being banned from tonight's Premiership game against London Irish at Adams Park He was selected in Wales' squad but now finds himself fighting his way back into contention after injuring himself playing Tier One rugby last week, and could even be forced out completely if it does come down to selection decisions based solely on form rather than reputation during the Six Nations tournament itself. And while there are plenty who believe that Newcastle have acquired one of the best young flyhalves ever produced by Northampton - former England centre Matt Dawson recently claimed as much - Ospreys remains adamant Williams will remain their man next season. The 19-year-old was included in Wales' autumn internationals following impressive performances for his club, which earned him call ups to the British Irish Lions tour to Australia this summer and the World Cup two years ago. He also led Wales Under 20s to victory in the Junior Varsity Championship final earlier this month. ""I feel like I've missed out big time,"" says Ospreys director Mick Crossan, who signed Williams when he became available via ""a couple of calls."" ""We got some fantastic results but we wanted someone who would play left wing or fullback.""

He initially denied the killing, but changed his plea on the second day of his trial at Winchester Crown Court. Bragg was overheard by friends four days before Ms Cook was killed saying ""one of these days I'm going to kill her,"" Dorset Police said.

The couple had been at Pokesdown Railway Station when they started arguing and Ms Cook walked away. After punching her, Bragg initially walked away but returned to help Ms Cook, who was unconscious on the concrete platform, and took her back to her flat. The couple had been together for about four years before the incident and their relationship was described as ""volatile."" Det Insp Neil Phillips said: ""There was no justification for such violence. Bragg and Julie clearly had a volatile relationship and efforts had been made to prevent further abuse.

A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling large amounts of data and the possibility it has to understand text on different levels (i.e., sentence level, wordphrase level) The key idea behind Deep Learning is that the input vector can be seen as an array of numbers where each number represents one feature which defines the object you're trying to identify from your training set (images or videos). The output value will either correspond with all features present in the input vectors or none but not any other combination (0 means there's no match found between input and target).

He said: ""It was never a functioning body. It has been entirely unable to agree on any kind of decisions over Syria. ""That's why I think our policy on Syria has been so incoherent and inconsistent over the last five years."" Mr Fallon added: ""We have been paralysed by disagreement within that council, with one part of it wanting to intervene, another not wanting to intervene, and the government not able to reconcile those two points of view."" The defence secretary said he believed there was now an ""emerging consensus"" in favour of military action against Islamic State (IS).

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra PS84m annually. Economist Gillian Paull told BBC Wales the ""upper limit"" could reach PS200m if ""nearly all"" parents took up the offer. The Welsh Government said it was currently analysing the likely costs. The promise to provide 30 hours free childcare a week was one of Labour's key election pledges and is now part of its five-year programme for government. The childcare will be made available to working parents of three- and four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year. In a report for the Welsh Government in February, Ms Paull, of Frontier Economics, produced various cost estimates for the policy. It said the cost would be PS84m a year if the childcare was offered to working parents and if 87 of them took up the offer at a cost of PS5 per hour. However, Ms Paull warned that she thought the policy was unlikely to encourage many non-working parents to take up jobs. The Welsh Government insists the policy will remove one of the ""major barriers to employment."" Ms Paull said if the policy proved to be successful in enabling large numbers of parents take up jobs, its annual cost would increase considerably. ""The cost estimate [in the report] is based on a very small response in working behaviour,"" she told the Sunday Politics Wales programme. ""If there is a bigger response, the cost could be considerably higher. ""A reasonable upper limit would be around PS200m, based on an extreme response of nearly all parents becoming eligible by working."" David Dallimore, a social policy researcher at Bangor University, warned that money would also have to be spent expanding the availability of childcare in Wales, which he claimed was already ""patchy."" ""It's very dependent on where you live,"" he said. ""Wales has a measurably lower rate of childcare than other nations in the UK. ""In Wales it's about 30 childcare places for every 100 children - it's about 40 in England and it's nearly 50 in Scotland."" He added: ""I think there's a lot of concern within the sector that there isn't enough provision to be able to deliver this [policy] in the current form we have."" Indicating the end of the Communities First anti-poverty programme on Tuesday, Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant cited the childcare policy as a way of helping parents find work. ""Across government we are ensuring prosperity for all,"" he said. ""The creation of a generous childcare offer for working parents will help to remove one of the major barriers to employment."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We know there are issues with capacity and cost in some parts of Wales and we are working with the childcare sector to address this. ""We are also currently undertaking complex modelling of costs. ""We have a cost range, and the purpose of our modelling and analysis is to look at key factors such as the number of eligible children, take-up rates, number of hours utilised and hourly cost, all of which impact on the overall cost estimates.""

It's important for students to communicate with the university and Balfour Beatty to stay informed about the availability of the rooms and any updates on the construction timeline.",gpt-3.5-trubo,-0.015151515151515152,-0.16666666666666666,0.07692307692307693,0.109375,-0.3157894736842105,0.31183120916321416,0.8790034310668233,0.3660743646548117,0.6051034863297432,0.5034013605442175,-0.5254952330963567,0.8418839360807401,-0.4779233816389381,0.9290123456790124,-0.5065679769620577,-0.25,-0.7370427257004802,-0.607758620689655,-0.36652782880712237,0.0,0.0,0.5714285714285713,-0.5484118269291972,-0.2573132447669429,-0.5090446552209719,0.19688269073010653,0.556946841179157,0.19117647058823534,-0.03796539529010771,1.304545454545455,0.0,1.3,-0.21270186339812386,2.2656250000000004,0.7300586347829919,0.4016739311879811,0.34912286907698237,0.5624999999999999,0.5487693390987182,-0.38461538461538464,-0.5732453476658121,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,-0.8253968253968252,-0.7313313237200483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.38181818181818183,0.2727272727272727,0.9517693129239823,-0.6261371154262657,1.1428220108605343,-0.478822482246771,0.5795315665764709,0.5876414333194128

It was bought by a relative of King George IV, who sold it to the Royal College of Music in 1927 and is now part of its Wurlitzer Collection. Wurlitzers were also built at the request of Queen Victoria's daughters Princess Alice (later Duchess of Sutherland) and Princess Helena; one of these survives today as part of the collection of EMI Records (now Sony). In addition, many concert grand pianos have been made especially for use by royal musicians including former British monarchs Prince Albert and his son Edward VII. A number are still played regularly by royalty around the world. One notable example is that owned by current Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he used regularly during both his time as an intelligence officer and subsequently when Prime Minister of Russia between .

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was accompanied by a demand for access for humanitarian aid. The situation in Madaya, a town near the border with Lebanon besieged by the government, received attention in the media. However, areas besieged by rebel groups have also been affected by the lack of access to food, medicine and other necessities. Agreement on humanitarian access was hailed as a success, but in reality has been slow to materialise. The Syrian government has refused access to most areas under its control, and in some cases has even refused to allow the UN and the ICRC to distribute aid inside the country. The withdrawal of some rebel groups and their weapons from the city of Aleppo was also supposed to be part of the deal. While some groups have made good their escape, others, notably Jabhat al-Nusra, have remained. Many rebels and civilians also chose to stay. The most contentious issue, however, was what would happen to areas where Islamic State and the Nusra Front were present. While the ceasefire included both groups, Russia and the US were unable to agree on how to deal with them. The original Russian and American proposal was that fighting would continue against IS and the Nusra Front, with the US providing intelligence and Russia conducting the bombing. This plan was rejected by other members of the International Syria Support Group, which also includes Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who said that it would undermine the ceasefire. The group finally agreed to set up a Joint Implementation Group, based in Geneva and made up of members of the International Syria Support Group's ceasefire taskforce, to decide whether or not strikes against IS or the Nusra Front were appropriate in any given situation. The creation of the Joint Implementation Group was a victory for the US and its allies, who had feared that Russia would use the opportunity to bomb the moderate opposition while pretending to be attacking IS or the Nusra Front. The creation of the Joint Implementation Group would make that more difficult. However, the Joint Implementation Group has never met, and there is no sign that it will do so any time soon. The US appears to have backed down on its demand for it to approve strikes, and now seems willing to let Russia conduct bombing raids without this oversight. The Americans have been trying to encourage the Russians to accept the Geneva process, which would mean a transition away from Assad. In return, it seems, they have agreed to Russia's demand that the US separate the ""moderate"" rebels from the ""terrorists"" - i.e. from Jabhat al-Nusra, which is closely allied with many of the Free Syrian Army groups. This would mean the moderates becoming dependent on the US, rather than their current patrons, which include Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The Syrian rebels are understandably suspicious of American intentions. Many of the armed groups, which are all Islamist in one way or another, do not trust the US, and believe that it has betrayed the Syrian revolution in the past. The Geneva negotiations, which started on 1 February, are part of a long-running attempt to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The first Geneva conference, in June 2012, produced a document known as the Geneva Communique. This document was agreed by all the major powers, including Russia and the US, and set out a plan for a political transition in Syria. It called for the establishment of a transitional governing body with ""full executive powers"" which could include members of the Assad regime and the opposition. The Geneva negotiations, which started on 1 February, are part of a long-running attempt to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The document was vague about the future of Assad. It said that the transitional body ""could include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent,"" but it also said that the ""establishment of a transitional government"" was ""an indispensable step in the beginning of a political process leading to free and fair elections."" Many have interpreted this to mean that Assad would have to leave power, but the Syrian government and Russia have always denied this, insisting that Assad could stand in the elections mentioned at the end of the process.

It uses pre-recorded driver videos of facial movements and applies them to the current photo in a way similar to face tracking on video cameras but without those problematic artifacts at edges, which can result when multiple faces are tracked over time with different head movement patterns. Image Credit: My HeritageSeamus Bellamy The new feature was made possible through deep learning technology trained specifically for this purpose using millions of historic family photographs taken by professional photographers all around Europe. The results have been mixed - some people look like they're straight outta Central Casting while others may give you nightmares - as seen below. But it's fun either way! You'll also be able to share your results via social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter directly within Genome Browser (more on other features later). Here's what we did... How We Did It To create our version of Deep Nostalgia featuring John Lennon, I uploaded two images into Genome Browser: one where he looks happy, grinning ear to ear; another where his expression seems more neutral. In addition, upload my own sample image showing how close to reality the app should try its best to match me up. Finally, select ""Next"" to find myself matched alongside a real person who has volunteered their likeness to help train this technology. They've provided four examples so each user gets to choose whichever combination works best. A pop-up displays asking if I'm ready to see my final picture. Clicking ""Yes"" takes us to the next page, where there appears to be no progress until after 14 steps. So far we haven't even begun to show anything resembling animation yet. Two minutes pass before any action happens ... then nothing else shows up again during 15 hours spent creating just five seconds worth of footage about 20 years ago, perhaps because John Lennon died almost 40 years ago. Then suddenly everyone moves along smoothly to step 16, and boom, instant movie magic. After clicking ""Done,"" here's mine compared against the celebrity above. At least we don't both look like serial killers? Eventually though, yours will probably end up looking better than ours does too based solely on training data used in making predictions. If not given enough samples of real human expressions to work with, it won't be 100 accurate every single time. Step 1 lets users take control... Here's hoping none of these anomalies happen once it finally matches someone to themselves correctly. That being said, most of the clips created thus far were pretty spot on.

His latest outburst was met with a range of responses, including the hashtag crylikeboehner, which was trending on Twitter on Wednesday. The CBC, Canada's public broadcaster, said ""the whole world was watching"" as Mr Boehner's tears began to flow during the anthem, which has been performed by various artists over the years, including Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston. Video caption: The Florida senator says his colleagues will be able to make a difference in people's lives.The Florida senator says his colleagues will be able to make a difference in people's lives. The Hill is reporting that US Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, broke into tears while talking to reporters on Capitol Hill. The Florida senator said it had been ""a difficult few days"" for the Republican party. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin was quick to defend John Boehner, who is expected to resign as speaker of the House next month. The Maryland senator told CNN the Speaker was ""a good man"" who had been put in a ""very difficult"" position by the ""ultra-conservative"" wing of the Republican party. Mr Cardin went on to say that Congress would not be able to function effectively without bipartisan cooperation, and that a Republican-controlled Congress was ""not going to be able to get anything done."" ""We've got to come together to do the people's business,"" he said. Bloomberg Politics is reporting that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the second most powerful member of the House, is ""the front-runner"" to replace John Boehner as Speaker of the House. The California Republican has said he will run for the leadership position, and the Bloomberg report says he has the support of a majority of the Republican caucus. Mr McCarthy, 50, was first elected to Congress in 2006, and was elected House Majority Leader by his fellow Republicans in 2014. The New York Times is reporting that Republican congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana is also considering a run for the speaker's job. Mr Scalise is the House majority whip, making him the third-ranking member of the House. Like Mr McCarthy, Mr Scalise has not yet said whether he will run for the speaker's job, but the Times says he is ""seriously contemplating"" a bid. Mr Scalise, 49, was first elected to Congress in 2008. Republican representative Peter King of New York says he is ""sick and tired"" of the intraparty fighting that led to John Boehner's resignation. The congressman told MSNBC that Mr Boehner was ""a man of his word"" who had accomplished a lot during his time as speaker. Mr King also said he had no doubt that the speaker's decision to resign was a matter of ""principle."" ""He feels it's time for the party to move in a different direction,"" he said. Mr King did say he was concerned about the future of the Republican party, saying that he had never seen anything like the ""civil war"" that was being waged between the moderate and conservative wings of the party. ""This is a dangerous situation for the country,"" he said. News of John Boehner's resignation is still dominating the news cycle in the US, with all of the major networks covering the story in the first few minutes of their Friday morning newscasts. However, the New York Times has already moved on to other topics, with its main story focusing on Pope Francis' visit to Cuba. The Wall Street Journal is still covering the Boehner story, but it is also leading with the pope's trip to Cuba. The Washington Post is focusing on both the Boehner resignation and the papal visit to Cuba. The Associated Press is reporting that the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, has told his fellow Republicans that he is running for speaker of the House. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has told Republican colleagues that he is running for speaker of the House. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana is also said to be considering a run.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"The seahorse placenta is a fascinating example of convergent evolution. Male seahorses' brood pouches develop and function like human placentas. During pregnancy, the males provide embryos with everything they need. They nourish them by feeding them small particles from their food that are broken down in special digestive organs inside each pouch. Their importance to developing babies can't be overstated; if this species was without male mates, it would not have been able to reproduce for millions of years. But what about female seahorses? What do those pregnant females get out of this deal besides carrying around another animal's foetus for nine months (and no sex)? The answer comes when we look at the consequences for both sexes: When mothers give birth successfully after mating there isn't any cost - but fathers who fail produce offspring which die shortly after hatching. So why does nature create such an elaborate system where every individual benefits except one gender? Conventional wisdom suggests women only aid reproduction as a means to appease men so they don't defect or cheat on the mother. It could also help her pass valuable genes onto future generations. My colleagues and I think these ideas underestimate how important reproductive success really is to animals particularly because most people consider eggs to be less desirable than sperm due to high energy demands during development. Credit: Shutterstock Maternal investment Sometimes evolutionary theory assumes ""survival"" must drive all behavior seemingly unrelated to survival, including mate choice. In fact, female fitness depends just as much upon successful reproduction as male fitness! Some theories suggest either traits found exclusively in males may persist simply because they boost reproductive potential more effectively. Or vice versa - since some traits promoting reproductively successful individuals benefit neither group nor self directly, they disappear once natural selection has done its thing. For instance, male tail length evolved independently among diving beetles, lampreys and humans, even though none of us invest in swimming ability ourselves. Since favoring long tails increases access to sexually receptive partners better known for having longer tailed suitors themselves, super-elongated genitalia should increase overall reproductive output across population groups within the same sexual guilds competing against other groups pursuing similar strategies. Similarly, many scientists believe brightly colored plumage serves female birds well, increasing chances of fertilization using visual cues rather than relying solely on auditory detection. Whether these colorful displays actually enhance female attractiveness remains up for debate still today amongst biologists. If bright feathers were intended to attract attention then surely coloration will vary between body parts depending on context. Think peacock feathers versus turkey breasts compared to wolf fur patterns. No matter what the cause behind the design pattern underlying wild variations throughout the animal kingdom's stunningly diverse appearances, variation itself makes perfect sense given our observation that hundreds of different shapes evolved into billions of animals. And yet despite being designed differently according to vastly differing needs, bodies remain remarkably consistent too - even right down to the shape of internal cavities capable of housing young. Despite generally looking very dissimilar anatomically speaking, literally thousands of avian and mammalian egg cases require precisely the same adaptations to properly accommodate newborn chicks and fetuses ranging anywhere from 2 grams to nearly 200 kilograms. This includes specialized folds wrapping around otherwise delicate ovaries containing dozens of eggs per clutch, ensuring proper blood flow while simultaneously protecting unborn young allowing their slow growth before emerging whole.

""Substantial evidence"" has been gathered so far, according to the Swiss Office of the Attorney General. The Fifa officials are accused of accepting bribes to vote for South Africa as the host of the 2010 World Cup. The 7.8bn global sponsorship deal with Adidas will run until 2030. The German sportswear giant is one of four firms - the others being Visa, Coca-Cola and Budweiser - to have been signed up until the end of the next decade. The decision to end the deal was announced on Wednesday at a Fifa executive committee meeting in Zurich. ""During this week's meeting, the Executive Committee decided to terminate the contract with adidas six years early,"" said a Fifa statement. ""Despite a long-standing relationship, Fifa felt that this decision is in the best interest of Fifa and the future of football. ""Fifa and adidas remain committed to continuing their cooperation in various other fields."" The Fifa statement did not reveal the terms of the agreement, but reports suggest Fifa will have to pay around 127.5m in compensation. Adidas will continue to sponsor national teams, including Germany, and will remain as the official match ball supplier to Fifa competitions. Fifa added that its commercial strategy ""has shown positive results in the past months,"" with the World Cup sponsorship rights for the 2018 and 2022 competitions ""sold out"" and a ""strong"" sales process underway for the 2018 Fifa World Cup broadcasting rights. ""We are pleased to see that FIFA, after conducting a materiality analysis, has concluded to focus on its key mission and task to further develop the game of football and to further support the national associations around the world,"" said Herbert Hainer, Adidas' chief executive. ""We are looking forward to continuing our cooperation with FIFA in the years to come and wish FIFA all the best for the future.""",llama_65B,1.6742424242424243,1.5,1.5692307692307692,1.6875,2.1578947368421053,0.03537084183244152,0.3595000588068681,0.6023209741590709,0.7153680346930558,0.289601554907677,0.49117663718167837,0.18502943650126136,0.3766527922279406,0.29938271604938277,0.3121202863164001,0.0,0.6499640540098776,-0.12561576354679801,0.1545044027408709,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,0.29721459164271347,0.517689742447778,-0.15000754685740883,0.09844134536505326,0.29623117315106107,0.4369747899159666,-0.32402040635790574,0.05454545454545472,0.23037148889813655,0.37142857142857144,0.5520367686842553,0.8928571428571428,0.719753240484435,0.7011035889826579,0.7992778047519667,0.5624999999999999,2.144415804891189,-0.6813186813186812,-0.22279872375724744,-0.07471638124141916,0.16805009747560992,1.0793650793650795,0.9774718803337956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2545454545454546,1.3636363636363635,0.18222259482723288,0.6841283632798477,0.13700530280904616,-0.5940808812623308,0.5509896931981888,0.6519222379121807
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A researcher from the Swiss research institute EMPA has developed an invisible lock system that uses conductive ink on a transparent polymer film to create invisible buttons. The result is a lock system that is not only impossible to pick but also completely invisible to anyone who doesn't know where the buttons are located. The conductive ink is programmed to detect pressure in specific areas of the polymer film, which then triggers the unlocking mechanism. This technology has potential applications in home security systems, as well as bank vaults and other high-security facilities. However, further testing and development are needed to ensure the reliability and durability of the system.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.07575757575757576,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0625,-0.21052631578947367,0.7362205193365757,0.9169819803660563,1.723557796899182,1.5026837841523601,0.16326530612244886,-0.4328800589261921,0.1554247266610596,0.006138702663087904,0.07345679012345675,-0.08388576902437467,1.1,0.46338016856618264,1.1172413793103446,0.6684004716762377,0.0,0.0,0.914285714285714,0.2229479207323388,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,-0.07875307629204267,-0.2612415760985518,-0.6882352941176471,-0.9067804000208158,0.11454545454545452,0.8532051774414544,0.40000000000000013,0.7885161734510571,0.7187500000000001,0.0,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.8624999999999998,1.2713117158822835,-0.15384615384615388,0.2125790987353615,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515503,-0.5587301587301585,-0.458717677848607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.2727272727272727,0.08746958044965136,-0.17097892528932893,0.39744781570468013,-1.5129264812931293,1.1154577851351761,1.0824572375946124

Now it is so rare that there are almost no records of the shark in the last ten years, except for a single specimen that washed up in Cornwall.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"""This is where it all happens,"" says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's a pristine room, free of clutter and distractions, except for a PlayStation 4 and several years' worth of Fifa games. On the mixing desk sits a book on Frank Gehry's architecture, while the far corner is dominated by a gargantuan bean bag, apparently fashioned from the skin of a dead muppet. Outside the sliding glass doors, Tinie has a child-sized Lamborghini, which he's planning to use in an upcoming video. ""Jake Bugg has been here,"" he says. ""MNEK's been here. Sinead Harnett was here the other day. ""Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal."" The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years. The record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots. ""I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out,"" he says. ""I've been in my own world and my own head. ""My engineer Ritchie said,'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.' ""But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened. ""That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends."" You can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a ""personality."" On Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings. ""It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started,"" he says. ""People were like,'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.' ""Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level."" Tinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate. But by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead. Patrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV. Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears. Soon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche. ""I got so many clothes I keep'em in my aunt's house,"" he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out. He acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. ""Eight years sitting on topHip-hop, grime, then I went pop."" Yet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. ""I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music,"" he says. What impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels. ""Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label,"" marvels the rapper. Tinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone. Grime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it ""was almost like the uninvited genre."" He says: ""People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side. ""I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else."" He addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: ""Black boys getting white paperFrom the underground, now we're in the skyscraper."" Reconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying. ""A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three,"" he reflects. ""It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like,'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or,'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking,'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.' ""But equally, they can tell you,'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like,'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.' ""But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense. ""So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the art comes before pretty much everything else."" Tinie Tempah's album Youth is out on 14 April.

Mr Smith, who lived in Bishop Auckland with his wife Kezi and two children, was a popular presenter of the long-running police reality show that also included colleagues such as former detective superintendent Sue Douglas MBE, now retired and living near Whitby. A Facebook tribute page shared by friends said: ""Gavin passed away peacefully at home surrounded by family."" The pair met while working together for the North East region, where they both worked until 2003 when she became an inspector at Durham CID. They married four years later and Ms Douglas moved to Newcastle - an area which has been hit hard by austerity measures. But despite their dramatically different backgrounds, the newlyweds were determined never to be apart. In 2013 Mr Smith gave up work after becoming ill following complications during surgery. He was told he had terminal bowel cancer but instead received good news about his prognosis through word-of-mouth support groups. The couple spent time recovering before spending Christmas Day 2014 travelling around Spain with their daughters Lucy (nine) and Scarlett (five). He returned to frontline duties on New Year's Eve 2015. Mr Smith made all five series of Police Interceptor's first season at BBC Two.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Slovakia is launching a legal challenge to mandatory quotas that were passed in a majority vote on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister has proposed a radical budgetary revamp to raise funds to support the country's immigration policies. The Slovakian government has filed a legal challenge against the mandatory quotas at the European Court of Justice, arguing that they violated EU law. The move is likely to be seen as an attempt to undermine the European Union's refugee policy, which seeks to share the burden of hosting refugees among its member states. Slovakia argues that it should not be forced to accept refugees who are not from its own region and have little chance of being integrated into society. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has proposed a radical budget revamp which includes cutting welfare benefits and raising taxes to fund his country's immigration policies.

But after days of heavy rain, a ""tidal wave"" of flood water swept through the garden in the early hours of Saturday. It came as floods caused ""chaos"" across north Wales. Former farmer Mr Tavernor has been restoring the 10-acres of garden and buildings at Plas Cadnant since buying the then overgrown 200-acre estate in 1996. It now attracts visitors - both local and from abroad - and its fans include the Prince of Wales, who Mr Tavernor said had hoped to visit the estate. But the force of the water from the flooded River Cadnant has now washed away many precious plants, including some rare botanical species. It also demolished a wall dating back some 200 years, as well stone obelisks, platforms and seats. ""The garden sits down in the valley so a huge amount of water came down from the fields like a tidal wave, devastating everything in its path,"" said Mr Tavernor. ""I'm just devastated. This has been my life's project - my purpose in life - for the last 20 years and I live and dream it, ""It's everything. I'm so emotionally involved with the garden. We've had so much support from people since we put the pictures on our Facebook page. It's almost like a bereavement."" But he insisted he would carry on his work, despite the setback, and aimed to open as normal for visitors in February. ""I was hoping to have a legacy for the future generations,"" he added. ""I'm sure a lot of people would abandon it but I'm going to persevere."" Days of rain caused floods which led to roads being closed, trains disrupted and homes evacuated on Boxing Day.

Developing these services will give Apple more control over the customer experience and potentially generate more revenue through fees and commissions. One key example of Apple's progress in this area is the Apple Card, which launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs in 2019. This credit card is integrated into the Apple Wallet app and offers various features, including cashback rewards and no late fees. Apple is also reportedly working on a ""buy now, pay later"" service that would allow customers to split the cost of purchases into monthly payments. In addition to financial products, Apple is also working on expanding its payment capabilities through services like Apple Pay and the upcoming Apple Pay Later, which will allow customers to make purchases using virtual credit cards. Overall, it's clear that financial services are becoming an increasingly important part of Apple's business strategy, and the company is investing heavily in this area.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Joanna Michael, 25, from St Mellons, Cardiff, rang 999 twice before Cyron Williams stabbed her to death in 2009. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ruled she was failed by police and the watchdog is still investigating what went wrong with Ms Michaels' case A mother who died on Christmas Day after being knifed 14 times had begged for help just minutes earlier - but officers were not dispatched until an hour later because staff thought it was a hoax call. Bar worker Joanne Michaels, 25, dialled 999 at around 8pm complaining of chest pains shortly before losing consciousness having been attacked while walking home from work alone outside Llanrumney, south Wales. An inquest jury has now concluded that Miss Michaels could have survived if emergency services had answered their radio sooner less than half-a-mile away. They also criticised South Wales Police's handling as 'inadequate'. The force accepted all points raised during Thursday's hearing into Miss Michaels' murder three years ago. Her family said they hoped lessons would be learned so other families did not suffer like them following mistakes made over previous incidents involving women who died after calling 911. Miss Michaels worked behind the bar at the Bargoed Inn pub where she met Mr Williamz when he came there looking for his brother Leon James. She and another colleague went out back so she could buy him some cigarettes only moments before she called cops then fell unconscious. But despite four calls including one from her friend pleading: 'My girlfriend needs you', no officer arrived and she bled to death 15 minutes later near Riverside Park overlooking the River Taff opposite her former home. Three ambulance crews used a defibrillator within seconds arriving first followed soon afterwards by two more ambulances. A single paramedic attempted CPR whilst awaiting further assistance which never turned up even though radio communications indicated those resources should do so. Two extra paramedics eventually got there almost 90 minutes after receiving the initial 999 call. Convicted killer Kevin Williams, 32, can be heard saying repeatedly to operator Ysbyty Gwynedd dispatcher Sharon Roberts: 'I need some fg help.' He interrupted again adding: 'We've gotta go... we're running late anyway I'm going to get my sister [to take me],' he tells Mrs Roberts. In total he makes seven phonecalls during which time his victim lies dying and begging for help. Inquests into deaths such as that suffered by Joan Michael (pictured), whose body lay undiscovered for several hours after making urgent requests for medical attention are held every year in England and Wales under Coroner's Act powers known as Regulation 28 Pregnant woman forced to give birth on floor during domestic violence attack dies after falling ill in hospital five days later Sabrina Khan tried to kill herself eight weeks pregnant due to abuse By Bethan Pritchard For Mailonline Advertisement Sabrina Khan, 26, pictured left, tried to end her life eight weeks pregnant last August amid fears husband Choudhry Imtiaz Shahid, right, intended to harm or kill both himself and daughter Zara Bullied schoolgirl committed suicide fearing bullies would expose nude photos sent online Robyn Farrow, 17, took her own life after suffering months of horrific bullying Online trolls targeted teenager Robyn Farrow regularly after she began sharing pictures of herself naked using Snapchat. But her parents Simon and Sally claim cruel jibes about injuries sustained in gymnastics contributed towards her taking her own life aged just 17 in May 2017. An inquest this week heard how her disability led others to make fun of the level of treatment her carers gave her and claimed drinking bleach would fix everything. One bully told friends he wanted to cut off her legs leaving doctors struggling to manage severe depression brought on by her ordeal. Just six weeks prior to killing herself Robyn confessed to staff working at West Sussex College in Crawley that people were threatening to tell everyone intimate details of photographs she shared online without permission. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's hearing social media company Snapchat denied knowing anything about any complaints regarding its service despite admitting users may sometimes report content violating its guidelines. Its policies state nudity must comply with local laws. Another teacher revealed Robyn feared certain pupils might learn nude images existed on her mobile after seeing footage recorded using CCTV cameras installed across college buildings. Following interviews carried out with students many admitted posting comments online with most unaware full names appear next to messages once published. After reading other peoples posts these individuals believed her identity had already become widely public knowledge leading to cyberbullying against her character becoming increasingly worse. Now Robyns family want internet companies to change policy insisting once someone starts doing something harmful they should start monitoring activity instead of once damage occurs. Social Media Safety spokeswoman Lydia Cairns said research shows between 12 - 43 per cent of young adults experience mental health issues linked to apps like Instagram and YouTube each month.

It's only fitting therefore that the last of five major artworks would be the biggest: the 40ft sculpture ""Moses"" made out of thousands of 21st century toys donated to the project over two years ago.

The island already hosts an amusement park, botanical gardens, zoo, and boutique hotel, making it a tourist destination in itself.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Doctors realised Maia Collingswood needed the transplant after her father Dan revealed he also had the procedure in 1997. Maia, from Barmouth, Gwynedd, had the transplant at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital on December 27 It was during a family holiday to Aberystwyth when Dan first noticed something wasn't right with his daughter and she started having seizures every day around 7pm. Pictured: She is taken off for surgery today The youngster went into hospital several times but doctors were unable to find out what caused them. After being referred to various specialists they eventually discovered that Maia has mitochondrial disease - meaning there are problems producing energy within cells of body tissues or organs (stock image) WHAT IS MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE? Mitochondrial diseases affect how your body uses food as fuel. They are caused by faults in mitochondria, which are tiny structures inside almost all our cells that produce most of the energy we need to live. Common symptoms include muscle weakness, poor growth, lethargy, blindness, heart defects and brain disorders. Vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency, can be an underlying cause. In some cases, parts of the body begin to fail because they don't get enough oxygen. These are known as organ failure. Symptoms vary depending on which part of the body is affected. Treatment focuses on providing extra nutrients where possible, or replacing worn-out organs. Source: NHS Choices 'I kept getting told it would just pass 'but nothing ever changed,' said Mr Collingwood whose transplants comes 22 years after treatment himself.'She lost weight really quickly, so I thought perhaps she may have an eating disorder but then everything else came back including losing eyesight slowly over time'. 'By this point my wife Lisa and myself were in despair because no one knew why Maia was unwell', added the musician who says now feels like Maia's third parent. Mr Collingwood got tested again last year while struggling through chemotherapy and radiotherapy following testicular cancer diagnosis. He underwent the same tests twice more before learning he too suffers from Mito Disease. As well as liver issues similar to Maia, both parents suffer joint pains due to their condition along with skin rashes and hair loss. The couple put much emphasis on keeping fit despite suffering pain daily. Last Christmas Day saw the entire family spend together though many tears were shed throughout the evening; laughter only breaking through every few minutes between bouts of grief and sadness. But the moment everyone looked forward to arrived without any warning. Maia suffered a seizure brought about by low blood sugar levels leaving her unconscious until paramedics pumped some liquid glucose into her veins via a drip arriving 10 minutes later. Her condition improved once medication took effect allowing the whole family enjoyed each other's company undisturbed. A statement released yesterday read: 'After months of appointments at different hospitals searching for answers...and two operations on her liver propped up against life support machines and dialysis machines, we finally found a team who could help us solve these mysteries surrounding Maia's health challenges. We therefore decided to take hope rather than giving up. And miracle upon miracles....we did!'.",opt_30b,3.1893939393939394,4.0,2.953846153846154,3.015625,3.1578947368421053,0.7194216816084223,0.0523381573462101,0.5616162123423272,0.16714901730086743,-0.3856439127375089,0.6286922433460453,-0.4466227777616657,0.5130336226694512,-0.42539378458918653,0.6147889173512519,-0.22413793103448265,0.1840469913181958,0.6206896551724136,1.8689989689834376,0.0,0.0,-0.004926108374384468,1.1342425806113596,-0.3793152142685106,0.13195707676161636,0.29192950694464065,0.7989271360326514,-0.3559837728194728,0.48968747554099296,-0.8316614420062696,-0.07420060312961937,-0.16551724137931023,0.20482655887035434,-0.6196120689655172,0.05231855850676247,-0.24881118746942021,-0.1006771274631137,-0.3168103448275862,0.1540854868543239,0.2917771883289124,0.6369658228272921,0.28855981720823964,0.13303137324626377,-0.2889983579638751,0.22732001076951422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.8363636363636364,4.545454545454546,-0.5582492734866296,1.2107002782985887,0.4769898905305976,-0.2761814060306226,-0.005130281568270754,-0.13843688425814643

Elon Musk has been talking about opening up the network to other companies' electric vehicles since at least 2019. The Supercharger network has already been opened up to non-Tesla electric vehicles in Europe. Tesla's Supercharger network is the largest public fast-charging network in the world. It currently includes more than 19,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia. Opening up the network to other companies' electric vehicles will make it easier for EV owners to find charging stations.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"A report commissioned by Food Standards Scotland found that in-store promotions were heavily weighted in favour of food with high levels of salt or sugar. The Stirling University academics behind the report called for a ""retail revolution"" to help people choose healthier options. However, the study was criticised by the Scottish Grocers' Federation. It said the report failed to take account of the efforts already being made to promote healthy eating. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said Scottish obesity levels, currently 30, were projected to rise to 40 by 2030. Professor Leigh Sparks, who wrote the report, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was an imbalance in the type of food promoted in shops. ""If you look at the environment in store in retailing, then most of the promotions are pushing the products that are less healthy for consumers,"" he said. ""A lot of the products have been supersized as well - boxes of crisps, bags of crisps are good examples of that."" He said that manufacturers needed to make changes to the composition of their products, while retailers should provide more information for consumers and change their ""balance of promotions."" ""I think retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and they're looking at what they can do,"" he added. ""But most of the voluntary schemes that have gone on so far have not had the impact because of this overwhelming tide in terms of unhealthy promotions as well."" The report also backs the idea of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr Gillian Purdon said: ""The report supports Food Standards Scotland views and recommendations for the need to extend sugar tax beyond soft drinks, to reformulate products to reduce sugar fat and salt, to resize portions, address less healthy food promotion and to provide clearer consumer information on products in both the retail and out of home sectors. ""This report will help us to develop new approaches to improve the balance of food offered and promoted by the retail sector. ""It is clear that a combination of measures will be needed overall to enable healthier eating. Regulation of promotions of high fat, salt andor sugar food and drink within retail stores and out of home premises should be taken forward as a priority."" Previous research by FSS indicated about 50 of less healthy food choices are purchased on promotions. For healthier foods, the figure is about 30. The report added: ""We conclude that the current context for consumer choice in-store is affecting the health and diet of consumers in Scotland. ""Voluntary and self-regulatory approaches or relying on consumers to make'good' decisions are not having sufficient impact. ""It will thus be necessary to regulate to make the changes have real impact."" Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers' Federation, which represents food retailers in Scotland, said: ""This report seems to ignore the significant efforts of retailers to actively promote healthy products in-store and the efforts of manufacturers to reformulate products and reduce calories. ""Additionally, extending the sugar tax will make no real or lasting impact on diet-related problems. Improved food education and awareness should be the priority rather than constantly shifting the responsibility for population health onto retailers."" SGF said more than 200 stores were participating in its Scottish government-supported Healthy Living Programme. The Scottish Retail Consortium said its members were committed to helping consumers make healthier choices and called for ""regulation or legislation"" on the issue. Ewan MacDonald-Russell, its head of policy, said: ""Fruit and vegetables are heavily price promoted and there has been a proliferation of healthy alternatives. Just as importantly, our industry has led the way on reformulating products to reduce salt, sugar and fats from products, and in producing clearer and more informative labelling. ""It's worth highlighting the number of products being promoted in total is falling in response to customer demands for simpler pricing. We will continue to engage directly with FSS and the Scottish government on this issue. However, any measures on pricing and promotions will have to be done through regulation or legislation; it's not feasible, or legal, to ask retailers to voluntarily take collective measures in this area. ""Ultimately however, the best way to help improve Scotland's health is for government to take steps to ensure the whole food and drink industry is working collectively, on a level playing field, to ensure no matter where customers shop or consume they are able to make healthy informed choices.""",human,4.833333333333333,4.5,4.523076923076923,4.578125,5.315789473684211,0.45154961905025454,0.6736252834113965,0.6021822645010412,0.6640786571340646,0.3078231292517005,0.8656777912521134,0.17809083263246425,0.45968625292501253,0.1836419753086421,0.41093327995103063,0.21875,0.2324707025561656,0.5172413793103448,0.577467100966226,0.0,0.0,0.638392857142857,1.4098642306511922,-0.2573132447669429,0.4459424959330412,0.43375717801476604,1.0478817316604243,0.35845588235294124,0.49330211448897976,0.21079545454545465,0.3738362654357335,0.8,2.135690129303984,-0.01953124999999993,0.17550115636503355,-0.2720427988500417,0.08799363090413248,0.7499999999999999,2.798704725692968,-0.21153846153846156,0.203665260654378,-0.03268841679312086,0.1593998693993016,0.7857142857142859,0.5076265748342309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.418181818181818,3.0,0.3435326698729792,1.1573140583595418,0.15185333513129345,-0.6015872696392991,0.5652640123157809,0.5205285522761447

It recently performed laparoscopic partial nephrectomy on a living pig, making it the first robot to perform such a procedure. The STAR system was developed by a team of engineers and clinicians at Children's National Health System in Washington, DC. The robot integrates advanced robotics and computer vision technologies, enabling it to plan and execute autonomous surgical tasks with accuracy levels that surpass that of human surgeons. The STAR system has significant advantages over traditional robotic surgery, including improved precision and reduced risk of complications. It is designed to reduce the time required to complete complex procedures, while providing better outcomes for patients. In addition, the robot's ability to adapt to tissue changes during the procedure means that it can be used for minimally invasive surgeries that are not currently possible with conventional robots. Looking ahead, the STAR system is expected to revolutionize the way surgeons perform complex soft-tissue procedures. With further development, this technology could be used for a variety of surgical specialties, including vascular, cardiac, and thoracic surgery.",text-davinci-003,0.7348484848484849,0.6666666666666666,0.47692307692307695,0.46875,0.6842105263157895,1.3505077996187989,1.0277095050812997,1.7126903784680034,0.9423153907111734,0.14814814814814808,-0.3894267884165696,-0.31660592467993626,-0.07768990881005361,-0.35288065843621386,-0.23495841725394365,1.5,0.7324729868113493,-0.31609195402298845,0.07778933344201693,0.0,0.0,0.33333333333333326,-0.3032261212486945,-0.23110541428142092,0.5452591965740897,0.5797101449275359,-0.09405441452993948,-0.2973856209150327,-0.05174592062333641,-0.44545454545454544,0.1838941644991086,0.1333333333333333,0.5292094407109151,0.15625000000000008,-0.12240592212872103,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.8958333333333334,1.6775614187429575,-0.2564102564102565,0.21791585594698729,-0.17433822289664472,-0.0795377239676952,0.31040564373897717,0.06704365003459317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.509090909090909,0.18181818181818182,0.2249377753868079,0.25234376763451993,-0.4175600213670504,-1.4971809447928952,1.0971114569141462,1.32199479290956

There's an automated restaurant in Shanghai that serves burgers, but this new one is even more advanced: robots can not only cook your meal for you with precision timing, they also serve it right at your table. The idea behind Haidilao's robot-run restaurants isn't just about efficiency - there are plenty of those already out there. It's actually bringing attention back to traditional Chinese cooking techniques. The company said its chefs have been trained through their ""Grandma School"" program, which was founded by founder Zhang Yong. Each chef learned from his or her own grandmother how to make dumplings, noodles, rice porridge, wok fried dishes, roast goose, as well other regional specialties.",opt_30b,0.2803030303030303,0.3333333333333333,0.36923076923076925,0.296875,0.7894736842105263,0.447482108051167,-0.35005734064600125,-0.10914718633658953,-0.1803045582708912,-0.1671525753158405,0.425012269268102,0.07401177460050481,0.9314033223654321,-0.12654320987654297,0.8785122038417443,-0.0714285714285714,0.5195922159516352,2.0172413793103448,1.9964842235527,0.0,0.0,0.4489795918367346,0.4649684220721454,-0.4257921550310127,-0.18433322154864668,-0.19688269073010684,0.05331006837042562,-0.4915966386554622,-0.22499116012229262,-0.24545454545454548,0.2598354199689869,-0.34285714285714286,-0.016283797864606545,-0.7812499999999999,-0.4195066647927631,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.13392857142857142,0.5295522596111609,1.0329670329670326,1.4266905142866666,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456333,0.8888888888888888,0.25635173773684855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8727272727272727,-0.2727272727272727,-0.8018623981306483,0.7208991454475434,-0.9675591886416065,0.21368868551340256,-0.23021667050374775,-0.4403590804967996

Security is under review but the same measures are in place as last year This article is part of a series from Africa's rising stars for Guardian Cities Khartoum - Thousands have already started packing into Khartoum's vast sports complex to watch Sudan play host to this summer's Gulf Cup football tournament. The stadium has been ready since April, when it was first announced that the tournament would be coming to Sudan. But many people will miss out because they don't own tickets and so plan their trips around whether or not games are being played at home. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fans queue outside Al Itihad Stadium ahead of the opening match between Mauritania and Libya in July 2018. Photograph: Mohammed HamdanAFP via Getty Images Al Fahaiba stadium hosts 70,000 fans inside its four enclosures while each stands can hold an additional 10,000 who stand along the pitch. For most visitors, watching the matches takes up less time than going shopping; Al Shaab Park is full every day until late at night. There are also several other events taking place over the entire month, including cycling races, rugby tournaments and diving championships. A few thousand extra tents have sprouted along the Nile River, where vendors sell everything from falafel sandwiches to beer. Sudanese police were deployed 2km (1 mile) away from the campground on Friday after clashes broke out during protests against corruption earlier in the week. They were joined by hundreds of security personnel from neighbouring countries, such as Uganda and Kenya. But there have been none of the violent demonstrations seen elsewhere in Africa since South African president Jacob Zuma visited Khartoum last December. Police remain stationed along all roads leading to Al Shabaab sport centre and the protest march ended peacefully without any arrests made. Organisers said 19 people had been injured and one person died when he fell off his motorbike into traffic. Away from the frontline, life continues much as usual. Neighbours continue to trade despite international sanctions imposed due to President Omar al Bashir's government's alleged complicity with Islamist militants and human rights abuses. People go about building new homes for families returning from exile, or studying or working abroad. Others make small repairs which keep them employed. Most worryingly, despite repeated attempts by UN officials to broker peace negotiations, tensions remain high. As always, uncertainty lingers. UN mediator Nicholas Haysom returned to Sudan last Thursday following two months of talks with rebel leaders based in Burketi refugee camps in Ethiopia. He hopes to strike a deal in mid-August before presidential elections scheduled for 9 October. For those who need evidence of progress, however, Khartoum feels like Groundhog Day. Weeks ago, political parties agreed terms allowing Mr Bashir to run again in his third term in office. ""Despite numerous violations of our constitution, we decided to accept the result ... as long as we get something tangible through mediation process"" says Yasser Nour Abdelnabi, former deputy speaker of parliament. Still, preparing for next year's election campaign hasn't stopped the government from cracking down further. Last month, 150 activists were arrested protesting land seizures. This week authorities raided opposition party headquarters in Khartoum, arresting dozens of staff members and confiscating computers, telephones and files containing details sensitive information. Some say opponents are still reeling from previous years' crackdowns, including detentions, beatings, torture and arbitrary arrest. In March 2017 alone, 50 civilians were killed across protests held throughout Darfur region. The situation remains dire for the estimated three million internally displaced persons scattered across 32 states, mostly living in border areas where food supplies are scarce and access limited. ""I am afraid if I leave my house by myself, someone might kill me here [in Sudan] or take what little money I earn as extortion,"" says 17-year old student Amera Ali who now lives in a precarious tent near the United Nations compound. She didn't attend school regularly until she was 12. ""If you live far away from your parents you must grow up fast. You cannot wait to visit your parent's houses. If you do, some militias may shoot you,"" adds her friend Samuel Ahmed. Fewer children went back to classrooms this year compared to 2015 thanks to violence leaving thousands dead, according to Unicef data. Deaths among refugee populations rose 40 to 463 deaths reported by Amnesty Internationa l in June.

By accessing YouTube through the iMessage App store, the girl was able to play games and watch videos without using up her screen time limits. Apple's Screen Time parental controls, released in September 2018, allows parents to set time limits on certain apps and websites, restricting the time their children can use them. Although the time limits can be worked around by using the App store in iMessage, some parents believe the feature to be useful, as it helps them manage their child's phone use. One parent told The Telegraph: ""The Screen Time function is great for giving parents visibility on the amount of time kids are spending on their phones.",llama_65B,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0.16923076923076924,0.125,0.15789473684210525,-0.3147319645972909,-0.8820550203603321,-0.853925571659237,-0.922350807465643,0.7074829931972787,-0.5367740846483283,0.4662741799831793,-0.14234811574726838,0.28086419753086433,-0.38905128128155214,-0.30000000000000004,-0.779956864811853,-0.982758620689655,-1.130235769597546,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999999998,-0.31889850929226876,0.6389945578379082,-0.4069802305478959,0.748154224774405,-0.09308118326479127,0.3823529411764707,-0.47241674547420937,0.3945454545454548,-0.04717571868146688,-0.3999999999999999,-0.03207660596625444,0.7187500000000001,0.0,0.222016136511175,-0.010714843619247419,0.5624999999999999,1.045110873181042,0.39999999999999997,-0.1378989113186685,0.1046029337379869,0.469519899244253,0.5079365079365081,-0.5859241208629047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.03636363636363636,0.0,0.4789695380779222,-0.20519445285728677,-0.14540036458316932,0.49307631000114116,0.017829343008613968,-0.29133806535187756

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"SpaceX's SN3 prototype experienced a structural failure while undergoing the same cryptogenic proof test that killed the previous two Starship prototypes. The test involves filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to The third prototype of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft has suffered a failure during a test at the company's McGregor, Texas, facility. SpaceX says the failure happened while SN3 was undergoing the same cryptogenic proof test that killed the previous two Starship prototypes. The test involved filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to pressures of up to 14.7 pounds per square inch to simulate the loads that will be placed on the vehicle during a mission as part of SpaceX's efforts to develop deep space capability. The test is required because of the possibility of ""cryptogenic failure,"" which would occur if the Starship were to be launched with untested fuel. The explosion occurred about 30 minutes into the test. The cause of the explosion is under investigation. The test was conducted on the same day as SpaceX held a launch pad abort exercise at the McGregor site. During the exercise, engineers aborted an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket test that was scheduled for that day. ""This test was not a failure,"" SpaceX says in a statement. ""It's not clear what went wrong.""

The survey found more than 60 of Scottish firms believe Brexit would have a ""negative impact"" on them. However, the institute said there was little evidence of companies cancelling investment or recruitment outright. The Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent research body based at the University of Strathclyde, carried out the survey between 5 July and 12 July, in the aftermath of the EU referendum. Just over 60 of Scottish firms surveyed said they believed Brexit will have a negative impact on their business, while only 19 said it would have a positive impact. One third said the impact would be ""very negative."" About 40 believe that leaving the EU could lead to a decrease in their investment and expansion plans, and 34 said that they could cut back on recruitment. More than 70 of firms surveyed as part of the research had done no preparation for the UK exiting the EU. Two-thirds of businesses said resolution of the uncertainty in the economy was a key issue in the negotiation of the UK's exit from the European Union, while 49 of firms cited access to the single market as a key issue. However, the survey found little evidence of companies actually cancelling investment or recruitment plans. A quarter of firms said they had made a decision to change their investment and recruitment plans, though the vast majority - 95 - said that decisions had been postponed rather than cancelled entirely. Prof Graeme Roy, director of the institute, said: ""This is the first hard survey evidence post-referendum of what businesses in Scotland are thinking and how they are responding to the unexpected EU referendum result. ""A clear majority believe that the impact - certainly in the short to medium term - will be negative. The survey offers some evidence that investment and recruitment plans may be being put on hold. ""Resolving the current political and economic uncertainty must now be the key priority. The longer the period of uncertainty continues, the more damaging the impact will be on the economy.""",human,1.8181818181818181,1.8333333333333333,1.9076923076923078,2.0625,1.5789473684210527,0.2593901011197148,0.5283458148925159,0.6589744861638613,0.6606572477067699,0.06122448979591826,0.41864752265345584,0.19428090832632464,0.4357441354260488,0.32947530864197544,0.5051685660556825,0.25,0.3887280389380696,0.3297413793103448,0.38118578765791894,0.0,0.0,0.22321428571428556,0.47705791325982017,-0.3162808633593673,0.36030775193637815,0.02461033634126324,0.4061516790050253,0.19117647058823534,1.1279240037833216,0.2545454545454547,0.37458129877166985,-0.07499999999999996,0.34665752184500287,0.9765625000000001,1.2378654754985736,0.4765313456366503,0.3263417992271393,-0.7499999999999999,-0.4485428686500814,-0.2692307692307693,0.23106023866499983,0.45763783510369244,0.3208754346839885,0.17460317460317476,-0.00029420245391254706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6909090909090909,1.0909090909090908,0.663591099691563,0.48383670568197373,0.17000658012801337,-0.5475930839820723,0.40460604686832796,0.8010225332806689

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System (MADS) will be able to shut down a target's nervous system for an extended period of time or even kill if its power settings are increased enough. The most powerful version of the MADS would likely only work as far away from targets as 1km but it could also operate at very close range in order not to make collateral damage more difficult than necessary - especially when engaging enemy troops who might try to hide behind civilians due to fear of air strikes. Its maximum effective range depends upon factors such as how much energy can be converted into heat inside a human body rather than dissipated outside. Chinese newspapers have reported that some military researchers believe there may eventually exist versions capable of incapacitating someone with no lasting physical injury or death. Anti-personnel weapons which rely on similar effects as microwaves were first used during World War II after experiments revealed they caused intense headaches within 30 seconds of exposure, leading authorities to conclude these signals had reached ""the threshold level,"" indicating their potential lethality. But while Germany experimented extensively with directed high frequency beams including painful ones intended to stun soldiers before killing them, the Allies opted instead towards explosives when developing techniques concerning electronic warfare.",opt_30b,1.0606060606060606,0.5,0.8461538461538461,0.96875,0.2631578947368421,1.0118801872536556,0.2832258709544129,1.0804635686122561,0.7125154678343991,1.2517006802721085,0.16324874829759248,0.7447434819175778,0.019199259538896566,0.9614197530864198,-0.27572391195456714,2.5,0.6499640540098776,2.3922413793103448,2.0186127374043297,0.0,0.0,0.9464285714285713,0.29754078106601906,-0.3162808633593673,0.0627480050715703,1.4027891714520095,1.4247274911831123,0.860294117647059,-0.23984539364454427,0.7795454545454548,0.15835474274815856,0.050000000000000044,-0.05041380923590859,-0.19531249999999994,-0.2588932094134688,-0.1971853844013725,-0.07105075911806477,0.5624999999999999,1.324846381066645,0.07692307692307684,0.061686267107812894,1.2421598381385939,0.4418352045438582,-0.38095238095238076,0.2722752065450611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.1272727272727274,0.9090909090909091,-0.8424803636091096,1.0982102777986873,-0.41200574265717527,-1.4111492049184744,1.5921712247658506,1.4854394850763724
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists said that finding this object in our solar system, as large or larger than Earth itself and possibly a planet of its own if it has an atmosphere, offers fresh insight into how planets form. The results were announced at the 216th meeting of American Astronomical Society (AAS) held 8-11 June 2013 in National Harbor, Maryland.""We have found what we believe is the coldest known Kuiper belt object,"" lead author Dr Hiroshi Kobayashi told journalists after presenting his team's findings on Monday morning [UK time] in Washington D.C.. ""The temperature was measured by looking for emission lines coming out of the surface which can only come through very thin ice, so it should give us pretty good constraints on the properties of any possible atmosphere.""Larger than Mercury ""It would be larger than anything else discovered before, all the way up past Neptune... It is around 10 times more massive than the smallest previously detected objects, called Centaurs, which are bodies located between Jupiter and Uranus which spend part of their orbit near Saturn,"" he explained. If confirmed, 2012 VP113 could also be bigger than world champion bull rider Chael Sonnen, who tipped the scales at 225 kg (500 lb). In fact, the size of the object might mean it weighs half again as much as our home planet. He added: ""This may just push things over into being classified as a dwarf planet since nothing smaller has been seen yet.In addition, there are hints of clouds and snow crystals forming on it from seeing variations in brightness. This suggests it has water ice underneath something like a layer of dust... but one slightly less dense than air because then you wouldn't see these changes in light variation... We think that's why it tiptoes across the face of Alpha Centauri A twice every 105 years. That gives scientists clues about where the dark side of the planet is facing.""Frozen gas cloud But despite the discovery being exciting for space fans, it pales in comparison when compared to another new find made earlier this year. On 1 January 2011 astronomers using Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory reported they had spotted a huge frozen gas cloud hurtling towards our star five billion kilometres beyond Saturn's gravity well, making it the most distant solid object ever observed. Followed closely by the discovery by Japanese researchers last week of an extremely close encounter by two small moons of Psyche in 2010, both discoveries highlight the need to keep looking deep into the cosmos. Professor Michael Lambeck, deputy director of the Max Planck Institute of Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, pointed out: ""Nowhere else do worlds exist such distances apart.""Dr Robert Wittenmyer, astronomer at Australia's Macquarie University, added: ""I'd love to know how many other potentially habitable worlds lie waiting somewhere in wait for them to be stumbled upon."" His colleague from Arizona State University, Duncan Steel, agreed: ""There are thousands of planets out there; maybe billions, no matter how you cut it. There's still plenty left to discover.""",gpt_j,3.1742424242424243,2.8333333333333335,3.1846153846153844,3.28125,4.105263157894737,0.10045053379371444,-0.11672871155826973,-0.1116889950243198,-0.1581595860108857,0.3797155225726651,0.8647912698427961,0.41211101766190095,0.5715405289638287,0.457631874298541,0.6593950985035216,0.09090909090909083,0.6065069616018477,1.9490595611285266,1.6060846547722147,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,0.5516248991778658,0.27875601516418813,1.2801259237062177,0.2595271832351404,0.7553417985429605,0.5909090909090912,0.5676772210504126,-0.12727272727272718,0.5435546075818215,-0.6545454545454545,0.1201054632574184,-0.0994318181818181,0.6363012841318265,0.5377783210946524,0.910389001095233,-0.18749999999999997,0.8992316901633396,0.8111888111888109,0.7535351148334477,0.5467880627212948,0.6463360382571866,0.5887445887445888,0.703229977032321,0.045454545454545456,0.2082988952252655,0.045454545454545456,0.2082988952252655,3.909090909090909,2.0,-0.4786581562738407,1.376484138959978,-0.4700479551753702,-0.012998937729177904,0.19914599160227195,0.07875833158163136

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"England's win over South Africa on Sunday secured the Twenty20 series. The game was officially sold out, as were England's two ICC Champions Trophy matches at the SSE Swalec Stadium. The near-15,000 crowd comes as counties bid for the next round of five years' worth of international games. ""To have three full houses over 19 days for England matches is something we've very proud of,"" said Morris. Cardiff hosted England's win over New Zealand and semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka versus Pakistan and the less well-attended Bangladesh v New Zealand match. Around 3,000 seats were not occupied for the England v New Zealand match because of poor weather forecasts, while cancelled trains are believed to have contributed to some empty seats for the T20 on Sunday. But a rapid re-allocation of tickets worked well for the England-Pakistan game after fears that India supporters, who bought tickets for both semi-finals, would not turn up. ""It's particularly important (to have big crowds) this year, because at the back end of the year we are likely along with other counties to be bidding for our international programme between the years 2020 and 2024,"" explained Morris. ""There's also the new city-based franchise T20 as well, so it's important we can demonstrate we can fill houses and people have a great time when they are here."" England's score of 181 in 20 overs against South Africa could also come as a relief, after captain Eoin Morgan criticised the use of a previously-used wicket for the Champions Trophy semi-final, a choice attributed to the International Cricket Council. ""I wasn't surprised (with the score), it's a wicket that has played extremely well this year in domestic and international cricket, in recent years we've had some very good marks,"" said former county captain and England opener Morris. Glamorgan have forecast an operating profit for 2017 on the back of five days of international cricket. But it appears unlikely they will add another overseas player to their squad for the T20 Blast, after signing South African paceman Marchant de Lange on a three-year deal for all forms of cricket.",human,1.9242424242424243,1.3333333333333333,2.1076923076923078,2.046875,2.6315789473684212,-0.21194361384854926,-0.17952424133895598,-0.26317792071287155,-0.030108072359074745,0.8749345892203031,0.565574938950476,1.095943585430549,0.6791355110652298,0.978869895536562,0.6472668941571111,1.0384615384615383,1.1248089235094287,0.863395225464191,0.962776607063775,0.0,0.0,0.40659340659340626,0.4160141468972519,1.0671901882321284,1.3357468159242247,-0.12115857891083502,0.03529282571552496,1.2647058823529416,0.8291820295372554,0.6314685314685315,0.9601427928254479,0.3384615384615386,1.23977575775328,0.733173076923077,0.756346822559242,0.608971386584296,0.3484129647866942,0.44711538461538464,0.30573378024614867,0.20118343195266258,0.9697913674811185,0.44255087350686745,0.2193621295026596,0.9181929181929185,1.0630237402618665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1272727272727272,2.272727272727273,0.20128888642460593,0.5353674611562166,0.7033788727274402,-0.08898348681420684,0.4996074885283431,0.20143912361496524

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"This article is an introduction to learning COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL). COBOL is a domain-specific language for business. It excels in managing and manipulating heterogeneous data in record structures, and for batch-type data processing. COBOL is a programming language. It is a very popular programming language for business applications. It has been around for a very long time, since 1959. It is one of the oldest programming languages. It is still widely used. The acronym COBOL stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language. It was designed to be a language that could be understood by non-computer-experts, such as managers and accountants. COBOL is a compiled language, meaning that source code is compiled into object code before being executed by a computer. COBOL supports structured programming. A structured program is divided into sections and subsections, each of which have a well-defined purpose. COBOL code is typically organized into procedures and data divisions. Procedures contain code (sequential, conditional, and iterative), and data divisions contain variables and tables. COBOL is a very verbose language. It is a procedural language, where everything is specified explicitly. There is no such thing as a default value or default action, everything must be specified. COBOL is very good at processing data in tables. A table is a structured record format. In COBOL, a table is defined by a table definition, which consists of one or more columns (a column can be of different types, such as numeric, string, etc.). An actual table is called a file, and is defined by a file definition. A file is a collection of one or more records (each record has one or more fields). A procedure is a section of code that performs a certain task. Procedures can be defined within procedures, this is called nesting. A procedure can be called from any other procedure. Each procedure consists of three parts: A procedure division (where code is), a working-storage section (which contains variables), and a linkage section (which contains variables and constants which are visible outside the procedure). The procedure division consists of the following sections: 010000 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. 020000 PROCEDURE DIVISION. 021000 MAIN-PROCEDURE. 022000 DATA DIVISION. 023000 PROCEDURE-1. 026000 LINKAGE SECTION. 030000 WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 032000 LINKAGE SECTION. 032100 WS-1 PIC 9 (4). 032110 WS-2 PIC X (4). 032120 WS-3 PIC S9 (2) USAGE COMP. 032130 WS-4 PIC 9. 032140 WS-5 PIC 9 (3) V99. 032150 WS-6 PIC S9 (3) V99. 032160 WS-7 PIC 99. 032170 WS-8 PIC X (10). 032180 WS-9 PIC 999. 032190 WS-10 PIC X (10). 032200 WS-11 PIC 9999. 032210 WS-12 PIC X (10). 032220 WS-13 PIC 99999. 032230 WS-14 PIC X (10). 032240 WS-15 PIC 999999. 032250 WS-16 PIC X (10). 032260 WS-17 PIC . 032270 WS-18 PIC X (10). 032280 WS-19 PIC 99999999. 032290 WS-20 PIC X (10). 032",llama_65B,2.234848484848485,8.666666666666666,1.9076923076923078,2.109375,6.842105263157895,0.18664586494492852,1.0598802565122587,0.606165163086798,0.31113391211003166,-1.8870986991287741,0.1407024774768565,-1.808743895061455,0.15525213184591985,-1.7431773879142296,0.17529982063365215,-0.9736842105263158,-0.2081062476368814,-0.719600725952813,-0.3127512715485667,0.0,0.0,-1.1879699248120303,0.4576653144927911,-0.41869830617778864,-0.29961035846520384,-1.4472604809809593,-0.3407255753720908,-1.4690402476780189,-0.38871548694870867,-0.9121212121212122,0.24296738120327382,-0.6736842105263158,0.431675467899968,-1.0608552631578947,0.13962162559238245,0.7221161965471967,0.5846025543371873,-0.9111842105263156,-0.9769782233081373,-0.7692307692307693,-0.2755234824461694,-0.4129063173867901,-0.30858150849640825,-0.17822333611807295,0.7556257898201727,0.0,0.0,0.17543859649122806,0.3803418138364702,0.6363636363636364,1.0909090909090908,0.8160106408707063,0.514767996349749,0.09954332652232388,0.31364084353423655,-1.1617183368310087,-0.9763624555140064

Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander and Man of Steel actor Henry Cavill will also feature in the adaptation of the TV series, which ran from 1964 to 1968. Grant, who most recently starred in Cloud Atlas with Tom Hanks, will play the head of British Naval Intelligence. The film follows special agents Napoleon Solo, played by Cavill, and Illya Kuryakin - Lone Ranger star Hammer - who work for the mysterious United Network Command for Law Enforcement (U.N.C.L.E.). Swedish actress Vikander, known for her role as Kitty in Joe Wright's Anna Karenina, has been cast as the female lead, while The Great Gatsby's Elisabeth Debicki will also star in the adaptation. Tom Cruise had been tipped for the role of Solo, originally portrayed by Robert Vaughn in the TV series, while George Clooney was set to play the lead role in director Steven Soderbergh's earlier version of the film. However, Clooney withdrew from the film and Soderbergh subsequently dropped out of the project. Director Ritchie will co-write the script with Lionel Wigram, who wrote both of Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films, starring Robert Downey Jr. Production is due to begin in September with a release planned for 2014.

Ellison, a lifelong county fan whose father played Test cricket before him, led Middlesex through their last two home season titles and then became vice-captain under Steve Finn until he stepped down from that role this summer on medical advice. He has been named by both sides as England's overseas player for Australia during the Ashes series later this year and now the decision about whether he will succeed Mark Ramprakash as skipper - even though it looks certain with Yorkshire's new man Graeme Swann in line for that task - is expected to make headlines shortly.

It was stationed in Cornwall, Hampshire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire, and flew many missions over France and Germany. In 1945, the plane was scrapped in a Lincolnshire quarry. The plane was a Mark VB with registration number EP120 and was built by Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd. The plane was equipped with a Rolls Royce Merlin engine and had a top speed of 362 miles per hour. It was armed with eight .303 machine guns and two 20mm cannons. Another notable item from the Spitfire is the propeller, which is made of wood. This is because the English had a shortage of metal during the war, so they had to use whatever materials they had available. The propeller was also made of laminated spruce and birch plywood covered with a thin layer of birch. This aircraft was excavated in 1991, and was not restored until 2004. It now rests in the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, England.",llama_65B,0.5303030303030303,1.1666666666666667,0.7076923076923077,0.65625,0.5789473684210527,-0.42621197735787425,0.0007756937523437637,-0.42025233641100995,-0.29786761280699015,-0.9024943310657596,-0.19712241454619236,-0.5612559573871602,0.03659627381177952,-0.6481481481481478,-0.014487250631079196,-1.0,-0.6499640540098776,-0.607758620689655,-0.36652782880712237,0.0,0.0,-0.8214285714285715,-0.08744228147313532,0.17511595824416942,0.3099135066671161,-0.8367514356029532,-0.33289646262377914,-0.19117647058823534,0.02929412831668729,-0.21212121212121196,-0.22971540277217048,0.1333333333333333,1.110820942829735,-0.15624999999999986,0.36154322585918774,0.50148381711954,0.7566236817334644,-0.5624999999999999,-0.17749575895105157,-0.46153846153846156,-0.07877920866952154,-0.39226100151745064,-0.27865678049587084,-0.529100529100529,0.26145627914239805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5272727272727272,0.0,0.1750782675182354,0.4420044184896621,-0.53065160690443,0.7910846707562086,-0.9938189469388872,-1.0811240841575154

However, Tesco said it was ""unable to quantify reliably"" the financial impact of the scandal and said it could not now give ""meaningful"" guidance on its underlying earnings for the financial year. Tesco has agreed to pay 129m to shareholders who bought shares in the 49 days after the supermarket chain's announcement of a profit overstatement on 29 August 2014 to 22 October 2014. The fine is nearly double the amount the company had set aside to cover the costs of its investigation into the scandal. The supermarket also said its full-year results would be hit by the 235m cost of the investigation and associated compensation. ""The new Board of Tesco has undertaken a thorough root-and-branch review of the business, and is focused on addressing the issues of the past while building a sustainable and successful future for Tesco,"" said John Allan, Tesco Chairman. It was revealed that the company had overstated profits by 250m. In a statement, the FCA said it was ""considering carefully"" whether it had ""satisfied the evidential standard"" for bringing criminal proceedings in light of the DPA. He said: ""Investors in Tesco have been badly hit by the grocer's accounting scandal and today's news will be of little consolation to them."" The SFO had been investigating Tesco since December 2014 following an accounting scandal at the supermarket. In a statement, the FCA said it was considering whether to bring criminal charges against Tesco. In a statement, Tesco said: ""It has been confirmed today that Tesco Stores Limited has entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Serious Fraud Office."" As part of the DPA, Tesco also agreed to compensate investors who had lost out as a result of the misleading information provided to the market. The SFO's Lisa Osofsky said: ""The agreement reached will both vindicate the rights of victims and ensure that the wrongdoers will face consequences for their actions."" The company also announced that it is launching a further issue of 650 million pounds (846 million) in shares to rebuild its balance sheet. The fine is the first of its kind levied by the SFO, a British law enforcement agency, since it received the power to do so in 2014. Tesco said its Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the SFO related to historic public accounting practices.",llama_65B,2.2803030303030303,1.8333333333333333,2.3692307692307693,2.59375,2.263157894736842,0.0033335780445630423,0.8318976804750864,0.24245969391765404,0.530058211655057,0.5799319727891155,0.0017786476807808013,0.6799831791421362,0.03717515204308963,0.8804012345679013,0.08521684735789516,-0.1875,0.3391383254956237,0.048491379310344855,0.3609516546638903,0.0,0.0,0.22321428571428556,0.06944944621198083,0.47978198763836233,0.8860101245912886,0.3691550451189498,0.05952667015462593,0.4779411764705883,0.2165002741147103,0.7795454545454548,0.3626216812306879,-0.19999999999999996,0.9226324657327489,1.50390625,0.7613416438103111,0.5513887600853195,1.2235718141603744,0.18749999999999997,0.6624231905333225,0.3076923076923076,0.022739218576420517,0.45763783510369244,0.18300157002142728,0.7301587301587303,0.9662097895759743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3272727272727274,1.9090909090909092,0.3856151832322024,0.7671378330119932,0.39744781570468013,-0.40372317081911463,0.5666230280312629,0.6849831379933612

Its existence has been long hypothesized, but this is the first time it has been confirmed. The researchers were able to confirm its existence by studying seismic waves in Earth's mantle. Davemaoite is believed to be the most abundant mineral in the Earth's mantle, and it could be a major contributor to the planet's chemical makeup. The discovery of Davemaoite could help scientists better understand the composition of Earth's interior. It could also provide insight into how the planet formed and evolved over time.

On current projections, the PRI would have a majority in both houses of Congress. ""This has been an election that was held under special circumstances,"" Pena Nieto told supporters late Sunday night at his campaign headquarters after polls closed across Mexico. ""It's also true we've had these moments when all Mexicans were called upon to confront challenges."" Pena Nieto ran for re-election pledging continuity and calling it vital to maintain the gains made during seven years of economic growth above 4 percent annually - but he struggled against high crime rates, widespread corruption and tepid job creation. His opponents criticized him incessantly over those issues before finally getting around to attacking each other a month ago once campaigning began Sunday morning. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who says he now supports Pena Nieto as president, campaigned hard against the incumbent, charging openly that Pena Nieto will continue corruption that flourished in past administrations or allow criminals to fill prisons if they aren't already overcrowded thanks to drug war violence. He promised change.

A GIF showing a person being removed from the background using a webcam is shown below. Demo of removing a person from a scene using Disappearing-People. Here is a video of the process of removing a person from a scene. This project has two primary goals. The first goal is to explore the new paradigm of running deep learning on the web in the browser. TensorFlow.js is a new open source library that lets us run TensorFlow models in the browser. The second goal is to build a tool that can be used by people to easily remove objects from backgrounds. We use a TensorFlow model trained on COCO, a dataset for detection and segmentation of common objects. How to remove objects from a scene The first step is to define the objects you want to remove. This can be done by drawing over them in an image editor. For our example, we will draw over the person in this scene. Here is the image after the person has been drawn over. The next step is to find a few hundred images that contain the object you want to remove. You can find these on the internet. For our example, we will use the COCO dataset, which has 115,000 images and 80 object categories. The objects are labeled with bounding boxes. We will take the 2,000 images with people from COCO and use them to train a TensorFlow model. Running TensorFlow in the browser The first step to running TensorFlow in the browser is to define the model. The model is defined by creating a graph with TensorFlow. The graph specifies the computation. The next step is to define the inputs to the graph. For this project, we use a single image as input. Next, the weights for the model are loaded into the graph. The weights are stored in a file that can be downloaded from TensorFlow Hub. Next, the model is compiled. The TensorFlow.js compiler transforms the graph into a serialized representation that can be executed in the browser. The final step is to serialize the model to disk. The model can then be loaded into the browser. Disappearing-People is a JavaScript library for removing people from complex backgrounds in real-time. It uses TensorFlow.js in the web browser.

This ambitious plan will require significant changes that go well beyond those necessary for simply maintaining and operating this ship: The whole concept of an all-nuclear propulsion system has never been attempted before. It involves redesigning every aspect of the vessel from top to bottomand the challenge becomes even greater when it comes to stealth features as they are essential for such a vessel.

His absence from that list of illustrious names reveals how much has changed at Anfield since then and while some fans may be reluctant to forgive him for leaving when they did, it would do them good to learn what happened next. Liverpool signed Sadio Mane (above) just months after selling Wallace PA Photos Enlarge As soon as Kenny left a year later by mutual consent, owner John W Henry was on the phone offering Carroll 100,000-a-week - more than any other player in English football except Wayne Rooney and David Beckham. The deal prompted muttering among supporters who wondered why their manager had been sacked before being replaced with a striker whose best days were behind him because of injury problems. It led to the famous 'zeitgeist' tweet from Ian Ayre: ""Our zeigiest signing ever."" Sure enough, within two years Carroll made only one appearance under Roy Hodgson and spent most of the second half of last season out injured again. He seems destined never to fully justify such wages but even so there remains an astonishing gulf between his status now and the position held previously by few players in the club's whole history. Twenty years ago this week Michael Owen arrived at Anfield. He cost around 17m but didn't start scoring regularly until late 200203; six months earlier, after joining Newcastle United on loan, he'd won the FA Cup against all odds. Yet no matter where you stand on transfers these days, nobody could accuse Sir Alex Ferguson of misjudging his arrival into Manchester United's forward line. Few imagined a time when both Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge would surpass Owen's total return of 91 goals in 172 appearances yet here we are. Instead, argues Gary Neville in his new book, money can buy success if used correctly but only once certain conditions are established. Transfer policy should reflect long term strategy rather than short term necessity I don't think premiership clubs know anything about building a team and structural changes to training methods must also take place alongside investment strategies designed specifically to provide young talent with opportunities. In short, everything needs tweaking. On Sunday evening a million people watched Steven Gerrard lift another Premier League trophy up above his head which meant something special given those closest to him knew better than anyone else exactly what it took to get there. While others will argue that 30 years without winning silverware isn't acceptable, perhaps instead we need to accept that times change and priorities shift. There'll always be pressure but sometimes expectations are unrealistic. Nowhere does that apply more than at Real Madrid. If Barcelona win La Liga too it means three league titles in four seasons plus Copa del Rey victories mean Pep Guardiola has surpassed Del Bosque's achievements despite spending far less over the course of five campaigns than Jose Mourinho during his own run of dominance at Chelsea. But hey ho, let us put aside our differences and celebrate progress along the way. Just try telling that to Liverpool fans still awaiting justice following Heysel and Hillsborough...

The company, Zoetis, is developing two pesticides called BT and BTZ that target a protein found on the whitefly, called Bemisia tabaci. The pest is a small white fly that feeds on cabbages and other vegetables. It acquired a gene from its plant host millions of years ago, allowing it to neutralize a toxin that some plants produce to defend against the whitefly. The toxins are produced in response to herbicides, allowing the plants to survive the herbicide. The pest is a major problem in many parts of the world, especially in Europe.

The return to the offices was controversial since it was announced, with many complaining about the lack of safety precautions and the speed with which the company was returning employees. It was at the end of February that the company announced that it would start returning employees to the office on March 2nd and that there would be two shifts a day. It was also announced that employees would have to wear a mask and get a temperature check. Today, the company announced that the first group of employees will return to the office on March 16th, not the 2nd. Apple's official statement was that it will return employees to the office in two stages. The first group will be the teams that have a direct impact on customer service and software updates. The second phase is scheduled to start in the middle of this month. The teams that work on the production of hardware and other Apple products will return to work. Apple's insistence on returning employees to the office was seen by many as a bad move. Apple employees have been calling on the company to wait until the outbreak is over.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so forgive me if you know this) Solid will allow people to build their own software and apps on top of an underlying blockchain that keeps information public while allowing private access for companies or individuals - in other words it's like Twitter except not sucky at all! Why This Matters: Well, right now we have horrible centralized services where Facebook owns your data, Google knows everything about everyone but tries its best to hide what they're doing from us even though our government lets them look away because otherwise how would they do business? We've been told repeatedly over the years that these are bad things, yet still many believe the omniscient omnipotent market forces built into capitalism will work out anything wrong without any intervention whatsoever. But guess what happens every time there's no regulation anywhere just pure free markets which means monopoly after monopolist gets too big for anyone else to compete against...bammo! Now imagine if instead of having to rely on one company holding onto massive amounts of personal info forever something similar existed which was open source meaning anybody could copy stuff off each others servers anytime they wanted then hack together whatever appservice they needed using some cool new version control system called Git. Imagine further being able to make money through advertising since companies wouldn't be tracking your downloads across different platforms anymore and oh yeah paywall sites owned by Conde Nast style conglomerates won't exist either cause you'll get paid directly when someone clicks an adblock advert or actually buys product X online thanks to micropayments powered by cryptocurrencies [check]. It sounds crazy enough to happen doesn't it?! What Makes Me Worry About This Technology: The technology behind Solid seems awesomely powerful and revolutionary, however my concerns lie mainly around adoption rate due to user experience. There isn't much incentive today for everyday users to switch completely from current tech once most applications work perfectly fine within said paradigm. Think back to previous waves of innovation such as riding bikes vs cars. Cars were great until everybody had em; suddenly bikes became more fun again). If decentralization does take hold, existing players may benefit greatly (Google, FB), harm smaller entities trying to break into space (TwitterSquare), become gatekeepers themselves (Apple, Amazon), or find ways to manipulate the platform itself (the way Reddit has recently gone down hill). When asking friends what's important about crypto currency to them almost universally 1 answer is ""anonymity - security privacy issues"" followed closely second place is 'making money quick easy' resulting in dapps attempting to focus primarily upon gambling mechanics, digital tulips and porn. Also they hate banks and credit cards . Obviously successful projects here become magnets for VC investment leading to brutal hierarchies based purely on factors outside meritocracy ...think Yelp reviews versus TripAdvisor ratings Lastly don't forget about IP law; solid core protocol 3rd party DApps potential landmines regarding intellectual property rights violations given vast number of possible permutations. Overall utility value proposition also remains unclear beyond initial novelty. Remedy For These Concerns In My Eyes Would Be To Give Users An Easy Way Out Of A Deadlock Like The Crypto Community Has Done Before By Building Decentralized Extensions On Top Of Public Blockchains And Use Cases Such As P2P File Sharing Or Peer 2 Peer Lending Products That Offer Commercial Advantages Over Existing Services While Still Being Open Source.",opt_30b,3.7196969696969697,3.0,3.292307692307692,3.34375,3.1052631578947367,0.8983629762903388,0.30267099616557086,0.9064795692712279,0.699835641282042,0.6660751257024546,1.8787056245762839,0.3604051632720227,1.3591358595200336,0.37104133118625876,1.4296635834210678,0.8913043478260869,1.206084520662183,2.4737631184407793,1.7389776411721698,0.13043478260869565,0.44763609308639146,0.4968944099378881,1.9723164650717104,-0.08297419849368805,1.2753889765175443,1.0657345650390555,2.074837025057952,0.049872122762148224,1.2877590700371038,0.10237154150197633,0.7782353611518952,0.01739130434782621,1.0171813536444732,-0.8627717391304348,0.2488378330656448,-0.34039087291187015,-0.17311972229958494,0.17119565217391294,0.7742710028076796,0.9297658862876251,1.725804869247292,1.114248641991599,0.8148276606968636,0.044168391994479035,2.0348398637779317,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.20393111999232305,5.254545454545455,3.5454545454545454,-0.7252878874542689,1.5246744986220757,-0.21010247166763907,-1.0152530907439583,1.0277321049506307,0.9642654680984879

Other studies have shown a decline in amphibians over an even shorter period: half its population was lost between 2000-2010 alone according to one study. EcoWatch contributor John Ikerd wrote about this issue here (from 2012): ""The world's most comprehensive review on vertebrate populations finds declines among species ranging from insects such as bees through sharks."" As for what you can do? The article goes into detail including interviews with some experts who offer solutions like herbivore grazing grasslands which also help reduce desertification; these practices are considered largely underutilized though because they require more investment than just planting trees or erecting fences around certain areas.

It said police had been told and were informing them of what they found when searching for the suspect A POLICEMAN was caught on camera hiding inside a child's climbing frame to steal valium tablets, West Wales Police have confirmed. Officers first became aware of an attempted burglary after receiving reports that two people might be attempting to break into the building while it was empty. Footage proved pivotal in identifying one person who has since admitted involvement in more than 20 offences across north west Wales. The restorative justice centre opened last month in Camau Bach near Machynlleth is now being used as a processing facility due to overcrowding issues. School catering officer Gary Gibbs, 29, began investigating matters about 10pm on Monday 11 May when he noticed lights coming through safety glass panels protecting equipment stored inside the children's gym There are several cameras set up around the building which cover most areas of activity but not all of them can operate simultaneously. One eye-catching picture taken by security staff showed a man crawling onto the roof. Another revealed him going under the fence before crawling along towards the back door of the premises. Police believe he climbed over a wall nearby a safe containing cash, then crept further underground until he got to a storage room where he stole 5 worth of painkillers - known locally as Valium - and left his mobile phone behind. He also took things such as cleaning cloths and washing powder within sight of CCTV footage showing how he reached the roof using ladders or scaffolding. When officers arrived at the scene shortly afterwards they searched neighbouring properties including a flat above the business listed as manager Simon Williams' address. They discovered three other adults still in possession of drugs despite having previously checked themselves out earlier that day. Mr Gibbs believed there may have been others involved due to the amount of time spent stealing illicit substances. ""Two years ago we would get maybe four offences a year, this year we've already had 15 so far,"" he added. Once the owner identified the culprit, who lived just yards away from the store, specialist detectives joined the operation. A search warrant was executed at 9am yesterday (Tuesday 1 June) at a property owned by Mr Williams at Nevern Road, Fairwater, Wales NP3 4AZ. During their investigation the suspected burglar attempted to flee by car leaving items in front of the house. However, at 6.20pm a member of the public called police after spotting the man running in a field next to the house.Officers arrested 25-year-old Aaron John Vaughan at Abertillery Railway Station where he claimed to work as a labourer. Upon questioning he acknowledged that he entered the main shop without permission on Sunday evening but denied any knowledge of the theft. His solicitor submitted paperwork claiming that he did not commit any offence but instead went to the shop because he wanted to use the facilities.Mr Gibbs insisted: ""We do not think crime will stop if offenders go to jail.""He explained his organisation provides a place where offenders can learn from their mistakes and offers resources to help with future offending behaviour.",gpt_j,3.371212121212121,3.0,3.2,3.359375,1.9473684210526316,0.3129311898171143,0.1467000284938047,0.1262327779093883,0.08713406028942233,0.3939662821650397,0.3767725549629387,0.29282919515851824,0.16665605648941612,0.38231347289318335,0.21340897553402396,-0.6304347826086957,-0.3374508036981847,0.7781109445277362,1.7018475062263068,0.0,0.0,0.4782608695652172,0.49656048398567343,-0.04195324642939283,0.5238901869170532,1.0956949744979843,0.9729520024099153,0.48209718670076745,0.2217055771708228,-0.38458498023715415,0.7094141234980301,-0.417391304347826,0.2229412642718131,0.19701086956521766,0.28176046915406683,0.33658052731957305,0.4800133957294156,-0.15489130434782608,0.5681490488619289,0.48829431438127074,0.4944052334063026,0.7049328143212157,0.3547721100685745,-0.38095238095238076,0.13083224939849541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.8727272727272726,3.1818181818181817,-0.43990988712850876,1.3192756901897353,-0.027675489788281094,-0.2251592056957549,0.351273272187279,0.31267800134979706

It has said making Scotland's railways public again is the only way to improve services for passengers. The rail union is calling for an immediate end to Abellio's ScotRail contract and for the Scottish government to take back control of Scotland's railways. It says that the private sector has failed to deliver the improvements in services that passengers were promised and argues that public ownership is the only way to ensure Scotland's railways are run for the benefit of passengers and staff, and not for profit. The union also wants the Scottish government to set out plans for a publicly owned Scottish railway network. The Scottish government has said it is ""actively considering options"" for the future of Scottish rail, including public ownership, but has not yet revealed any concrete plans. The current franchise agreement with Abellio runs until 2025. The RMT is demanding that the Scottish government takes action now to set out an immediate timetable for Abellio to be stripped of its ScotRail franchise and a plan for a publicly owned Scottish railway network to be put in place. The union believes that this would enable better investment in the network, improved services, and lower fares for passengers.",text-davinci-003,0.9318181818181818,0.6666666666666666,0.9538461538461539,0.96875,0.3157894736842105,0.2453176241725824,0.3279977127504158,0.04304736508120684,-0.3642005005097706,0.5411942554799697,0.8239611723439927,0.5756471357817025,0.9487799051800628,0.5689300411522633,0.8876955054968017,0.8333333333333335,-0.23854125236977733,0.35057471264367807,0.4128142540958932,0.0,0.0,0.6190476190476187,0.16503934889174532,-0.38835239719455267,-0.33177415360261137,0.5031446540880503,0.8073052892342035,0.12745098039215677,-0.30097591243788147,0.6434343434343435,0.7856011279211247,0.3555555555555556,1.321686907367455,0.8854166666666666,0.3298160469634361,-0.3635351942873041,-0.19699675255657734,1.7291666666666663,2.1586633481516078,-0.358974358974359,-0.3412977170089795,0.5230146686899342,0.4930913526121032,-0.5784832451499118,0.1630139516372329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.10909090909090909,0.36363636363636365,1.143223738730314,-0.08801885944850864,0.15786325297601242,-0.21468826750466663,0.4180085250311001,0.18033478663138197

Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans are able to learn and adapt quickly when navigating a new environment. The model enables robots to adjust the way they move in order to traverse an unfamiliar terrain, based on visual input. The technology uses a deep reinforcement learning approach that combines perception with motor control. This allows the robot to develop a ""muscle memory"" of how to react to different obstacles. The robot is trained to interpret visual input and then generate a set of commands to adjust its movement accordingly. The model has been tested on a robotic platform in a variety of terrains and achieved success rates of up to 90. It is hoped that this technology could eventually be used for more complex applications such as exploration and search-and-rescue missions.",text-davinci-003,0.4318181818181818,0.5,0.38461538461538464,0.4375,0.0,0.1693185111918169,0.6908438110470531,0.7458748682078692,0.4960860266902653,-0.15986394557823136,-0.7439005539151359,-0.2266610597140454,-0.4282863559768985,-0.14043209876543192,-0.4117964432208108,0.0,-0.6499640540098776,-0.04525862068965513,0.38118578765791894,0.0,0.0,0.24999999999999986,-0.5666534226104408,-0.6700865749139138,-0.34643628160558093,0.2830188679245282,-0.22279911036493288,-0.19117647058823534,0.06178927226509531,-0.2704545454545454,0.3626216812306879,0.050000000000000044,0.622256776214835,0.27343750000000006,-0.6682298512544761,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,0.5624999999999999,0.969854863164542,-0.2692307692307693,-0.3757712550030027,0.26150733434496715,0.3367876570272817,-0.603174603174603,-0.3699898134060854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.45454545454545453,0.09537121672328129,0.1484116016740428,0.1399549119235666,-0.5303694710641276,0.28187744694454697,0.14409554109227968

The new design is filled with cards, similar to Apple's Store apps (Apple News, Books) or the recently redesigned Podcasts app that debuted in iOS 15 beta 5 last week. Evidence of this redesign was found buried within the code of macOS Monterey Beta 6 released earlier today by developer Steve Moser who dug into all of the changes listed inside of System Information to find out what else could change when macOS 11 Big Sur launches later this year. And as it turns out - the Mac App Store will be getting its own makeover before Public Beta testing kicks off later this month: Today's system info dump contains references to ""NewStoreIcon,"" which are usually used internally at Apple but also sometimes show up if you visit some sites like 9to5Mac. pic.twitter.comjxUQ3E1ddA - Steve Troughton-Smith (stroughtonsmith) June 22, 2021 When visiting the US store directly from Safari running version 14 of the web browser, one can see links to Featured, Collections, Categories, Search, Updates, Purchases, Today, Notifications, My Account, Sign Out, Help Center, About This Mac Mac mini, and Settings.

The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500 in 2011. The DHPA said if numbers continued to fall, the breed could lose its hardiness to survive on the moor. It said demand had dropped for the ponies as pets because of the economic downturn. The ponies were traditionally used for farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts. Charlotte Faulkner, founder of the DHPA, said in a letter to South West Equine Protection (Swep): ""It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. ""We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether."" Ms Faulkner said selling ponies for riding and driving would continue. ""The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association believes the meat trade should be (used) too,"" she said. ""Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sale.""

Chevelleau, who was sentenced on Wednesday, was described as Mackin's ""criminal associate"" by police. He claimed the vehicle was stolen by a stranger while he was using a phone box. Chevelleau said he saw his car being driven off by an unknown person but thought it was a prank by a friend, so did not report it to police until three hours later. The vehicle was later found abandoned by police. Sgt Lee Westhead said his ""web of lies"" had helped Samuel's killer escape justice for 12 years.

She did say however both councils should consult widely around public meetings during January 2011.

This is a mistake because it can give you an insight into what kind of environment and culture exists within that organisation - key factors in how happy a person will be working there. The first thing I ask during interviews at Candidates4Hire is: 'What do you like most or least about your current role?' If someone says he likes his boss then great; if not, this often raises red flags as sometimes bosses don't get on with each other! Similarly, asking them where they see themselves after five years could elicit some important information such as salary expectations (if they want more money) and career progression opportunities available through the company. Finally, by finding out who else works in HRrecruitment gives me another perspective when speaking to candidates which may highlight things not picked up from just talking to one member of staff. Talking to others helps form better opinions on issues discussed earlier that might have been overlooked due to my own bias towards certain aspects of the business.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Tesla's 100MW Powerpack battery has provided South Australia with the same grid services as peaker plants, but cheaper, quicker, and with zero-emissions through its battery system. The energy system cost of renewables is rapidly dropping to a point that they can be good (if not great) at providing both base load power and peak demand management without any additional support from fossil fuels or nuclear generators. Why then are governments still spending up big on new baseload capacity when renewable technologies have already proven their ability to supply reliable clean electricity? Why build more gas generation than wind turbines in Germany for example if we know how much lower the costs will go by 2030 and beyond? A study published last month in Nature Climate Change outlines one reason why: these newly installed coal and natural gas projects aren't just being built because they're needed - some think they're actually ""strategic"" investments meant to prop up lagging industries even after those sectors become uneconomical due to market forces alone. This paper proves what many long suspected was happening; namely that there may well be an ideological element behind this recent wave of infrastructure investment into old school power sources like government subsidies rather than low carbon alternatives involving cleaner tech such as batteries. According to researchers writing about it: In our results, economic interest does not appear sufficient to explain all business decisions concerning resources development - specifically resource extraction and production activities associated with current technological change...We instead suggest that developing countries pursue strategic interests partly independent of economics within technology evolution processes driven largely by markets. Strategic actors seek rents above equilibrium levels generated by developments in key upstream capital goods required for exploiting mineral resources in order to benefit strategically important downstream industrial sectors [emphasis mine]. They also attempt to limit competition among national firms involved in economically significant value chains related to mining exports seeking access to critical inputs for efficient operation. In other words, policy makers could view specific types of resource exploitation strategies undertaken since 2000 as attempts to reinforce domestic industry against globalization pressures and ensure continued dependence upon imported components essential to competitiveness.[i] This research shows us another side of climate politics which most observers haven't considered before now. It suggests the need for active state intervention and planning regarding economies where ""market mechanisms would fail."" Such interventions might include heavy taxpayer funded incentives directed toward particular forms of industrial activity. As I noted previously though, the idea that oil companies rely on direct handouts while cutting government programs aimed at helping people achieve greater financial security seems odd given Big Oil's strong lobbying presence throughout Washington DC. But maybe that's why anti-lobbying advocates keep failing, despite years of trying! The truth lies somewhere between ideology and reality probably depending on who you ask. Just look at John Kerry recently; he claims to want bold action towards solving environmental problems using capitalism, yet his actions betray something else entirely - including massive funding going directly to offshore drilling platforms during his own tenure as Secretary Of State under Obama administration. If only politicians were less selfish and self serving perhaps things wouldn't seem quite so dysfunctional here in America today. We certainly do love seeing them squirm around looking guilty over nothing right??",opt_30b,3.3863636363636362,2.5,2.707692307692308,2.6875,2.3157894736842106,1.8094412145612746,0.704369134059166,1.7678845371257415,1.0650824871934639,0.8911564625850339,0.921102221073481,0.3108494533221192,0.6184036445033495,0.26790123456790116,0.3585013620604808,2.0,1.1493241156947323,2.0172413793103448,1.975092501497526,0.0,0.0,1.407142857142857,1.3564931051737996,-0.49318371913664055,0.0464235552240285,1.0237899917965545,1.1512989146679216,0.6500000000000001,0.46609175012295795,-0.3054545454545453,0.49613043481867375,0.10000000000000009,0.4884651026911572,-0.921875,0.06682557669657442,-0.25707131596030786,-0.10606601717798204,0.11249999999999992,0.3717848136299612,0.2153846153846152,0.17967515264852307,1.202933737986849,1.0110364117346957,-0.20317460317460284,0.21695208811294642,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.21794494717703364,5.163636363636364,3.3636363636363638,-0.7898386668021781,1.5505085639136822,-0.21584168751546787,-1.8559996974321342,1.715201357492735,1.6741857387905001

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A Bay Area-based startup called Perfect Day has created a lab-grown ice cream that uses whey protein from genetically modified yeast. While there are plenty of dairy-free ice cream alternatives on the market, this one is still being marketed as ""the real thing"" by some in the food industry. Others have raised concerns over its production methods and labeling. Perfect Day founder Guri Krishnan-Sarin tells Fast Company that it makes a seven-ingredient product with no GMOs (genetically modified organisms), gluten or milk proteins - but she doesn't want to be labeled organic because the company isn't yet certified for organic products. The name comes from ""perfect day,"" which refers to perfection without any GMO ingredients. Krishnan-Sarin's team works 12 hours per day, 7 days every week, creating a cultured powder made using 100 percent natural components like sugar cane juice concentrate and coconut oil. This mixture is then mixed together when it's time to make ice cream. According to Krishnna-Sarin, frozen yogurt contains about 40 water; her version contains 45. Ice creams contain more than 60, while sherbets only 20-30. That means that unlike regular homemade ice cream, where you put an egg yolk into warm liquid, your culture would work at -4 degrees Celsius. This also puts them out of reach of many customers who might otherwise buy these other non-traditional brands. But after speaking with Krishnan-Sarin, I think we can all agree that there is room in our grocery stores for both types of ice cream: traditional ones and those grown in labs. How do they compare?

View Article At first glance, this looks exactly like any other batch of vanilla-flavored ice cream sold in stores across America today. However, there are two important differences. First, this ice cream was grown inside a lab rather than whipped up from raw ingredients straight from Mother Nature. Second, this particular batch used whey protein derived from genetically engineered baker's yeasts. Whey protein isolate is typically cheaper than whole milk and cow' s milk proteins, so most companies prefer to add it as well. Generally, small quantities of whey aren't harmful. Some folks even enjoy drinking it after workouts. When consumed in massive amounts though, according to reports published online last year, it could cause kidney failure for some individuals. Whole milk is certainly better for consumers, since cows don't need antibiotics and hormones to grow quickly before slaughter. These additives give factory farm animals horrible stomach problems. Despite the potential hazards posed by large doses of isolated animal milk proteins, scientists continue to find ways to extract specific beneficial compounds. One such method involves removing individual molecules from the rest of milk fat - butter, cheese, etc., and isolating them individually. Then, they're added back to whatever type of drink or dessert contains milk fats themselves. Whey proteins are generally considered safe to consume if: You're male Your total body weight exceeds 50kg You avoid consuming 70 grams of protein each day Don't Add Anything Else Except Sugar Source Because Your Body Needs Amino Acids Too Who's Type Type and number: is being: In order: being: desirers: prote:ers hovering account",gpt_j,5.181818181818182,6.666666666666667,3.8461538461538463,3.828125,5.0,0.6695910460326379,-0.2604278501831264,0.3660743646548117,0.3529590719289152,-0.4595616024187455,0.9877597901899924,-0.8749836463881882,0.39400739469430685,-0.8886831275720162,0.38738336827846004,-0.2333333333333334,0.5054698220562365,0.41724137931034483,0.5898190872629878,0.0,0.0,-0.3142857142857145,0.8340886585335621,0.7647921441684136,4.0266890542222065,-0.2625102543068088,0.6645737498117119,-0.654248366013072,0.5811612254661005,-0.7565656565656566,0.060232159763609495,-0.5333333333333333,0.3057289318900561,-1.03125,-0.18361038808692698,0.035704349438931644,0.3515870177982862,-0.3374999999999999,0.6422022767272724,0.09230769230769217,0.40105472536478204,0.13947057831731582,0.3020114567275658,-0.420458553791887,0.4509737426131676,0.022222222222222223,0.14740554623801777,0.044444444444444446,0.29481109247603554,6.036363636363636,4.2727272727272725,-0.5539130515614215,1.6270915196756177,-0.21950648799661163,-0.07577636393025051,-0.17917034535500018,-0.15844452200294717
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Scientists in China have developed an extremely fast charging technology that can charge a lithium-ion battery to up to 60 percent capacity in under six minutes. The technology involves a unique electrochemical process, which is reported today (April 27) in Nature Energy by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Fujian University of Technology. The development builds on prior work described earlier this year by researchers at Tsinghua University, who also showed how nanoscale graphite particles power high performance batteries for short periods without degradation over thousands of cycles. But because they were limited to less than 10 percentage points, their potential was not as great as the new system that has reached 60 percent capacities after just a few seconds. [Gallery: Fast Charging Batteries] ""This represents a big step forward,"" said researcher Jianliang Xiao, lead author of the study published in nature energy, ""as it demonstrates a very efficient way to recharge without any loss of power."" His team's results show that when used with commercially available electrodes, it should be possible to achieve full recharging within five or fewer minutes, he added. Lithium storage devices such as cells are currently built using porous carbon materials called supercapacitors; these store energy chemically but do so slowly, meaning that people must wait hours or even days before they can use them again. Supercapacitor tanks offer far greater power density - that is, more energy stored per unit volume - compared to traditional capacitors, and because they don't degrade with time like other chemical systems, they could change our idea about what constitutes a small portable device. This research shows that if we want devices that provide longer lasting power on demand, then we need to harness both chemistry and physics, Xiao told LiveScience. How it works Xiao's group first needed to build enough room inside the cell to accommodate huge amounts of current, explained Li Dongdong, deputy director of Professor Zhang Gaoli's Center for Novel Materials and Devices of the Key Laboratory of Functional Inorganic Nanomaterials and Related Applications Underlying Mechanism of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. To avoid overheating, conventional liquid electrolytes cannot flow through narrow spaces between electrodes, but graphene sheets make excellent channels because there is no resistance across micrometer gaps. These flexible sheets would allow us to pack many times more conductive carbon atoms into one square inch of space compared with the cylindrical fibers found in existing commercial cathode materials, Wang Minhui, another member of Gaoli's team working on the project, previously told LiveScience. In experiments designed to understand why higher temperatures led to better performance, his team discovered that increasing temperature caused electrostatic repulsion among negatively charged ions inside the electrode pores. That made the nanopores smaller, reducing the distance between positive and negative charges, boosting electric currents flowing around the electrode surface. With this knowledge as background information, Xiao co put together two different types of highly ordered mesoporous carbons known as MCM-41 and SBA15. Both already had been shown to enable rapid ion diffusion. But only MSC composite demonstrated stable electrical properties after cycling hundreds of times, while SBC material degraded quickly upon repeated discharges. So Xiao decided to see whether combining the two kinds of carbon would result in even faster charging times. Indeed, his team now reports that electrons travel twice as fast along the MCS interface compared with SC alone. Combining the two compounds produced 3000 increase in peak power density, Xinxin Liu, one of the authors of the paper, noted on her personal blog. Realizing the importance of nanoarchitecture, Zhu Xiaoping and colleagues assemble three-dimensional graphene frameworks into a hierarchically organized double layer structure. Pressurized against Ni foam substrates, these composites produce large specific areas and high volumetric capacitances independent of the pore size and geometry of the underlying substrate, offering a major advance toward practical applications. Cellulose films (a green renewable feedstock) coated with these scaffolds yield impressive performances due to their high geometric area provided by a hierarchical architecture based on polymeric networks, reinforced by aligned 3D framework structures. Graphene has recently received much attention due to its extraordinary physical and mechanical properties. However, until now, synthesis methods have offered little control over the final morphologies imparted to graphene resulting in nonuniform samples containing domains with varying sizes and shapes. Here, Zhiyuan Gao et al., from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, demonstrate fabrication techniques to synthesize submicron-sized GO flakes supported by well-aligned CeO2 nanoparticles acting as electron conducting supports. They find that the ability of CeGO hybrids to efficiently transfer photogenerated holes in organic dye sensitized solar cells depends strongly on partial reduction of GO during their fabrication, mediated by oxidized oxygen functionalities present on the outermost layers of reduced GO flake surfaces. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the researchers model the effect of physicochemical interactions on thin layered flocks where they plan to maintaination rates as a but will open conditions that value.

GitHub takes zero fees, and the revenue comes directly back to you if your program gets funded or not. Fees are set by companies that wish to sponsor projects on behalf of their productsservices. For example with Microsoft's Developer Division Sponsor fee structure (see below) they can select which language (s), region (s), etc., as well as how much money per month they want to spend supporting open source development for selected programming languages through sponsored programs. In exchange for sponsoring these types of efforts, corporations provide an array of benefits including visibility within the community via marketing tools like blog posts, social media campaigns, speaking engagements at events, webinars and more. This can also be leveraged into support for employee learning team building opportunities such as hackathons or company-wide technical challenges where employees use open source code to complete tasks together; all while receiving professional training in coding best practices along the process! If this sounds interesting please read my article about it here: In addition to providing sponsorship options, another benefit offered under Program Manager roles involves getting access to certain project management resources so as to better manage any grant proposals submitted. This includes timely delivery reports, status updates during review periods, being able to track what's happening across multiple repositories owned by individual contributors against metrics provided by organizations themselves besides just tracking changes over time associated with particular releases and branches, usage data around packages used throughout various applications sold commercially by said organization beyond just its own software licenses, bug reporting systems vs. issue tracker integration scenarios using JIRA Github Issues integrations versus Jenkins Pull Requests Integrations, and other common ones found in Open Source Software communities today. All things considered I would say many people do indeed find value in having someone else help them navigate the administrative aspects involved when dealing with grants because let's face it... No one really wants to learn new skills unless absolutely necessary especially given most companies tend to pay very little attention towards helping out their full stack engineers master technologies outside of what they're already doing day after day anyway.;)",opt_30b,2.121212121212121,1.0,1.7076923076923076,1.734375,1.631578947368421,1.5405301425025282,0.8244098447904554,1.4864099762134093,1.0412549502207986,1.8701298701298699,2.7238235947151925,1.1539108494533221,1.038950410531638,1.152918069584736,0.8327588986418173,1.1363636363636362,2.2610522126014097,2.0172413793103448,2.2330233102005526,0.09090909090909091,0.2874797872880344,2.558441558441558,4.116502142174589,-0.15009939278071666,0.8375088041792168,2.0762174658811245,2.923434909656256,1.633689839572193,2.459519251391193,-0.31818181818181823,-0.2606871845220867,0.07272727272727275,0.861730410777549,-0.6107954545454545,-0.29666867855596535,-0.27884801834537526,-0.12123917679900165,0.42613636363636354,0.4452614123076242,1.020979020979021,0.5976430399918091,1.1886697015680323,0.6123411945950576,0.7503607503607507,1.6087620806221754,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,1.1499191491521377,3.090909090909091,2.727272727272727,-0.6920923961392127,1.0944337675457891,0.10738849812356722,-2.0218061521932613,2.3198259281449536,2.137212990707684

They are being held under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act, 2006, which allows police to detain people for up to 14 days without charge. The police seized a small quantity of cocaine and a stun gun on the ferry. The two men were questioned by Kent Police as part of a joint investigation with detectives from the Metropolitan Police. The two men were identified from a video filmed on a London bus, in which they appear to discuss a stabbing. The video was apparently filmed on July 6, and was circulated on social media. The two were arrested on Saturday after police received several calls from the public. They are both believed to be from the London area. The video was shot by a woman who was on the bus. She was reportedly ""disgusted"" by the comments the two were making. The two men were reportedly talking about a stabbing, saying that it was all right to stab someone in the head and kill them. ""It makes me feel scared and anxious to know that people like this are free to walk around our streets,"" the woman said. The two men have not been named and their exact ages are not known. They were questioned by police under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act, but were not arrested for terrorism offenses. ""We have now released two men arrested in Dover under the Terrorism Act following the discovery of a small quantity of Class A drugs and a stun gun on board a ferry.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile. He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football. ""I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,"" he said. ""The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper. ""It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence."" He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better. ""You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march."" E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe. ""In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,"" he said. ""Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going. ""We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next."" But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale. ""The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,"" he said. ""We asked,'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question. ""We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums. ""Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football. ""Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up."" Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau. ""You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,"" he said. ""Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes. ""But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared.'We didn't need to know','they didn't know','it was nothing', and even if it was, then'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'."" ""I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through. ""Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves."" As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs. ""We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria."" ""I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone."" Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones. ""I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,"" he said. ""I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.""",human,6.143939393939394,6.333333333333333,7.707692307692308,7.765625,9.631578947368421,-0.975645686791184,-0.776547596574578,-1.1204758177028504,-0.8141320638877285,0.05252333491536143,0.5748147392236964,0.7168814911886087,0.7565231670480156,0.7089434395635945,0.6954283996792919,-0.17441860465116288,0.32805493828557647,0.3777064955894145,0.7259574880254797,0.023255813953488372,0.1507148999629735,-0.6744186046511628,0.1245920605171825,-0.10920852830224906,0.2910185560011499,0.30906003777400437,0.48516858078834196,-0.11559507523939797,0.869940880013112,0.82431289640592,1.1943591371406101,0.4744186046511629,0.9682418339275399,-0.08357558139534878,0.46690077341173125,0.03260946925500738,0.3932654230547681,-0.03052325581395354,1.4240198240755568,1.8211091234347043,1.2096670627102362,0.7176247779699096,0.6176809377289334,1.231450719822813,0.6175883566486169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.5636363636363635,4.181818181818182,0.20880804182339466,1.4418675520524902,0.22973862179461288,0.9982148919926894,-0.6560554615630322,-0.5923948556711679

His signing in 1960 was a statement of intent from Bill Shankly, who had just taken over as manager. Wallace made an immediate impact at Anfield with his hardworking, no-nonsense approach to the game. He quickly became a fan favourite and went on to play 316 times for the Reds, scoring 62 goals. His most famous moment came on October 4th, 1965 when he scored the club's first ever European goal in a 3-2 win against Anderlecht in the European Cup. Wallace was part of the team that won Liverpool's first two league titles under Shankly in 196364 and 196566. He also played in three FA Cup finals during his time at the club, winning one in 1965. His career ended in 1973 after 13 years with Liverpool, but by then Wallace had left an indelible mark on the club.",text-davinci-003,0.4393939393939394,0.5,0.6461538461538462,0.546875,0.42105263157894735,-0.8496949119078906,-0.6815754428172751,-0.6624819727644862,-0.6793800554807172,-0.14285714285714293,-0.48461513250990207,0.32380151387720774,-0.3211416434201201,0.0864197530864199,-0.47181728271311024,0.125,0.5312526156038254,0.14224137931034483,0.03634737957277717,0.0,0.0,-0.2857142857142858,-0.8021682889323973,0.33236294115730125,-0.15998882241989412,-0.5783429040196882,-0.36782087856405304,0.7647058823529413,-0.23231873608057918,-0.7954545454545455,0.0,0.050000000000000044,0.622256776214835,-0.07812499999999993,-0.5697280210225427,1.5993925623666883,0.741356785946077,0.18749999999999997,1.2407076040104958,0.3076923076923076,-0.49378024993051867,-0.32688416793120884,-0.20102130479565686,-0.26984126984126966,-0.6221252056612898,0.125,0.33071891388307384,0.0,0.0,0.2909090909090909,0.36363636363636365,0.14507882273709682,0.047948472645382594,0.031225698390859796,0.6830691926470082,-0.5387644137415516,-0.4128078306662234

Farm Urban was founded in 2014, growing salads, herbs and vegetables in two shipping containers on a vacant plot in the city's Baltic Triangle. It relocated to the historic Sugar House, a disused warehouse in the city's south docks, in March 2016. The company produces fresh salads and herbs for sale in local supermarkets and restaurants. The warehouse is 5,000 sq ft and contains a climate-controlled growing system. Brightly coloured LED lights hang over rows of pots containing plants, including pea shoots, basil and other herbs, all growing in a nutrient-rich solution fed via a tube. BBC North West Tonight visited the farm and spoke to Ben Raskin, director of the company. ""We grow in vertical stacked layers, so we have a tray system which we grow in. ""We water the plants by a drip irrigation system. We feed them with nutrients which are fed through the water. ""What you see here are LED lights, and we use the LEDs because we can control the spectrum. We can control what colour the plant sees. ""We're producing food which is fresh, we're producing food which is nutrient dense, we're producing food which has zero food miles. ""We grow food for people to eat within 10 miles. ""In the UK we import about 50 of our food, and that's with a population of 65 million. We will need 100 of our food by 2040. ""We need to look at new ways of producing food. ""What we're doing is just a small part of a whole food system, but we need to start changing the way we produce food.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mobile measurement firm RootMetrics conducted over 840,000 checks, ranking operators for reliability and speed of voice, data and text services. While EE dominated for speed, Three was a close second in terms of reliability during last year's six-month study. Vodafone said it could not ""take the results of this report seriously and neither should our customers."" Evidence suggested some tests were ""carried out in an inconsistent manner,"" it added in a statement. O2 ranked second in the speed index, but its reliability score was lower than that of EE or Three in the tests. Each operator was rated out of 100 in a range of categories - overall performance, call performance, mobile internet, text, network reliability and network speed. EE performed best across all categories, with Three second in terms of mobile internet, text services and network reliability. Source: RootMetrics O2 came second in the call performance and network speed categories. Vodafone was last in all categories other than network speed, where it beat Three. Average speeds for networks were not given because they ranged so vastly from area to area, RootMetrics said. Neither did the study offer details about network coverage and mobile hotspots, although consumers can look at individual network performance at street level via its coverage map. EE said the results showed it gave ""customers everywhere in the UK the best mobile experience,"" partly because of its investment in new 4G services, greater 3G capacity and upgrades to 2G networks. Three said the study was ""carried out prior to our launch of 4G at no extra cost, so is not up to speed with our current performance."" Rootmetric's tests saw data scientists cover a 23,000-mile area of the UK, including urban and rural locations, with 1,000 indoor tests. They used off-the-shelf Android devices, which had the testing software installed on them. Rootmetric's Bill Moore said the aim of the testing was to get as close to a consumer experience as possible, across a range of metrics. ""It is all very well to test speeds, but if you can't get on the network then the speed becomes irrelevant,"" he told the BBC. Futhermore, he said that while all networks faced the issue of dropped calls, it was a much bigger problem in the UK than in the US, where the firm has also been conducting tests. ""Networks here have a 2 failure rate compared to 0.5 in the US,"" he said. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum, said that EE's win in this particular study represented a return on huge recent investments in coverage. ""Clearly, EE scores very well and this reflects both their strategy of wanting to continue to be one step ahead with their network and the money they have put behind it,"" he said. ""While Vodafone doesn't score so well in comparison, they shouldn't be written off. ""They too have ambitious plans for network upgrades which are being delivered through'Project Spring'. However, for the rest of the industry to close the gap on EE in terms of network speeds and availability, it is not going to be without a struggle."" Mr Howett added that consumers may want more detailed information from future surveys. ""I suspect many will be looking for this specifically broken out for 4G network performance as they are being enticed to upgrade by their operators,"" he said. Communications regulator Ofcom is planning its own UK-wide mobile survey and will shortly publish quality of service information to help consumers compare the performance of mobile networks and to encourage providers to improve.",human,3.6742424242424243,3.6666666666666665,3.8461538461538463,4.0,4.578947368421052,-0.11549717256106896,0.3010288701397604,0.054172415546255424,0.5342770417779789,0.11791383219954653,0.0743024629584883,0.26863533003146106,0.37911186497167493,0.33847736625514396,0.5263789716890531,-0.12962962962962954,0.20726398885165495,0.5727969348659002,0.6322620798388984,0.0,0.0,0.5714285714285713,0.6942546943814083,-0.33593673622350884,-0.4325311915196208,-0.10937927262783724,0.17165188687050856,0.41067538126361675,0.12680821847923213,-0.08249158249158237,0.39731836896912004,0.28148148148148144,1.2250047799703585,-0.08680555555555552,0.6923880016151498,0.30186404525642213,0.38254084328536614,0.2847222222222221,1.279016345367886,0.22222222222222215,0.746851687758464,0.23245096386219297,0.30796440003437275,0.7713109935332159,0.015759856497881464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.8,2.5454545454545454,0.3612033756375342,0.9248084991724762,0.2439972981999221,-0.047166698071268214,0.09110153122180163,0.04733586290759261

But Mr Andreyev's interpretation of history brought relations to a new low. He told reporters his remarks had not been ""sufficiently precise."" The ambassador was speaking outside the Polish foreign ministry, after he was summoned over his comments on Polish TV channel TVN24 on Friday. However, his comments to Russian media later made clear that there was unlikely to be any immediate improvement in relations. ""I am not retracting my remarks, I am simply making a clarification because they were misinterpreted,"" he said, adamant that he was referring not to the start of the war but to the catastrophe in Poland. There had been no discussion about his possible expulsion from Poland, he added. A Polish official said that during the meeting it was noted that the envoy's remarks had been ""untrue and contrary to the findings of Polish and Russian historians."" He said the Russian parliament itself had in 2010 directly blamed Soviet dictator Josef Stalin for ordering the 1940 massacre of 20,000 Polish prisoners of war at Katyn. Mr Andreyev had argued that Poland was partly responsible for what happened in September 1939, because ""during the 1930s Poland repeatedly blocked the formation of a coalition against Hitler's Germany."" The war erupted in September 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland from the west, little over a week after the USSR and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Soviet forces entered Poland from the east that same month, as part of the secret agreement. Mr Andreyev had also suggested that the Soviet invasion was ""to ensure the safety of the USSR"" and was not an aggressive act. Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz pointed out at the weekend that ""even children in Poland know that neither Ribbentrop nor Molotov was Polish,"" condemning the Nazi-Soviet carve-up of her country. The ambassador's interview on Friday was broadcast hours after Poland's ambassador to Moscow, Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz, was herself summoned to the Russian foreign ministry because the graves of 57 Soviet soldiers were vandalised at a cemetery in Milejczyce in north-eastern Poland. The vandalism was strongly condemned by the Polish government. Russia is also angry that Polish officials this month removed a brass relief of a wartime Soviet general, Ivan Chernyakhovsky, from a monument in northern Poland.",human,2.1742424242424243,2.0,2.169230769230769,2.21875,2.210526315789474,0.43011007414958574,0.5030814050856823,0.4482403505359319,0.2778566293441933,0.2673069227691076,0.4233659690452443,0.2895166477019739,0.4285620160106453,0.3113652868554829,0.5443456795630355,0.7352941176470589,0.6193622778888312,0.25253549695740357,0.25392886882938626,0.0,0.0,-0.10924369747899158,-0.08452396990697114,0.4502981783421501,0.8343853915030506,-0.411137383583458,-0.19409848325955478,0.4723183391003461,0.51191893649727,0.46042780748663104,0.49413293819160414,-0.14117647058823524,0.6223801060192312,0.6525735294117647,0.6347960713029744,-0.07389081942709379,0.2783597426317081,0.12132352941176476,0.6589820285202098,0.06334841628959273,0.7112058726474453,0.8614359249010681,0.5150870048652542,0.40336134453781525,0.39873763599740847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6181818181818182,1.4545454545454546,0.18880168078570927,0.8635195173412112,-0.032093078901716685,-0.4512150595337841,0.44217624536781613,0.38435316955479754

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"El Salvador may become the world's first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The country recently partnered with digital wallet company Strike to build modern financial infrastructure using bitcoin technology, and this move could potentially bring many benefits to the country's economy. Some of the benefits of adopting bitcoin as legal tender include reducing transaction costs, enabling financial inclusion for the unbanked population, and providing a secure and transparent payment system. However, this move also comes with some risks and challenges, such as the volatility of the bitcoin market and the potential for illegal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. It's important for the government to carefully manage these risks and educate the public on the proper use of bitcoin as legal tender. As an assistant, I would suggest keeping a close eye on how this experiment plays out and learning from the successes and failures of El Salvador's implementation of bitcoin as legal tender.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.44696969696969696,0.16666666666666666,0.4307692307692308,0.328125,0.10526315789473684,0.8616976794969442,0.6754686798708,1.2535471156289812,0.6016683221999332,0.7755102040816324,-0.14162531107103626,0.690776562938043,0.04056085870007934,0.3672839506172842,0.1688042832820588,2.3333333333333335,0.08733875454383165,0.5172413793103448,0.3098257338129151,0.0,0.0,1.2142857142857142,0.353697645260084,-0.5718072105932064,-0.4881364003756029,0.19688269073010653,0.19183363278509027,0.8921568627450981,0.6846566274085878,-0.9121212121212122,-0.578854372591137,1.8,1.4524484631704595,1.4062500000000002,0.36154322585918813,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.5624999999999999,0.8386186997241288,-0.6153846153846154,-0.49378024993051867,0.0,0.0,-0.38095238095238076,-0.3838873035272961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34545454545454546,0.45454545454545453,0.19476513341780638,0.1767768067823873,0.17614083817386947,-1.3618440778223742,1.3194905495487246,1.3585140612627582

The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they added. The adware, which was pre-installed on some Lenovo laptops, was injecting ads into webpages by intercepting traffic between users and websites. This could make it easier for hackers to capture people's personal information, the experts said. Superfish also came with a root certificate that allowed it to read all encrypted traffic passing through the laptop. This meant it could potentially be used to spy on its user. Lenovo has since removed Superfish from its systems and released an automated tool to remove it.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Once Kyle Abbott dismissed Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for 59 in the third over of the day in Port Elizabeth, the tone was set. Abbott (2-38), Kagiso Rabada (3-77) and Imran Tahir (4-58) made life uncomfortable for the visitors and kept them under pressure throughout the 85.3 overs they batted. After a rain delay of 10 minutes, Rabada and Abbott were on target. Rabada was rewarded with the wicket of Kusal Mendis, who edged a short-pitched delivery to AB de Villiers at gully. It was the first time that Mendis had fallen in a Test in South Africa in five innings. He was the first of seven wickets to fall for 56 runs, which set the tone for the rest of the day. De Villiers took another catch at gully to dismiss Niroshan Dickwella for 20. His dismissal was the third in quick succession as Sri Lanka lost three wickets for 14 runs. Tahir struck two blows in his first over, dismissing Upul Tharanga (36) and Dhananjaya de Silva (2) in the space of three deliveries. Tahir's first wicket was a result of a poor shot selection by Tharanga. The batsman, who was on 36, attempted a sweep shot to a full delivery which was also outside leg stump, but only succeeded in gloving a catch to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. It was a poor shot from a senior batsman, considering that Sri Lanka was reeling from the loss of three wickets in quick succession. Mathews and Dickwella showed some fight with a partnership of 56 runs before the captain's departure. Tahir struck again when he dismissed Dinesh Chandimal (4) and Lahiru Kumara (0) in the space of two deliveries. Tahir, who is the leading wicket-taker in the series (13 wickets in two Tests), completed his fourth five-wicket haul when he dismissed Rangana Herath for a duck in the final session of play. The right-arm leg-spinner took a total of 5-58 in 18.3 overs. Sri Lanka lost their last six wickets for 36 runs to be bowled out for 205 in 59.1 overs. The Proteas reached 17 without loss in the three overs before the close of play. In the first session of play, South Africa struck twice, courtesy of a superb catch by De Kock and a brilliant direct hit from de Villiers. Kusal Perera (2) had a lucky escape on 12 when he was dropped by de Kock off a delivery from Rabada. De Kock was also responsible for the dismissal of Perera, when he took a low catch, also off Rabada, in the fourth over of the day. Perera scored 16, before he was dismissed with the total on 45. South Africa struck again when de Villiers ran out Mathews with a brilliant direct hit from long-on. Mathews had scored 59 off 89 deliveries. He was the only batsman to put up some resistance. The third Test match is in Johannesburg, starting on 12 January.",llama_65B,2.772727272727273,3.5,2.830769230769231,2.890625,3.3684210526315788,-0.8442381024605443,-0.5533915135724143,-0.7684034015885811,-0.7734511339306582,-0.39141810570381996,0.04115797143320366,-0.2789674581095943,-0.0749908051559635,-0.257597340930674,0.03946028689564033,-0.34615384615384626,0.03416451695831439,-0.29045092838196274,0.09079280479582413,0.0,0.0,-0.4505494505494506,-0.11223542346772016,0.41401041305450426,0.20371471175193773,-0.7307376790559728,-0.37881894977453673,0.5294117647058826,-0.06747042903873293,-0.7685314685314685,-0.30772600645350645,-0.5846153846153845,0.12212525554867266,0.19230769230769226,0.2742453862982389,1.5302934105679167,1.1536529355708307,-0.5336538461538461,-0.14954839506863252,-0.33136094674556216,-0.09882460822606746,-0.040231897591533346,-0.0140973063821694,0.2002442002442003,0.8279382387691293,0.15384615384615385,0.6007884366082041,0.07692307692307693,0.26646935501059654,0.8,2.3636363636363638,0.6656422263652992,0.5642945789257668,0.7715683251963686,0.8789009945772602,-0.7973289055368835,-0.8939784907369567

In a blog post, YouTube said it was ""committed to ensuring that the music industry - from artists and songwriters to labels and publishers - earn more as a result of the growth of online music."" It insisted that its ""responsibility is to the wider ecosystem,"" including users of its services. YouTube said that in the last 12 months the music industry had made more money from the service than ever before, with viewers watching videos with music in them for a total of 25 billion hours. But it added that this represented less than a quarter of the time people spend listening to music online. The company said that ""this is not the way to solve the industry's problems."" YouTube and other tech firms have come under criticism from musicians and the music industry for not compensating them fairly. Major labels have argued that the value of their music to YouTube is being underestimated, while independent labels have complained about being excluded from negotiations about YouTube's new paid-for service, YouTube Music Key. YouTube's blog post followed a panel event in which it discussed its plans with artists. The event, described by one participant as ""fruitless,"" was held a day after YouTube had held a press briefing on the same subject. One of the panelists, Zoella, was later criticised by the music industry for being an ""unlikely representative"" of musicians' interests. YouTube responded by saying: ""We will continue to have conversations with the industry to ensure that we both understand each other's perspectives."" The blog post did not address any of the issues raised by musicians at the event or the wider complaints made by the music industry. Last week, the head of the music industry's global representative body criticised the ""damaging misconceptions"" about how the streaming industry works. Writing in the Financial Times, Frances Moore, the chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said: ""The unfounded and unproductive perception that the music industry is resistant to change has become tiresome.""",llama_65B,2.0681818181818183,1.8333333333333333,2.169230769230769,2.21875,2.789473684210526,0.44688872311797734,0.911846226456673,0.5666889545787902,0.883742577543546,0.3418367346938774,0.059647482541967646,0.4695121951219512,-0.027790351526115278,0.4915123456790124,0.07019870036744345,0.0625,0.4177948231211842,-0.514008620689655,-0.10206248817910814,0.0,0.0,0.732142857142857,0.18420054490921736,-0.2867970540631551,0.3234967232718339,0.23995077932731737,0.0577985161144432,0.573529411764706,0.7970025133169725,-0.00795454545454537,0.5312976421670375,0.050000000000000044,0.8910556013471553,0.8007812500000001,0.9371756518488723,-0.1223279699527033,0.2842705639686566,0.46874999999999994,1.235357120636965,0.13461538461538453,0.2205916372059212,0.6537683358624178,0.12518674897380389,1.1190476190476193,0.8356339764337377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3818181818181818,0.9090909090909091,0.33626108175733527,0.8214037881397025,-0.29774895458174405,-0.5850632053506252,0.5710432971968981,0.7269543559949234

Titan has long been considered one of the most intriguing places for scientists to study in our solar system due to its dense and complex atmosphere, which is primarily composed of nitrogen and methane. The discovery of cyclopropenylidene is significant because it is a building block of life and could offer clues about how life could develop in such an environment. Additionally, the fact that the molecule is present in such a harsh environment could have implications for the search for life on other planets and moons in our solar system and beyond.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Apple has been criticized for placing its own apps at the top of the App Store search results. While Apple denies the accusations, an analysis of search terms showed that Apple's App Store has come under renewed scrutiny over the way it ranks apps for users. The company has come under fire for allegedly manipulating search results so that its own apps show up more frequently. Analysts at the New York University's Stern School of Business analyzed data from the store for the period between September 2010 and May 2014 to determine whether Apple was indeed using its own apps more frequently than others. The group found that apps from Apple's ""tied developers"" occupied 19 of the top 20 spots in search results for certain popular terms, while apps from competitors occupied just 6 of the top spots. In some cases, Apple-tied apps were ranked above non-Apple-tied apps by more than double. For example, iMovie was ranked above Adobe's Creative Suite by nearly 50 of the time. Google's Android Market, which has more than 500 million apps, ranks Apple's apps more heavily than those of its competitors. The New York Times points out that Apple has been accused of manipulating search results before.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Most object detectors enumerate a large list of potential object locations and then classify each item, which is a large waste of resources as well as an inefficient approach. Objects are often found in specific areas of an image and searching the entire image for potential object locations is unnecessary. To address this problem, some object detectors use region-based methods, where a few potential object locations, called regions of interest (RoIs), are proposed, and each of these RoIs is classified separately. This approach saves both time and resources, as it only requires a limited number of RoIs to be classified rather than searching the entire image. These object detectors often use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to make their predictions, which is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly good at handling image data.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.2727272727272727,0.0,0.2,0.203125,0.21052631578947367,0.5743211371683635,0.6527656887107108,0.8764306369811854,0.5523422030954053,0.8707482993197275,-0.5428596267840126,0.5698906644238855,-0.7187579874203586,0.5401234567901235,-0.6931849352240955,1.9,0.2599856216039513,1.7172413793103447,0.18960239935652323,0.0,0.0,1.1714285714285715,-0.26540927955144455,-0.49318371913664055,-0.49019408708610723,0.47251845775225576,0.2865467685837936,-0.07647058823529419,-0.9067804000208158,0.3945454545454548,-0.5489313778978989,0.40000000000000013,-0.31752566442654906,1.2812500000000002,-0.06360446328962716,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.037500000000000026,-0.026767332592180663,0.030769230769230656,0.07538777048662969,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,1.0412698412698416,1.8710031210114724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.03636363636363636,0.45454545454545453,0.46661046584986937,-0.2343114844195941,0.5842631203133626,-1.0748766157454586,1.1711953285271817,1.1113236836793121

The lens has a tiny display that projects information onto the user's field of vision. It's not a screen, however, as the display appears to be projected into thin air. Users can interact with the display by focusing their eyes on different parts of it. For example, a user might look at the top of the display to see the current time or the weather. The lens is powered by a rechargeable battery that sits on the user's finger. It's also outfitted with a microphone and motion sensors. Mojo Vision says the display has a resolution of 14,000 pixels per inch, which the company claims is ""better than 2020 vision."" The startup said it's working to improve the resolution to 28,000 pixels per inch. Although the lens is meant to be worn every day, Mojo Vision said it's working to reduce the thickness of the contact so that it's less noticeable. The startup said it has partnered with Flex, a company that designs and manufactures wearable products, to create the lens. Mojo Vision also said it has partnered with VSP Global, an insurer and eye-care provider, to make its lens compatible with standard contact-lens fitting and prescription processes. The company did not provide a timeline for when the lens would be available for consumers.",llama_65B,1.5606060606060606,2.0,1.7076923076923076,1.671875,1.631578947368421,-0.31597063140574183,0.15073426996887548,0.10235833057383593,0.04027227625735746,-0.380952380952381,-0.3464899505885931,-0.16761490130114268,-0.4124717631625472,-0.22240377632534483,-0.44361980063985545,-0.4411764705882353,-0.46929083203388433,-0.6298174442190668,-0.38210172071956044,0.0,0.0,0.11764705882352937,-0.2905100947176878,-0.5486826542824518,-0.29910441749803374,-0.12739468223712797,-0.0611497392772794,-0.3373702422145331,-0.4261750167478484,0.29572192513368983,0.3341869794867954,-0.3764705882352941,0.31715939431135814,0.6525735294117647,0.0252637356864286,-0.21479889368341232,0.04826743096026585,0.12132352941176476,0.4385566496772262,0.009049773755656075,-0.24954795872630775,0.03076556874646678,0.4158516963837974,-0.27637721755368794,0.2668939176746488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4727272727272727,1.1818181818181819,0.7870752049854559,0.37062898567706337,0.5014535173543341,0.11987223114449087,-0.2734104351005453,-0.363610913566057

The men have since been released, but their testimonies have sparked outrage among activists and human rights advocates, who say the confessions are a result of torture. The police have denied any wrongdoing and said the men confessed willingly. However, some of the men reportedly told their families they were beaten in custody. The incident is part of a larger pattern of police brutality in the region. Last year, Human Rights Watch documented numerous cases in which police detained people without warrants and subjected them to beatings, threats, and humiliation. In some cases, detainees were held for months without charges or access to legal assistance. Activists are calling on authorities to take action against those responsible for the torture and mistreatment of the Muslim men, as well as to investigate all allegations of abuse by police officers. They also urge that the government ensure that procedures are in place to protect individuals from such abuses.",text-davinci-003,0.6439393939393939,0.8333333333333334,0.7230769230769231,0.75,0.2631578947368421,0.4177218489729222,0.33979032218313104,0.4600206104411039,0.5070432184587267,-0.3129251700680272,-0.015341175585409294,-0.1295206055508831,0.05447894509604742,-0.10802469135802452,-0.015843186084627366,-0.5,-0.4777813848565912,0.06724137931034478,0.24726416769769402,0.0,0.0,0.4857142857142855,0.28295811620806716,-0.8234023832542172,-0.48649535450418613,-0.3543888433141919,-0.19550011390614935,0.22941176470588226,0.4145421862029699,0.11454545454545452,0.46016348640049265,0.19999999999999996,0.8923263955467551,-0.03124999999999989,0.09098237986733988,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.4875,0.3717848136299612,-0.061538461538461514,0.032210130288144886,0.1046029337379869,0.2742291664862987,-0.4698412698412697,-0.24457717760421613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38181818181818183,0.9090909090909091,0.2659448916853298,0.14408790879747396,0.588667644275037,-0.21856953894000603,-0.008002241450709567,-0.02508461997452911

The strongest winds are expected to be along the coast, particularly the southwest coast. Road users are being urged to take extra care and allow extra time for journeys. It is expected that snow will start to melt today as temperatures rise above freezing. The weather will be wet and windy later on, with gusts of up to 50mph expected. The snow is expected to disappear, but there is a risk of flooding in places. It's going to be wet and windy in the South East today. The wet weather will bring a risk of local flooding and travel disruption from surface water and spray. It will turn windy later today, with gusts of up to 50mph along the coast. Melting snow could lead to localised flooding, especially on roads and in low-lying areas. Wet and windy weather will be followed by a frosty night. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for heavy rain across the UK. Flood alerts are in place in the South East, warning of the possibility of flooding to low-lying land and roads from surface water and small rivers. Areas at risk include the River Cuckmere at Exceat and the River Rother at Rotherbridge. The River Rother at Rotherbridge is currently at an alert level and is continuing to rise slowly, with flooding to low lying land and roads expected.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with PredPol for a number of years. The software analyzes data such as crime reports, weather, and local events to produce a ""heat map"" of the areas in a city where crime is most likely to occur. Police officers can then use this information to target their patrols and increase their presence in high-risk areas. While some police departments have reported success with PredPol in reducing crime rates, others have raised concerns about the potential for the software to perpetuate bias and lead to over-policing of certain communities. Critics argue that the algorithm reinforces the targeting of certain neighborhoods based on past crime data, which may not accurately reflect current conditions or individual behavior. Additionally, there have been concerns raised about the transparency of the algorithm and the potential for errors or bias in the data that it uses. Overall, the use of PredPol remains controversial, and many experts agree that it should be used in conjunction with other methods of community policing and crime prevention.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.7348484848484849,0.5,0.7230769230769231,0.796875,0.2631578947368421,0.4462181529618806,0.6672157276085574,0.6562762146929183,0.6286871010601872,0.5204081632653059,-0.207085750964258,0.4857022708158116,-0.263464078559335,0.6049382716049383,-0.23178647035760327,0.25,0.3887280389380696,0.14224137931034483,-0.36652782880712237,0.0,0.0,1.2678571428571426,0.3865516280663416,-0.6111189563214894,-0.6448316045428788,0.19688269073010653,-0.14840048395519806,0.6691176470588236,0.4221328716876535,0.2545454545454547,-0.5325859153064354,0.8,0.6576171830350245,0.6250000000000001,0.15616554253060996,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.37499999999999994,0.743569368419995,-0.15384615384615388,0.09935531442256486,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,-0.04761904761904745,0.05725907926654653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.6363636363636364,0.3857816186215425,0.1539733970884464,0.2235271701683139,-0.7374449772577716,0.764791004491528,0.742534903906421

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans ""wrong"" information, including disputed international borders. The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law. The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography. Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (PS10.4m). It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it. It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India ""which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity"" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India. The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering ""value added"" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber. It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months. There is an exemption for government agencies and departments. Google already offers slightly altered versions of its maps inside India, eliminating the Line of Control that divides Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and locating the whole disputed region within India's borders. Both Google and Uber declined to comment. The laws extend beyond large international companies. Anyone creating, distributing, or owning unsanctioned maps must apply to a government agency for a licence, and submit the material for inspection. The geospatial data will then be considered by a security vetting committee, which will decide if the applicant is granted a licence. Once the material is cleared, it must be watermarked with the insignia of the vetting authority. ""It's only a draft proposal before the country,"" the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said in a tweet. ""I would appeal not to pass hasty judgment, but put up your suggestions."" Speaking to the Economic Times, he said: ""It is a general concern being raised that India as a responsible country must have provisions to secure its boundary and territory. ""That is why the bill is necessary. ""It is not a question of sending a message to any firm or company - but it is a question of addressing our own security concern."" In a country where the number of people owning a mobile phone is rocketing, providing online maps is a big and growing business. If this bill goes through, no-one, from Google to the smallest business, will be able to run their map services in India without a licence. The government will control how anyone uses online maps. When I want to book a cab using a taxi app service, I'm sharing my location with the service to find a cab. The driver uses a map to navigate. When I take a picture and upload it with metadata, I'm creating mapping information that would require a licence. A growing protest online, with the hashtag ""savethemap,"" claims the bill won't just hurt individuals, but also small businesses. Campaigner Sumandro Chattapadhyay says companies such as Uber and Google will survive by getting all their maps vetted by the government. ""But smaller companies have no means to know what kind of geospatial information they can store and what they cannot,"" she says. ""Moreover, if a start-up requires three months to get approvals for your data before you can use it, it'll be as good as dead."" The bill also bans the publication of such material outside the country, and is designed to apply to citizens of India living and working in other countries, explicitly stating offenders outside India will be subject to the same penalties. ""This act needs to be dropped,"" said managing editor Arup Dasgupta, in a post on Geospatial World magazine's website. ""This act does not, in fact cannot, even begin to comprehend the paradigm shift in geospatial technologies which makes it a non-starter. ""India does need a geospatial information act, but it has to be an enabling and encouraging act that makes for faster and better implementation of programmes, not a regressive and punitive act as the proposed one,"" he said. The bill is still in the draft stage, and government is inviting submissions on it until 4 June.",human,4.984848484848484,5.333333333333333,5.1692307692307695,5.234375,6.105263157894737,-0.041208840940122275,0.6277405546592391,0.2691982017613029,0.27954824395377303,-0.04265489979775686,0.42259179591692236,0.09801559338985763,0.4756310562629258,0.10568902235568922,0.5657060546430384,-0.06756756756756754,0.3974087271993392,-0.17194780987884425,0.204462131541153,0.0,0.0,0.09652509652509648,0.26874902741582996,-0.3656861654232905,0.21317960252367066,0.3644990355408731,0.4821449372638524,-0.3410174880763117,0.16462603962097414,0.23562653562653563,0.2817409587555049,0.42162162162162176,1.4416287506210044,0.3842905405405408,0.4828088173045011,-0.3347611731178456,-0.16772446791697174,0.3192567567567567,1.0220609200854929,0.295218295218295,0.6047588775842161,0.028271063172428935,0.08514960404103797,0.7241527241527245,0.619569900956729,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.16216216216216217,2.7454545454545456,3.6363636363636362,0.24413831680043457,1.2107468925980913,0.3032767225942954,-0.1663137584191923,0.09193234580127396,0.05959184760667809

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy a bigger house It was the largest divorce settlement in history. In January this year, Shanghai couple Zhang Jun and Sun Shuai gave up their seven-year marriage after furious jostling over ""joint assets"" they had intended to share with equal shares; instead, Mr Zhang took home 60 per cent of what he was due by law, while his wife got 40 per cent plus interest accumulated during the seven years of cohabitation. The couple separated shortly afterwards but have since teamed again under another name - together they bought an apartment valued at 1 million. It seems that both men and women can find ways around Chinese divorce laws if they really want to get divorced without losing out financially. As we reported earlier this month, according to government figures from 2011, more than 20,000 people went on record as having given up their marriages because of money issues (China Daily). Some of them paid hefty sums to speed things along. A judge who married off 35 couples in 2015 spent 157,000 (113,700) buying 70 iPhone apps, including Tinder, Meet Me, Geico Insurance Car Rental and UberEats - all designed to help people fall pregnant quickly. And then there were five state agents dispatched across north-eastern China who used police tactics to impersonate divorce lawyers and threaten clients into signing contracts agreeing to cash settlements ranging from 1m yuan to 2.2m yuan (190,900-380,300), or 50 per cent to 80 per cent of marital wealth respectively. Even though these weren't real lawyers, it worked like magic, according to one lawyer involved in the research whose findings appeared in Caixin magazine. He said the scheme made him feel ashamed. But no sooner did the article run online when consumers began complaining about how cheap the schemes were compared with real legal fees, which start at 5,500 yuan. One man complained that his 752,000 yuan deal came close to breaking even, adding only 120,000 yuan to his capital gains. Other media reports say dodgy agents may be selling the services of ""fake expert witnesses,"" calling themselves experts using papers signed in front of cameras to make sure customers understand how much each party will receive. Shanghai residents Frank Wu and Ling Shi ask whether you should trust any agency offering such services, adding: ""We're afraid that our case could end up being decided against us."" As well as disguising themselves as lawyers, officials are also employing dubious techniques to win custody battles. In May 2016, a 56-year old woman named Qian Hongping wrote an appeal letter to her ex-husband, saying she wanted the courts to grant her full control of their three children. She accused her husband of ignoring child support payments, refusing to let the kids visit grandparents, and forbidding them from talking to friends. Her words left few doubters. But how exactly does propaganda triumph over fact? We caught up with Ms Qian to learn why she felt compelled to write her letter. Interviews with other prominent suspects revealed similar stories of abuse. Another version of the same story has been published recently involving a 71-year old man called Huang Chenggang who gained sole ownership of two flats worth 10m yuan and 13m yuan respectively through the use of forged documents - specifically certificates showing the properties belong solely to him. This time, however, the fraudsters didn't give up until they'd won complete control. Since going public, Mr Huang says he now lives alone in one flat, with his elderly mother in the second. He refuses to speak to reporters, but details of his case appear online, accompanied by photographs of the flat where his father died last week. Here, too, the main character appears unwell. His face shows signs of dementia and fingers are curled up involuntarily as if weakened by illness. When asked about family members' reactions, he replies: ""My parents don't talk to me."" At first glance, Mr Huang sounds just like a typical victim of a scammer. However, Mr Huang claims to know something most of us would prefer not to admit: That many families struggle to come to terms with reality. If anything, he blames himself for failing to communicate better with his parents. According to others interviewed, Mr Huang suffers from severe depression related to losing his beloved son two decades ago. Others suggest he probably lost touch with reality ever since. But regardless of whether Mr Huang knows the difference between right and wrong, the truth is clear: Many vulnerable citizens who say otherwise are actually victims of deception and manipulation. 4 July 2015 Overblown real estate boom On 16 June, the People's Bank of China announced its latest moves to manage runaway housing prices.

Rolls Royce worked with the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the National Health Service to develop the technology. It uses AI and machine learning to analyze a patient's speech patterns and habits, then translate those patterns into written and spoken words. The tool will be made available to patients through the NHS and MND Association. It will be available to anyone with a diagnosis of MND. People with the disease will be able to create their own speech profile and then use it to help them communicate. Dr. Susie Henley, Head of Healthcare Innovation at the MND Association, said, ""This breakthrough has the potential to transform the lives of people living with the disease who cannot move their arms or hands. It could mean they are able to communicate with their loved ones for the first time in many years.""",llama_65B,0.5,0.5,0.5076923076923077,0.5,0.3157894736842105,-0.19143238421871844,-0.11834495374087134,-0.20017623196938084,0.41639643120279124,-0.006802721088435469,0.018243372226440315,0.032380151387720775,-0.16170002680706086,-0.010802469135802314,-0.14780156569030692,-0.375,-0.09486249951610068,-0.04525862068965513,0.6196389541579388,0.0,0.0,-0.39285714285714296,0.3089185232562808,0.6861686527118478,1.1912504998001512,0.2830188679245282,0.7496883002364124,-0.3823529411764707,-0.23231873608057918,-0.09545454545454539,0.0,0.8,1.162224595336498,0.15625000000000008,0.4818214725859153,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.9374999999999999,0.8721627943624909,0.3076923076923076,0.2393756274825937,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.26984126984126966,0.3141612623717166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2909090909090909,0.8181818181818182,0.1764546984694774,0.028876042439595104,0.5967062639146609,0.22546519681033692,-0.1577879818633179,-0.29723845794039133

This data is then used to create a profile of the user and determine what products they may be interested in. The algorithm is designed to learn from user behavior over time, meaning that the more users interact with the platform, the better the recommendations become.

England's second tier, the Championship, spent PS42.4m on agents, an increase of 62. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record PS1.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43 increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent PS3,098,508, down from PS3,167,964, while League Two teams spent PS821,450, down from PS1,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' fees when the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from PS14.3m to PS13.8 for the 2016-17 period. Manchester City now top the Premier League list with PS26,3m, up from PS12.4m, followed by Chelsea, who have also more than doubled their spending on agents' fees, up from PS12m to PS25.1m. Manchester United (PS19m) and Arsenal (PS10.2m) complete the top five, while Tottenham's outlay has risen from PS6m to PS7.2m. Yet despite being considered part of the Premier League's'big six' clubs, Spurs trail behind West Ham (PS9.5m) and Bournemouth (PS7.4m) in agents' fees paid for 2016-17. Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for PS1m, why would there be another PS1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5, 10 or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy.",human,5.446969696969697,7.666666666666667,6.938461538461539,6.875,9.105263157894736,-1.1206957052037532,-0.5521164530460513,-0.9488813258441998,-0.7331838864504163,-0.6450580232092837,0.8931695589950919,-0.05587163376704741,0.8634978161877191,-0.09531590413943343,1.1053968180324742,-0.2058823529411764,0.09335526677750326,0.3995943204868153,0.9016153737554702,0.0,0.0,-0.7058823529411766,0.7576142613334947,-0.24343851098049013,1.3050639916771118,-0.3841142691695219,0.6814392174045995,-0.5472895040369089,0.6321953117295656,0.048663101604278274,0.9200960304222471,0.015686274509803866,0.8540408789628446,-0.5422794117647058,0.2896706276041383,0.27837936621370246,0.9522679330663906,-0.08455882352941178,1.2593480781689654,0.8778280542986424,0.8594516571142279,0.03076556874646678,0.21328680244779538,0.03734827264239055,1.429379815671209,0.11764705882352941,0.3781823827840375,0.0392156862745098,0.19410774385513072,2.418181818181818,3.272727272727273,0.4264602896766206,1.2037580360190392,0.22201517207507004,1.1414732003240344,-1.1040480261792673,-1.0106838335700286

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised. But, the results of a new study might influence the government to reconsider this limit, especially if it means it could help women conceive. The study was conducted by scientists from the Francis Crick Institute in London and was published in the journal Nature. The researchers were able to keep human embryos alive in the lab for up to 13 days, by using a new technique that involved feeding them. They took embryos that were a few days old and placed them in a specialized dish filled with a nutritious liquid that helped them develop. Using this technique, they were able to keep the embryos alive for up to 13 days, which is a huge jump from the previous record of nine days. This study provides a ton of new information about how embryos grow and how different parts develop. The researchers were able to discover that the cells that make up the placenta and the embryo itself are distinct before the two-week mark, which is something that was not previously known. This discovery could help scientists better understand what goes wrong in the development of embryos when women suffer from infertility or pregnancy loss. The researchers are hopeful that their findings could help scientists develop new fertility treatments that could help women who are struggling to conceive. The study might also have implications for stem cell research. Scientists can use stem cells to make other types of cells and tissues, which could help to treat a variety of medical conditions. However, at the moment stem cells can only be derived from embryos that are less than 14 days old, which limits their availability. But, the researchers from the Francis Crick Institute believe that by using their new technique, they can grow embryos in the lab for longer than 14 days without it having an impact on the embryos or the people that they could potentially become. This could be a great way for scientists to create more stem cells for use in the lab.",llama_65B,1.9772727272727273,1.6666666666666667,2.246153846153846,2.25,0.6842105263157895,-0.21866151592743613,-0.1289764025163236,-0.3409177645113066,-0.07879142813151066,0.44444444444444425,0.08500536968319089,0.7598542192318475,0.526995996903529,0.7302469135802467,0.4643542731765387,0.7666666666666666,0.7398501475266441,-0.28275862068965507,-0.03983879757309846,0.0,0.0,0.4857142857142855,-0.44142562871521757,-0.7133294952150251,-0.14938734058240025,0.4265791632485644,0.1736814711478663,0.22941176470588226,0.4145421862029699,1.0478787878787883,0.5698394456181923,0.0,0.3524855343016653,0.7187500000000001,0.827898848080259,0.062320319020680734,0.12541376654028952,0.2625,0.8814637517191042,0.8307692307692308,0.8242533304236699,0.41841173495194733,0.34350110610492707,-0.5587301587301585,-0.28210592835706866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8181818181818182,0.45454545454545453,0.6688247685337483,0.5858149866306598,-0.4719919527238266,0.15857073263804408,0.11439351261389996,0.20262913666105734

Jeffrey Taylor, who represents one plaintiff suing under seal, called Mr Schmidt's statement false and irresponsible.""Mr Schmidt has publicly stated many times over at least the past decade or more that there is no discrimination whatsoever at Google based upon race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc.,"" Mr Taylor said in a phone interview Friday. ""He knows better than that now.""Alphabet spokeswoman Susan Molinari declined to comment. A San Diego judge called for prosecutors Monday to consider charging Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling with attempted extortion after finding the basketball power broker guilty of threatening legal action against those who leaked a recording containing racist comments.In her 16-page decision, City Attorney Jan Goldsmith found Sterling threatened potential witnesses who might testify against him during recorded conversations released March 13 through NBA investigators probing abuse of management positions held by African Americans.Sterling, 80, faces up to three months behind bars when sentenced June 12 for making criminal threats, but Judge Malcolm H. Mackey ordered him temporarily freed until then so he can continue receiving cancer treatment and mental health care while awaiting trial. Former U2 lead vocalist Bono says former President Barack Obama took a big step forward regarding gay rights.Bono spoke recently about Obama during an appearance Tuesday night on CBS This Morning: Late Show With David Letterman, saying people thought the president didn't like gays because of his conservative advisers.""No, I don't believe that at all. No,"" he said. ""My sense [of] what you saw...was Obama being, 'Well, we're going to get out of Iraq... we'll remember this vote.Obama famously voted against repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell military policy in 2010, later signing legislation allowing openly LGBT service members to serve. But later drafts included wording that explicitly excluded protections for same-sex relationships, prompting some critics to accuse the administration of secretly supporting gay marriage.""The president did something very important, which was move us beyond DADT and onto DOMA repeal, and then within days of taking office to say, 'Yes, we will recognize your marriages, Bono said.BONO SLAMS TRUMP'S ARRESTED AGENDAAt the end of January, Trump signed an executive order calling for sweeping changes in federal government agencies, including hiring freeze, workforce reductions, and suspension of discretionary spending. In doing so, he indicated - without actually spelling out how - that any new hires needed to be approved in advance by White House officials. And that meant civil servants could lose their jobs.Among others, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was forced to resign Feb. 10 amid reports he'd been considering whether to recommend removing funding for sanctuary cities - places where local police departments refuse cooperation with immigration agents seeking to detain undocumented immigrants wanted only for minor offenses.""This is a secretary who ran not just our Department of Veterans Affairs, where hundreds died waiting for medical attention, but is now charged with helping keep America safe,"" Boston Mayor Martin Walsh tweeted following Kelly's resignation.On April 6, Trump announced Kelly would become head of homeland security.Trump outraged much of Washington earlier this month by pardoning Joe Arpaio, Arizona sheriff convicted of disobeying federal judges in targeting Latinos suspected of illegal activity.Presidential pardon attorney Barry Berke argued Arpaios conviction for ignoring a 2011 order to stop racially profiling Hispanics was politically motivated. During testimony before Congress, former director James Comey reportedly claimed Trump told him privately he believed the five-term law enforcement official should go free despite having broken the law.But in announcing his ouster, Sessions praised Arpaio's efforts toward rooting out corruption among city cops. So far, however, neither the president nor anyone else in his inner circle appears willing to weigh in directly on DACA. MORE OBAMA TO ENDORSE KENTUCKY GOV.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to ""reduce significantly"" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the letter was only made public this week when asked for by Nia Griffith MP on Twitter, as part of her campaign against racial discrimination in policing. It is not known whether any other departments were consulted about either proposed policy change. But it comes amid growing concern among civil liberties groups that Theresa May's Home Office is planning to introduce new rules that will make it harder to challenge unfair stops. The police are currently required to have a reasonable suspicion before detaining someone even if they have committed an offence or got into trouble with the law. It means innocent people can be locked up unnecessarily and unfairly targeted simply because their skin colour matches that of another person who has previously been arrested. A government spokesman said: ""We remain absolutely determined to tackle racism and all forms of unacceptable behaviour within our communities through strong action which holds those responsible to account."" He added that there would be no changes of substance until after publication next Tuesday of the second phase of its inquiry into race relations. That report is expected to recommend more powers over routine searches. Griffith tweeted last night: ""I'm still waiting for my reply from theresamay re increasingly disproportionate number of black men stopped searched during stopnsearch - time to act!""

The technology could be part of the solution for affordable housing in some of the poorest communities in the world. It is the first time 3D-printed homes have been created at scale. Other attempts at 3D-printing homes have usually been in controlled conditions. The area where the houses are being printed is prone to earthquakes. There were a few delays to the project. It took some time to get government approval for land, and the 3D printer was stuck at customs for three months as the machine was in a brand new category that didn't exist.

It has a carbon fiber shell that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to stand up, but collapses when gravity takes over and they are needed for space travel. SagAga Lunar Orbital Structure (LUNAR) The design of this structure was inspired by Chinese paper folding techniques called Origamis. This style of construction uses layers upon layers of folded materials to create complex shapes. Most commonly used today are book or magazine covers that can be opened flat and closed up into a box shape with no internal support. A couple of other popular origamis include a telescope lens made from cardboard and a shoe last that folds out like a zipper as well as a windmill that opens up like a fan to catch air around its blades. By using these generation methods we could fold our own version of this type of origami using modern engineering technologies - sheets of metal instead of paper. In order to make sure this piece stood upright during launch I added four small rockets at the corners to push against each corner while launching to keep them stable until reentry where their motors would not interfere with anything else going through the engine nozzle.",gpt_j,0.8863636363636364,0.6666666666666666,0.9230769230769231,0.921875,-0.05263157894736842,-0.3225920760960794,-0.6029894596170173,-0.3351850044988572,-0.7809337356173063,0.45049130763416456,1.182754222950863,0.5180824222035324,1.6467836217774972,0.4825102880658439,1.7880934704216382,0.16666666666666674,-0.07434413437206501,0.18390804597701152,0.6870925171098669,0.0,0.0,0.714285714285714,0.919494784522111,-0.5455993801076845,-0.23016758711316165,0.8094066174459937,1.189289009523942,0.8071895424836601,1.2982226033722424,-0.44545454545454544,0.1838941644991086,-0.0888888888888888,1.0525322285159238,0.4687500000000002,0.974844237604622,-0.3635351942873041,-0.19699675255657734,0.5624999999999999,1.979901117639179,0.46153846153846145,1.078909040748004,0.17433822289664472,0.3051069275546079,-0.9735449735449735,-0.7627229053497121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.309090909090909,0.7272727272727273,-0.41846272495027576,0.707760791562832,-0.24507442070401927,0.15107151654759896,0.12255272241258279,-0.3115033595674617

After losing opener Kamran Akmal in the third over - he was bowled by Jamie Overton off his fourth delivery - Shan Masood set about rebuilding after some early jitters against England's potent attack. He scored 40 runs from 41 balls before falling LBW to Chris Jordan (1-40), who then trapped Adil Rashid lbw without scoring as well as having Mohammad Hafeez caught behind via DRS just three deliveries later. The experienced duo of Younis Khan and Misbah were both run out cheaply while skipper Shahid Afridi departed for 16 when he top edged an attempted pull shot at Samit Patel. However, left hander Shoaib Malik played very sensibly alongside fellow tailender Sohail Tanvir as they added 60 together which helped take Pakistan beyond 200 - something many had written them off doing beforehand. Having won the toss, Jonathan Trott watched as his side struggled throughout the opening powerplay period despite being given two chances that went begging; firstly Asad Shafiq dropped by Ahmed Shehzad at mid-off following Carl Hopkinson straying onto leg stump and secondly Joe Root spilled by Umar Akmal on 10 when attempting another catch. Indeed it seemed Pakistan would be in trouble but continued to chip away thanks to excellent work between openers Nasir Jamshed and Azhar Ali putting on 91 together before the latter fell 21 short of a century when flicking Tom Westley straight into the hands of James Anderson at fine leg. His departure didn't affect those around him though and although they lost quick wickets late on, Hasan Ali ensured there wasn't any real drama along the way. He finished unbeaten on 20 from four overs including taking one crucial scalp, bowling Gary Ballance (18).

The test requires filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to fill and pressurize the vehicle's fuel tanks to 20 times their capacity and then igniting the fuel tanks and driving the vehicle in a centrifuge to cause the vehicle to explode.,flan_t5_xxl,-0.11363636363636363,-0.3333333333333333,-0.12307692307692308,-0.171875,-0.21052631578947367,0.6328481438676705,0.2016337481468097,0.7072980752343778,0.41075073859805794,1.0249433106575958,0.2565952108126338,0.8634707036725541,0.28768661085559444,0.5401234567901235,0.03213728527955697,-0.16666666666666674,1.1512398392756253,-0.48275862068965514,-0.2988158729538991,0.0,0.0,2.5714285714285707,0.98989101241698,-0.6504307020497724,-0.4580825384722716,1.3453650533223953,1.2748786165877952,-0.6372549019607844,-0.09360607031504128,-1.378787878787879,-0.578854372591137,0.8,2.9028626882027946,2.9687500000000004,0.974844237604622,0.30186404525642213,-0.03033008588991065,3.0624999999999996,3.1787653186477587,-0.46153846153846156,-0.5277022413276352,1.0460293373798686,0.4930913526121032,-0.677248677248677,-0.24522384940232553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.5454545454545454,1.1808471428330682,-0.40574701330970614,-0.8056833579979764,-0.9928353534030728,1.192521137895991,1.410732000901489
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Gridsort sorts data by storing it in a simplified binary cube, which offers excellent cache utilization. It is a simplified implementation of cubesort. Benchmarks and visualizations are available. Gridsort is an efficient sorting algorithm that takes advantage of the spatial locality of memory to improve cache utilization and reduce the number of comparisons needed. It works by creating a simplified binary cube data structure, where each cell in the cube corresponds to a value in the array to be sorted. The cube is then traversed in a top-down fashion, and cells are compared to their neighbors to determine which ones should be sorted. This process continues until the entire array is sorted. Gridsort is typically faster than traditional sorting algorithms such as quicksort and merge sort, and it is particularly well suited for sorting large data sets.",text-davinci-003,0.2878787878787879,0.5,0.23076923076923078,0.234375,-0.05263157894736842,0.5696761366366734,1.2649596679692106,0.9038606935791847,0.7743726442292279,-0.48299319727891155,0.3751377232999184,-0.5504625735912532,0.27299595595930864,-0.5617283950617281,0.22640178852925166,0.75,0.6226914918148967,-0.2327586206896551,0.6334721711928776,0.0,0.0,-0.1785714285714287,0.03277941947685761,-0.7880218120987627,-0.7625173951346522,-0.14766201804758006,0.4722403798157522,-0.3823529411764707,0.0857043596640187,0.07954545454545464,0.4560721735478283,0.050000000000000044,0.622256776214835,0.03906250000000007,0.9468047907636447,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.37499999999999994,-0.04206938852807463,-0.2692307692307693,-0.3757712550030027,-0.13075366717248352,-0.054856880516334326,-0.7142857142857141,-0.5161985285489611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272727272727272,-0.09090909090909091,0.5054832088542911,-0.0062396177709978405,-0.35830500748499017,-0.5320433095409958,0.1208500682355613,0.18014361571168255

Four lorry loads of tobacco products were seized from it when the raid took place last week. The store, which was shut down by officials from HMRC's Criminal Investigations Department (CID), also had five bookmakers operating within its premises as well as three gambling machines. Officers found an illegal roulette machine under the counter at one point during their search operation. They recovered more than 200 cartons of cigarettes but believe that there would be far more if they didn't close up shop before Saturday's match between England and Croatia. According to local sources, no staff members paid any tax or national insurance contributions either. A source told The Sun: ""This is where all Britain's money goes - into the pockets of crooks like these who thought they can get away with making millions while paying none back.""",opt_30b,0.4696969696969697,0.3333333333333333,0.5538461538461539,0.625,0.42105263157894735,-0.026948376100524744,-0.41214240840503746,-0.17207192834514684,-0.014502184205480582,0.31875607385811444,-0.036109927254593256,0.5180824222035324,0.6335666876682873,0.6512345679012347,0.5555251572718246,-0.5,-0.09642853735576144,0.7315270935960589,0.6153823807805652,0.0,0.0,0.6326530612244898,-0.6190711399553823,0.04594879370838265,0.30966712087298764,0.09844134536505326,0.24082653825305506,0.6008403361344538,0.054391447323856056,-0.04545454545454524,0.3252269508561229,-0.05714285714285716,0.7253281906922375,0.15625000000000008,0.627029874122419,0.35889826578874157,0.21197740306817955,-0.08035714285714289,0.6052729188109565,0.37362637362637346,0.5735178782453004,0.5977310499313534,0.5847304251572278,0.1269841269841273,0.5620651846329601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.290909090909091,0.0,-0.8879551297002678,1.0210375694735832,-0.8056833579979764,0.06484656751223793,0.11535779249337123,0.20275316717917022

The 23-year-old's saves helped them beat Reading in the play-off final. Ward has been quoted on the BBC as saying ""I definitely want to be here, I have enjoyed every moment of the last two seasons. I have grown as a person and as a player and now I want to go into the Premier League with this club."" The club have only said that talks with Ward will continue and they hope to get him to agree a deal. They will no doubt have a better chance of doing that now he has had a taste of the Premier League. Ward's current deal with Liverpool expires in 2018 and he has spent most of his time out on loan with Tranmere, Aberdeen, Huddersfield and Birmingham. Ward has made 87 appearances for Huddersfield and helped them win promotion to the Championship in 2016-17.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"India shut down the internet in the state of Assam during protests against a new citizenship rule. The Citizenship Amendment Bill, which creates a pathway for citizenship for minorities in India from Muslim-majority Bangladesh and Pakistan, has stoked tensions across several states - including West Bengal where what began as a peaceful protest quickly escalated into violent clashes between police and supporters of Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress party. Here are some key things to know about how this unfolded: What sparked violence? The Trinamool chief was not happy with the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill when it came up for discussion before Parliament on 16 December 2017. She took her concerns directly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with other opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi who she believed were ""partners"" in their fight against the bill. In an address at Patna University campus, Ms Banerjee said that she had conveyed these views to Mr Gandhi through Manish Tewari, his media advisor. ""I told him why I wanted my MPs opposed to the CAB... I have even taken part in discussions regarding the issue... We have always been partners,"" he quoted her as saying. According to Hindu Sena president Pramod Muthalik, Ms Banerjee called off talks with party allies over passing the legislation after sending out press statements aimed at portraying herself as being opposed to its passage. At one point, she is understood to have suggested that if Mr Modi did not listen, then all alliance parties should walk out of the ruling coalition. It's unclear how exactly this led to massive demonstrations across the country but there are reports of sloganeering by members of the BJP government in New Delhi cheering those protesting. By 20 January 2018, the day the Lok Sabha passed the controversial law, mobs gathered outside parliament demanding protection and support for people facing arrest due mass arrests under Section 144 CrPC. Many more joined them later. In Bengaluru, thousands of protesters clashed with police while in Kolkata today hundreds of people turned out en masse. Here's what happened so far. Read full story here "" Why does PM Modi want such a divisive piece of legislation approved? Why suddenly implement something that many believe will be abused or lead to unrest among Muslims living within India's borders? Wasn't National Security Advisor Ajit Doval trying to persuade Sonia Gandhi to see reason on the matter in 2016? Afterall A DOG'S LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN HUMAN RIGHTS... AND THAT INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO LIVE! Posted by Shri Ramkishan Jhaveri on Friday, 24 February 2019 Who wants to stop the law? Right-wing groups, primarily backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have repeatedly attempted to pass similar bills since 2002. All failed because they faced stiff resistance at every step from stakeholders ranging from the Centre (which controls laws promulgated by governments) to various regional states. But having successfully got wider political backing, the current move now faces major opponents too. Opposition voices include both the Left Front and the UPA II Ministry of Home Affairs led by Amit Shah, the leader of the ruling party; besides citizens and civil society organisations representing different religious communities in India, also Supreme Court lawyers, academics and constitutional experts. Even former Chief Justice Dipak Misra has spoken out against it despite being home minister himself while senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan has filed anticipatory bail applications seeking relief for individuals expected to face detention under section 4 (2) (b) of the Citizenship Act. Civil rights activists say the rationale behind the Citizenship Act of 1948, which grants Indian nationality to non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries, is justifiably based on security considerations. They cite examples such as large-scale refugee influxes affecting stability in Kashmir or increasing infiltration attempts from militants into India from across the border. Critics argue the proposed amendments could amount to illegal discrimination on grounds of religion, violating Article 14 of the constitution. ""This amendment is motivated exclusively for reasons of domestic politics rather than providing any reasonable justification. This practice of making inflammatory speeches targeting minority community without empirical basis only increases communal tension and can lead to dangerous events,"" says Advocate Gopinath Pillai, convenor of People's Union For Democratic Rights (PUDR). He adds, given past experience, tensions in northeast India are likely to increase once the sanctuary period granted to residents from certain north east states ends. Lawyers protest against changes to citizenship rules near LN PAU on 23022019. AP Photo Rajesh Kumar Singh Lawyer Mahesh Bhatt attributes growing terrorist activities originating in India to the Citizenship Amendment Bill. While files pertaining to terror incidents have increased significantly, instead of increasing resources towards prevention measures, the focus has shifted toward helping terrorism suspects caught redhanded get back home safely, says Bhatt. Recently released data shows that the number of 'jihadi returnees', persons suspected of participating in acts of militancy, rose sharply last year - more than tripling the overall number of troops activated earlier when requesting reach safety on high traffic executives.

The Brexit issue has dominated the first EU referendum debate between the five party leaders. UKIP leader Nigel Farage was jeered when he denied his party was responsible for a poster showing a queue of migrants under the slogan ""Breaking Point."" And he was heckled as he said people would be ""living in misery"" in the EU in 10 years' time. But Mr Farage told the ITV debate he was ""quietly optimistic"" of victory in the 23 June vote because he believed the British people had ""a funny habit of doing the right thing."" The UK will go to the polls in the EU referendum on 23 June The event at the London Studios in Waterloo - the only debate to feature all five of the main political parties' leaders - was billed as the ""big debate"" on the UK's future in the EU. Asked about the poster, which was criticised for having featured a queue of refugees in Slovenia, Mr Farage said he was ""proud"" of it, arguing that it was right to draw attention to the refugee crisis facing countries in Europe. ""The truth of it is, if we're not prepared to talk about immigration, we're not prepared to talk about what I think is the single biggest issue that faces this country."" Later, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she thought the poster was ""racist."" Audience member Angelique Flynn - whose question about whether a UK-only points-based immigration system would work prompted the exchange - told BBC Radio 4's World At One she was concerned that it was ""becoming a real theme"" in the debate. ""The EU has its problems but immigration isn't the cause of all of them,"" she said. 'Unfettered immigration' Ms Sturgeon said ""the EU isn't perfect,"" but warned that if the UK voted to leave it would be ""the hardest of Brexits."" She said she did not believe the UK would be able to continue its membership of the single market, ""because to do so would require you to accept the free movement of people."" ""That's what the rest of the EU would insist upon, and you'd have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" she added. ""I don't believe there is the remotest chance, if we vote to leave the EU, that we would be able to negotiate a deal that gave us full access to the single market while not accepting the free movement of people."" But Mr Farage said he believed the UK could negotiate an alternative arrangement and said there was ""huge public concern"" about the level of immigration. ""I'm not saying immigration is not a good thing,"" he added. ""But what people don't want is unfettered immigration, where people come here, don't have a job to go to, don't have health insurance."" Image copyright Getty Images The TUC union has claimed that the average weekly wage has fallen by 1,600 since 2007 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""not wedded"" to the principle of free movement of people, but insisted that the UK would be able to negotiate a better deal on immigration by staying in the EU. He also said that, while the European Convention on Human Rights was ""not perfect,"" it had been ""a good thing"" for the UK. Mr Farage said the UK should leave the European Court of Human Rights as well as the EU, saying there was ""no way we can accept the European Court of Human Rights continuing to overrule UK Supreme Court judgements."" Ms Sturgeon said Mr Farage's ""intolerant"" views on immigration and human rights were ""an insight into the type of Britain he wants to create if he gets his way."" Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said the UK was ""stronger, safer and better off"" in the EU, saying: ""It has brought investment, it has brought jobs, it has brought prosperity.

None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. The systems were restored as a result of the hospitals' IT teams working with outside experts to resolve the issue. At Kentucky Methodist Hospital, the ransomware attack forced the hospital to temporarily suspend some services and re-direct patients to other facilities for care. The hospital has since resumed full operations. Chino Valley Medical Center was also impacted by the attack, but was able to continue providing patient care without interruption. Similarly, Desert Valley Hospital in California was able to continue providing patient care during the incident. The hospitals have not released any details on the exact nature of the attack or how it was resolved.

Managers distributed anti-union literature prior to the vote, claiming that a union would lead to fewer benefits and job security. The vote by Instacart employees to unionize is an important step forward in the fight for better wages, benefits, and job security for workers in the gig economy. Despite the managers distributing anti-union literature, many of the employees recognized the importance of joining a union in order to ensure their rights and protections as workers are respected. Unionization is a powerful tool that can help ensure that all workers have fair wages, safe working conditions, and access to benefits. Through collective bargaining, unions can advocate on behalf of employees to win improvements to pay and working conditions, and give workers a stronger voice in their workplace. Instacart employees have taken an important first step in the fight to improve their working conditions.

""Having our best players in Wales is vital to the future health of our game,"" the WRU's Martyn Phillips said. The WRU chief executive continued: ""Seeing international players re-sign these contracts highlights the success of the programme as we continue to work hard to drive the game forward. ""We have made no secret of that and the importance both on and off the field at regional and national level in Welsh players playing their rugby in Wales."" The quartet have made more than 370 regional appearances between them. Cardiff Blues' Wales captain Warburton, 28, was the first Welsh player to be given a dual contract in September 2014. Flanker Lydiate returned to Welsh rugby on a national dual contract in December 2014 when he joined Ospreys following a spell in France with Racing Metro. Scarlets prop Lee, who has won 26 caps for Wales, signed his first dual contract in January 2015. Newport Gwent Dragons' Amos, 22, signed his national dual contract in December 2014 and has won 10 caps for Wales. Amos' deal is a boost to the Dragons as he had been linked with a move away from Rodney Parade. Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones said: ""It's great news for both our region and Wales that Hallam has committed to the Dragons for another two years."" Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson on Sam Warburton: ""With his leadership ability and having achieved so much in the game he's a great asset for Cardiff Blues. ""It's great that he sees his future here and he will be a key figure for us moving forward."" Ospreys head coach, Steve Tandy on Dan Lydiate: ""With Dan's outlook on the game and his desire to keep learning, even as a senior Wales international and a Lion, he is an example to everybody. ""I believe he's really grown as an individual and a player since he came to us less than two years ago, and there is still more growth in him, on and off the field."" Scarlets head coach, Wayne Pivac on Samson Lee: ""We're delighted to see another homegrown player committing his future to the club. ""It's great news that Samson has extended his contract and will continue to ply his trade here at the Scarlets."" Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones on Hallam Amos: ""He is pivotal to our plans going forward.

But business groups have described the charge as ""disappointing"" and a ""tax on jobs."" The levy, which is expected to raise 3bn by 2020, will be paid by employers with a pay bill of more than 3m. The government says these businesses are the most able to pay and that every penny raised will go directly into training apprentices. However, the CBI warned that the new charge could hit small and medium-sized firms hard, putting off some from taking on apprentices in the first place. The British Chambers of Commerce said the proposal was ""too much too soon"" and called for a more gradual implementation. The Federation of Small Businesses said the levy would leave small firms facing an additional burden at a time when they were already struggling. It added that the government should focus on helping employers take on more staff and not impose a tax on jobs. The government has promised to protect small businesses by exempting them from the levy if they have an annual pay bill of less than 3m.

It was captured using a modified telescope that uses two telescopic filters, one blue and one red to enable it to see on the magnetic north pole as well as in other regions. The project took four years to complete. Astrophoto-artist Chris Menges says he made the Jupiter photos by scanning thousands of photographs taken over 14 months, then stitching them all up into an image of the largest planet in our solar system. Red laser dots show where each photo was taken. Here's more: The bottom line is that there are no ways around this problem; humans will never be able to live long enough or travel far enough to get access to Venus or Mars for direct observation (unless we build some sort of space elevator), so indirect methods alone must do us until something like Star Trek style warp drives become available soon anyway. No matter what scientist tell you about how rare a star forming region is they always have their own agenda because someone else funded them - which majority of people don't know if its true because most scientists work behind closed doors with mostly government grants. If you wish to learn more read my post ""A Decade Long Journey To Find Earths Light Pollution Problem And What We Can Do About It!"" I really hope everyone reading this catches the message here.. Light pollution isn't just affecting wildlife but human health too through cancer causing rays at night that affect plants growing near city lights. How can anyone deny this when we ourselves grow taller than average just living near bright streetlamps? Low frequency light doesn't even penetrate walls very much unlike UltraViolet radiation. This is common knowledge amongst astronomers who work outside often during daylight hours among many others... Then again did you ever hear of Cosmic Background Radiation being affected by blue light emissions from sunlight reaching EARTHS surface before the Sun goes fully dark? Keep in mind that planets orbiting distant stars don't emit any light themselves due to distance since those planets are billions of miles away that only form while the parent star is still burning... As per earlier studies these are not new findings yet they seem to be ignored by the media and 'experts' alike due to dozens of journalists conveniently ignoring this point. In fact Ozone layer depletion may actually lead to even MORE dangerous UV radiation hitting land masses rather than less thanks to higher levels of ozone loss specifically caused by higher energy level UVC wavelengths coming out from heat generating devices such as electric motors etc. Read More: According to NASA, Planet Nine could impact life across Earth's orbit. For instance, small asteroids might strike the Arabian Peninsula. ""This would create massive tsunamis,"" said study coauthor Robert Weryk, a planetary geologist from San Diego State University. Also, polar ice caps might crumble, potentially leaving pockets of fresh water exposed below ground - adding nutrients for algae or bacteria that would feed fish populations. Such changes in climate could influence agriculture and economic growth throughout Asia's Middle East coast, according to the researchers. While officials haven't alerted residents to possible dangers ahead of time, experts say it wouldn't take much warning to protect against potential impacts.""Planet Nine won't hit us next week or next year, but after 100 million years or so,"" Weryk told Live Science. But anybody who thinks they'll survive another 10 million years should think twice, he added. When searching in Google Maps looking for places in Mexico there is the option to click on 'earth' to find points along latitude lines showing different heights above sea level. There is also the option to enter certain locations, including cities and countries. One thing missing is altitude graph information displaying the height above sea level. Now there seems to be a solution courtesy of Dr. Charles Eberlein working closely with researcher Jevon Phillips. Watch his video presentation on YouTube titled A Quick Look At Altitude Graph Data On Altitudes Of Places Around Us Below! Dr. Charles Eberlein has been studying altimeter data collected by satellites - especially from Japan. He collects and analyzes radar measurements from thunderstorms and volcano eruptions. His purpose is to discern patterns within atmospheric pressure fluctuations. When used correctly altimeters provide information regarding weather forecasting accuracy. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency provides accurate information via satellite. They measure hundreds of millions of things every single day such as ocean waves, forest fires, volcanic activity, rainfall rates and aircraft flight paths to name a few. Many times people ask me why does altitude change? Why won't high mountains reach the clouds?? Unfortunately there are zero answers to these questions. Not ALL altimetry measures air pressure.

Facebook has recruited writers who focus on five topics: social issues, sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and news. The platform was first announced in January and the writers were brought in a month later. Subscribers will be able to choose how many emails they receive from Facebook. They will also have the option to unsubscribe if the content is unsatisfactory. The free version of the service will feature news, however, the paid version will provide access to the other four categories. The paid version of Bulletin will cost a few dollars per month.

When he played, his wife was ""in shock"" as he played all the notes perfectly. Care worker Samantha Aldridge said: ""You would not know anything was wrong with him. ""He's only been playing for the last week and he's picking it up really well. ""He has got Alzheimer's and dementia but he's playing brilliantly. ""He's playing all the notes and he's playing the chords and he's picking it up really well. ""All of a sudden, he's got the confidence and he's going for it."" Mrs Aldridge said: ""He's playing all the notes and he's playing the chords and he's picking it up really well."" Mr Hardy, 74, has been at the home for six years and had not played the saxophone since he was younger, his wife told care workers. But in the last week he has been playing for about half an hour a day. Mrs Hardy said: ""I was in shock when I heard him play. ""He had always played the saxophone when he was younger but had not played for years and years. ""When I heard him playing I thought 'wow'. It's amazing."" Mrs Hardy, who visits her husband every day, said he also enjoyed looking at photographs of when he was younger. She said: ""He loves to look at old photographs and he will tell me all about them."" Mr Hardy's care home is run by Alzheimer's Care UK, which has care homes in south Somerset and Dorset. The company's marketing director, Jane Pritchard, said: ""Music has a profound impact on people with dementia, especially those who have played a musical instrument. ""It is wonderful to see the residents at Wookey House being uplifted by Edward's saxophone playing. ""The power of music is remarkable. ""Our residents and their loved ones have told us that music can help them to reconnect, even when dementia is very advanced.""",llama_65B,1.8106060606060606,2.8333333333333335,2.4153846153846152,2.296875,3.5789473684210527,-1.143794678965161,-0.7712918182337568,-1.0435648648545084,-0.7781579424209728,-0.7334570191713049,0.052504382170349174,-0.176619007569386,0.18923504425168217,-0.28479236812570125,0.17232744148560009,-0.8181818181818182,-0.5786715286107265,0.10815047021943579,0.39085538137239884,0.045454545454545456,0.2082988952252655,-0.9090909090909092,0.02750233867106659,-0.32164155595867866,0.17459987205332644,-0.24162875680513085,0.0985274381928892,-0.9037433155080216,-0.24829934953502467,0.5727272727272729,0.3611332318586073,0.34545454545454546,0.9329841005275555,-0.6107954545454545,0.2741720293602136,-0.22440626238270675,0.10379747903298497,-0.11931818181818186,0.41217236767833415,1.2307692307692306,0.7629895482576633,0.047546788062721335,0.1376323358351976,0.42712842712842736,0.1590895575437569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,1.4545454545454546,0.8682931160369038,0.31738181733095294,0.7003256136616673,1.2605301965518911,-1.2297684897647119,-0.7827191307328675

They are being asked to clarify how this amounts to blackmail and threats of physical harm. The activists include former SNP MSP David Torrance who helped deliver the controversial referendum result. He believes there was no consensus among Yes voters when they backed independence at last year's Holyrood election. In Westminster he joined forces with Labour peer Lord Carlile as co-chairman of Better Together. But today he is one of those behind Operation Yellowhammer - whose aim is to oust Nicola Sturgeon from office before she can push through legislation giving Scots control over their own affairs. Mr Cameron said: ""It seems wrong to ask people to sign up without knowing what kind of support and solidarity will come along side them and I think it's unfair to make claims against individuals if they haven't signed up yet. Most importantly it's wrong to pressure anyone into signing up under threat of violence."" A spokesman added any protest group threatening serious violence should expect to face police action. This comes amid warnings that the final countdown to polling day remains fraught with danger. Voting experts say protests around polling stations across the country risk causing chaos just days before 1 October - especially with two parties contesting every seat - because there may be so many candidates standing. Earlier yesterday Adam Tomkins, the Secretary of State for Scotland's Electoral Commission, warned political groups attempting to disrupt voting centres were putting themselves at unnecessary personal risk. Writing exclusively for PoliticsHome ahead of Thursday's local elections, he said: ""We know that some organisations plan to use intimidation tactics such as mass demonstrations in order to prevent others from casting votes; pushing supporters towards booths where they don't belong; disrupting polls and taking ballots away once cast. Unfortunately these activities present potential risks to both officials involved and other electors trying to exercise their legal right to register and participate in the democratic process.' 'Any organisation intending to threaten disorder running counter to electoral law, including force or the threat thereof shall be guilty of an offence which carries prosecution andor significant penalties.' We urge all elected representatives and party leaders to campaign peacefully and rationally throughout next week during the crucial period leading upto polling day, while keeping within the law. If they do this then there's little doubt that the vote itself will be conducted calmly, efficiently and fairly,' Mr Tomkins added.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Scientists have observed electrical activity similar to the brain activity of premature babies in lab-grown brains. The lab-grown brains are simplified versions of the organ that is grown in a dish from stem cells. Scientists made stem cells from the skin of adults and then turned them into neurons. The neurons were placed in a dish to grow and form a brain-like structure. The researchers observed a spontaneous electrical activity in the neurons. The spontaneous electrical activity was seen even though the organoids did not have a synapse, which is a specialized structure of the neuron that permits transmission of electrical or chemical signals from one neuron to another. The spontaneous electrical activity lasted for approximately 25 days. The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature. The researchers also observed spontaneous activity in the brains of premature babies. The brain activity was observed in the brains of premature babies that were born at less than 29 weeks. The babies were monitored for 12 months after their birth. The researchers observed a similarity between the spontaneous brain activity of the organoid and the premature babies. ""The similarities that we observe between our cultures and the developing human brain are intriguing and represent an important step in our understanding of human brain development,"" said senior author Dr. Alysson Muotri, associate professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine departments of Pediatrics and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, in a news release. ""We are excited to follow up on this study and explore its clinical implications. The generation of human cortical organoids is a new and promising avenue to study human brain development and neurological disease using a combination of genetics, stem cells and modeling,"" added Muotri. The researchers also noted that there are limitations to the study. The organoid did not have all of the structures of a human brain. The organoid also lacks a blood supply, which is important for the brain's development. The researchers also noted that the electrical activity was seen in premature babies who were born at less than 29 weeks. The babies that were born at 29 weeks did not display this activity. ""It was striking to see the similarity in spontaneous electrical activity between the organoids and the human brain,"" said Dr. Muotri. ""This suggests that organoids can provide a good model to study human brain development. Moreover, our work establishes that we can mimic brain activity in a dish with this method.""

The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, and they have long been marginalized and discriminated against by the government.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Droidlet is a platform for building intelligent agents that simplifies integrating a wide range of machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid prototyping. It can be used to quickly test out different models on real data and then deploy the most promising ones in production environments with little need for specialist knowledge or expertise. In this post, we will introduce you to Droidlets (and what they are), how they work, how many different types there are available, and even give an example application. What Are They? When first introduced by Google AI at IO 2017, ""droidlets"" were defined as: A droidlet is an expert system based around AI components that allow developers to rapidly prototype new applications without needing any deep understanding of advanced concepts such as reinforcement learning and neural networks... A droidlet consists of a black-box algorithm whose performance metrics must be tracked over time - usually using log files - which allows you to measure its success and potentially intervene if it performs poorly. This gives you feedback loops just like those seen across real engineering projects but while being gentle enough to use in increasingly complex systems. You may have heard them referred to more recently under their other name of DRLs - Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems - but these two terms actually refer to slightly different things so don't get confused! The main difference between an agent in an RL setting and a droidlet is that an existing model trained from scratch would generally not start off having any idea about how best to act. Instead, since the entire architecture is designed solely to serve the task itself, all of the decision making decisions are made purely through trial and error exploration with no guidance whatsoever coming from some kind of preprogrammed strategy. That means that unlike traditional approaches where the developer has full control over every part of how the agent acts, instead they only have limited access to information and measurements within their environment during training - the droidlet takes care of everything else while giving the developer complete freedom. In fact, the whole point behind using a droidlet approach is to take away any possible worries regarding long term stability and generalization with respect to the model created; because in practice when trying to apply anything learned before deployment into your own live environment, you won't really know whether it was going to perform well until after several months, weeks or days worth of trials. With droidelets however, due to the nature of the underlying implementation, once deployed the model should remain unchanged regardless of usage frequency or external factors. An additional benefit of the droidlet approach is the lack of requirement for specialized hardware resources especially given recent developments in low power mobile computing platforms; the basic premise here being that running the same experiments again and again could easily exhaust battery life faster than one might reasonably expect. Differently put, with standard RNN techniques applied directly to raw input, trying to make predictions far outside the normal operational bounds results in very large amounts of computation required, whereas with a droidlet application specifically implemented for the problem domain this doesn't need to happen as the overall complexity level does not change depending on context - simply feeding forward inputs as necessary while producing sensible output. Overall, the goal is to create something that works instantly yet isn't necessarily useful unless the user actually trains up a lot of samples by hand according to the definition above. While early implementations of droidelets did require a bit of programming skill, newer libraries now support scripting right inside Android Studio, freeing users who also happen to possess that skill set from ever having to write code. Over time, as creators come together towards similar goals to better cater for specific problems, this area continues to grow and develop thanks to constantly improving technology. So let's dig deeper below to find out exactly what makes each type of droidlet special and why you might choose to go down one route rather than another... Types of Droidlets You Can Build Yourself Like I mentioned earlier, though using the word 'agent' sounds accurate in describing typical RL scenarios, unfortunately this term tends to pick out both the human operator of the agent alongside also the software itself. Confusing stuff indeed and fortunately there's been quite a development push underway to eliminate ambiguity surrounding terminology in this space recently leading to our current situation today. As a result, we believe it should be stated clearly that Droidlets themselves aren't the same thing as humanoid robots nor do they employ true self-driving capabilities. None of the examples mentioned thus far would technically qualify either as they rely on continuous direct supervision via an operator throughout testing execution periods - not least because, when dealing with actual live production environments, humans will always inevitably take charge of the process due to safety concerns related to autonomous vehicle adoption. So, what exactly is a droidlet then? From our perspective, a droidlet should primarily contain the following four pieces: a predictive ability. Provided an appropriate starting state, the aim is to automatically learn how best to behave without requiring explicit intervention from a human trainer; .

Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who won in Australia, came second; Max Verstappen third for Toro Rosso and Sebastian Vettel fourth for Red Bull Racing. The Mercedes drivers finished 1-2 with Lewis Hamilton continuing his preposterous run at this year's championship by beating team-mate Nico Rosberg to pole position once again - but only after being given an unprecedented 10 points penalty as stewards decided that both men had been racing under yellow flags during their pit stops. This points deduction means they are now tied 2-2 going into Sunday's race at Suzuka. Fernando Alonso took top spot in the Honda battle for fifth place, ahead of Jenson Button. The McLarens were eighth and ninth in line between Daniel Ricciardo (Renault) and Jean-Eric Vergne (Toro Rosso).

Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall and Ryan Hughes, 22, from Penwortham were charged by police after the incident but later released under investigation for attempted murder On Wednesday (January 8), both men appeared before Preston Crown Court via video link to be sentenced over their part in Adam's attack which left him needing extensive hospital treatment including operations to his head, chest, arm and spine as well as exploratory surgery. Taylor pleaded guilty last week while Hughes initially denied any involvement until he changed his plea during court proceedings this morning. Both defendants will now serve an extended sentence - known as a ""hospital order"" or ""indeterminate detention."" It is hoped that when they are eventually released some time into the future it would only take them around half of what would have been normal prison sentences if convicted of manslaughter. Judge Andrew Jefferies QC said: ""There's no doubt you two played roles... You each picked up weapons... It seems to me there can be little doubt one of those weapons hit Mr Wilson repeatedly causing really significant injury. READ MORE 'Brutal' gang violence leaves man fighting for life following street brawl He added: ""The minimum term required isn't 15 years; 12-and-a-half years might seem right given your age and level of responsibility."" The judge also imposed concurrent four year terms for affray against each defendant who apologised through tears today saying sorry out loud several times. No reason had previously been made public why Mitchell set upon Adam in such savage fashion outside of his own home in Lancashire. However Judge Jeffries expressed concern about how similar incidents may result in further violent attacks among rival gangs trying to settle scores, adding: I wish all involved could understand the extent of damage done to society."" He concluded: ""This case makes sad reading because people like yourselves cause so much misery yet carry themselves off as though nothing has happened. I hope learning lessons assists others not make same mistakes in future.",opt_30b,1.9242424242424243,1.5,1.7692307692307692,1.75,2.1052631578947367,0.48937273761421834,-0.08994267180497131,0.20094694606610172,0.0886655135332143,0.6103012633624875,1.5980973529124602,0.42556770395290144,1.0683604480898978,0.373456790123457,0.9772174356054973,0.2857142857142858,0.26759419517028527,0.838669950738916,0.8893634594432283,0.07142857142857142,0.25753937681885636,0.5102040816326527,1.667017562535163,0.31551505013089437,1.6113366346648936,0.8859721082854797,1.447316469849395,0.6008403361344538,2.0684513512575706,0.05454545454545472,1.1506153923833522,-0.19999999999999996,1.290192402266556,-0.4464285714285713,-0.3315216558046977,0.18779560419178334,0.42798476160999943,-0.29464285714285715,0.6052729188109567,0.769230769230769,0.5296992331191688,0.7098056217934822,0.9626041789514249,0.6984126984126987,1.96516483225959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.727272727272727,2.272727272727273,-0.6398345948953741,1.0067756718830703,0.020427147224684018,-0.3804570216694236,0.5659662563357603,0.42682223884519227

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are ""of particular interest"" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved their ""causal connection"" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been ""secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine."" ""The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts,"" the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. ""We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17,"" he added. ""If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough."" The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question. The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added. The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia. They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October. The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage. Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as ""premature"" and ""counterproductive."" The Boeing 777 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was brought down on 17 July last year in Donetsk region.",human,3.537878787878788,3.6666666666666665,3.7846153846153845,3.90625,3.5789473684210527,0.17025524435602776,0.7912905449725182,0.0549154183176563,0.6159648182392471,0.027210884353741395,0.7112943643201671,0.23025885431268114,0.7301910220070157,0.28086419753086433,0.8709449248000752,-0.05555555555555558,0.5156099974013877,0.017241379310344803,-0.056877298462100524,0.0,0.0,-0.03174603174603188,0.6431886236971553,0.013501003583450672,0.6853771332366395,-0.08385744234800849,0.07510112938367476,0.01416122004357305,0.7021366595248302,0.43602693602693604,1.0763680264812785,0.059259259259259345,0.17247871163303377,0.9895833333333334,1.3868564924658697,-0.008655599863983433,0.29929127650276033,-0.15972222222222224,0.6329760109129352,0.017094017094016964,0.5918751554694297,0.23245096386219297,0.4515421669829767,0.40917107583774265,0.5453431130328825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.4545454545454546,2.1818181818181817,0.17659269679724607,1.1487648675161448,-0.06375246754800493,-0.00984709610006698,0.020078255547297877,-0.0339544170882015

Bailey, from Doncaster, was given the Richard Whiteley award at a ceremony in Leeds on Friday night. Cricketer Joe Root received the Sporting Achievement award. The Yorkshire Awards, now in their 27th year, ""recognise the many and varied achievements of people and businesses in the county."" Bailey competed in the children's event at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire in July, swimming 100m, riding a bike for four km and running for 1.3 km. Despite stumbling twice on his way to the finish line, he picked himself up and ran the final 20m of the course without his walking frame. Bailey's family said: ""We are extremely honoured to receive the Richard Whiteley award for Bailey's efforts and it makes it all the more special with being proud northerners."" Sheffield-born Root became the leading batsman in the ICC world rankings after helping England beat Australia to regain the Ashes. The 24-year-old has established himself as one of England's key performers and is closing on 3,000 test runs. Root said the award was a ""real honour"" and he wanted to thank everyone who had supported him. TV chef Rosemary Shrager, who has worked and lived in Yorkshire for many years, was presented with the Woman of the Year award, while Rotherham-born William Hague was named Man of the Year. Mr Hague, former MP for Richmond, said: ""Whatever I have done, and wherever I have been in the world, I have never stopped being a Yorkshireman, and never will."" Sir David Wootton picked up the Lifetime Achievement while Huddersfield-born poet Simon Armitage won the Arts and Entertainment award.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Scientists have created a vaccine for cat allergies that trains the immune systems of cats, instead of desensitizing the immune system of people allergic to cats. Hypocat trains the cat's immune system by exposing them to harmless amounts of cat proteins on their skin and inside their bodies. Injecting this vaccine into kittens reduces peri-and postoperative symptoms (eosinophilic granuloma) caused by feline allergy in children who are at risk of developing asthma later in life as adults. The study was published online January 15, 2016 in Translational Medicine. Laura Niederhofer is an Associate Professor in Immunology Microbiology with dual appointments in Dermatology at the University of Minnesota Medical School where she leads studies evaluating methods to prevent or treat allergic diseases including eosinophilic granulomas such as those found in humans exposed to domestic cats and mice with eczema. She also serves as Deputy Director of Research Programs (Dermatologic AllergyImmunology Program). ""The current gold standard of treatment for eosinophiloma remains highly invasive surgical excision,"" said Dr. Niederhofer. They must not only remove nonhealing lesions but extract tissue from areas away from vital anatomical structures."" Cats bring joy to millions of families around the world. But they can be hazardous when living near houses where someone has been diagnosed with serious food allergies. This creates a problem: how can you keep your kitten out of harm's way? Fortunately, there may soon be a solution - if it works well enough. A new animal model shows promise for testing vaccines against IgE antibodies specific to certain foods. When tested on healthy human volunteers, two doses weakened these undesirable antibodies so much that it might help make existing vaccination therapy more effective. And because its mechanism differs significantly from other allergy treatments currently being used, it could lead directly to safer therapies for treating severe reactions from accidental exposure to allergens like peanuts and shellfish. A team led by geneticist David Huber, Ph.D., professor of biological sciences in UT Austin's McKinnon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, recently developed a method to disrupt genes using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which work much like Cas9 protein does in bacteria. CRISPR uses DNA sequence information stored within viral genomes to target and destroy any gene for which researchers specify a change would make animals healthier or less susceptible to disease. We know that disrupting particular genes makes mice better protected against influenza virus infection; perhaps someday we will learn whether similar changes improve our ability to fight off allergy attacks. Researchers modified their technique by packaging multiple pairs of guide RNA strands together as single long molecules called ribonucleoprotein complexes, or RNPs. These RNP constructs were then introduced into T cells taken from mouse blood samples. After about three weeks without the need of further outside intervention, half of the engineered T cells were able to completely turn off their native form of the Fc receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI alpha subunit) while the remaining cells began expressing levels of the targeted Fcepsilon RIalpha equivalent to what occurs naturally after birth. ""This overcomes one of the main hurdles in making strong therapeutics targeting IgE production, since local recruitment of mast cell precursors requires high numbers of pre-existing IgE-producing B cells. Our approach allows us to bypass that step entirely and direct therapeutic modification in vivo during early stages of development before mature serum IgE concentrations become established,"" says Huber, senior author of the paper describing this research in Nature Biotechnology. Previous efforts to develop anti-IgE drugs have failed due to overly broad effects achieved with monovalent biologics. While some researchers question the validity of data supporting the efficacy of monomeric IgE antibody therapies for elimination of allergenic reactivity in patients, others remain optimistic that improved understanding of mechanisms regulating IgE synthesis will some day yield safe and effective medications capable of preventing or reversing this debilitating condition. Until then, nature provides a unique alternative to trying to arrest this potentially fatal autoimmune self-attack. As one example, scientists working in Austria have successfully bred dogs genetically altered so that they produce no natural IgE and therefore do not suffer adverse responses to common allergens. Importantly, however, these changes appear to negatively affect other aspects of dog health, leading to reduced lifespan and fertility. For now, not everyone agrees that genetically engineering organisms should ever be made available for human consumption. It took decades for researchers to build up momentum toward approval based upon extensive safety trials involving tens of thousands of animals across dozens of species. Recent events suggest FDA regulators may take an even slower pace moving forward. Last year, former head of FDA Michael Taylor warned Congress that President Obama had threatened to delay regulations until after his term expired unless lawmakers backed down from imposing stricter rules on manufacturers releasing genetically modified plants and animals. Although biotech companies argue that GM foods are inherently safe due to lack of safety experts, factually true safety statements, have never sought bakers diddle hear gives results are known to enter back ili-bearers have started free",gpt_j,5.613636363636363,4.666666666666667,4.184615384615385,4.328125,3.736842105263158,1.522514319425261,0.9488683672450435,1.5383182427300484,1.232517538087127,0.6373943516800656,1.1136922478906717,-0.07849733669750483,0.37989998603345154,-0.025533108866442,0.42592400668336555,1.1666666666666665,1.0662022029798996,1.1990595611285266,1.1710343329742414,0.0,0.0,0.8831168831168831,1.1757126388652983,0.03573795066207537,0.8955810338341135,0.9068536057871577,1.1666487070122553,0.7994652406417113,1.0900857944887175,-0.44545454545454544,0.4397938826751248,-0.10909090909090913,0.6358634263904278,-0.6392045454545453,0.4169528419575484,-0.27884801834537526,-0.04500834716121477,-0.07386363636363628,0.1381748258760662,-0.12587412587412594,0.024557313043367647,0.6656550328780981,0.5962024129401414,-0.08465608465608436,0.1917794371913931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.545454545454546,5.0,-0.553572764635684,1.716409709522349,-0.11360553133318084,-1.5508337596349362,1.3793154010534012,1.3725988580800281

Here's a step by step guide on how to build a Spotify Wrapped clone using Mux's Data API: 1. First, you'll need to create an account with Mux and get an API token. You can do this by navigating to the Mux website and following the instructions provided. 2. Next, you'll need to authenticate your requests to the Mux API using your API token. You can do this by including your token in the headers of your HTTP requests. 3. Once you've authenticated your requests, you can start making requests to the Mux Data API to retrieve data about a user's Spotify listening history. You can retrieve this data using the 'analyticsv1' endpoint. 4. After retrieving the user's listening history, you'll need to parse the data and aggregate it to create meaningful insights about their listening habits. For example, you could calculate the user's most listened to artists, songs, albums, and genres. 5. Once you've aggregated the user's listening data, you can use a front-end framework like React or Vue to display the insights in a visually appealing way. You could create charts, tables, or graphs to help the user visualize their listening habits. 6. Finally, you'll need to deploy your application to a web server like Heroku or Netlify so that other users can access it. Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to authenticate your requests to the Mux API using your API token: "" ' import requests apitoken 'your-api-token' headers Authorization': f'Bearer {apitoken response requests.get headersheaders) print (response.json "" ' This code example sends a GET request to the 'analyticsv1' endpoint of the Mux Data API with an 'Authorization' header that includes your API token. The 'response.json ' line of code extracts the JSON data from the response object and prints it to the console. Good luck with your project!

His critics want to know who he has been dealing with and if there are any conflicts of interest between him, his family or business interests An investigation into Donald J Trump's financial relationships is being carried out in the United States Senate after 10 Democratic senators sent letters to eight banks asking them for information regarding their involvement with ""business activities that might pose conflicts of interest or influence Mr Trump while president."" The bank documents show how close the candidate was working with his son Eric before last November's election, when it emerged that some of the assets they took charge of were worth 413m (296m). The inquiry will focus on the relationship of the two men over 15 years as an extension of the money trail from Deutsche Bank through to offshore investments owned by members of the Trumps and Kushner families. US Senators Bob Menendez (left) Kamala Harris (centre) Elizabeth Warren (right) have outlined concerns about potential conflicts of interest within President Donald Trump's administration. Credit:AP Among those named in the letter signed by Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee; Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut; Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island; Al Franken, D-Minnesota; Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont; Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin and Mazie Hirono, Hawaii say, ""We write today to request copies of all filings you made or submitted under section 404 (a) (1), 401 (k) plan investment advice agreements, Plan Sponsor Investment Advice Agreements, Form N-23C and similar forms filed since January 1, 2006, which relate to your communications with Donald J. Trump, Family LLCTrump Organization, Inc., Eric M. Trump Revocable Trust, Ivanka Trump Irrevocable Trust, Jared Kushner Real Estate Development LP, and other entities incorporated or established by individuals associated with the Trump family."" Senator Chuck Schumer said at a press conference yesterday that he plans to subpoena records related to the finances of key players in the Trump circle including tax returns and banking transactions. Schumer suggested they had been carrying out extensive negotiations involving foreign governments without disclosing this fact to Congress. One such example relates to the planned meeting between Russian officials visiting Washington DC next month - Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and US national security adviser Michael Flynn - and General Joseph Dunford Jr, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which raised questions among Democrats about whether Flynn may be compromised by Russia. It also raises issues about what kind of meetings might take place between people like Manafort and Saudi princes, many of whom use British law firms because of its global reputation and legal system. This comes days after a report revealed that several wealthy businessmen friendly to Trump donated millions to support pro-Russian politicians in Europe. At least one, Viktor Vekselberg, is thought likely to meet alongside representatives of the Kremlin at Davos, Switzerland, later this week where discussions could include sanctions imposed by Washington following the annexation of Crimea. The recent CIA assessment found Moscow hacked Democratic National Convention emails and released them online in order to help elect Trump as part of its efforts to meddle in politics elsewhere around the world. In response to the claim the Russians interfered in the US elections, Nikki Haley, Ambassador to UN, wrote on Twitter: ""If we truly care about democracy here abroad then we must call evil by name."" But none of the details given so far by either side suggests ill intent or evidence of collusion. Last night Mueller added another point to the list of controversial decisions taken by the new boss: appointing Sally Yates, formerly acting attorney general, to investigate the links between Trump and Russia. Her predecessor Loretta Lynch chose her successor, Dana Boente, whose wife served time for running guns up north - alongside former NRA chief Wayne LaPierre to Colombian drug cartels.",gpt_j,4.204545454545454,2.1666666666666665,3.2153846153846155,3.375,4.7368421052631575,0.9019319609279501,0.5837834376972625,0.728939173647637,0.6029877311261488,2.1209372637944055,3.9587430207661645,1.1081207363797778,1.944116998802523,1.2170781893004115,2.4081660739752375,0.7777777777777777,0.7693478311469917,0.10057471264367816,0.7107122150651836,0.05555555555555555,0.2290614236454256,1.3095238095238093,1.6938659224867862,3.333159531749566,10.407475309893439,1.0773858353841943,1.673490234276318,1.954248366013072,1.7175158516646845,-0.5232323232323233,0.7101922303665624,0.8,2.6460472035545757,0.3645833333333335,1.0047200398155862,0.50148381711954,1.0208791198589464,0.06249999999999994,0.4416154603555483,0.6666666666666664,1.6207663034776325,0.697352891586579,0.719566323180925,2.3350970017636685,8.251263721209552,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.2290614236454256,5.6909090909090905,3.0,-0.6211813399467181,1.7241006877233427,-0.43311200175470077,-1.4703166373140104,2.0688519204032776,2.0482628471401734
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Apple has extended its deadline for employees returning to the office because of the increase of Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant. The return to the offices was controversial since most companies were forced by their governments to close and reopen later on, which caused much debate in the market about how well Apple is preparing for this situation. According to a report from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, the company will extend its January 30th reopening until March 29th, but it expects all departments except work requiring ""immediate physical presence"" will be closed till April 4th at least. On top of that, according to sources familiar with the development there are no set timelines for when some teams would resume normal operations and others won't either. This confusion might also have an impact on product releases. For example, the last OSX 10.14 Mojave release date had been planned for today (March 11), as usual, along with other products such as iPadOS 14.2.

The tri-motor performance version of the Air electric has over 1,200 lb-ft of torque and 1,000 horsepower from the electric motors. The Model S Plaid was tested at the Laguna Seca racetrack for the Model S Plaid to show its capabilities. It was the fastest four-door sedan ever at the track, and it was the fastest electric vehicle ever at the track. That has all changed now that the Air has been tested. According to Lucid, the Air ran a lap of 1:36.35, which is 1.56 seconds faster than the Model S Plaid prototype. The car was in Performance trim, which is the highest trim offered. The car was fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Lucid is also planning to sell the car with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires as an option. The car was driven by Lucid's Director of Dynamic Performance Paul Young. Young is a professional racer and has driven a variety of performance cars in his career. Lucid says that the Air will hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds, the quarter mile in 10.6 seconds, and will go on to a top speed of 235 mph. The Air has a 111 kWh battery pack that is capable of delivering a range of 400 miles on the EPA test cycle. Lucid Motors plans to start deliveries of the Air in 2021. It's a luxury electric sedan that will compete with the Tesla Model S. Production will take place in Arizona at a facility in Casa Grande. The Lucid Air was unveiled in December 2016 and the company has raised over 1 billion from investors including Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.

He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's government. He was arrested in October 2015 on charges of supporting the Houthi rebels who control much of Yemen's north. The release of bin Mubarak is part of a larger agreement between the Hadi government and the Houthis to exchange prisoners and detainees held by both sides, as well as open humanitarian corridors for aid to reach civilians in need. The deal was agreed upon at the recent consultations in Sweden, which saw the first official talks between the warring parties since 2016. Bin Mubarak's release has been welcomed by international human rights groups, who have long called for his release and an end to arbitrary detention in Yemen. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said that she ""welcomed"" the release of Ahmed Awad Bin Mubarak and urged all parties to comply with their obligations under international law and ensure the humane treatment of all detainees.",text-davinci-003,0.5984848484848485,0.3333333333333333,0.5846153846153846,0.546875,0.15789473684210525,0.031478868327895496,0.434365112573664,-0.16810578785311964,0.3738618586503343,0.6491739552964043,0.6247486404134295,0.5920941968040372,0.24020128458310444,0.4660493827160493,0.31190950141038803,0.5,-0.09642853735576144,-0.3399014778325123,0.1545044027408707,0.0,0.0,0.20408163265306126,0.529069432755808,1.0568222552928013,0.8500356269661463,0.09844134536505326,-0.14056114345642778,1.2563025210084038,0.022404907736646638,-0.04545454545454524,0.08328728710856,0.22857142857142865,1.2085997522858938,0.6919642857142859,1.3048732183314833,-0.154409719002133,-0.05117266213995568,0.5624999999999999,0.6781330758855001,-0.0219780219780221,-0.09876011632224538,0.14943276248283832,0.3672576856785028,-0.38095238095238076,0.15711112153113307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43636363636363634,1.0909090909090908,0.10015280398752355,0.13952627989622182,0.7542110100224596,-0.07688640823613753,0.37803712617746743,0.3320207837365535

Magic Eraser can wipe out calls, texts or any app data by pressing on it with your finger. The leaks do not include details about the device's price but according to The Verge, they are based off of ""reliable sources"" who confirmed the existence of the upcoming Google phone. A spokesperson for Verizon declined comment when asked if the company plans to launch a 5G variant, referring us back to previous statements made earlier this year where the carrier said there was no such thing as a Pixel 4XL yet. Google has previously teased their next iteration in video form, which may be why Verizon could make an announcement before October 30th. This time around though, instead of waiting until CES 2019 to drop the Pixel 3A XL, we might see a smaller version of the smartphone appear at IO later this month (where Google is expected to reveal two more standalone Assistant devices).

Bitfinex told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen from its exchange platform. All transactions on the virtual exchange have been suspended while the security breach is investigated. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said that it was ""deeply concerned about the issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it."" The hack is one of the biggest thefts in bitcoin's history and is being treated as a ""major deal"" by many in the virtual currency community. ""Unfortunately, we continue to have vulnerabilities in the form of exchanges and wallets,"" former Singapore-based bitcoin broker David Moskowitz told the BBC. ""The vulnerabilities almost always occur on the exchange or wallet side and this is an area that continues to need improvement and more secure protocols, no different than when a bank gets robbed."" Securing bitcoin trading platforms has been a key challenge, with hacking and thefts seen as the biggest threats. In 2014, the Tokyo-based Mt Gox trading exchange declared bankruptcy when hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins vanished or were stolen. But Mr Moskowitz stressed that in spite of the latest alleged theft ""the core protocol is extremely robust and has not been hacked."" He said while there would most likely be a price correction in bitcoin, he remained confident that it would continue to be an appealing alternative asset.",human,1.0833333333333333,1.0,1.0923076923076922,1.21875,1.0526315789473684,0.12903188866737028,0.6446684319502194,0.13218770654329134,0.5321911780863245,0.17563388991960394,-0.18683511406646214,0.2119428090832633,0.3565524074748395,0.3751402918069585,0.3279851721578443,0.3181818181818181,0.3460631120642893,0.3808777429467084,0.923080787389352,0.0,0.0,0.2987012987012984,-0.40205674693221327,-0.36452709675316913,-0.1413356964526723,0.00894921321500462,-0.12838916504332118,-0.10427807486631008,-0.19808201510962264,0.8272727272727276,0.6644917749067837,0.6181818181818182,1.2699568662625977,0.4971590909090911,-0.06467761054160046,0.04780251743063577,0.16499075687274176,0.017045454545454527,0.37844063726550303,-0.06993006993007006,0.698200655930282,0.6181082448153769,0.20743024716402034,0.42712842712842736,0.23329416130392486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6545454545454545,1.6363636363636365,0.2770460724868893,0.3248423747466199,0.923444832968073,-0.13893750051829346,0.18277950631551404,0.16001495466176463

The RFL's match review panel will look at official video on Thursday, as it does for all on-field incidents. Keighley have gathered additional video from spectators following an appeal. Footage already online, shot from the stands, shows a number of fights breaking out on the field between the two sets of players. Following the incident, Whittel posted on Twitter that brackets and bands had been used to try to re-align his jaw and that he faces at least three months out. Keighley Cougars of League One, England's third-tier competition, progressed to the Challenge Cup fourth round with a 50-32 win over Fryston Warriors - a side from the second tier of England's amateur game. The match, a ""home"" game for Fryston, was played at nearby Featherstone in West Yorkshire after the tie was at risk of being reversed and played at Keighley instead. Keighley have also complained to the RFL about their off-field treatment before kick-off, as they allege players and members of staff were refused entry to the ground without a valid matchday ticket. A statement on Keighley's website said: ""The players' allocation of'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground.

However, organisers Culture Coventry said the funding withdrawal was ""not due to any wrongdoing on our part."" The festival is one month away and this year's programme will include a rally from Birmingham to Edinburgh; rallies at Lordswood Park in London and Speke Airport in Liverpool, as well as an air display over Sedgefield Country Club near Haddington. It costs around 1million each year for public safety and welfare but the festival now has fewer sponsors than it used to have,.with just three leading retailers remaining - Morrisons,, BQ and TK Maxx. Organisers were also expecting to lose sponsorship money because their main sponsor, Aviva Insurance, pulled out last week after 21 years. The festival attracts about 120 corporate partners. Culture Coventry director Nick Hobbs said: ""Our programmes are not extremely expensive - we budget between 500-800 per event. We don't receive government grants or subsidies so every penny goes into those events."" He added that despite losing sponsorship they would continue with the programme as planned. In 2013 concert promoter MCD announced it would be pulling its support after 10 years following what he described as 'a breakdown in communication' with the festival company.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Blue Origin launched the fourteenth test flight of its New Shepard rocket booster and capsule on January 14. There were no passengers on board, but the capsule can carry up to 7 people, which is a lot more than many other vehicles in this relatively young sub-orbital spaceflight industry. The company's presidentCEO Bob Smith said that the next two flights will be targeted at flying humans around Earth as early as 2018 with trips lasting about thirty minutes each way - during daylight hours only. ""It's going to take some time,"" he told Ars back when we talked to him for our Orbital Tour feature several months ago. But even if it doesn't happen right away, there are still lessons to learn from those first few tests. The second trip was much harder and lasted slightly longer (about 20 minutes). And the third test was very easy: just enough thrust to get off the launchpad... then coasting through the air until landing. Here's what you need to know to understand these results so far. Getting into orbit without burning fuel This is the key objective that all of today's human orbital missions share in common. It seems like such an obvious goal, why hasn't anyone figured out how to do it yet? Well, because it takes a bit of engineering work to make sure your spaceship gets where it needs to go while using minimal energy or fuel along the way. Even though most rockets burn their engines throughout their entire journey to orbit, engineers have discovered ways to reduce the amount of power necessary by making everything smart enough to fly itself instead of relying on human pilots for every aspect of operations. At Boca Chica Beach Spaceport south of Brownsville, Texas they tested a new system called SuperDraco thrusters over autumn 2016. These small engines fire jets of hydrogen gas directly onto themselves after ignition inside the engine chamber. According to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, ""Shooting liquid oxygen [fuel] straight down has been the single biggest problem with liquid propellant oxidizers"" prior to this development. This reduced volume of the fuel significantly increases efficiency. As a result, not nearly as much of the fuel goes unused and is wasted compared to earlier systems. A similar approach could also extend lifespan between refuelings of larger capsules carrying multiple satellites. For example, here's a video showing Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket blasting off for its fifth mission last month, reaching orbit twice. You'll see one brief burst of flame before the main vehicle starts powering upwards toward space. Engineers say that peak combustion happens quickly in seconds followed by droplets of exhaust plumes streaming behind the ship. By holding steady throttle settings once the initial thrust phase ends, the propulsion system continues to push the enormous rocket forward under almost constant acceleration. Then, once the vessel reaches cruising altitude height above sea level here - the rockets shut off completely allowing the craft to glide smoothly back to earth. After landing, the same thruster hardware ignites again briefly pushing the spacecraft downward to catch any remaining speed needed on the return leg home. The bottom line is that modern disposable rockets don't waste fuel by heating things up or cooling them down; rather, they optimize different aspects of lift versus weight gain. They use lots of chemical reactions that produce tiny amounts of heat barely noticeable within the environment. So little actual friction occurs in modern reusable launchers that launches often feel effortless. Unlike traditional designs that rely upon powerful internal fans for pressure support combined with the inability to control airflow due to the presence of struts and braces that connect supports together, SpaceX took a unique solution known as Raptor design. The 12 Raptors being developed will eventually provide 62 percent of the force of gravity on takeoff, according to Elon Musk. The final shape resembles something akin to arms holding open giant wings - able to expand outward to increase stability and hold cargo near the center point. In contrast, standard Falcon 9 boosters create lift with large solid structures both above and below. Draggy fins lower towards the ground in order to gain extra pressure at low altitudes, helping keep the thing airborne and stable. We've seen a number of examples of high tech reentry systems too. For instance, Japanese researchers recently landed a 3D printed carbon fiber sphere designed to be dropped free-falling during a supersonic dive that would normally tear apart anything else on contact. At speeds approaching Mach 9 9 meter per second) the object survived atmospheric entry and safely curved around the planet to come to rest. Another study demonstrated that a specially shaped parafoil sail with aerodynamic characteristics that enhanced drag became less effective at higher velocities thanks to the small size of the payload. That means engineers must fine tune the dimensions of the device depending upon what types of experiments will be performed. Reusable ships and landers also allow scientists to revisit locations repeatedly since costs associated with material expenses decrease dramatically. Hence, they're finding places previously inaccessible and opening doors into worlds only imagined before.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Disney CEO Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board on September 10, the same day that Apple unveiled the launch date and subscription price for the Apple TV Plus. The introduction was made by Tim Cook in a press conference at Apple Park with Phil Schiller, Eddy Cue, Jennifer Bailey and Angela Ahrendts, who previously served as COO of Burberry Group. Apple has since appointed industrial design chief Jony Ive to take over some of his responsibilities. In an interview earlier today, Iger said he ""was incredibly proud"" of leading Disney through the transition process but also noted it wasn't without its difficulties: ""It certainly involved a lot of soul searching."" He added he is looking forward to spending more time with his family instead of being so busy running one company which would include returning to teaching at Stanford University School of Engineering. For now, though, Iger will stay focused on his new role as non-executive chairman of Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). The following video shows parts of my conversation with Iger (starting around 1 hour 15 minutes into the presentation) followed by a transcript. I look very much forward to working alongside you, Bob [Chairman Adam Silverstein]. And we've talked about this before when we first met together during our discussions about taking control of this amazing business...but part of what's important here is just how lucky we are; fortunate enough to be able to do something special and different than most people can imagine doing in their entire life. This is really no small feat and most CEOs wouldn't have been able to enjoy these experiences or achieve these things. So thank God we're all in position to live out those dreams, right? It's not often where you get to come home every night after dinner saying 'God bless us' because there were extraordinary circumstances surrounding your success. We got this stuff pretty good. This journey began back in 1984 when Jobs came to me and told me he wanted to buy Pixar. At that point in time, having seen the movie Toy Story 2...and knowing the work they did, I actually thought it might be impossible as well. But he didn't stop talking until he convinced me that if we bought them, it could only help enhance our relationship with him. What became clear years later[after starting up] 20th Century Fox Animation, then bringing Toonagural and then building Pixar into such a valuable asset that many other companies looked at buying us. So the two biggest challenges that faced me in taking ownership of both 21st Century Fox and the company that ultimately led to the creation of the Fox brand were cultivating leadership courage for a group of leaders like yourselves who'd never owned anything quite like this before...working with a great team of talented individuals like [former X Games snowboarderactor] Shaun White...the way he approached the job; as if it were nothing more than another competition; coming off win number five in PyeongChang and feeling very confident going into Tokyo 2020. Then dealing with the fact that it was essentially a blank canvas, the chance to create new stories we weren't sure existed yet based off research by our colleagues across multiple disciplines. They said at least three times a year, we had to stop ourselves and say...wait a minute. How does that feel? Because nobody had done any research in animation since the silent era! Not counting Chuck Jones or Hal Roach Studios. There hadn't even been a cartoonist ask themselves...how does it feel? Let alone somebody who looks at a film screen as naturally as Shaun White.
