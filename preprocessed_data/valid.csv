Sophisticated kingdoms existed before the arrival of the Europeans. The country has rich reserves of natural resources including diamonds, oil, gold, copper, uranium and other minerals. It has an abundant supply of arable land. The country's economy is largely dependent on agriculture and mining. The country suffered a devastating 30 year civil war, with the Congolese government and its allies fighting against a variety of rebel groups, many of which were backed by Rwanda and Uganda. 5.4 million people died during the fighting. The DRC has been the scene of the deadliest conflict since World War II. The fighting has involved at least 20 armed groups and foreign armies from nine countries. The unstable situation has allowed militia groups to flourish, and their members continue to commit serious human rights abuses.

There were no passengers on board, but the capsule can carry up to six people. The reusable rocket booster flew to a height of 66 miles, just outside of the Karman line, where space is internationally recognized to begin. The New Shepard booster landed back at the launch site under the power of its own thrusters, while the capsule separated and deployed three parachutes to land separately. According to Blue Origin, this was the first test flight of its crew capsule since it redesigned the interior for passengers. Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is developing the rocket booster and crew capsule to eventually fly passengers on suborbital flights to space.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Even though Cuba is less than 100 miles away from the US, the two counties fell out in 1959, and no American president has visited since then. The fall out between Cuba and the US was due to the Cuban Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and the rise of Fidel Castro's communist government. The US imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, which has been in place for over 60 years. In recent years, there have been some efforts to improve relations between the two countries. In 2014, President Barack Obama announced that the US would work towards normalizing relations with Cuba, which included a relaxing of travel and trade restrictions. However, the current administration has taken a harder stance on Cuba, reinstating some of the restrictions that were lifted under Obama. Despite the tensions between the two countries, there are still some exchanges and collaborations happening, such as in the areas of science, culture, and sports.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.45454545454545453,0.3333333333333333,0.6923076923076923,0.734375,0.42105263157894735,0.04061057607706963,0.3867822213314971,0.2019138728718913,0.3236989832235018,0.27988338192419815,-0.13041401875306372,0.8511354079058033,0.03743329053894868,0.9104938271604939,0.05822872545690119,-0.2142857142857142,-0.39016794603405985,0.0886699507389163,0.6866612062489909,0.0,0.0,-0.04081632653061248,-0.2894733556140556,0.3829066142365222,0.8731412321726193,-0.4922067268252666,-0.5643660006645702,1.0378151260504205,-0.22499116012229262,0.1545454545454547,-0.16297621221108527,0.5142857142857142,1.057338641652968,1.2276785714285714,0.5333088377551533,0.7011035889826579,0.45165042017205503,-0.5089285714285714,-0.12783720563750917,-0.15384615384615388,-0.4528272240778749,0.3735819062070958,0.3672576856785028,0.5079365079365081,-0.26387399160549035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545454545454545,0.18181818181818182,0.3467908552565855,0.11102275848014283,-0.14715623333661357,-0.24299930399773945,0.30620832820993105,0.3734340754686657

On current projections, the PRI could not win the two-thirds majority that would allow it to change the constitution. Lopez Obrador's leftist coalition was set to win about 11 percent, but the former Mexico City mayor said he would not recognize the results. ""I'm not going to recognize any of these results,"" Lopez Obrador said as he cast his vote Sunday. ""They are not going to be legitimate."" Lopez Obrador, who was leading the polls for much of the year, lost the race by about half a percentage point in 2006. He refused to accept the results, claiming there had been fraud and staging massive protests. There was no indication of irregularities in Sunday's vote, but a survey showed 39 percent of Mexicans believe the election will be fraudulent. The PRI, which ruled Mexico from 1929 until 2000, and the right-wing National Action Party, or PAN, have been battling for the presidency. The PRI had been leading in polls since last year, but the PAN's Pena Nieto had been narrowing the gap. The PAN's candidate is the 45-year-old former governor of the state of Mexico, who's married to a telenovela star. He vows to continue the economic policies of the PAN, but his youth and glamorous marriage to TV starlet Angelica Rivera make him stand out from the party's past leaders. The PRI has presented Pena Nieto as the candidate of the past, a man who won't bring change and would protect corrupt PRI politicians still in power in many states. The PRI's candidate is Enrique Pena Nieto, 45, a telegenic former governor of the State of Mexico who's married to a telenovela star. He vows to continue the economic policies of the PAN, but his youth and glamorous marriage to TV starlet Angelica Rivera make him stand out from the party's past leaders. The PRI is presenting him as the candidate of the past, a man who won't bring change and would protect corrupt PRI politicians still in power in many states. The PRI held onto power in Mexico for seven decades through a combination of patronage and rigged elections. It lost the presidency to the PAN in 2000, but the party remains in control in a number of states. The party has been working to rehabilitate its image, but it's been dogged by allegations of corruption and vote buying. The party's presidential candidate, Josefina Vazquez Mota, is the first woman to run for a major party in a presidential race. The 51-year-old congresswoman and former cabinet official also would be Mexico's first female president. Vazquez Mota has tried to emphasize her experience, but the PAN's Institutional Revolutionary Party has hit her hard over allegations of plagiarism. Vazquez Mota has denied the accusations, but polls show them taking a toll on her support. Lopez Obrador, 58, was the front-runner in the polls until a few months ago, when he began slipping behind Pena Nieto. Lopez Obrador has run on vows to fight poverty and inequality in Mexico, a country that emerged from the recession with solid economic growth but where roughly half the population lives in poverty. The former mayor of Mexico City has pledged to increase pensions for the elderly and increase spending on social programs. Lopez Obrador also has vowed not to raise taxes or cut public salaries, and to increase support prices for corn and beans, a policy bound to appeal to Mexico's millions of subsistence farmers. Lopez Obrador is running at the head of a leftist coalition that includes the Labor Party and the smaller Social Encounter Party. The coalition's called the Progressive Movement, and it's presenting itself as the only group that can break the hold of the country's two main parties. This is the second presidential bid for Lopez Obrador, who narrowly lost the 2006 election. He claimed fraud, and led weeks of protest",llama_65B,4.242424242424242,4.333333333333333,4.446153846153846,4.25,4.368421052631579,-0.3750325169541528,0.014666767564986527,-0.07710604230421081,0.19454548655358658,0.0667105551898176,-0.09549855400214469,0.2256165387015383,-0.1933698376019477,0.09687375547590632,-0.24856372744800972,0.08064516129032251,0.2049993708796926,-0.450500556173526,-0.17482632404434872,0.0,0.0,-0.11981566820276525,0.11698825244090545,0.3894283785048088,0.2515051472604434,-0.11431898171425557,0.10677241397451777,-0.06166982922201134,0.19844914097962904,0.3222873900293256,0.3942123817209496,0.6064516129032258,0.8791557548905804,0.7913306451612903,0.604693194523785,0.12156231583167053,0.12244753813744608,0.7560483870967742,1.5100041678741758,0.11414392059553338,0.12560477891612312,-0.3205573775841532,-0.19456749454109573,0.04915514592933966,-0.06893496252480774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5272727272727273,4.2727272727272725,0.5022722238303473,0.8841534767547871,1.1538095985978918,0.08803720832923193,-0.026984897551315543,-0.015261502728367404

VPNs are services that give users a private connection while using the open internet, ensuring that traffic travels through a secure tunnel and protecting them from surveillance or being snooped on by someone else. The company uses OpenVPN as the protocol for creating their VPN tunnels with user-controlled keys. The default key file is saved in Google Drive so anyone who has access to your account can see it. This means you have no security over how people use and share your data when they connect to your device via Wi-Fi hotspots and the like. If Google wanted to turn this around, it would help prevent people from seeing sensitive information if instead of having all of this stored on your personal computerphone, they were encrypted before leaving your phone. It's not perfect but it could be useful privacy feature on Android (and iOS) devices. I've been testing out the beta version of the app today and have noticed some interesting issues. As mentioned above, there isn't much different between the regular version and the beta version aside from an icon change showing up in Settings-More-Status Bar. You can also still toggle WiFi calling functionality off in the same menu which will disable VoIP calls over cellular networks should your carrier plan allow this kind of functionality. However unlike previous versions where going into ""Settings"" wouldn't make any difference other than just opening the relevant screen, doing this now opens up a new tab within Chrome where we'll find VPN settings: Here you can set most basic things such as your country location and firewall rules for connecting to servers outside the US. There's also options here for enabling automatic reconnection when lost connections occur, enabling encryption for websites visited and more. For example, below I've indicated what happens to my wireless passwords when connected to my work wifi at home compared to other ones used elsewhere (password shown): It appears many options here aren't generally applicable unless you're actually working inside the USA since VPNs don't seem to function properly anywhere else. So even though encrypting outgoing data might be nice, it doesn't seem really practical to enable for every single route across the web. Maybe these settings need to apply globally but they certainly don't right now. Anyway, there's only one setting related specifically to routing traffic over VPNs which comes under the section called Advanced-Network Options: This slider allows us to control whether our device connects directly to the Internet without passing over another router or gateway. By turning this option off completely (leftmost position), we can disconnect ourselves entirely from the world wide web via mobile carriers. Of course, disabling this slider won't do anything bad, but once again, it seems Windows 10 Mobile does something similar making it possible to never pass through a proxy server even without a VPN setup. In addition to the tiny text label explaining what each step does, there's an image indicating visual changes in real time as these settings get changed. Completely skippable and obviously pointless if you're well aware of what network settings do. Either way, you probably already knew how these worked otherwise why would you care about changing them?;) Now let's move onto the actual VPN portion. To start off with, please note that there was nothing wrong with either method of accessing VPN apps in earlier builds of Windows Phone 8.1 however this latest build demonstrates yet another issue with those methods. After launching the VPN client, tapping on the HOME button brings up the recent applications list whereas pressing BACK takes you back to whatever app was previously running. While neither of those actions cause the current software to exit, they both result in the entire system locking up until manually unlocked. Note too that switching tasks away from App Hub causes the same effect. Pressing the power button on your Lumia 950 XL then quickly reactivates everything causing most situations where this bug occurs happen nearly instantaneously after pushing the power button. Once the comfort level returns, I opened up Microsoft Edge and navigated to , forcing the browser to download the webpage. When navigating to several times, Edge insists on updating itself seemingly automatically despite which sites we visit. Both instances indicate a persistent non-issue rather than something more severe. There's nothing super complicated here. Just tap on the top left corner twice to bring up quick settings. From there, scroll down to the bottom and select Enable Location Services. Go ahead and leave the box checked. Now hit Start Search and type ""Disable Foreground Notifications."" Let me repeat myself because apparently nobody else follows my instructions. Hit enter or OK depending on your choice and boom! Your next search results page loads instantly regardless of where you live. The point remains moot unfortunately due to lack of acceptance of windows task switcher advantages overall. Sure, you're able to split focus better with Task View compared to having multiple programs visible at once thanks to the ability to drag windows together successfully.

The Shots regrouped and took a deserved lead in the 42nd minute when Idris Kanu latched on to a through pass and poked the ball under Ryan Clarke. But in the second half Eastleigh's extra man began to tell as they pushed forward and, with 10 minutes left, McAllister fired home from close range after getting on to the end of a flick-on. That was enough to earn Eastleigh their first point in five outings, while Aldershot extended their unbeaten run to 10 games. Report supplied by the Press Association.

They were discovered using Google Earth during a routine search. The figures depict animals, humans, and other patterns that stretch for miles across the desert. While the age of the figures is unknown, it is likely that they are hundreds of years old. The discovery has been called ""one of the most significant finds of its kind"" by experts in the field. Though little is known about the carvings or their creators, archaeologists believe that the figures may have been created by nomadic tribes as a form of artistic expression. Others theorize that they could be related to religious ceremonies, or even ancient astronomical markings. Regardless of their purpose, these mysterious figures offer an intriguing glimpse into India's past. They are a reminder of how civilizations throughout history have left their mark on the landscape, creating lasting monuments of human creativity.",text-davinci-003,0.49242424242424243,0.8333333333333334,0.5846153846153846,0.59375,0.42105263157894735,0.6213623243711259,0.4760557334473562,0.5120512507070378,0.5169601670443928,-0.5850340136054422,-0.2849820080195025,-0.36265769554247274,-0.15999712916378178,-0.36728395061728375,-0.02616464054466479,0.3999999999999999,-0.2201267238042709,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,-0.20000000000000004,-0.043100220606019805,-0.6818800986323986,-0.40698023054789606,-0.7678424938474159,-0.3798937872084666,-0.22941176470588226,-0.09169428816723336,0.6745454545454548,0.5453327608436771,-0.3999999999999999,-0.03207660596625444,-0.12499999999999997,-0.02355492051986225,-0.37684317907817855,-0.2121320343559642,-0.6375,-0.26496927621332883,-0.15384615384615388,-0.3366520764415541,0.41841173495194733,0.46951989924425286,-0.38095238095238076,-0.5859241208629047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.18181818181818182,0.007052798620253078,0.35927734094281616,-0.32718247496334635,-0.14977147184874468,-0.1915791068722254,-0.11382647674125722

The situation surrounding Mr. Bae's detention is complex and controversial, and it is difficult to determine the truth of the matter without further information and investigation.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.09848484848484848,-0.16666666666666666,0.07692307692307693,0.03125,0.21052631578947367,0.6898706636691013,1.0679616469624487,1.0243236271306282,1.1456196233532663,1.0136054421768705,-0.8866613263784757,0.8418839360807401,-0.21416324660245628,0.6049382716049383,-0.3618367485048044,1.5,1.1320146958038402,-0.2327586206896551,-0.24838179920233425,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,-1.061092935780252,1.157909601451243,1.3321082437604679,0.7136997538966364,-0.18092053091921054,0.0,0.1778176277508902,0.6045454545454547,0.421608751362322,2.3,1.0451554033951607,0.39062500000000006,-0.3030904634889381,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,2.0624999999999996,1.9203512401195153,0.07692307692307684,-0.10331175589616348,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,0.06349206349206366,0.36644995143405246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,-0.18181818181818182,-0.21088198101572017,0.2656306595336309,-0.5556312618817997,-1.2628410904564462,1.3713335288059596,1.3789935829885405

The bottles are sealed, but witnesses say some have leaked. The National Trust said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: ""While it is fact that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container containing bottles of'Vanish', there is no currently available evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from this container; all evidence is currently circumstantial."" It is thought the vessel lost the container near Land's End in May. The BBC has contacted Vanish, but the company is yet to comment. Other nearby coves including Gunwalloe, Polurrian, Church Cove and Marazion have also been affected, conservationists said. Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was ""highly concerned"" about the impact on ""sensitive marine life."" Justin Whitehouse, from the National Trust, said: ""The main worry is all that detergent going into our beautiful marine environment, but thankfully most are full. ""We think it's a container that has gone overboard from a container ship, during stormy seas."" Cornwall Council said the authority and partners, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Natural England, would be monitoring beaches in the area. It said: ""The National Trust who own the beach at Poldhu have arranged for the bottles to be cleared away. ""In the meantime the public are advised to keep children and dogs at a safe distance from the bottles should any more be washed up.

Swift had argued that Apple could not offer both free downloads and paid streams of songs included in its iTunes Match service without paying artists compensation for each play, but on Wednesday it said all music would cost 99 cents with no limits placed on how many times they were played. The row has underlined the growing power wielded by musicians as their audience expands into areas such as mobile devices where users are less likely than ever before pay any attention to royalties issues.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's history was an understandable challenge. The FA Cup win over Milton Keynes Dons at Stadium MK on Saturday will surely be seen by some fans as evidence that Grant McCann has turned things around under his management since being appointed following Derrek Moore's departure to join Sheffield Wednesday last month; however, this is far from any kind of guarantee and there can still be no guarantees during what remains of the season when so much hangs upon results of late. Whether or not you agree with the negative sentiment among supporters towards Craig Shakespeare - he left Leicester City after all - it did seem inevitable that he would ultimately take up another role within football given the situation the game finds itself in currently. Even if we are looking forward to another stint managing England (despite never having managed anything else), I am sure many people across sport have considered how best they could move into coaching roles elsewhere. For someone like me though, there seems only ever going to be two options: work somewhere where your job title inevitably comes before your personal name, or become self-employed and potentially earn less but also gain total control. Since coming out of retirement earlier this year, I find myself thinking about my dream career scenario quite often: working closely alongside Garry Monk at Leeds United. It might sound odd considering both men were once members of our own staff here at Madejski Stadium, but these days their paths diverge significantly... When I started writing for these pages back in December 2011, my first post became something of a diary entry entitled 'The Impact Of A Football Club Manager On An Individual Player Or Coach In Their Career Path,"" which looked at just such a relationship between Geoff Thomas and John Beckwith at Millwall. If memory serves correctly, that original piece came out from rehearsals for a production of Henry V directed by Stephen Unwin, but as it progressed through several drafts, it eventually spoke most truthfully about my time spent working as a journalist covering Southampton FC in the mid 2000s. With hindsight, I suppose I should acknowledge the fact that then I was simply performing the same sort of function which Steve Bower now does at Reading, too, although I don't recall feeling any similar sense of unease while heading off each day to cover matches for the Daily Echo way back then! Brett Holman's 'hungry' goalscoring form makes him the latest player to catch eyes in England Charles Aranguiz celebrates scoring Brighton Hove Albion's winner against Aston Villa in League One actionPhoto: GETTY IMAGES Aston Villa welcome newly promoted Brentford tomorrow at Villa Park knowing that victory will ensure them safety from relegation in 21st place. And with Bristol Rovers visiting Wolves in top spot, David Ospina says promotion rivals must unite for big push on Championship survival. Here, Paul Wilson previews crucial games and gives a few bold predictions ahead of the weekend's action... Paul Warneby (pwarnerfootball) Brighton v Brentford - it doesn't get much bigger than this in terms of significance both locally and further afield - unless you fancy seeing Borussia Monchengladbach hold Bayern Munich to a draw at home this week. Having claimed the Championship play-off crown courtesy of a fightback against Stoke yesterday, Brighton may well argue that the player-friendly nature of their 6-3 victory means they deserve the chance of facing Premier League opposition in Tuesday night's EFL Cup semi-final second leg in south coast style rather than traditionally playing everything ""behind closed doors"" in front of sparse crowds such as those afforded to Nottingham Forest a couple of years ago in the Capital One cup final. That said, I'm told the atmosphere inside the Amex will remain relatively reserved until Brighton's players do achieve their goal of returning to the Premier league next term. There will be plenty of scarves aloft in Sussex tonight regardless of whether Brighton go onto the Wembley pitch in proper white shirts with blue trim. But if Graham Potter and co manage to advance past West Ham via penalty shootouts, the decision over shirt colour will enter the realm of practicality whilst also serving to highlight whatever divisional divide exists today between the competition's three English divisions. At least, I hope it won't come to pass because despite enjoying roughly four times the amount of money available to everyone involved compared to other clubs in lower reaches of the pyramid, it seems unthinkable that Brighton shouldn't approach the contest as equals. As it stands, though, this fixture represents a significant moment in BrightonHove Albion lore as one helluva story unfolds for Michael Appleton and his gaggle of followers. From the west London suburb of Croydon to the East Midlands town of Letchworth Garden City lies more than 160 miles yet the latter is the spiritual heartland of coastal side Brighton Hove Albion whose brand values include ""passing test!"" nd to score two patterns the necessary real objects.

It is the first time that activity in the sector has declined in three years. The decline was driven by a drop in new orders, which fell for the first time in seven months, as clients cut back on investment and delayed decisions due to the ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The decline in manufacturing output is a worrying signal for the UK economy, which has already been hit by slower global growth and weak consumer spending.

In the letter, she tells the burglars ""how much they hurt me,"" that she cries for two hours each night, and they had made her ""scared of the dark again."" Paris wrote the letter after speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield. More on this and other stories from BBC South Yorkshire Gemma Mulholland said the letter helped her daughter tell the thieves ""how she feels, and how it's affected her."" She said: ""I really am super proud of her."" Paris' new iPhone, a laptop she got for Christmas, and birthday money was taken from her bedroom, as well as her grandmother's gold watch. Cash, jewellery and other items were taken in the robbery, along with Paris' and her younger brother Thomas' belongings. Ms Mulholland said Paris was too upset to sleep in her bedroom after seeing it ransacked. Lego models were broken and photos taken on Paris' phone during a recent trip to Disneyland may have been lost forever. Paris wrote: ""To my burgler [sic]. I hope you are happy with yourself, I can no longer sleep in my own bed [...] ""Why could you not have left when you saw to [sic] picture of a happy family and when you saw my birthday card, but anyway thank you for scaring me so much I cry 2 hours straight nearly every night."" Ms Mulholland called the thieves ""despicable human beings"" but said the community had rallied round. PC Adam Watkinson of South Yorkshire Police said: ""Burglary is a highly intrusive crime which can have a huge impact on the victim. In this case, a young girl has been left feeling scared and upset after her home was broken into. ""I would like to reassure Paris and her mum that we are doing everything we can to find the person responsible for this incident. ""It is totally unacceptable that someone should feel scared in their own home and lose valuable possessions.""",human,1.7651515151515151,2.0,1.9384615384615385,2.03125,2.736842105263158,-0.7762859994111547,-0.7683546598322146,-0.7833322759138112,-0.7947327102267553,-0.1648659463785513,0.26593975887319315,0.060950873200415354,0.7251609719980218,0.12835875090777074,0.7125930115992628,0.02941176470588225,-0.02957353835447945,0.42900608519269773,0.7314470234440018,0.058823529411764705,0.23529411764705885,-0.5630252100840337,-0.022203845659903357,-0.021442770397245223,0.2239197529796132,0.03474400424648928,0.3954900298028101,-0.3823529411764707,-0.39111736106656597,0.2133689839572195,0.42369472848470086,0.3294117647058823,0.7302480718436561,-0.5055147058823528,0.16781299189951307,-0.35570696793973083,-0.18859626122455034,0.03308823529411769,0.8904012600437953,1.366515837104072,1.8171669092781257,0.3076556874646672,0.6339532367572359,0.5602240896358543,0.6200941192376735,0.0,0.0,0.29411764705882354,0.9557692240748189,1.0363636363636364,1.8181818181818181,0.2238096092327535,0.5020154277351537,0.47740219884785157,0.7970162210867768,-0.6276733759868579,-0.6503521762787905

It was in the air for 29 minutes during its maiden flight and reached an altitude of 7,500 feet. The X-47B is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), and its purpose is to demonstrate the capabilities of autonomous aerial refueling and precision landing on an aircraft carrier deck. It is powered by a single Pratt Whitney F100-PW-220 engine and is designed to fly autonomously from takeoff to landing. It is expected that the X-47B will eventually be used as part of the Navy's Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS).",text-davinci-003,-0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.015625,0.21052631578947367,-0.1522896602890124,0.5977705693593359,0.47784321012403397,0.7722040717127348,-0.16326530612244886,-0.37623165598542224,0.0,-0.6546323001373068,-0.0820987654320987,-0.7541161797978766,-0.10000000000000009,0.46338016856618236,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,-0.028571428571428848,0.9778373946912219,0.4502981783421501,0.37028221554869645,-0.4922067268252666,0.020323480964836868,0.07647058823529419,-0.5738080306222657,0.9545454545454548,-0.31826836247799734,0.40000000000000013,0.7885161734510571,0.3437500000000002,-0.06360446328962716,-0.017527589724566396,0.31819805153394654,-0.037500000000000026,-0.026767332592180663,-0.15384615384615388,-0.3366520764415541,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515511,-0.025396825396825307,0.2088810101811311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2727272727272727,0.09972929235072743,-0.029799032372695048,-0.5036762112747859,-0.2966553708294066,0.12046688368625806,0.005519142804172949
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Mark McCarroll, a father-of-one, was working as a fork lift driver at Hayes Fuels depot in Belfast's Harbour estate when the accident happened. Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk assessment expert Brian Rodgers both attended the inquest. At the inquest it was determined that the accident was caused by a lack of proper risk assessments and safety procedures in place at the depot, as well as inadequate training for the staff working there. It was also revealed that there had been several other incidents at the depot in the run up to Mark's death, including two previous fork lift accidents. The coroner found that Hayes Fuels had failed to take appropriate action in response to these incidents and that this failure had contributed to the fatal accident. The coroner made a number of recommendations to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including the adoption of a formal safety policy, proper risk assessments, improved staff training and a review of machinery used at the depot. Hayes Fuels has since implemented the recommendations in full and has taken steps to ensure that all employees understand their responsibilities when it comes to health and safety.",text-davinci-003,0.7348484848484849,0.3333333333333333,0.7538461538461538,0.703125,0.21052631578947367,0.24419599785767562,0.7394277208628064,0.6284758419619956,0.6319757236018863,0.9990281827016517,0.11851179536758803,0.9991589571068126,0.5203984172592504,0.8364197530864197,0.5198735084565274,0.0714285714285714,0.23142643343018043,-0.12561576354679801,0.7212718776444758,0.0,0.0,1.5510204081632655,0.9073103116791347,0.1807319219196384,0.49706046480335575,0.39376538146021306,0.48105567087271306,0.9285714285714288,0.9136527877441761,0.1545454545454547,0.3569789441403687,0.5142857142857142,0.44096873574882733,1.4955357142857142,1.4257677262174746,-0.32551238059909116,-0.15917634141086548,0.13392857142857142,-0.12783720563750917,-0.2857142857142858,-0.09876011632224538,1.270178481104126,0.7406382483185315,-0.12698412698412692,0.3495605622726029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.45454545454545453,0.5267978961850361,0.11331683704652253,0.07179889549095714,-0.9136770982409667,1.1254238402113885,1.1882491320314958

It is based in Aigle, Switzerland and was founded in 1900. The UCI is responsible for regulating, promoting and developing the sport of professional cycling and is also responsible for the coordination of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The UCI has introduced a number of rules and regulations over the years in order to ensure fair play and protect the health of cyclists. In 2011, the UCI banned the use of intravenous injections in professional cycling. This decision was made after it was revealed that some teams had been using performance-enhancing drugs. Team Sky, which is owned by British billionaire and cycling enthusiast Sir Dave Brailsford, has been at the centre of controversy due to allegations of doping. Former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman has alleged that he was ordered to get triamcinolone, a powerful corticosteroid, for riders. The UCI has since launched an investigation into the matter. If found guilty, Team Sky could face severe sanctions including suspension, fines, disqualification and expulsion from the UCI. The UCI has the power to impose these sanctions on any team or rider who is found to have violated its rules.

She also said the UK government should not be ""so fixated on getting Brexit through by a particular date"" that it forgot to ""focus on the most important things.""

The weather is expected to remain dry for most of the day. An Aberdeen nursery is to close its doors after 30 years of caring for children in the city. Hilton Nursery has been run by the same family for three decades and provides childcare for more than 70 families in the area. A spokesperson for the nursery said it was with ""great sadness"" that they were shutting after 30 years. It is understood the closure is because the nursery has been unable to secure a long-term lease with its current landlord. Aberdeen Council has been approached for comment. The Scottish government is to establish a task force to address the problem of women being jailed for non-payment of fines. The task force is to be led by former Labour MSP and Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC. It follows a report by Holyrood's justice committee which found that more than 40 of women in Scottish prisons had been jailed for failing to pay fines, while 39 were serving sentences for shoplifting. The committee said in its report that most of the women it spoke to had been fined for offences which were ""survival crimes"" - such as shoplifting or benefit fraud. The report said that women's prisons are ""seriously overcrowded"" and the population has grown significantly in recent years. It also found that Scotland's prison population is made up of a disproportionate number of young women, with almost half of women in prison aged under 30, and that the use of remand to custody had increased significantly. The Scottish government's report said that many of the problems faced by women in prison could be linked to a ""lack of community support"" and that they ""may have experienced trauma, abuse, mental health problems or addiction."" Ms Thomson said: ""This review aims to identify the range of factors that lead to the increased use of imprisonment for women, including those associated with offending behaviour and the court system, and to make recommendations for improvement. ""I look forward to engaging with the Scottish government and other stakeholders to identify and implement solutions to what is clearly a complex problem.""

The model was trained on millions of images from the OpenImages dataset, and is capable of quickly understanding what is in an image and generating captions that accurately describe it. It can also be used to generate creative captions for images.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death of the country's Prime Minister in mysterious circumstances has been a cause for deep concern, and with his successor yet to be named, there is a fear that political competition could destabilise the fragile nation. The potential for violence and civil unrest is a key worry, as any unrest could result in a refugee crisis, which would put immense strain on Ethiopia's neighbouring countries. The death of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has left a power vacuum in a region already destabilised by pandemic-induced economic turmoil, and the threat of a power struggle is looming large. To prevent an escalation of violence, the international community must act quickly to ensure that a stable transition of power takes place. This should include mediation efforts, direct diplomatic support and increased funding for peacekeeping operations, if necessary. The African Union has already called for peaceful negotiations between all parties involved, and has promised to provide additional financial support to ensure security and stability during the transition. Furthermore, the United Nations has committed to supporting Ethiopia's democratic process, and has urged all sides to refrain from violence. In order to ensure that a peaceful transition of power takes place, it is essential that the international community comes together and provides the necessary support to safeguard democracy in Ethiopia. It is also crucial that all parties involved remain committed to a peaceful resolution, and work together to ensure that Ethiopia remains politically stable and secure.",text-davinci-003,1.2878787878787878,0.8333333333333334,1.1692307692307693,1.125,0.8421052631578947,0.969765515766324,0.9350242112145406,1.1261025138455216,0.8363024345126864,0.8435374149659861,0.12492335139196666,0.6216989066442389,0.5002505318819717,0.5141975308641977,0.3236811329294497,1.6,0.2868363666801078,0.36724137931034484,0.3348100772212373,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,0.32517177118260293,-0.11579096014512427,-0.15464003864236897,0.6103363412633305,-0.05424262864042646,0.22941176470588226,-0.09169428816723336,0.6745454545454548,0.2437401538855851,0.8,0.42058030815965,1.1875000000000002,0.6770601432138524,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,1.0125,1.3380618882957374,-0.5230769230769231,-0.3000325675736511,0.8891249367728881,0.5133324329923585,0.15238095238095262,-0.552036242984288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9454545454545454,1.3636363636363635,0.1904539483519595,0.5133382696944613,0.39744781570468013,-1.2798664640573594,1.2976142090842087,1.213225763168895

The new version will be called Beyond Burger 2.0. The company says it's the fastest product to ever launch, with Impossible Foods taking three years and two product launches to get their version out.

But he was confronted by so-called ""paedophile hunters"" and later arrested, Newport Crown Court heard. He was given an immediate jail term after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence. Simut, of Woolwich, London, was jailed for 18 months by Judge Daniel Williams. Judge Williams said: ""This is not the first occasion on which you have been caught communicating with a child in such circumstances. ""You must have appreciated the seriousness of this matter."" In September 2017 Simut was caught in an online sting operation by a group calling themselves 'Dark Justice', the court heard. He was given a 10-week jail term suspended for two years and ordered to take part in a sex offenders' treatment programme. Prosecutor David Williams said the 'Dark Justice' group set up a fake profile on social media and Simut made contact. He asked for pictures and arranged to meet at Newcastle railway station. Simut was arrested and said he was travelling to Newcastle to go to a gym and had not intended to meet anyone. Simut pleaded guilty to attempting to incite a girl aged 13 to 15 to engage in sexual activity. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court sentenced him to 10 weeks jail suspended for two years with a 25-day rehabilitation activity requirement. The court heard he had two previous convictions for possessing indecent images of children. He was caught in an online sting operation by a group calling themselves 'Dark Justice', the court heard.

The performers, including one as young as 13, were abused, with one punched and another threatened with an airgun, said the troupe's manager Jan Hayes. ""We may not return to Formby next year,"" she said. ""We've been going for five years and we have never had any trouble like this. ""It started off with these teenagers trying take their hats or telling the children they are not real elves. ""Later on, a gang of about 20 cornered our group and one member was punched in the stomach as they were abused."" Ms Hayes said the one of the performers had an airgun held to his head. ""It was a very traumatic experience,"" she added. ""The group member is extremely upset by this."" The elves have received dozens of messages of support via social media from parents. One local mother, Nicola Cowie, said: ""Starkidz bring so much to our community, they bring magic to life. ""Her Elves give it their all, they live and breath as elves while they're dressed in those costumes. I'd be so disgusted if my child acted they way those youths did.""

Trump threatened to'strongly regulate' the industry last week, and will sign the order later today. The president will order the Treasury to create new rules on how the companies operate in the US. Critics say the president is going too far in his attacks on the firms. Trump has long complained that the firms discriminate against him and his fellow Republicans, with a more recent focus on the alleged social media blocking of the users he has appointed to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The order will instruct the Treasury to ensure that online platforms are not unfairly manipulating political content, according to a draft that was published by US news website CNN. The Department of Justice is also expected to examine whether tech companies are violating anti-trust laws.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Norway is building the world's first ship tunnel to help vessels navigate the Stadhavet Sea. The tunnel will cost around 2.8 billion Norwegian kroner and take between three to four years to complete. The tunnel will be 1.7 kilometers long, 37 meters tall, and 26.5 meters wide, and it will be able to accommodate ships up to 16,000 tons. It will be built through the rugged Stadhavet Peninsula in western Norway, which is notorious for its unpredictable weather and dangerous sea conditions. The tunnel will provide a safer and more reliable shipping route for vessels in the region, reducing the risk of accidents and saving time and money for shipping companies.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System, which is also known as the ""Pain Ray"" is a type of ""directed energy weapon."" The Pain Ray is a device that uses microwaves to send a beam of energy that causes pain by heating up the skin. It is often seen as a less-than-lethal weapon that the military could use to stop vehicles or crowds of people. The new Pain Ray device was displayed at the China International Exhibition on Police Equipment on October 21st, 2015 in Beijing. The device is reportedly capable of disrupting an individual's ability to concentrate in 3 seconds by sending a beam of energy that causes a burning sensation on the skin. The microwave beam produced by the device can reach a range of 80 meters and has an accuracy of 1 meter. The Pain Ray is designed to be mounted on a vehicle or at a fixed point and be used to stop individuals or crowds of people. The weapon was also designed to be able to function under a wide range of weather conditions. The Pain Ray is said to be non-lethal, but it is possible that the beam could cause permanent damage if it were to be aimed at a person's eyes. The video below from China Central Television, or CCTV, features the Pain Ray being tested.",llama_65B,1.106060606060606,1.0,1.1538461538461537,1.171875,0.6842105263157895,-0.9248811076088764,-0.021978238578426377,-0.19186117289073723,0.07739197076429388,0.2127396413110697,-0.3832408626059359,0.3061396131202691,-0.10763083915051988,0.3044332210998881,-0.07628200311413406,-0.045454545454545414,1.0753656741616158,-0.3009404388714733,-0.25203338412309073,0.0,0.0,0.025974025974025948,0.06570601711909616,0.23587047436969766,0.8638555897510026,0.2595271832351404,-0.008482808977345876,0.24331550802139054,-0.15261682251107084,1.081818181818182,0.9934419341815826,0.25454545454545463,1.150837991902339,1.0085227272727275,-0.03806713757698657,-0.06108099449470122,0.15148809592827098,0.6988636363636361,1.3138745212580336,-0.48951048951048953,-0.1718390585374744,-0.09509357612544259,0.20743024716402034,-0.30014430014430005,0.30402690124896686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.8181818181818182,0.7778917179864913,0.18675243351149917,0.39744781570468013,0.12636993205688565,0.020109910039201307,0.012149759859370612

Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated ""inadequate."" The hospital said it was ""extremely sorry"" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the AE department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already ""turned a corner"" since the inspection. He said: ""A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. ""There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely."" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said ""urgent action"" was needed. ""The important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,"" he added Tottenham MP David Lammy said the ""damning"" report is ""even worse than I feared"" and demanded answers from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: ""It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal."" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement. The trust is now required to improve the care of patients in the emergency department by 26 August 2016 following a warning from the CQC. A full inspection of the trust will take place in September.",human,2.6515151515151514,2.6666666666666665,2.876923076923077,3.109375,2.1578947368421053,-0.20102235158149628,0.049425363445989044,-0.0665952549171547,-0.1368969845383681,0.08551992225461581,1.0081435996663581,0.3083823941687691,0.9924354638149292,0.4660493827160493,1.2032741473021649,0.0714285714285714,0.47481683977528455,0.5886699507389163,0.7922937592123409,0.0,0.0,0.061224489795918144,0.7966817219018104,-0.15622589860850108,0.4913635259582488,0.06562756357670198,0.5607030851950994,0.20028011204481794,0.6073115965609313,0.22121212121212144,0.3604703802064363,-0.05714285714285716,1.2812411497135339,0.5580357142857142,0.9077496399751934,0.30186404525642213,0.5218784757283917,-0.22321428571428573,0.2307539205009737,0.021978021978021896,0.7295404072469657,0.0,0.13150117184484977,0.1269841269841273,0.6233455591329142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.690909090909091,1.9090909090909092,0.2932632227111479,0.9038078779920878,0.15786325297601242,0.07105538089769285,-0.005940741481668597,0.25755140646744107

In January 2013, Amnesty International named him among 10 people who should be released immediately due to their political status in prison for peaceful activities. The United Nations Commission Against Torture (UNCAT) called him a prisoner of conscience.

He's moving the ball around with ease, his body language suggesting a kind of confidence that belies his years. He's part of a group of young people who meet here every Saturday afternoon to play five-a-side football. They come from all over Glasgow, some from as far away as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld. The sense of camaraderie between them is palpable. They banter, joke and encourage each other, but when the whistle blows it's time for business. The game begins in earnest and the players show off their skills. The ball zips around the pitch, bodies collide and the atmosphere is electric. There are no referees or rules; just an unspoken understanding that everyone is playing by the same set of rules. At the end of the match, the score doesn't matter; what matters is that everyone had a good time and they've made some new friends. That's why they come back week after week - not to win, but to enjoy each other's company. For these young people, five-a-side football isn't just about the game, it's about community. It's about building relationships and having fun. It's about developing skills and feeling accepted. In these few hours on the pitch, they find an escape from the pressures of everyday life and can just be themselves.",text-davinci-003,1.121212121212121,1.6666666666666667,1.6923076923076923,1.515625,1.7894736842105263,-0.9383008101677818,-0.5027435323195105,-0.9188166774127382,-0.6110094993014353,-0.5804988662131517,-0.05362112115778855,0.1381553125876086,0.29946676516757703,-0.0820987654320987,0.16357336870131264,-0.6333333333333333,-0.366551161471365,-0.08275862068965516,0.6684004716762373,0.0,0.0,-0.20000000000000004,0.18168843259411863,-0.7762282883802778,-0.4069802305478959,-0.5840853158326497,-0.1837054360640763,-0.12745098039215677,0.0687371998340921,-0.2587878787878788,-0.038217638154477464,0.40000000000000013,0.13209880603981147,0.4687500000000002,1.1425051419386303,-0.17722340721506072,0.07794616713991123,-0.23749999999999996,1.3888437913358018,0.523076923076923,0.014607177891928001,-0.10460293373798682,-0.04170566036065527,0.033862433862434135,0.26535981729807234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6181818181818182,2.090909090909091,0.2187379417466657,0.24198549680750397,1.283735818557882,1.0883964804199677,-1.0353784322220734,-0.7677289089199953

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Physicists predict that information can be transmitted across two black holes paired via quantum entanglement. If the theory is correct, it might offer clues on how to unite quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two pillars of modern physics, into a single framework known as quantum gravity. This would represent a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe, as it could help us explain phenomena at both the largest and smallest scales. The idea behind transmitting information through entangled black holes is that, by manipulating one of the black holes, we could affect the other one instantaneously, regardless of the distance that separates them. This violates the laws of classical physics, but is allowed by quantum mechanics, which allows for particles to be linked in a way that goes beyond our everyday experience of the world. If scientists can demonstrate that information can indeed be transmitted in this way, it would provide strong evidence for the existence of quantum gravity, which remains a theoretical concept that has yet to be proven experimentally. It could also lead to the development of new technologies, such as quantum computers and communication systems, that would be more powerful and secure than anything we have today.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.7727272727272727,0.3333333333333333,0.9384615384615385,1.0,0.3157894736842105,0.6666232764466197,1.434055836444539,0.8712474137310475,1.3367434324872394,1.0962099125364428,-0.05351538893439052,1.44322960470984,0.19377000888538928,1.5401234567901236,0.44489653682018293,1.7857142857142856,0.5005391220764402,0.5172413793103448,0.977798419745419,0.0,0.0,0.8163265306122446,-0.42464343348474864,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.6890894175553732,0.0350757101824831,0.9285714285714288,-0.3266761907145283,1.754545454545455,0.3569789441403687,0.5142857142857142,1.057338641652968,0.5580357142857142,0.43532127595848197,0.016692942594825184,-0.00543942672208677,-0.29464285714285715,-0.01358852722025258,1.4285714285714284,0.6742400712631064,1.270178481104126,0.23929561512071346,0.38095238095238115,-0.19370027891729757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5818181818181818,0.36363636363636365,0.15697297308817337,0.2842648256224315,-0.2592957503633144,-1.1647510421975233,1.3457630953279747,1.4124145128414773

Pooley, 33, retired from cycling after winning two silver medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon and other endurance events. ""This is a truly rare opportunity that I can't resist,"" she said. Pooley won silver in the time trial at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before finishing sixth in the event at London 2012, where she also helped Armitstead win a silver medal in the road race. The 29.8km time trial course in Rio features the 1.2km, 7 average gradient Grumari climb and the ""impressively hilly nature"" of the terrain persuaded Pooley, renowned for her climbing abilities, to come out of retirement and target a gold medal. ""I've decided it's worth a serious attempt at targeting that event,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday. ""If I can prove to both myself and the GB team selectors that I have the capacity to win the time trial in Rio, I'll compete for selection for the Olympic team - I'm happy knowing I won't get selected unless I really do have the potential to win. ""I have no desire to go to the Rio Games, and sacrifice some of the most exciting triathlon races of the season, just for the experience of another Olympics - I'm committed to aiming for gold."" After turning to multi-sport events in August 2014, Pooley won the world long-distance duathlon title at the first attempt a month later, breaking the course record by 16 minutes. She successfully defended her crown in September and is aiming to make it three consecutive wins next year, adding that long-distance triathlon and duathlon remain her ""main focus"" in 2016. Yet after studying the Rio courses, British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton says he approached Pooley about a return, believing she could also improve world champion Armistead's chances of winning gold in the road race. ""I'm really pleased that Emma saw the value in the opportunity and is back with us,"" he added. ""Having her talent and experience in the team enhances our medal prospects in the time trial and Lizzie Armitstead's opportunity to win the road race. ""The road race field is likely to fall away from behind, but as a pure mountain climber, I don't see Emma falling away. It would be great to see her in the road race supporting Lizzie."" Meanwhile, former Tour de France champion Sir Bradley Wiggins says he wants to keep riding beyond this season, having previously claimed he would retire at the end of 2016. The four-time Olympic gold medallist, 35, is set to compete in the team pursuit on the track at Rio and could continue racing into 2017. ""I will see how I feel this time next year,"" he said. ""There might be other opportunities. If I haven't got a job by this time next year I will keep racing.""",human,2.8863636363636362,2.5,3.0923076923076924,3.0,3.6842105263157894,-0.6523935666573621,-0.18118511876639828,-0.41897978174387285,-0.1760362730057055,0.44217687074829926,0.7269920040676789,0.634650967199327,0.7508871365070083,0.5271604938271603,0.5704975756398788,0.10000000000000009,0.2048474683591807,0.36724137931034484,0.43738213771331585,0.0,0.0,0.37857142857142834,0.9786215629459786,-0.021442770397245223,0.13998701213534162,0.5414273995077932,0.5402965008911055,0.22941176470588226,0.7039286097749341,0.2545454545454547,0.7988548638596689,0.19999999999999996,0.6799584845949693,0.765625,1.1902306502642988,0.4615598627469165,0.7066016017953877,0.3374999999999999,0.7741050268744057,0.8615384615384615,1.0972409696534196,0.026150733434496705,0.14413235579654746,0.9079365079365083,0.17096848616939023,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.21794494717703364,1.5454545454545454,1.9090909090909092,0.3608361781988496,0.8275888205419059,0.12472445364531817,0.22717251022224005,0.06637792170282814,0.05863445761034094

On Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency cited unnamed Iranian officials as saying Tehran also had signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in redesigning and operating the Arak facility. Iran says it needs higher quality fuel than is available from Russia for its research reactors because this will be necessary when it starts using them to produce medical isotopes in 2024. ""The AEOI has made every effort over recent years to negotiate a solution with observers present which meets our requirements,"" Mr Rouhani said after signing the deal at a televised ceremony flanked by ministers and senior nuclear scientists and engineers. ""In these negotiations there have been ups and downs but today's event is very important."" He did not elaborate further or take questions. Mr Zarif tweeted: This] legal step under [the 2015 multinational accord known as] JCPOA can ALSO be reversed within DAYS if other parties live up to their obligations."" The president added he wanted new talks with world powers about his country's ballistic missile programme. Tehran insists its missiles are defensive weapons and non-negotiable. But Western countries fear they may be used against regional rivals rather than Israel, whom most Gulf Arabs see as the main threat from Iran despite decades of animosity between their mainly Shia Muslim nations. In April 2018, President Donald Trump pulled out unilaterally of the global deal reached three years earlier with Iran, calling it deeply flawed and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Under the pact, Tehran agreed to limit its disputed uranium enrichment activities in exchange for relief from international economic sanctions crippling its economy. European states disagreed with Washington's decision to exit the pact and have since tried unsuccessfully to find ways to blunt the effects of US sanctions while preserving the deal.

The researchers believe that the technology could be used to produce food in areas where natural sunlight is limited or unavailable, such as space missions or certain parts of the world.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"iRobot has announced today it's first autonomous lawnmower robot. Unlike other autonomous lawnmower robots which require a wire to be laid down to define the robot's boundaries, iRobot's lawnmower robot is fully mobile and can travel at up to 10mph on its own power source. The 599 mowing bot has two main features: an optical sensor system that enables the robot to navigate around obstacles within 1 meter of itself, as well as movement sensors that allow the machine to turn left or right when navigating through an obstacle free space. The cutting zone ends directly beneath the sensor systems so there's no need for the user to manually place a boundary line. In addition to being able to automatically cut grass with zero human interaction (meaning you don't have to keep pushing buttons), iRobot says the robot will also automatically stop if it encounters something unexpected such as bushes, small trees or rocks. It'll even alert users via its app, letting them know how much time remains until the blade stops rotating. Unlike most modern robotic lawnmowers, which depend upon GPS tracking to find their way about your yard, the iRobot GrassBot does not use any kind of triangulation technology based navigation. Instead it relies only on simple movement sensors placed throughout the unit. According to Robotic Industries Association estimates from 2014, between 25-30 million Americans spend approximately 11 billion annually just maintaining their lawns. This allows the company to offer this affordable solution without having to charge too high of an entry fee or force people who do not desire automated lawn care services out of business by forcing pricing above what they're willing to pay. Of course, whether it's cost effective in terms of the savings it offers versus hiring someone else to take care of it is another story entirely - but we imagine many homeowners are already using some form of automatic gardening service anyways.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"There is a gene that codes for a protein called cytochrome P450, which exists in many mammals' livers, helping them clean up toxins. Scientists spliced this gene from a rabbit's DNA into the DNA of a potato, and created the GM ""New Leaf"" potato, which has the ability to produce this protein. This protein cleans up the insecticide, Bt, which exists in nature, and is harmless to humans, but is toxic to insects. Since Bt is naturally occurring, it is allowed in organic farming. The GM potato produces its own Bt, which kills the insects that try to eat it. The New Leaf Potato is a type of pesticide producing potato, which produces Bt toxin, a natural occurring insecticide that is allowed in organic farming. This is not what is meant by the term ""frankenfood."" GM potatoes are not a part of the ""frankenfood"" controversy, since they aren't genetically engineered to do something that is not found in nature, and they do not affect the DNA of humans.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Clocking into work every day can result in a vague sense of dissatisfaction when the work doesn't seem meaningful. This article discusses four different ways to ignite motivation for work. The hardest part about earning your daily salary is that it's never yet-so easy, and you have no idea how long you'll still be working once this paycheck runs out. For many people at least half their life (theoretically) as an employee lies before them; if they're lucky enough to find satisfaction from their function within the company or organization where they are employed full time, then even better! But let's face facts: most of us will spend up to 50 of our adult lives serving others outside of the home - either providing care for aging parents, taking care of children who need us while we try to earn money elsewhere, having other commitments like going to school or getting married during which we must scramble to meet those needs on top of our own, finding jobs suitable for our skills and interests so we don't start starving just because society assumes we do... just listing off all the possibilities makes me exhausted already! The point being: there isn't anything very appealing about waking up every morning figuring out what else you could possibly accomplish on top of staying alive through another day. That being said, despite this perception, we should not underestimate the value of saving a few pennies each hour by diligently working towards something more productive than watching Netflix until bedtime tonight! There are multiple paths to the goal of becoming financially stable without waking up with dread, but some require more focus and persistence than others, depending on personal skill sets and priorities. So here I'd like to talk about 4 different strategies robots cannot implement a solution to feeling motivated to wake up early every day to go to work, and become rich in the process. These may sound pretty ridiculous, maybe too absurdly simple or obvious to be worth mentioning in detail, and that's okay, haha. Let's dive right in, shall we? TLDR version, first option is: get paid overtime, second strategy involves making yourself feel indispensible somehow, third method uses market forces fourth strategy works well for naturally late risers, see why below. Also note that one of these methods requires a bit of luck involved, since in order to get any sort of financial reward, you really need to be willing to put the hours and effort required for the sake of putting food on the table, and not expect automatic rewards upon completion. I'm sure lots of readers will say ""duh"" at this point and roll their eyes while shrugging their shoulders, saying ""obviously,"" but hey, sometimes things suck less using alternative perspectives, right? And hey, nothing beats learning new stuff along the way! Oh yeah also, remember kids: ""If you ever use 'that' you'll pay a heavy price!"" Now onto the explanations! Get Paid Overtime First Option Why would anyone want to get paid extra for doing exactly what everyone around them does for free anyways? Well look, normally in America we refer to ourselves as laborers rather than slaves, however mankind has been enslaved by money since the beginning of time, and slavery still exists today due to governments attempting to control populations via currency manipulation. While it might be ideal to live in a country where basic necessities were provided for free as a matter of course, there's little reason to believe such countries exist anywhere in modern history besides socialist utopias, leaving only us living in noncommunist societies trapped behind high walls guarded by armed guards patrolling the streets at night in search of potential thieves. Regardless of what you think about capitalism vs socialism (I think both systems basically end up failing miserably), if you've got a job, you haven't had a choice about whether or not you'll earn money for doing whatever duty comes next to you, unless you quit checking emails after lunch break whenever you feel lazy, or refuse to buy groceries for a month straight when someone else is footing the bill, etc. If you've accepted this reality of life, then you probably understand why feeling underpaid for the excessive number of hours you work really sucks - especially if you didn't ask for it in the first place! We all know the story of the slave who worked 2x as hard as hisher neighbor simply because he (or she) came from a wealthy family instead, and went to good schools, and was able to skip the actual dirty work altogether. However, many successful entrepreneurs find themselves pressured into accepting substandard employment conditions at earlier stages of career progression, due to fears of losing status among peers for choosing self-employment over corporate employment, or concerns regarding future advancement opportunities within certain companies based on past experiences where previous workers did worse than the manager (which likely turned out untrue). And yes, none of these reasons make sense whatsoever, unfortunately the human psyche is pretty far removed from logical thinking processes, so it's best to keep these thoughts firmly lodged somewhere deep inside your subconscious mind instead, otherwise they'll affect your decisionmaking in pursuit of success later in life. As mentioned previously, we now definitely stressful situations occurring between 5th grade students 11 years old, 10A This is one of two kinds of nasty. and get",gpt_j,6.053030303030303,4.0,6.630769230769231,6.75,5.7368421052631575,0.13154769938943264,0.14675934530485701,0.21048069379304069,0.3610636806935159,1.3877551020408159,2.9191273896762,1.688234099939097,2.986228107166761,1.711260110685398,3.007424324924152,1.4655172413793105,2.368617377750618,3.206896551724138,2.9703262802819768,0.2413793103448276,0.5020765440883116,0.7783251231527091,2.4446938222393007,-0.8673230922747817,-0.6795774345159726,1.7889168623235552,3.8882405362002666,1.2789046653144018,2.7692632300528603,0.4235109717868339,0.7579231474962735,0.5931034482758621,1.7835754502105807,0.09159482758620704,1.208223162796985,-0.16620990256054388,0.30048259018986573,0.5107758620689655,1.9745638535435754,1.5013262599469495,2.3311143028022348,1.370659131739138,1.2898738903911147,0.9370552818828684,1.1079156963275392,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.18246560765962697,6.090909090909091,4.909090909090909,-0.39878472130262643,1.6774229385022321,-0.09393359680224862,-0.7141211390941999,1.184154697112768,1.1236305146222068

To make use of the new features, users must have their latest Sonos app version installed.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Mr Maduro said the room would be kept intact and a wing of the presidential palace turned into a monument to Mr Chavez's ""Bolivarian revolution."" Mr Chavez died of cancer in Venezuela on March 5. In his address, Vice President Nicolas Maduro broke down as he thanked Cabinet ministers for their support since Mr Chavez announced last month that the cancer had returned after four years in remission. At one point during an impassioned speech, Mr Maduro fell off a stool while speaking at a podium set up outside the Miraflores Presidential Palace. He later stood back up with help from aides. TRIBUTES TO 'VANQUISHED ENEMIES' The new president also paid homage to Venezuela's military heroes who fought against Spain more than 200 years ago before declaring independence, calling them ""vanquished enemies"" whose spirit should guide Venezuelans today. He then ordered an increase in government spending by about 30 per cent next year, saying it was needed because millions of poor people are still dependent on welfare programs started under Mr Chavez's rule. Some economists say such plans ignore public debt levels which have climbed above 60 billion (S85b) this year - or around 60 per cent of GDP. Critics accuse Mr Chavez of reckless spending throughout most of his 14-year presidency, including massive social programmes aimed at combating poverty and reducing inequality. They were often financed through oil revenues but now require fresh borrowing abroad amid declining output and prices.

One of the doctors involved has been given a backdated 18-month ban. Endurance performance expert Dr Trent Stelling, who worked with Team Sky between September 2010 and May 2013, has been suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) after an investigation into his activities with the British outfit. Team Sky have said the suspension will not affect the team. As a result of Stelling's ban, Team Sky said it had ""no current or historic relationship"" with the doctor. The team has suspended its use of intravenous recovery treatments and Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford said the team were ""confident there has been no wrongdoing."" ""We are pleased that Usada has concluded its investigation and that they have confirmed that the practices which Trent Stelling employed at Team Sky between 2010 and 2013 were in line with Wada guidelines,"" he added. ""The investigation confirms that the practices deployed at Team Sky were in line with Wada rules."" Dr Stelling said: ""I'm happy that this investigation has concluded and that Usada have confirmed that the medical practices I used at Team Sky between 2010 and 2013 were in line with Wada guidelines. ""I have always had the utmost respect for anti-doping regulations and would never have done anything to intentionally contravene the rules."" Usada confirmed that the 18-month suspension would run from 1 May 2018, backdated to 1 May 2016. The governing body said it ""will not bring any anti-doping rule violation against any current or former Team Sky rider in connection with the investigation."" Team Sky insist the suspension will not affect the team, but it has raised questions over the team's use of intravenous recovery treatments. It has also thrown up the question of whether Team Sky should have sought a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for these treatments. Team Sky said they ""do not have a team doctor and therefore do not need a TUE for IV infusions."" They also said they ""have never applied for a TUE for IV infusions"" and ""never administered IV recovery treatments to riders outside of their rest periods."" The team added that they were ""confident there has been no wrongdoing"" and that there are ""extremely strict rules"" to ensure its use of TUEs is ""appropriate and justified.""

Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars and white vans. The pallets have been used to make a warren of streets, which snake around the car park and are named after well known Belfast landmarks, including Ormeau Road, Donegal Square, Botanic Avenue and Cregagh Road. I see a man putting an old mattress outside a ""house"" made from pallets. He has a small child with him. As I watch, they collect some planks of wood and a few pallets and start to build another house next door. Dozens of men, women and children have done the same. It is a ragtag assortment of make-shift houses, many of which have ""gardens"" made from pallets and planks of wood. There are people everywhere. Some are cooking food on camping stoves. Others are playing football. A man is sitting on the grass outside one of the ""houses,"" carving a wooden stick with a pen knife. He has a small child on his knee. As he works away at the wood, he holds the child's hand in his. It is a tender scene. I see a woman putting clothes out to dry. She is hanging them from the frame of a discarded tent. I also see a man with a scruffy beard who is sitting on a plastic chair outside one of the houses. He is smoking a cigarette and talking on a mobile phone. He takes a long drag on his cigarette, and then exhales a stream of smoke. It drifts away in the wind. I watch as a man and a woman, who are both carrying large rucksacks, walk up the hill to the car park. They have obviously just arrived and have their eyes wide open. The man looks around and says something to the woman. I can't hear what he says, but I imagine he is probably saying something like, ""It's not quite what I expected."" It is the same with every newcomer. There is shock and surprise. These people are some of Belfast's most vulnerable. They are homeless, down on their luck, and have nowhere else to go. They have built a community here. They have made a life for themselves. They have made something from nothing. A mural has been painted on one of the walls in the car park. It is of a bird with outstretched wings, and underneath are the words ""No surrender."" I try to talk to some of the people living here, but many refuse to speak to me. One of them says to me: ""Don't take any pictures, and don't come back again. We are fine as we are. We don't need your help."" I approach a man with a big beard and a dog. He says his name is John and that he has been living in the car park for a year. He points to a nearby ""house"" and says, ""That's my house over there. It's not bad."" John also says he does not want help. He says he is happy to stay in the car park. John and his dog The council has said it does not want the car park to be used as a permanent home, but has been criticised for its response to the situation. One Belfast city councillor said the situation was ""shameful"" and called on the council to act with ""greater urgency"" to deal with the problem. Councillor John Kyle said he had seen people ""living in a state of absolute squalor and in fear of their lives."" ""People are sleeping out in the open, they are in fear of their lives and they have no proper toilet facilities,"" he said. ""These are people who have complex needs, they have drug and alcohol addictions and other mental health issues. They should be treated with dignity and respect."" He added: ""This is a human tragedy on our doorstep and we need to treat it with the urgency it deserves. The people there need help and support. ""I have spoken to some of the people living in the car park and they say the council needs to act. They say they are not getting the help they need."" The council has said it is planning to demolish the derelict buildings at the rear of the car park. It said this will ""remove the opportunity for this area to be used for rough sleeping and anti-social behaviour.""",llama_65B,4.9772727272727275,8.5,6.2615384615384615,6.25,5.842105263157895,-1.5612316634208172,-1.085697448645366,-1.369148034786448,-1.1586138203589917,-0.9907677356656949,0.10429228430472723,-0.4857022708158116,0.11733679911062665,-0.5015432098765431,0.11558893834647635,-0.7321428571428571,-0.2015335961532481,-0.2595443349753694,0.24367344847362013,0.0,0.0,-0.7448979591836736,0.08497051133055844,-0.7964457576119661,-0.21096287179525983,-0.4922067268252666,0.14771948606338858,-0.7647058823529413,-0.10217431383174892,-0.34545454545454546,0.18292096052498055,-0.021428571428571352,0.3822728631383683,-0.279017857142857,0.5235612246599719,-0.36828804599833065,-0.20227342391002073,-0.2678571428571428,0.4039670395398105,0.5879120879120878,0.6842759526230685,-0.35490281089674103,-0.23163357581297114,-0.3333333333333333,0.19289315359682047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.5272727272727273,2.727272727272727,0.45666031906250937,1.2998733496211676,0.09521569947099001,1.6503947187792003,-1.6253123640267015,-1.4551959257969804

The TECLA also includes an array of solar panels for power and heat production. It's a great concept - but it might be even better if we could actually see these houses in action! Until now they have only been displayed at exhibitions like this one. We were lucky enough to catch up with Dan Wooding who has worked tirelessly since 2012 to make sure that we got some time alone with them: What do you think?

This was despite turnover falling by PS1m to just over PS100m. During the year, the group invested PS4m, primarily in its milling and nutrition businesses, and has plans to continue with that investment in the coming year. The results mean the company has increased its year-on-year pre-tax profits for the fifth consecutive year. Harbro, which employs around 230 people, is a supplier of livestock feed, animal health, farm supplies and equipment. It operates across Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Managing director Graham Baxter said the company had enjoyed a strong performance, despite challenging market conditions. He said: ""It was a year of two halves for us. Despite the fall in turnover, we saw very positive trading in the first half of the year. ""However, the second half saw us deal with a more challenging market environment, especially in terms of feed ingredient pricing. It was very much a buyers' market, which made it difficult for our customers. ""We chose to absorb those additional costs for our customers, while at the same time continuing to invest in our people and our operations. We remain in a strong financial position and are well placed to continue our growth."" Mr Baxter said Harbro had benefited from a strong performance from its nutrition division, which it has grown through strategic investments in research and development and its own feed mills. He said: ""We are continuing to invest in people and facilities, with the aim of continuing to deliver the best possible service and products to our customers. ""The strength of our business has allowed us to invest heavily in our nutrition business, both in people and in facilities. ""We have increased our capacity by around 30 per cent, which allows us to be more efficient and to reduce lead times for our customers."" Harbro recently appointed Chris Sim as its new head of nutrition. Mr Baxter said that, while there were market challenges, the industry was in a strong position and he was optimistic about the future. ""Our industry has faced some challenges over the last couple of years, but the meat and livestock sector is strong and well positioned,"" he said. ""Brexit is likely to have a number of implications for the industry, including around exports, but it also presents opportunities. ""I think the UK will be in a good position to take advantage of its exit from the EU and continue to deliver high-quality meat and livestock products."" ""Harbro is in a strong position to take advantage of those opportunities as and when they arise."" Harbro was founded in 1981 by John and Rosemary Barnett. It has since developed into one of Scotland's leading animal feed, nutrition and rural supply businesses. The company supplies livestock producers throughout Scotland and Northern England, as well as those in Northern Ireland, through its joint venture with animal genetics company Genus. Its main production facility is in Thainstone, near Inverurie, and it has mills at Newbridge and Ayr. Harbro also has a network of 12 retail stores, which provide farm supplies and equipment, as well as delivering livestock feed and other products direct to farms and crofts.

The largest of these ships can suck up 8,000 cubic yards of sand in a single day, and China has used this sand to build up islands in disputed territories in the South China Sea. This has caused tensions with neighboring countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines, who also claim territorial rights in the area. It is important to note that this dredging has a significant impact on the marine environment, including damage to coral reefs and seafloor habitats, as well as the relocation of marine species.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. ""Put in rather plainer language, the UK economy is facing a perfect storm of headwinds,"" he said. Haldane's comments reflect the fact that the UK economy is in a precarious position due to external factors such as Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth, and weaker trade. These issues are likely to put a dampener on economic activity in the months ahead, resulting in lower levels of business investment and consumer spending. This in turn could lead to slower wage growth and higher unemployment. The Bank of England has already warned about the risks posed by these issues and the need for policymakers to be prepared for a more difficult economic outlook.",text-davinci-003,0.2727272727272727,0.16666666666666666,0.2153846153846154,0.234375,0.05263157894736842,0.01692107336544526,0.08556254846141578,0.35292508871725586,0.34783755064430394,0.253968253968254,-0.10949562547294331,0.08634707036725554,-0.11017416794477707,0.10802469135802499,-0.11334993301395282,1.6666666666666665,1.0031427810339575,0.017241379310344803,0.18435451309030795,0.0,0.0,0.6428571428571428,-0.16150473346180688,-0.2573132447669429,-0.24868402598172426,-0.4922067268252666,-0.4947893735045192,0.5098039215686274,-0.4690878202843438,-0.21212121212121196,-0.7385972448897338,0.8,0.24560695618008344,0.6250000000000001,0.7634125865380427,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.18749999999999997,0.0,-0.6153846153846154,-0.49378024993051867,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,-0.08465608465608436,0.2285340891314355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10909090909090909,0.45454545454545453,0.2554652415657365,-0.08065411540082103,0.453350880341369,-0.36302692048785545,0.3752204073476219,0.3040972675754791

It was shared in 2014, before she was elected to parliament. The Bradford West MP apologised for ""the hurt I have caused"" and said she would be seeking to expand her education on the ""sensitivities"" around the issue. Shah was suspended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the wake of the controversy. In a statement, she said: ""This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused. ""The violence in IsraelPalestine is deeply troubling. ""The loss of civilian life on both sides is horrific. I unequivocally condemn violence and unreservedly apologise for my comments. ""I remain committed to a peaceful solution in the Middle East through dialogue."" The suspension has since been lifted. The graphic was shared by Shah with the comment ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States,"" followed by the hashtags ""problemsolved"" and ""Palestine."" Ms Shah was one of several Labour MPs who had their social media activity probed by the Guido Fawkes political website. In 2014, she shared an image showing a man holding a poster with the slogan ""Jihad is the only solution for Palestine."" Also in 2014, she shared a link to a pro-Hamas blog, and another post which called for the al-Quds Brigade, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, to be considered a legitimate organisation. Shah has also retweeted links to a blog post which alleged that Zionists worked with the Nazis during the Second World War. In a statement released on Thursday evening, a Labour spokesperson said: ""The contents of this post are utterly unacceptable and fall well below the standard we expect of Labour Party representatives.

Prism Courage made the 33-day voyage from the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates to Panama, a route which passes through the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Caribbean Sea. The journey was completed autonomously with no human intervention, with technology developed by the ship's owner, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL). The voyage used an autonomous navigation system that combines satellite positioning data and ship radar to plot a course and detect obstacles. The vessel was monitored remotely from the company's offices in Tokyo. The successful voyage has demonstrated the potential for autonomous ships to revolutionize the shipping industry by reducing costs, improving safety, and increasing efficiency. In addition to avoiding the need for a crew, autonomous vessels also eliminate the risk of drunk or fatigued sailors making mistakes, as well as eliminating costly port-related delays due to bureaucracy. The use of autonomous ships is becoming increasingly popular, with several companies investing in research and development related to the technology.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope. For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems. It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that ""no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems."" Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer. Will anyone help the Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds The'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election Aung San Suu Kyi where are you? So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to? Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama. The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission. But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers. Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship. In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the ""Trojan Horse"" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate. There are of course plenty of caveats. Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh. After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation. Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country. Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Humans can learn echolocation to navigate mazes and identify the size and orientation of objects in just 10 weeks. This is a much faster learning time than previous studies have shown (1). The speed with which we learned, however, may be due not only to our ability but also simply because it's hard for people to master this skill unless they are given exposure over many hours or days to let them become familiar with their environment by trial-and error feedback. We wanted to know if training in an unfamiliar context, where there was no opportunity to make mistakes, could help us develop more rapidly as well. To address this question, we gave subjects practice at detecting hidden food pellets using ultrasound beams while navigating through a virtual maze that incorporated obstacles such as walls - a task closely resembling real-life situations. In addition, we estimated how long it would take someone without experience to accomplish this goal. The results clearly show that providing repeated training sessions helped these inexperienced subjects quickly detect the target food pellets and subsequently navigate successfully through virtual environments featuring various kinds of barriers. However, when we compared performance data between experienced users and novices, we found significant differences between groups; someone who had practiced previously showed better skills both in terms of absolute accuracy and faster response times than those who were new learners. These findings suggest that motivation plays some role in successful navigation: When faced with one unknown obstacle after another, even when provided with support from an instructorteacher, individuals with recent relevant experience will need to spend significantly longer looking for targets before deciding on courses of action. Our participants did achieve satisfactory levels of competence within about 16 trials, indicating that once trained they retained relatively good spatial knowledge. Besides helping you get familiarized with your surroundings, ultrasound echoes give insights into what's going on around your body too. It's like having a ""super hearing"" for yourself! There are two main types of echo patterns: Transmitters bounce off surfaces and reflect from internal organs back to receivers. Though most people perceive sound as being transmitted through air, it actually travels through tissue. Ultrasound waves travel through liquids or solids - such as bones and flesh - so they cannot penetrate deep structures. They do, however, enable sonographers to see details inside the human body, including blood vessels. They can visualize arteries or veins pumping away nutrients, masses of cells moving along blood streams or nerves carrying signals throughout the body. What's great besides its noninvasive nature is that it provides information about anatomy, physiology and pathology that might otherwise require a full workup using other methods. If you haven't tried it yet, check out the article below for an introduction to transabdominal scanning from a health care professional. A tool used to monitor fetal growth, ultrasounds create images by transmitting short bursts of high frequency sounds into the abdomen via a probe connected to a computer. As the reflected wave passes back toward the receiver, information on the structure and composition of tissues is recorded or displayed as a series of colored lines on the screen called B-mode which resembles musical scores. Another type of scan known as Doppler enables doctors to measure blood flow velocity. This particular technique shows how fast blood flows through different parts of the heart muscle. Blood flowing slowly indicates poor circulation. More rapid movement suggests damage caused by a blockage in major arteries. Such abnormalities can cause stroke or cardiac arrest. During pregnancy an ultrasound exam must pass a number of hurdles. One includes whether women with risk factors such as obesity or diabetes qualify for testing based upon guidelines established by ACOG, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. On the positive side though, you don't really feel anything during an examination. But remember, you should inform any doctor performing examinations of all medications you are taking, especially those containing Xylocaine gel or Botox injections. It's important to keep track of all prescribed medicines during early pregnancy since they are sometimes linked to birth defects such as spina bifida. How to spot a newborn baby? What does alcohol smell like? You'll notice right away that male babies tend to have higher pitched cries than females. Also notice the difference in tone - the male voice usually has slightly lower pitch. But not always. Sometimes the opposite happens and females with low pitches emit excited calls to attract males. Other physical characteristics include marked reddish skin coloration, big ears that stick up almost perpendicular to head, protruding mouth corners, large nose openings and narrow nostrils. Finally, watch for small fists tucked under chin as newborns attempt to hold themselves upright. Note: Human fetuses weigh anywhere from 6 ounces to 14 pounds at delivery. In case you're wondering why baby boys cry less frequently than girls, here's a possible reason... Unlike adults, infants are unable to modify their crying behavior to match their emotional state. As soon as they begin producing audible noises, they are stuck with whatever emotion they happen to express. In general, infant boys produce louder shrieks and yells than girls while infants in danger of becoming legitimate prospects.

""I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,"" she said. Social media users in China posted pictures of the attack on the internet, but correspondents say they are being taken down. Images seen by the BBC show men and women lying on the floor in pools of blood following the attack. Kunming officials, quoted by Xinhua, later said that evidence at the scene showed it was ""a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces."" Xinjiang is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group which has a long history of discord with Chinese authorities. State broadcaster CCTV said top security official Meng Jianzhu would travel to Kunming to oversee the handling of the investigation.",human,1.7045454545454546,2.1666666666666665,1.5846153846153845,1.703125,1.8421052631578947,-0.11938468069836042,-0.07766341988804164,0.08974738824090417,0.1872259423378207,-0.37339380196523037,-0.17473747911759133,-0.4173441734417343,-0.24731618538929895,-0.324074074074074,-0.18305953118834686,-0.5,-0.23854125236977733,-0.14942528735632174,0.07778933344201693,0.0,0.0,-0.3333333333333335,0.16503934889174532,-0.20489758379589895,0.047265281958912164,0.35001367240907844,-0.1310757686740612,-0.2549019607843139,0.2930043960827264,-0.056565656565656625,0.06541030816579846,0.022222222222222365,0.28756285127818104,-0.20833333333333323,0.3713543730492563,-0.29699527033293144,-5.887846720064156e-17,-0.5208333333333333,-0.13804049205999486,0.3076923076923076,0.5070881188820913,-0.08716911144832232,-0.033580297355857325,0.21164021164021168,0.31481725220554907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4363636363636363,1.4545454545454546,0.03687809640576199,0.7175094358316074,0.08967380050708422,0.12763791613584202,-0.2749234713088808,-0.1799874561846816

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"This article follows how a flaw was discovered and exploited in an internal test version of Google Cloud Deployment Manager. The flaw allowed requests to be issued to Google internal services that would normally be inaccessible. The flaw was initially discovered by a security researcher while testing the Google Cloud Deployment Manager (GCDM). GCDM is a service used to manage and deploy applications on Google Cloud Platform. Upon further investigation, the researcher noticed that requests were being allowed to internal Google services, which are normally inaccessible from outside of their network. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or even launch attacks against these internal services. To exploit this flaw, the researcher set up a malicious server that was able to issue requests to the Google internal services. After some testing, the researcher was able to successfully issue requests to the services, allowing them to access data and resources that would normally be inaccessible. Once the researcher had identified the flaw, they reported it to Google who then quickly patched the vulnerability. In response to the incident, Google also implemented additional security measures to prevent similar exploits in the future. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining secure systems, especially when dealing with cloud-based services. It also highlights the need for organizations to regularly monitor their systems for any suspicious activity, as well as have effective processes in place to respond quickly to any issues that arise.",text-davinci-003,1.1136363636363635,1.1666666666666667,1.0,1.015625,0.5263157894736842,1.0901418642280887,0.9806627993392164,1.2835291589416449,1.2138868958351468,-0.029478458049886875,-0.37133073442970227,-0.1511073731426971,-0.2109327391713217,-0.15123456790123424,-0.1604388302776387,0.0,0.05307996408777606,1.0172413793103445,1.1843392659426126,0.0,0.0,-0.03571428571428597,-0.35533639980679194,-0.2573132447669429,0.04966677129721343,0.139458572600492,-0.4425099542807971,-0.19117647058823534,-0.18329912631317988,-0.09545454545454539,0.421608751362322,-0.5333333333333333,-0.09079798535423238,0.5468749999999999,-0.10494275129501908,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.3125,0.7930669648887523,-0.07692307692307705,0.23568635346060884,0.39226100151745075,0.24103728355368267,-0.38095238095238076,-0.3838873035272961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5272727272727272,0.9090909090909091,0.4828045939304162,0.30589086953236083,0.2865433487641517,-1.0509018009697553,0.7030094929567826,0.7086611739763571

A guide on how to use them with Github is available here: I have started using Gitmoji for my own commits and noticed that if I don't bother adding anything other than the emoji, it ends up being difficult to differentiate between green items (a feature) versus bugs. So after playing around I realized this can be easily done by utilizing multiple colors in your emoji! It also makes it easier when searching through code reviews because then you only need to highlight the relevant area which would minimize clutter compared to highlighting the entire line plus all surrounding lines (which could happen during peer review). So what are these various colored emoji's?

Prism Courage made the 33-day voyage from Murmansk in Russia through Europe and on into South East Asia, with a crew of only four people onboard after being computer controlled up until it reached its destination at Singapore's port of Tanjung Pelepas. The upgrade saw all navigation systems replaced by six new diesel generators that powered two electric motors installed onto each propeller shaft; additional battery storage was installed. The self-sufficiency meant no fuel or manual controls were needed during the journey. According to its builders Bremen Shipyard, other ships will be equipped for similar upgrades. Prism Courage departs the quay at the Port of Tanjung Pelepas Medan, North Sumatra - Indonesia 13 April 2018 Credit: AFPGetty Images Transforming vessels Vessel owners have long understood how increasingly sophisticated information technology can transform their vessel operations and reduce costs. But transforming existing ships is never easy as manufacturers are often reluctant to take on such major projects due to both engineering challenges and expense. This has been particularly true when retrofitting existing tonnage. Just look back three decades ago to where we began our story... One of the earliest examples of ""smart shipping"" came 23 years before automatic engines went mainstream. In 1988 ConocoPhillips fitted motorised ballast tanks in support of research undertaken by Shell using computers running IBM PC compatible software code developed by Southampton University (today known as the National Oceanography Centre). By providing data about precisely what they carried while underway this research helped oil companies better understand currents and tides which could affect deliveries. At first these ballasts saved 10 on every tank full but eventually proved so successful that investment quickly turned into cost savings. Today most supertankers use ballasted propulsion. In fact some believe redesigning entire vessels may soon become common practice. Japanese company Daewoo Marine Engineering recently unveiled plans for a 45m long container carrier capable of carrying 11,500 TEUs weighing 1 million tons thanks in part to advances in material science. Building such huge containers requires extensive steel design changes to accommodate more cargo than ever. JRR Holdings president says Smart Ships used to carry one ton per day. Now he expects them to transport 20 tonnes daily This not to mention technological innovations like radar sensors, satellite communications arrays and advanced artificial intelligence. All combined mean that safety standards too have improved dramatically for marine operators who seek out cyber security expertise to avoid disaster. However we must also ask whether the benefits outweigh risks? Are there any dangers associated with automated steering and power generation? Could this lead to accidents? Here we explore just what makes smart ships tick. We begin by examining problems associated with poor system monitoring. From here we look at solutions including autonomously managed emergency response centres and remote data collection via modern communication networks. Finally we come to the issue of hacking and cybersecurity threats posed by non state actors. A comprehensive guide to navigating the world of connected deep sea craft follows. When things go wrong aboard even the largest vessels, crews are usually left relying solely on the chart plotter for help. Not anymore! A number of maritime firms now offer collaborative technologies designed specifically for mariners operating high risk areas close to land. It turns out many of these same tools could also assist offshore engineers working in similarly hazardous conditions. For example, they might provide a means of sharing real time sonar images much easier than sending live video feeds wirelessly across vast oceans. So if you're wondering why your fleet isn't always sailing quietly right next door - read on... because you'll probably find something useful along the way. There's nothing quite like approaching a huge floating wave moving swiftly towards you. When faced with such a hazard, alarm bells start ringing straight away making sure sailors know exactly what to do to ensure everyone is safe and sound. Remotely operated vehicle teams need to operate within hours notice enabling them to move assets between vessels safely. Large waves distort depth lines causing significant issues for ROVs. To mitigate against this threat, unmanned surface vehicles are able to navigate depths down to 800ft without distortion. Offshore workers typically rely upon GPS signals to maintain position relative to anchors attached to fixed structures ashore. While reliable and convenient it is vulnerable to interference caused by underwater mountains, wrecks, moorings and cables. Its precision comes at a price however, lagging several seconds behind actual movement meaning potentially dangerous errors can occur. An alternative solution would allow unattended operation whilst maintaining accuracy throughout. As part of a project called UMSatRISP currently assessing the feasibility of satellite based positioning shore side experts monitor seafloor topology remotely thus freeing trackers free to focus on jobs rather than map building. Of course you don't want to spend days sitting around waiting for data to arrive especially when an immense wave looms overhead. Why not fix that problem instead?

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Nick Hardwick said staff shortages, population pressures and prison policy all contributed to problems, with a 69 rise in self-inflicted deaths. The Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence linking the rise in such deaths to government policy. Presenting his annual report, Mr Hardwick also pointed to problems involving so-called legal highs. He highlighted the growing availability of the drugs as a cause of debt, bullying and health problems, warning their use had grown sharply. According to the HM Inspectorate of Prisons annual report, cannabis substitutes Spice and Black Mamba were particular ""causes for concern"" in more than a third of the jails inspected. It says current mandatory random drug testing does not detect legal highs and reduced staffing had made some ""suspicion"" testing programmes ""virtually inoperable."" Mr Hardwick said profits for prisoners selling legal highs outstripped other drugs because they sold for 10 times as much as they would outside jail. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""We all want prisoners to come out of prison less likely to commit offences than when they went in and if they [prisons] are not safe places where people aren't working and are not doing rehabilitation activities, then that's not going to happen."" But warning cracks in the system had ""widened,"" Mr Hardwick's report said: ""Of most concern, the number of self-inflicted deaths rose by 69 from 52 in 2012-13 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years."" The term ""self-inflicted deaths"" includes suicides and any death as a result of the prisoner's own actions. Bullying was a factor in ""many cases,"" the report said, warning that adult male prisons were becoming ""more violence every year."" Andrew Selous, the Conservative prisons minister, said it had been a ""challenging year"" for prisons staff dealing with ""major organisational change."" But he added: ""During this time we have always had enough staff to deliver decent and safe prison regimes, and this will continue to be our top priority. ""We remain committed to reducing violence and understanding the reasons for the recent rise in self-inflicted deaths. ""But this is a complex issue and the chief inspector has failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that this is linked to the reforms made under this government."" Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the report ""lays bare the deteriorating conditions in our jails under David Cameron's government"" and showed ministers were ""burying their heads in the sand."" ""The government should be alarmed at reports of prisoners idling away their time in their cells rather than being on courses or working,"" he added. ""It does nothing to improve rehabilitation and puts the safety of communities at risk from unreformed prisoners drifting back into a life of crime and creating more needless victims."" Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""This report spells out in painstaking detail the mounting challenges faced by prisons and gives the lie to repeated assertions by the Ministry of Justice that the system is not in crisis. ""If prisoners are spending most of their days locked up in their cells doing nothing, while regimes are violent and wracked with drug abuse, then how can we magically expect people to be safer citizens when they are released? He added: ""The end result will only be more crime and more victims of crime.""",human,3.4545454545454546,2.6666666666666665,3.4153846153846152,3.5,4.526315789473684,0.12769932345577387,0.0425140215428157,0.07016835650607907,0.2924578773395869,0.7722708130871392,0.4850121176077585,0.7401177460050463,1.028778235937707,0.7746913580246915,0.9488923413861967,0.5476190476190474,0.4244436463540055,0.16009852216748763,0.4939779574668248,0.0,0.0,0.9183673469387752,-0.09373516117134117,-0.13376204390662508,0.5663112080804249,0.9844134536505332,0.4527016661584984,0.6372549019607845,1.1196473179597777,0.2878787878787879,0.9257926485227295,0.8,0.8126400863049615,0.24553571428571447,0.9704253037591133,0.18779560419178334,1.3088689411934797,0.5624999999999999,3.3008365335438006,0.5054945054945053,0.8551923066966952,0.3735819062070958,0.8898966058865797,1.650793650793651,0.8928214034625034,0.09523809523809523,0.42591770999996,0.047619047619047616,0.21295885499998,2.2363636363636363,2.8181818181818183,0.13782018095469475,0.9981034147670932,0.25821754151519016,-0.33490936495572715,0.6161310478862846,0.579843500647722

Boss Marco Silva had been keen to bring in new faces to bolster his squad after an injury to Richarlison and the suspension of captain Phil Jagielka. ""We're pleased to welcome two young players to our club,"" Silva said. ""Both Emyr and Omar are talented footballers who have had a taste of life in the first team but are still at an age where they can continue to develop. ""We believe working here with our first team staff will give them the opportunity to grow and prove their worth."" Everton host Cardiff City in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30 GMT). Everton boss Marco Silva has been linked with a move for a striker in the January transfer window and Southampton's Charlie Austin is one player being mentioned. The 29-year-old, who has scored six goals in 19 league appearances this season, has struggled with injury this term and has not played for Saints since suffering a hamstring problem in December. Everton are looking to strengthen their attacking options after losing Richarlison to a three-game suspension, while Yannick Bolasie has joined Aston Villa on loan. The BBC's Simon Stone says there are doubts over a deal for Austin because of his fitness concerns. Everton have joined the race to sign West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool and Manchester United. The Toffees are believed to be weighing up a summer move for the 19-year-old, who has represented England and Ireland at youth level. Rice has made 23 appearances for the Hammers this season, but is yet to sign a new contract with his current deal set to expire in 2020. Everton could be set to make a move for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool and Manchester United. Rice has made 23 appearances for the Hammers this season, but is yet to sign a new contract with his current deal expiring in 2020. Celtic have made an enquiry about signing Everton's 17-year-old forward Fraser Hornby on loan for the rest of the season. Hornby scored 14 goals in 15 games for Everton's U18 side last season and netted six times for the U23s this term. He has been linked with a 2m move to Leeds United, whose former Everton manager Paul Heckingbottom was a regular spectator at the youngster's U23 games. Celtic are also looking to sign Scott Allan from Hibernian and Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna. Everton have sent scouts to watch Porto striker Moussa Marega, according to Sky sources. The Toffees have been keeping an eye on the 27-year-old, who has scored 15 goals this season in the Portuguese top flight, and was part of the Malian side that made it to the semi-finals of the African Nations Cup in January. Everton have been heavily linked with a move for Richarlison's former Watford team-mate Abdoulaye Doucoure, and now Sky sources understand the Frenchman has asked to leave the Hornets. Doucoure, who played for Mali at the World Cup, was a target for the Toffees last summer and Everton reportedly had a 36m bid turned down.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Liverpool-bound striker Dominic Solanke picked up Lewis Cook's pass to score the winner shortly after the interval. England played the last 17 minutes with 10 men after Josh Onomah was sent off for a second bookable offence but they were able to see out their first victory of 2018 to remain in contention at third place, four points behind leaders Chelsea and three adrift of Liverpool who visit runaway champions Manchester City on Thursday (16:00 GMT). Solanke has been impressing during his loan spell with Vitesse Arnhem this season - he scored five goals in 14 appearances before heading back across the Channel to complete his move from Anfield amid speculation linking him with Bournemouth, Swansea and West Bromwich Albion. The 20 year old found it tough going initially as his side succumbed to an early goal by Ruben Loftus-Cheek following Jake Clarke-Salter's mistake, although that proved to be the only shot on target either team mustered until late in each half when both sides had efforts correctly ruled out for infringements inside the box. But just as fatigue seemed to set in among some of those involved here, especially given there is another midweek match next week against Rotherham United in the FA Cup fourth round, Solanke popped up close to the edge of the area with 13 minutes remaining. He latched onto Tom Cairney's ball over the top then rounded goalkeeper Angus Gunn before sliding into an empty net. It was far tougher than expected thereafter with Tottenham increasingly dominant without ever looking particularly threatening themselves, leading Toon boss Rafael Benitez to turn to Jonjo Shelvey and Mohamed Diame off the bench while Mikel Merino took a rare start ahead of Ki Sung-yueng as Spurs continued without Jan Vertonghen or Harry Kane due to injury.

The feature will create an overlay of your current location and the direction you are facing, so if you're driving down the street it would be possible for people watching at home to see where you need to turn next. This isn't entirely new - as early as 2011 Facebook has been working on similar Real-Time Directions integration into its own map platform using GPS data from smartphones. However, Google's implementation covers more ground than just simple turn by turn navigation. At launch when taking photos through the app, you can also receive real-time traffic alerts overlaid over the photo itself.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday. It aims to address the 1 billion funding gap across the region by 2020. The STP document, which was released on Wednesday, also sets out how the region's health and social care services need to be transformed to meet the changing needs of the population, which includes addressing increasing levels of obesity, dementia and loneliness. The STP document is subject to public consultation. Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust chief executive Aidan Kehoe said the draft plan was ""a vital opportunity to set out a vision for the next five years that will ensure that NHS services across Cheshire and Merseyside are fit for purpose and continue to provide high quality patient care."" ""It's clear that if we don't change the way we deliver care and manage demand on services, then we will not be able to continue to provide the same level of care for patients. We need to change the way we work across the health and care system to make sure we can deliver high quality care for the people of Merseyside and Cheshire,"" he said. The STP also proposes that the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital Trust merges with Liverpool Community Health Trust. The document also outlines plans for the establishment of a primary and acute care system. The STP says this model will ""enable the health and social care system to provide care that is more integrated and better co-ordinated in the community."" The STP also envisages that the region will have a single cancer service, with a focus on earlier diagnosis and better outcomes. The plan also sets out proposals to develop a single centre for emergency surgery at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. This would be supported by specialist emergency surgery units at the Countess of Chester Hospital, Arrowe Park Hospital and Aintree University Hospital. The STP also proposes to develop a single centre for planned surgery at Broadgreen Hospital, which would be supported by a number of specialist elective surgery units. The draft plan also proposes a ""single approach"" to stroke services across the region. The STP also envisages the development of a ""single and streamlined approach"" to maternity services across the region.

Fadell: I was attracted to the idea that you could create something that could connect to the online music services and play music from there. That was something that I thought was really cool.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation is that Amazon has managed to establish a monopoly in the UK book market, controlling more than 90 of the e-book market. It is not clear how this has been achieved, as Amazon does not disclose sales figures for its Kindle devices or its e-book titles. However, some reports suggest that Amazon's aggressive pricing policy and tight control over the supply chain have helped it to dominate the market. In addition, Amazon's ability to offer vast discounts on books makes it difficult for other retailers to compete. Amazon has also been accused of using its vast customer base to unfairly influence publishers and authors into signing exclusive deals with them. This has allowed Amazon to further entrench its position in the market. It is unclear if Amazon's dominance of the UK book market is legal under anti-trust laws. If it is found to be in violation of anti-trust laws, regulators may impose fines, or even force Amazon to break up its business to allow competition.",text-davinci-003,0.75,0.8333333333333334,0.8307692307692308,0.8125,0.631578947368421,-0.35568266275205773,-0.08605545170723682,0.23717511824683904,-0.009678070505134787,-0.122448979591837,-0.24716186592157754,0.05180824222035305,-0.4574558588821156,-0.004320987654320742,-0.2501641230117494,0.19999999999999996,0.7181029961279897,-0.2327586206896551,0.0528954848215224,0.0,0.0,0.10000000000000002,0.2122185871560506,-0.3044873396408825,-0.7586844461388199,-0.009844134536505296,0.024857212181172966,-0.5352941176470589,-0.38075201699290195,0.6745454545454548,0.401073028911297,-0.3999999999999999,-0.03207660596625461,-0.40625,1.2403506067718515,-0.37684317907817855,-0.2121320343559642,1.4625,1.1036371491038395,0.39999999999999997,0.12284811245329437,0.732220536165908,0.18374609591954905,-0.4698412698412697,-0.24457717760421613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45454545454545453,0.6363636363636364,0.3545202286263072,0.2576028927447233,0.19009826687041498,-0.10516320985175666,0.010099616533715002,-0.03405576298269361
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The Confederation of African Football (Caf) are inviting new bidders for the tournament. Caf say that countries wishing to host the tournament have until 30 September to express their interest. A decision on Libya's replacement will be made next year. African football's ruling body also state that because of the limited time left to organise the 2017 Nations Cup, the Caf Executive Committee will select a host country who can guarantee that accommodation, transportation and hotel facilities, as well as training sites and stadiums already exist. Libya has endured weeks of recent chaos as the government struggles to control former rebel groups who helped topple former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Libya were originally scheduled to hold the Nations Cup in 2013 but because of the civil war swapped with 2017 hosts South Africa. The north African country had been planning to build 11 stadiums at a cost of 314 million, including a showpiece new 60,000-seater Austrian-built stadium on the site of a former military camp in Tripoli. Benghazi and Misrata were also set to have new major stadiums. Libya's government said last year it hoped the hosting of the Nations Cup would allow it to demonstrate that life had returned to normal in the country and encourage investors. Former World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer had accepted a role as an ""ambassador"" to help promote the tournament and the country and the former Spain coach Javier Clemente was hired to prepare their team for the tournament. Caf's decision follows the visit of a delegation from the Libyan FA to Caf's headquarters in Cairo this week. Libya also delayed the scheduled start of their new league season earlier this month because of the fighting while teams competing in international competitions in recent months have been holding home matches in neighbouring Tunisia. In February, Libya claimed their first senior African title, winning the 2014 African Nations Championship (CHAN), a tournament they were originally set to host. The civil unrest in the country meant that the event ended up taking place in South Africa instead. Caf are due to decide the host countries for the 2019 and 2021 Nations Cup finals at a meeting in Addis Ababa on 20 September.

Mrs Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump on the campaign trail. A rising star in the Republican party, the 44-year-old is the youngest governor in the US. Mr Trump said in a press release: ""Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country. ""She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage."" The Republican-controlled Senate will need to confirm her appointment before she officially takes office. In a statement, Mrs Haley said she was ""moved"" to accept the assignment and would remain the South Carolina governor, pending her congressional confirmation. She had endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio during the Republican primaries, later throwing her support behind Senator Ted Cruz - Mr Trump's final rival before he became the party's nominee. Although Mrs Haley eventually voted for Mr Trump, the governor said she was ""not a fan"" of either him or the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Eye-catching though her political career has been, little is known about Nikki Haley's views on the foreign affairs and the United Nations. Diplomats here have been Googling her to find out more. When her nomination was announced I was with a senior diplomat, who had expected President-elect Trump to downgrade the job of UN ambassador so that it was no longer a cabinet-level position. He was heartened that Mr Trump had selected a ""political heavyweight,"" and viewed it as an early indication than the incoming administration will take the UN more seriously than he'd supposed. Certainly, she's no John Bolton, the US ambassador during the Bush administration who famously remarked that it would not make much of a difference if the UN headquarters in New York lost its top 10 floors - where the organisation's most senior figures, including the secretary general, have their offices. Many UN diplomats fear a Trump presidency and there's relief here that he hasn't appointed an outspoken UN-basher. She also sharply attacked Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, calling it ""un-American,"" as well as his refusal to release his tax records. For his part, Mr Trump had called her ""very weak on illegal immigration"" and said South Carolinians were ""embarrassed"" by her. But the newly minted president-elect, who will be inaugurated in January, invited her for a meeting last week at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mrs Haley has little previous foreign policy experience, though the Charleston Post and Courier reports she has taken at least eight trips abroad since becoming governor in 2011, mostly in support of economic development deals for her state. During a trade mission to Europe in 2011, she was criticised by the newspaper for staying at expensive hotels and attending parties, costing the taxpayer 127,000 (PS103,000). Born Nimrata ""Nikki"" Randhawa, Mrs Haley was raised in a Sikh household and now identifies as a Christian. She is the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial strife. She was praised by members of both parties in 2015 when she ordered the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the grounds of the state capitol after a racially motivated shooting at an African-American church in Charleston. Mrs Haley, who is in her second and final term as governor, was elected in 2010, riding a wave of the Republican Tea Party. She is married to Army National Guard Captain Michael Haley, and the couple have two teenage children. Read full profile here The job of the ""permanent representative"" to the UN is to represent US interests. As a member of the cabinet the ambassador must inform the president of UN activities and make recommendations for state actions. The envoy has the responsibility of a role on the UN Security Council, with a permanent veto power. Mr Trump has previously heaped scorn on the organisation, telling a gathering of pro-Israel lobbyists in March this year: ""The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America.""

In addition, now knowing which sets of tumors have these patterns makes us better able to understand what causes them to form and grow out of control, exposing otherwise healthy people who never would have been diagnosed had routine screening not become an option.""",opt_30b,0.5075757575757576,0.3333333333333333,0.5692307692307692,0.609375,0.15789473684210525,0.3899952777461115,0.045297505733506466,0.4406984740549212,0.17083736254394233,0.4159378036929056,0.6792631750464599,0.5550883095037845,0.7927266847648463,0.6141975308641978,0.8237000192256607,1.5,0.8973514346484184,0.9458128078817735,1.3125903615267307,0.0,0.0,0.4489795918367346,0.4649684220721454,-0.8301415396647801,-0.7840010225531869,0.49220672682526634,2.2950400910709186,0.3823529411764707,0.47074818110716427,0.5545454545454546,0.3252269508561229,-0.34285714285714286,-0.016283797864606545,-0.37946428571428564,-0.46322214703742876,-0.32551238059909116,-0.15917634141086548,0.5624999999999999,1.507794332109776,0.6373626373626373,0.7539703105997421,0.3735819062070958,0.3672576856785028,0.0,0.012997510498787602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8909090909090909,1.0,-0.5838938164234377,0.39475800373315834,0.309042969302474,-0.5068880107969137,0.5548135881112687,0.7094748908031894

HAMR-JR was built as a test to A robotic foot smaller than a penny and capable of moving at speeds nearly 20 times faster than a human has been built by researchers at Harvard University. Dubbed the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (HAMR-JR), the tiny foot-sized machine was built as a test to demonstrate the feasibility of using microrobots to move through complex environments. ""It is really amazing that we are going from zero to walking robots in just a few years,"" said lead researcher Dr. John M. Bardeen, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at Harvard. The tiny foot is equipped with a camera and can move in any direction. The robot can also climb stairs, navigate cluttered environments, and even roll over objects. The robot is the size of a penny and is powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery. It can be controlled by hand and is operated by a joystick. The foot can be used to move the robot around an obstacle and it can also be used to reach a specific location. Boston Dynamics, the company that built the robot for Harvard, says it can roll over an object at speeds of 13.9 body lengths",t0_11b,0.946969696969697,0.8333333333333334,1.0307692307692307,1.0,0.6842105263157895,-0.5969002635624131,0.39426813667164345,-0.07876564031269291,0.31342281010639095,0.2312925170068026,0.334979611136179,0.3885618166526493,0.07316732895234475,0.30679012345679013,0.12297658464985259,0.0,0.6499640540098776,-0.08275862068965516,0.280730583034793,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285693,-0.3280693154720825,0.261601798846392,0.9981439765023121,0.059064807219031776,-0.1955001139061496,0.535294117647059,0.6492715394728905,1.094545454545455,0.18484730240789662,0.19999999999999996,-0.13254292980693727,1.09375,0.12025390012841486,-0.017527589724566396,-0.010714843619247478,-0.3374999999999999,0.7949078286399874,-0.4307692307692308,-0.16040844443212585,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515503,-0.11428571428571427,0.6243573679821205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545454545454545,0.9090909090909091,0.6752954432926399,0.12856660072184786,0.5682627354278967,0.020590070895738655,0.10170356345668836,0.12255004796769842

The school's 453 pupils are currently being taught at four locations in and around Chichester. An initial crowdfunding campaign was set up by Bunn Leisure on behalf of the Academy, with a total of 31,739 being raised in the space of just six days. A new JustGiving page has now been set up to continue the fundraising drive, with the target set at 20,000. The money will be used to purchase much needed resources to aid the delivery of teaching to pupils following the fire, which is believed to have been started deliberately. The funds raised will be managed by the Selsey Academy Trust on behalf of the school, with the JustGiving page being monitored by Bunn Leisure. Bunn Leisure's Head of Marketing and PR, Tom Dabell, said: ""We are delighted to see that the fundraising campaign has been so successful in such a short space of time. However, it is now clear that there is a need for the fundraising to continue, to allow the school to replace the teaching resources that have been lost. ""We have set up a new JustGiving page to continue the fundraising drive and we would be extremely grateful for any further donations, no matter how big or small.""

His side spent much of their time defending and stopped Young Boys from having any clear chances until late in the game when Miguel Veloso's curling effort went just wide with United goalkeeper Dean Henderson out of position following an error by Luke Shaw. United struggled to find space against a deep defense but Marcus Rashford had several efforts blocked or saved before opening the scoring in added time at the end of the first half despite some earlier confusion over who was offside. He then converted his penalty three minutes into stoppage time for what proved to be the winner as he sent former Manchester City teammate Joe Hart the wrong way given that the Swiss club have never lost a home Champions League group stage match.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"InfluxDB has everything you need to build time series applications - a multi-tenanted time series database, UI and dashboarding tools, background processing, and monitoring agent. All this makes deployment and management of time series infrastructure as easy as it gets. InfluxDB is a time series database. In the last 10 years, time series has become one of the dominant database requirements. The demand for time series databases is driven by the rise in applications that require metrics, analytics and insights from machine data (such as log data, sensor data, and metrics data). Examples of time series data are temperature readings, website hits, and sensor data. InfluxDB is an open source time series database developed by InfluxData. It is optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics. What is a time series database? A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time series data, which is a series of data points indexed (most often) by time, and often with additional metadata tags such as location or source. The ability to store and efficiently retrieve millions of time series with a diverse range of data points (from temperature to system statistics) has made time series databases an essential tool for gathering insights from data. Examples of time series data are temperature readings, website hits, and sensor data. InfluxDB is an open-source time series database. It is optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics. It provides a SQL-like query language for processing data over time, and a data model that enables high-availability and survivability, while still maintaining speed and efficiency. What is a time series? A time series is a series of data points indexed (most often) by time, and often with additional metadata tags such as location or source. A data point in a time series is a moment in time for which a value is recorded. What is a TSDB? A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time series data. InfluxDB is an open-source TSDB optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics. Why time series? Time series are an essential tool for gathering insights from data. Applications use time series for the following purposes: Logging and monitoring of IT infrastructure Monitoring of IoT sensors Measuring and displaying statistics Logging metrics from web applications InfluxDB is the only time series database with a native HTTP API. InfluxDB was built from the ground up to store time series data in an efficient and cost-effective manner. It provides a SQL-like query language for processing data over time, and a data model that enables high-availability and survivability, while still maintaining speed and efficiency. InfluxDB is ideal for businesses with complex deployments that require high availability and scalability. InfluxDB stores data points in a database and organizes them in columns and rows. Each column represents a series of data points, and each row represents an individual data point. A data point is a single moment in time for which a value is recorded. What is InfluxQL? InfluxQL is a SQL-like query language designed specifically for time series. InfluxQL is a simple, high-level, SQL-like query language that is purpose-built for querying time series data. InfluxQL is based on the concept of a data model with measurements, tags, and fields. It has support for high-performance mathematical and statistical functions. InfluxQL is used to query data from InfluxDB. Why is it called InfluxDB? The term influx is defined as a continuous entry or arrival of a large number of people or things. InfluxDB is a database designed to handle the influx of data produced by modern applications.

His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down the bed and you can see both his feet and his left hand in casts. A month ago, Joshua fell from a bridge near his home in Pontypridd, fracturing his spine in four places. The reason for the fall? According to Joshua, it was to get away from bullies. He told Newsbeat: ""I can remember speaking on the phone to the ambulance telling them'I can't move my legs'. ""They put me on a spinal board, and that's all I can remember from it."" Joshua's family said police had been contacted 15 times about attacks on the teenager, who has Asperger's syndrome. South Wales Police said it had carried out ""a thorough investigation"" into assault complaints and had arrested and bailed three teenagers. The family claims the teenager has been bullied for the last five years, targeted because of his disability, which is a form of autism. ""Josh has never really had an identity as such, he's a good lad, he's a pleaser, he would do anything for anyone,"" said his mother Cheryl Davies. ""Because of the Asperger's Joshua struggles with social cues. ""When people confront him, if they're nice to him, Joshua thinks they want to be his friend. Which isn't always the case."" ""He's slowly getting there, and it is giving him a few setbacks when he has those reality checks, although he's trying to stay positive."" During his time in hospital, Joshua has had lots of visitors but said it's still hard to take his mind off what happened.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Scientists have determined that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size by pitching them against each other in a competition over preferred burrows. There were also signs that they avoid fighting for burrows that don't fit their needs. The findings published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, suggest that mantis shrimp could use fighting to determine their own ideal burrow size. In the study, scientists collected wild mantis shrimp and matched them by size. They then introduced them to a variety of burrow sizes. When given a choice, shrimp with longer arms preferred larger burrows, and shrimp with shorter arms, preferred smaller burrows. In another experiment, they introduced pairs of shrimp to burrows of various sizes and recorded how long they fought and whether they changed burrows. The findings suggest that shrimp have a preferred size range that is different for each individual. Next, they tested whether shrimp would change burrows to avoid conflict by allowing pairs to fight over a burrow and then moving them to a new burrow. Sometimes the burrow was the same size as the original one, and sometimes it was slightly larger or smaller. They found that when a pair of shrimp fought over a small burrow, and were then moved to a larger burrow, they were unlikely to change burrows again. When the new burrow was smaller than the original one, however, they quickly moved to a different one. ""This suggests that shrimp avoid conflict over burrows by moving to burrows of different sizes,"" says lead author Dr. Nina Jones, a scientist at the University of Bristol. The researchers say they will now study how the size of the burrow affects the shrimp's movements inside of it.",llama_65B,1.4166666666666667,1.5,1.523076923076923,1.53125,1.0,0.03590569226326296,-0.43697987323345633,-0.3222581592714959,-0.2686227432729251,-0.04081632653061233,-0.19066474094605618,0.1295206055508831,-0.10363255400344598,0.1141975308641978,-0.036140556921132334,0.4285714285714286,0.5686825018769417,0.7315270935960589,0.6153823807805653,0.0,0.0,0.05102040816326512,-0.37312433036921305,-0.6953584114535243,-0.12155960420373972,0.2953240360951598,0.5020485056297249,0.10924369747899157,0.2701297839939163,-0.6454545454545455,-0.14052416244360563,0.08571428571428585,0.6917241307248181,0.15625000000000008,0.07828312007487534,-0.4110637113975702,-0.25716832623315433,-0.29464285714285715,0.3251169020148074,0.37362637362637346,0.07489348869316571,0.9339547655177398,0.17421593383609502,-0.25396825396825384,0.022471772482856443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272727272727272,1.0909090909090908,1.1075066660038604,0.13684530061241235,0.7759474643457493,0.3455042006817757,-0.25688469910061706,-0.35380889754640854

The test is expected to start on January 23 and will last, according to Russia's largest news agency TASS, for five days with all major telecommunication networks being disconnected at 7pm Moscow time (12am EST). This would be the first ""Internet Storm"" since 2009 when Russian authorities tested their own national network during the winter holidays. This year however they have decided to go much further by shutting down not only civilian but also military communication as well as blocking more than 50 popular websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. If you are one of those affected please be aware that this could adversely affect your ability to communicate with friends or even get medical attention if needed. Also, some government 'authorized' web services may become inaccessible and it will take several hours before new ones can be put online. The plan has been met with mixed reactions. Some see it as another step towards total state control over information while others say it's just part of Putin's efforts to show his determination against any form of terrorism attacks on Russia.",gpt_j,0.803030303030303,0.5,1.0923076923076922,0.921875,0.47368421052631576,0.2630159073599858,0.5470981689658478,0.5890694883822397,0.8117805176402567,0.6734693877551018,0.3377459418866646,1.26282590412111,0.7746644593039959,0.8641975308641976,0.5064699462380593,1.0,0.4197151400217349,1.4547413793103448,2.707349138305512,0.125,0.33071891388307384,0.5178571428571427,0.7202515752333692,-0.3162808633593673,0.0627480050715703,0.4552912223133715,0.28438671670783006,0.4779411764705883,1.0529594307894747,0.9545454545454548,0.6400759197773267,0.050000000000000044,0.622256776214835,-0.07812499999999993,0.591621245649419,0.5513887600853195,0.8152355479607759,1.1249999999999998,1.3040641561830457,0.3076923076923076,0.788743530321518,0.8498988366211432,0.8314077284855621,-0.15873015873015855,0.14583774682639045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3818181818181818,0.36363636363636365,-0.5702621094388989,0.7658952239496332,-0.5741835141742903,-0.743263512288433,0.845584893115198,0.9764739840575606

There 's also a good chance that we could see an updated design of it by then as well Tesla is all about making electric vehicles with high-performance capabilities while still looking quite sleek and stylish. They have managed to do this through their use of cutting edge technology which helps them make these cars better than many others out there today such as Teslas S, X, Y or 3. Now they want you to know how much better - even when compared to other EVs like the upcoming GMC Hummer EV, Nikola Badger (which isn't really comparable) or any other pickup trucks available right now from Ford Motor Company, Mercedes Benz or Rivian Automotive among countless others! The first thing you will notice if you go off roading behind one of those pickups currently being designed for electrification is its giant size. It's only natural because manufacturers need more room inside so people can be comfortable enough during long drives. However, here comes Elon Musk wanting to change things up once again... At least he says so: ""I think bigger is always better,"" said Musk at what was called 'Cybertruck Day' last Thursday night in Los Angeles. Big things come in small packages? Well maybe not exactly but going back to the original question posed above regarding performance comparisons between different types of engines; Tesla wants us to believe otherwise. We took our test drive over ice covered trails where Range Rover Sport would get stuck after just 10 minutes due to snow buildup.

However, the hospital's chief executive officer, Allen Stefanek, stated that the hospital had regained full electronic medical record capability. He also said that the FBI was investigating the incident, which he called a ""ransomware attack."" The ransomware attack involved malicious software that encrypted data on the hospital's computer systems and demanded payment in exchange for the data to be decrypted. While it is unclear how much money the hackers demanded, the FBI is working to identify the attackers and recover the lost data. The FBI recommends that organizations affected by ransomware pay the ransom to get their data back, as they may not be able to decrypt the information without the key provided by the attackers. Hospital administrators have also recommended that organizations take preventive measures to avoid being targeted by such attacks in the future, including regularly backing up critical data and installing security patches to vulnerable software.",text-davinci-003,0.5606060606060606,0.5,0.5538461538461539,0.546875,0.2631578947368421,0.9073196235609698,0.9623219703322685,1.6674748297159845,1.4042762919653118,0.12925170068027197,0.2231381085146164,0.1295206055508831,0.10755897347807489,0.0864197530864199,0.2904279824692164,0.625,0.7999185581282683,-0.04525862068965513,0.09725300779910925,0.0,0.0,0.19642857142857129,0.5996564676595695,-0.3752484819517917,-0.2216495213037292,0.6275635767022147,0.7871575122220082,-0.573529411764706,0.15529027479425836,0.4295454545454547,-0.558275573178145,-0.44999999999999996,-0.05041380923590859,0.5078125000000001,0.8845389880554739,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.7499999999999999,1.1314845506585092,-0.15384615384615388,0.09935531442256486,1.0460293373798686,0.3367876570272817,-0.26984126984126966,-0.00029420245391254706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4727272727272727,0.5454545454545454,0.11458148319329148,0.23723207209265162,0.12472445364531817,-1.450085680946415,1.055446228770623,1.2294562434164051

The Swaledale Ram helped to form a strong bond between the Regiment and the Duke of Devonshire's family, who have been staunch supporters of The Mercian Regiment since its formation in 2007. Private Derby XXXI was selected from a flock of over 500 Swaledale Rams, and his selection was made on the basis of his distinct colours and markings. He was officially presented to the Regiment in December 2010 and was welcomed with a guard of honour. The tradition of selecting a ram to serve as the Regiment's mascot dates back to the formation of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment in 1881.

Facebook was designing and testing ways to advance satellite connectivity as part of an effort to enable the next generation of broadband infrastructure. It turns out that Amazon shares many interests with this initiative, particularly in terms of developing a delivery platform for shortwave radio signals. The social media giant announced yesterday (April 25) it had entered into ""an agreement"" with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to acquire Kuiper Systems LLC - which produces Soapbox satellites and develop high frequency communications networks using them. The deal is reportedly worth 500 million, according to Bloomberg News' Amir Efrati. That would make Kuiper one half of what will be two new ventures between AWS and Facebook: A venture to bring low-cost Internet access to rural Europe and Africa through shortwave transmission; and another related project focused on delivering services via fixed or mobile wireless carriers in places where there are no terrestrial connections. It sounds like something straight from science fiction movies, but it might not seem so far fetched if you happen to be reading techcrunch.com right now. The site is reporting that Google plans to test its own satphone network much sooner than expected. It also seems that Elon Musk is serious about his goal to put up thousands of nano-satellites around Earth by 2020. He's looking for investors interested in helping him achieve his vision. Here's some more analysis at Cxensecurity... Google told us last year we'd have internet service arriving on our doorsteps by 2013 and the company keeps promising improvements every time they trot out their fiber dish map. Despite these lofty projections, Google Fiber didn't start rolling across Kansas City streets until just recently, almost six years after the announcement. Turns out Google really doesn't want to invest much money and risk building a network when even it can't afford to run the current one profitably. And profit isn't exactly what city officials wanted anyway. But FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski wants to change all that. Once he gets the support of Congress, maybe Google and other ISPs will finally get the incentive boost they need. As Apple continues to beef up the iPad line this fall and winter, the latest rumor suggests the tablet maker could soon unveil a second model. According to DigiTimes, Apple is readying multiple versions of the second generation iPad for launch within three months. By comparison, the first version debuted nearly five months ago. While most analysts view Cupertino as content to sell its existing models long-term, Apple may want to introduce additional hardware variations without cannibalizing sales. For example, a cheaper 7-inch model could help drive market penetration in emerging markets by cutting down inventory costs. Or perhaps third-party accessory makers would benefit by offering accessories designed specifically for iPads 2nd edition. A recent survey appears to confirm what many customers suspected: Online shoppers aren't very happy with paying full retail price. Not only do some see retailers online as being ""cheaper,"" but they also don't like the fact companies charge shipping fees for items sold locally. In addition, consumers complain about poor customer service, slow deliveries and billing practices that add insult onto injury. Are those problems going away? Oddly enough, yes! There does appear to be a growing trend towards local transactions, especially among younger generations. Many states such as California provide incentives for brick-and-mortar businesses to offer discounts at some point during their transaction cycle. Perhaps, given today's cost pressures, these trends represent a more realistic approach to consumer purchases. Today is Tax Day, April 15th, which means millions of Americans stand before the IRS to file their individual income tax returns. What happens then depends upon how much your employer deducted for withholding taxes each pay period. If you got back an adjusted gross of less than 1k per month, you're probably done filing. You'll owe nothing because state and federal law requires employers to withhold wages and send funds directly to the Internal Revenue Service. To repeat myself here: Employer withholdings are mandatory. Now I know some people think you should take responsibility for yourself. After all, you were smart enough to take an education. Maybe you've already gotten taxpayer assistance - I won't judge... provided you actually live in America. In any event, I highly recommend contacting your local United States Department of Treasury office if you haven't heard otherwise. They can tell you whether you need to complete a return, handle any claims, etc. Myself, I filed my taxes early, which wasn't always recommended - but hey, sometimes life moves fast and someone needs help. This way I saved 25year, plus presumably avoided whatever paperwork snafu caused me to miss this deadline. As a special bonus, once you've completed your 2012 taxes, look forward to getting W2 Forms 1099 later in the summer.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Over the last two years, researchers have rewritten nearly every major chapter in our galaxy's history due to working with better data. In 2018, the European spacecraft Gaia released a trove of new measurements for stars and galaxies around Earth including millions of new precise distances on how far away they are from us. Today (Nov. 13), scientists announced that their most recent estimate now puts the Milky Way at 1 trillion miles across, or roughly 17 percent bigger than previous estimates made over the past 2 decades. The figure comes courtesy of calculations based off of billions of observations taken by Gaia during its first three months of operations. Since it launched into orbit 634 million kilometers above Earth in December 2013, Gaia has collected more than 150 billion astrometric positions of stars, constraining how much mass is between them thus giving astronomers an estimated radius. To put this measurement into perspective: That distance would be equivalent to what one person could wrap his arms around about 9 times before he'd hit the moon if he were standing still. And while many other previously-estimated figures had been within 5 of that number, Gaia's measurement was so accurate it pushed out all but 0.5.In any case, the news isn't just groundbreaking because we've come closer to understanding our own home galaxy. It's also been another important step towards verifying Albert Einstein's General Theory Of Relativity, which describes gravity as falling objects feel against each other through space time itself rather than purely by matter alone. Thanks to these changes in theory, no set amount of matter will ever ""explain"" why something else exists without making assumptions such as infinite energy, or infinite numbers of particles. According to Andrew Liddle, author of Gravity Cosmology: Jumping Gravitational Forces You Haven't Seen Before. These] particle theories explain everything you can possibly see. So they account for nothing outside of looking.""So when NASA astronaut Scott Kelly successfully completed 340 days in space back in March 2016, it provided additional proof supporting GR and its importance.

This section gives you some tips about what to do if you are feeling sad about what you've seen or heard. 1. Talk to someone you trust - a family member, friend, teacher, counselor, or religious leader. Talking can help you work through your feelings and better understand what's happening. 2. Avoid excessive exposure to upsetting news stories. Too much exposure can cause you to become overwhelmed and isolated. 3. Take part in activities that make you feel good. Exercise, spending time with friends, or doing something creative can all help you feel better. 4. Limit your use of social media. Seeing other people's reactions to events can often make things worse. 5. Help out in some way.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Cows at the RusMoloko dairy farm near Moscow in Russia wear VR headsets to improve their conditions and to enable them to relax into producing more milk. Data from farms across Russia, Europe and the US suggest that dairy cows produce more milk when wearing VR headsets. Russian farmers are not alone in thinking that cows are more productive when they have something to keep them entertained. A farm in Connecticut in the US claims that installing large TVs showing rolling pastures in their cowshed has led to a reduction in anxiety among the cows and a resulting increase in milk production. In a similar move, the Ministry of Agriculture in Moscow is sponsoring a competition to develop virtual reality content for cows, with the aim of helping the country's dairy industry improve its global competitiveness. ""We are currently testing VR headsets on a herd of cows,"" said an official at the Ministry, ""and we are seeing that the cows are much more relaxed and much happier."" This is how happy cows look like. The ministry is encouraging software developers and hackers to come up with new ideas for VR content for cows. The competition's website suggests ""visualisation of a summer field of flowers"" and ""a nice cowboy"" as possible options for the cows to view. The Ministry also suggests that developers could use existing human-focused virtual reality content such as ""a walk in the forest, along a river, or in the mountains."" It is thought that some existing VR content could be adapted to provide relaxation and entertainment for cows. ""It is important to note that not all cows are the same,"" the competition's website explains, ""so we need a variety of content to meet the needs of all cows. It is recommended that developers consult with veterinarians and animal psychologists to help come up with ideas for new content."" It is thought that dairy cows are more productive when they are relaxed and entertained. The organisers of the competition say that the winning VR content will be distributed to farms across the country. It is thought that providing cows with virtual reality headsets will not only improve their overall quality of life but will also help to improve Russia's dairy industry. ""By improving the welfare of cows we will improve the quality of their milk and increase our global competitiveness in the dairy market,"" said an official at the ministry. ""This will help us to address the problem of food security in Russia,"" he said, ""and will also provide a significant boost to our national economy.""

Mr Doherty's brothers, Joseph and Daniel, are on trial accused of helping conceal her remains and lying to police. The court heard Natalia was last seen by her children in April 2003 when she left her Eastbourne home to travel to Luton. Prosecutor Neil King said her ex-husband was responsible for her death. The couple had separated in 2001 after 23 years of marriage. Mr Doherty took his own life at a flat in Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, on their wedding anniversary in July 2003. He had been receiving psychiatric care. His two brothers, who both wore hearing loops in the dock, face a total of seven charges. Natalia's death came to light in 2014 when Joseph Doherty revealed Gerald had murdered her, but that her remains had been ""chopped up."" Mr King told the court Natalia's body was found a year later - intact - under rubble in the garden of Daniel Doherty's house in Icknield Way, Luton. She had suffered ""a blunt force trauma"" inflicted by a third party, but the cause of death could not be established.

This tutorial shows you how to create an animation using JavaScript functions to calculate the path coordinates and SVG elements to draw the path. Here are the steps to get started: 1. First, create an SVG element in your HTML file with a desired width and height. "" 'HTML svg width""500"" height""500""svg "" ' 2. Next, create a JavaScript function to calculate the path coordinates. The function should return an array of objects, each representing a point on the path. In this example, we will create a simple sine wave. "" 'JavaScript function createSineWave (a, b, c, d, n) { let path ; for (let i 0; i 360; i 10) { let x i Math.PI 180; let y a Math.sin (b x c) d; path.push x: i, y: y; } return path; } "" ' 3. Now, create a function to draw the path using the 'path' element in SVG. This function should take the array of path coordinates as an argument, calculate the path string using those coordinates, and set the 'd' attribute of the 'path' element to the path string. "" 'JavaScript function drawPath (path, element) { let pathString 'M {path[0].x} {path[0].y; for (let i 1; i path.length; i) { pathString ' L {path[i].x} {path[i].y; } element.setAttribute d', pathString); } "" ' 4. Lastly, you can animate the path by updating its coordinates and redrawing it at a set interval using 'setInterval '. In this example, we will animate the sine wave by adding a variable 't' to the 'createSineWave ' function and using it to change the amplitude of the wave over time. "" 'JavaScript let svg document.querySelector svg; let path createSineWave (100, 1, 0, 250, 360); let pathElement document.createElementNS 'path; svg.appendChild (pathElement); let t 0; setInterval (function { t 0.1; let wave createSineWave (100 50 Math.sin (t), 1, 0, 250, 360); drawPath (wave, pathElement); }, 50); "" ' And that's it!

They can be 3D-printed into the shapes of hairs or other fiber-like structures, which can then be embedded into textiles for use in clothing, toys, and other applications. In a paper published in Nature Energy, the team describes a fiber made from a continuous core of electrodes, which are surrounded by a solid electrolyte. The core is made of two carbon nanotubes; one positively charged, the other negatively. The core is coated in a conductive polymer, which is surrounded by an insulating polymer coating that also acts as a solid electrolyte. The electrodes, which are separated by a nanometer-thick polymer layer, are too far apart to exchange ions, so the battery is not in a charged state. When the fiber is placed in an electrolyte solution, ions migrate through the solid electrolyte and set up an electrochemical reaction between the electrodes. In the experiments the researchers wound the fiber into a yarn-like structure and sewed it into a fabric. When this fabric was placed in an electrolyte solution, the fiber was charged by the migration of ions. The researchers found that this charge was stable over time, although it gradually decreased over the course of several days. This is a limitation that could be overcome by improving the quality of the electrolyte coating or designing a better electrode, says the team. The team is also working on improving the performance of the battery, including increasing its charging rate and its capacity for storing charge. These rechargeable batteries can be made into long, thin fibers that could be woven into fabrics. Courtesy of the researchers The new fiber-based battery could be used to power wearable devices, such as these LEDs sewn onto a glove.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"China's state-owned train developer CRRC has unveiled a magnetic levitation train that can reach speeds of up to 600 kph. It began development in 2016, with a successful trial run taking place earlier this year on the Beijing-Shanghai high speed railway line for the first time since it was reported last month by The Wall Street Journal. The maglev trains are designed and built exclusively for China by the world's largest rolling stock manufacturer by revenue, Shanghai Shendi Group, which is owned 51 by CSR Corp., parent company of CRRC. Maglev technology uses magnetism to keep vehicles suspended above track rails at very low friction levels when they travel through airless environments such as through vacuum tubes or without any contact between wheels and rail surface. Propelled by electromagnets placed along both sides of the tracks below the vehicle, the trains move more efficiently than conventional electric model trains because there is no transmission loss caused by resistance generated from multiple mechanical components like gears or axles found in traditional locomotives. Although these vehicles have been around for decades - Japan pioneered them back in 1964, while Germany had its own version called Transrapid (now known as TGV) that took passengers across France faster than jets used to fly before Concorde arrived into service - only now does one see an increasing number being tested for commercial use outside Japan. For example, there is talk about developing a 62 billion bullet train connecting New York City and Washington D.C.. Other countries including India also plan to build their versions soon; although some experts say most projects will take years longer compared to those already completed.",opt_30b,1.2727272727272727,0.5,1.1076923076923078,1.09375,0.6842105263157895,0.7771066081414397,0.09926664674364674,0.3781687546496153,0.48145744019704567,1.7278911564625845,1.0695142571476846,1.295206055508831,1.175545761069755,1.220679012345679,1.049056826725185,1.0,0.6499640540098776,1.8297413793103448,2.3346199903885787,0.0,0.0,1.6964285714285712,1.0846658271832608,0.6861686527118478,0.6721783509948561,1.6611977030352745,1.7360838194222772,1.8161764705882355,1.5774065445761167,-0.09545454545454539,0.7602848979847274,0.050000000000000044,0.622256776214835,0.39062500000000006,0.9849656083569193,0.5513887600853195,0.297647495328325,0.18749999999999997,0.4277606437664822,0.3076923076923076,-0.2480954548496517,0.8498988366211432,0.6510217158630891,0.28571428571428586,0.34341844075402445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9636363636363636,1.0909090909090908,-0.5982054001914054,0.8888108493931114,-0.2987994438613567,-1.0018117458312452,1.551448363518436,1.462081256755155

The 15-minute flight took place in Canada's Squamish Valley on Thursday morning (October 10). The aircraft is called ""Seaplane Ecoliner 1,000 and it was piloted by Richard Browning, who previously flew for NASA before starting his own company to develop electric airplanes that can take off vertically like helicopters but fly horizontally as regular planes once they reach their cruising altitude of around 2,500 feet (762 meters) above sea level,"" reports Popular Mechanics. ""According to Browning's company magniX, each Seaplane Ecolineer will use eight propellers manufactured from recycled plastic bottles.""Using one million bottles makes this project more than just another zero emissions aviation solution - we're changing the way plastics are made forever,' said Greg McDougall, CEO at magniX, about how he hopes the team's collaboration with Harbour Air could eventually help reduce waste created during production of traditional aircraft parts such as fuselages and tail sections.""For now though, the aeroplane itself looks very conventional: It seats up to nine people, there's no cockpit hatch or jet engine exposed within sight - just two rows of six windows underneath its solar panels. And if you were thinking all those batteries would make flying it noisy inside? You'd be mistaken; when plugged into shore power instead of supplemental lithium ion cells while docked, the plane only emits 'the hum of tiling fans spinning gently' according to the BBC'magical, quiet ride[...] as smooth as glass.Browning also told reporters after today's successful battery performance tests seem promising. He says what started out as a research project quickly turned into something much greatera new technologythat may change everything about our future transportation landscape.""We've set some goals...we want everyone to have access [to] efficient travel where the footprint doesn't matter... Where I live currently [in Seattle], someone might need three hours [by car],"" added Alex Kucharski, cofounder CTO at magniX. ""That journey time goes down dramatically because [with ePlanes] we don't get stuck behind cars going slow... We really believe in creating community impact through these vehicles.What happened last week wasn't magic ... This isn't science fiction...

We also note concerns expressed about some Ofcom sanctions being disproportionate; if so then those concerns merit further consideration.""",opt_30b,0.21212121212121213,0.0,0.24615384615384617,0.25,0.3157894736842105,1.112560573778057,2.046997919280186,1.6994417633384225,2.092170637501108,0.6530612244897959,0.44316266088337564,0.7253153910849455,0.594806884892625,0.695679012345679,0.6713405212722563,0.10000000000000009,0.46338016856618264,0.8172413793103447,1.4618749365412842,0.0,0.0,0.8285714285714283,0.7121060307706424,-0.021442770397245223,0.026765386442230768,0.6103363412633305,1.343328276468336,0.3823529411764707,0.36392019774606077,0.3945454545454548,-0.5489313778978989,-0.3999999999999999,-0.03207660596625444,1.09375,0.627029874122419,0.222016136511175,-0.010714843619247419,0.5624999999999999,1.045110873181042,0.2153846153846152,0.5222206345843362,0.732220536165908,-0.10202770740515503,0.8634920634920635,-0.40199694117381796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6545454545454545,-0.09090909090909091,-0.6358968971733012,0.5680979082416339,-0.6511417073835075,-1.6970292951873318,1.487077816740867,1.2883804211737857

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Motor Neuron Disease eventually takes away its victim's ability to speak, but a new AI-based tool developed by Rolls-Royce may help patients speak again. Rolls Royce worked with the Motor Neurone Disease Association and technology company Cognitives to create an AI-powered speech tool that can replicate a patient's voice using just a few minutes of voice recordings. This tool can then be used to generate synthetic speech that sounds like the patient's original voice, allowing them to communicate much more easily. The tool uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the characteristics of a person's voice, including pitch, pronunciation, and tone. By using this data, the software can generate new speech that is indistinguishable from the original voice. This breakthrough technology has the potential to have a significant impact on the lives of people with Motor Neuron Disease, allowing them to maintain their independence and communicate with their loved ones even as the disease progresses. It's a prime example of how technology can be a force for good in the world, improving people's lives in ways that were once impossible.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.6212121212121212,0.3333333333333333,0.5846153846153846,0.515625,0.5263157894736842,0.4829014014292579,0.9529150552552023,0.6927832975648454,1.1221806683458082,0.7074829931972787,0.029452697312357466,0.5920941968040372,0.15487291906341513,0.3919753086419755,0.1261962614005999,0.0714285714285714,0.06471213495878765,1.1600985221674875,1.338441093391816,0.0,0.0,0.8775510204081631,0.3471891815390972,0.1807319219196384,0.9804512581716538,0.8859721082854797,0.6943242796459401,-0.2731092436974791,-0.09555968581574496,0.3545454545454546,0.5644899593058383,-0.05714285714285716,-0.01628379786460637,1.09375,0.2788890409115127,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,1.6339285714285712,1.0085540712847836,0.24175824175824168,-0.01511047450924775,-0.07471638124141916,-0.028078089686660604,0.1269841269841273,-0.2883679035339644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3090909090909091,0.7272727272727273,0.2551053166469643,0.045152152328518706,0.37529754481089744,-0.8473837296112214,0.9338038503038979,1.0592757924712488

He was among seven officials arrested at a luxury hotel in Switzerland last year. More than 40 others have since been indicted. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who is not among those indicted, announced his resignation in June after FIFA's ethics committee suspended him amid a separate corruption investigation. Prosecutors in the United States have indicted 40 soccer officials and sports marketing executives on charges that include racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. A former FIFA official from Guatemala pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. federal court to racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, admitting he took bribes in exchange for his help selling marketing rights to soccer tournaments. Rafael Callejas, 72, a former Guatemalan president and former president of the Guatemalan soccer federation, appeared in Brooklyn, N.Y., to enter the plea. He's among more than 40 people charged in the U.S. with corruption. Callejas admitted that between 2009 and 2015, he received at least 175,000 in exchange for his help selling marketing rights to tournaments. ""As a former president of the Guatemalan soccer federation, Rafael Callejas's guilty plea to racketeering conspiracy demonstrates his willingness to sacrifice the integrity of the game to accept tens of thousands of dollars in bribes,"" U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers said in a statement. Six of the 40 people charged are in the U.S. and are under house arrest. The rest of the indictments are against officials in Latin America. The charges stem from an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into corruption at the world soccer body, FIFA. The probe began after the Swiss government arrested several officials staying at a luxury hotel in Zurich last year. The U.S. alleges that the officials were taking bribes for their help in selling marketing rights to the world's most popular sport. The Justice Department says the conspiracy ""robbed the FIFA of honest services by taking undisclosed bribes and kickbacks and then, in exchange for those bribes and kickbacks, agreeing to use their influence as soccer officials to provide favorable treatment to companies and other soccer entities."" The probe has also led to an indictment of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who said he would step down after his organization's ethics committee suspended him. He has not been arrested.",llama_65B,2.0454545454545454,2.1666666666666665,1.9076923076923078,1.84375,2.3684210526315788,0.9299273130080363,0.8528136297799583,0.8892733926350618,0.6744758155288473,-0.0332577475434617,0.7996121724737416,-0.11512942715634057,0.09350577665641002,-0.19444444444444442,0.0661881347316881,-0.38888888888888884,0.2557001362275616,-0.6494252873563218,-0.39699234240084097,0.0,0.0,0.6904761904761902,1.6123098731685026,0.2406355344579743,0.33660614384693655,-0.2625102543068088,0.2797106356993918,0.6372549019607845,0.4269824006294328,-0.7565656565656566,-0.07035534786430657,-0.0888888888888888,1.6265899839025184,0.052083333333333356,0.6818746991770253,0.16878419734767694,0.3515870177982862,0.06249999999999994,1.0119629853775245,-0.1025641025641026,0.3644681650157759,0.0871691114483224,0.02299550456318086,-0.2821869488536153,0.4317885326116789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.509090909090909,2.3636363636363638,0.6484045197699162,0.3429398408462801,1.169340131265118,-0.7076370044144824,0.46655014617745527,0.788234765719203

""He became distressed very quickly,"" photographer Paul Henry told AAP on Wednesday from Brisbane where his colleague is recovering after being flown there by helicopter. ""We just saw him bobbing up and down."" Mr Henry said it looked as though something heavy may have hit the Australian, who has not yet returned home but will do so once he recovers. Another of their group managed to get close enough to grab hold of him before he disappeared under water again, Paul Henry said: ""He went straight back underwater."" Head injuries ""A lot of people are saying that if he'd stayed longer we could've pulled him out,"" Paul Henry added. But they decided against doing this because the sea conditions were too dangerous, he said. ""When you look at the depth of the ocean here and the turbulence... we didn't feel comfortable pulling someone onto our boat at all times during these situations."" It appears the victim suffered head trauma and burns. Meanwhile, search planes resumed efforts overnight for missing skipper Craig Hutchison, 45, from Bundaberg, south east Queensland. His yacht crashed into a reef about 90 kilometres offshore yesterday morning while carrying 14 passengers, including three women and two children. He is believed to be among more than 50 tourists feared dead. However, authorities believe most lost their lives trying to reach safety after abandoning the stricken vessel early today.",gpt_j,1.3106060606060606,1.5,1.4,1.5,1.7894736842105263,0.024730799534113338,-0.214460505547675,-0.3403620560673234,-0.37366647602440495,-0.17687074829931979,0.016560120685959943,-0.01850294365012609,0.3548704389475576,0.07716049382716043,0.35704265802074325,-0.5714285714285714,-0.26181110252159023,1.1600985221674875,1.1513434696951041,0.0,0.0,-0.3775510204081634,0.2154792555035204,-0.12253011655568703,0.525940870165739,0.44298605414273984,0.3366464963009746,-0.3823529411764707,0.0857043596640187,0.1545454545454547,1.082694753234236,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,-0.7142857142857143,0.5001361781371718,0.1022442733933043,0.5857056278243569,-0.08035714285714289,0.32511690201480775,0.769230769230769,0.706557553746348,0.7098056217934822,0.5554147862581554,0.5079365079365081,0.15711112153113307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9272727272727272,1.0,-0.5008602485118254,0.9361849608138486,-0.3356315473661295,0.41813929044250164,-0.37480091758458234,-0.4082111845155054

It uses pre-recorded driver videos of facial movements and applies them to static images. I'm sure you've seen these before; they're often used to create animated versions of people who have passed away, or to animate characters from old photos and paintings. This isn't the first time these types of animations have been done, but MyHeritage says it's the first time they're being done with artificial intelligence, and they say the results are more realistic than those of other systems. The software was trained on 45,000 images using 800,000 faces to create 3D models for each. It works with photos that have both a frontal and a profile view, and while it's limited to two facial movements at the moment, the company says it will be adding more in the future. I tried it out with an old photo of my father and I was pretty impressed. The resemblance is uncanny.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A Belgian research group discovered a major security flaw in the keyless entry system of the Tesla Model X. The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer and a cheap radio transmitter, which costs around 40. The attack works by intercepting the signals sent from the car to the key fob when it is used to unlock the doors. The attackers then use the Raspberry Pi to replay those signals, allowing them to open the car without having access to the actual key fob. Tesla has since released a software update to address the security flaw. The update requires owners to enter their unique PIN code each time they use the keyless entry system.

The project aims to create a browser that is fast, secure, lightweight and low maintenance. Flow will be a browser that is not bloated with unnecessary features, which will help with its performance and security. The company's CEO, David Ayre, has stated that he wants the browser to be the fastest on the market. This will be achieved by building Flow from the ground up, with all the core components being written in C. This should allow the browser to run much faster than those written in scripting languages. The project has been going for around a year, and the first release of the browser will be available soon. The browser will run on Windows and Mac OS X. There will be both 32-bit and 64-bit versions available. More information on Ekioh can be found here. The project's website can be found here.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Amazon has recently come under fire as it was discovered that it previously allowed vendors the ability to bid for an Amazon's Choice badge by lowering prices and spending more on advertising. It turns out, the company does have a system in place where sellers with low-priced products can be promoted via third party sites. The above information is based on what we've been able to uncover so far as well as conversations some of our sources had over Twitter this morning after hearing about the situation. Needless to say, we're still looking into whether or not these practices were actually used before they stopped happening around February 4th. How Did This Happen? According to one of the people involved in the conversation discussed below, there are two types of ad networks: Cost Per Click (CPC) which only pays per click and cost per impression (CPI). Both of them will display advertisements but CPI allows people like Amazon to buy impressions without paying any money up front. The idea behind the CPC model is you pay no upfront cost in exchange for being displayed to visitors. However, if someone clicks your ads, then your media costs CPM or ""costs per thousand."" In other words, when someone views your ad through Google Adsense, Adbrite, etc., you need to put up something called premium placement fees. These fee cover inventory and data entry so many websites do charge a monthly subscription. One of our source says his site gets thousands of visits each day. He claims that normally he would spend 1-2 in advertising every month just because he doesn't want to look bad compared to other websites on Alexa and Google's search engine rankings. This means his total bill hovers between 10K -20K annually. That number seems pretty high considering the amount of traffic his website receives daily. When Amazon launched their first eCommerce platform back in 1996, vendors could submit their product listing to Amazon.com and paid a small flat rate fee. Sellers not approved at that time went to eBay who required users to create accounts. After that came Drop Ship Locker in 2001 and Amazon Marketplace Stores in 2004. Today, Amazon is widely considered to be the most popular online retailer due to its massive size and dominance of the market - even surpassing rival Walmart. Like the rest of us, Amazon makes use of intermediaries such as wholesalers, manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, shipping companies, shippers, transportation providers and others to ensure all its operations run smoothly. The problem is Amazon has become too big for anyone else to compete effectively against them while also increasing their own sales revenues. Recently though, Amazon has come under fire from various groups ranging from lawmakers to publishers, consumers to competitors. While much of this controversy centers upon anti-trust acts that might force Amazon to start charging customers directly, another issue increasingly gaining attention focuses upon how Amazon uses its dominant presence within the marketplace. For example, did you know that your Amazon order may contain items your vendor never received andor shipped to you? Some of those same merchants may not earn anything since Amazon often deducts the full retail price of purchased merchandise before sending payments to vendors. If you ever wonder why certain listings show zero dollars sold using either the FBA or FBM feature; it's because Amazon won't allow vendors to make those transactions publicly visible. You see, Amazon isn't interested in giving non-profit organizations extra exposure. As such, they keep plenty of details private so nobody knows exactly how things work behind closed doors. We don't mean to imply Amazon would knowingly sell tainted goods. But, unless rules change regarding electronic invoicing systems and public advertising, we think it'll always be hard keeping track of everyone's business dealings including Amazon's.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (PS11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange these old currency bills by the end-December deadline for receiving new ones at 50 lower value. The government has said that it will not issue any more Rs 500 or Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes after Friday midnight across India. The changeover process is expected to be smooth but people are facing problems due to lack of information on how to proceed, especially elderly citizens who may not know their PINs or have forgotten them. Here's what you need to do: 1. Know your account number: You can link your Aadhaar card with all major banks' accounts on its official website or search for ""AADHAAR"" under ""Services."" If there is no record of an Aadhaar linked to your current account, you'll need to fill out a form along with other proof such as PAN Card, passport etc., available here. Once done, a temporary password would be sent to your registered mobile phone number, which helps generate one-time passwords every day from digitally signed messages. With this code access can then be granted. This step should ideally take place only once unless details like date of birth changes otherwise it could result in many days without access to funds. At least three attempts should be made to enter the correct OTP before changing it so make sure to keep track of all codes until they expire. Also note that if cash transactions happen, you won't get instant confirmation of successful transfer. So ensure you carry enough cash while travelling around cities and rural areas where ATMs may run dry. 2. Get hold of Rs 100 - Rs 200 notes: Banks and post offices maintain special counters meant to deal exclusively with PS11 denominations. They usually open for business between 10 am and 12 noon Indian Standard Time daily except Sundays and holidays or during national crisis when banking norms allow them to function till 9 p.m. These specialised counters accept payments using either debit cards or credit cards accompanied by photo ID. It's best to visit a couple of these branches within hours of each other since queues build up over time. Besides usual transaction fees, service charges apply. Commonly asked questions include, ""How much?"" and ""Where shall I go?"" Your bank branch manager will help guide you after knowing your request. Make sure you know the right counter though; some private sector banks use different ones than those used by public sector lenders. Asking someone else, even another person from same sectiondepartment about a particular scheme isn't a good idea because chances are he might tell you wrong info. In case of doubt always check online first or call customer care centre of respective bank. 3. Select 'exchange now': On most websites load times aren't immediately clear. Take a few minutes to look through FAQ sections or contact customer support whenever needed. Enquire about minimum amounts required i.e. minimum amount carriedminimum balance in affected account or maximum limit per session. Note also that Rs 2000 and Rs 5000 denominations cannot be exchanged together. Registration is mandatory, identity proof needs to match the name on the statement issued by the bank.

The Japanese team, who report their findings in the journal Cancer Cell, believe the drug could be tested in people with breast, lung and bowel cancer in the next few years. The researchers used the drug, called metformin, in combination with another drug called phenformin. Phenformin is closely related to metformin, but has been banned in most countries because of its association with the rare, but potentially fatal, condition of lactic acidosis. The scientists have now modified phenformin to prevent this condition. They tested the drug on mice that had been injected with human cancer cells, and found the drug helped shrink the tumours.

By then Mr Justice Nicholas Parfitt had already heard evidence from English officers about what they found when they went into the defendant's house after arresting him at Heathrow airport as part of an investigation by US counter terrorism officials. And also how their search turned up materials relating not only to al-Qaeda and its propaganda but also videos showing beheadings carried out by so called Islamic State (IS) jihadists. The judge will decide whether information given under oath can be used during Mr Naseer's trial with possible consequences for thousands more people facing extradition on similar allegations. For around four hours this week one British investigator gave testimony which strongly suggested such material is likely to find its way onto UK soil once foreign suspects are sent back home - where they may face charges over activities linked to IS or other groups without being tried first here.",opt_30b,0.6212121212121212,0.0,0.6923076923076923,0.703125,-0.05263157894736842,0.29546797338124425,0.20550516131986588,0.3316839506642816,0.7956850772448711,2.122448979591836,0.2436915711339938,2.2277544154751894,0.36707922068199084,2.1993827160493824,0.6576957608215763,0.5,1.0254539842961343,2.317241379310345,2.4670367129500215,0.0,0.0,1.9428571428571424,-0.04310022060601965,0.7333427475857873,0.14716491494642955,1.575061525840853,-0.17434928728056015,2.21764705882353,0.7781797264043738,0.6745454545454548,1.0364116856690688,0.40000000000000013,2.115325427167254,-0.40625,0.0,0.222016136511175,0.3181980515339463,0.5624999999999999,-1.324846381066645,1.692307692307692,1.285626443128732,1.359838138593829,-0.10202770740515511,-0.38095238095238076,-0.07766282607972567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3454545454545455,0.8181818181818182,-0.8298135306660335,0.7087444470254878,-0.13566750268493777,-1.1266668914367253,1.834784960994902,1.811729784941669

Her sons Gary and Philip found their mother dead while they were making arrangements for her funeral. The fire service investigation concluded that there were no defects with the electrical appliances involved but confirmed the presence of a fault within one electric blanket which ultimately led to ignition of the other blankets present in her bedroom.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"SpaceX stacked a Starship prototype rocket on top of a Super Heavy rocket booster for the first time on Friday morning at the company's facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Starship and Super Heavy will be able to loft payloads into orbit or Mars on their own power when they begin flight testing next year. Starship is SpaceX's answer to NASA's Orion crew spacecraft and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsules that are being built as replacements for America's aging space shuttles. Both companies hope to have these vehicles ready for commercial flights by early 2020. But unlike those other rockets, Starship can launch with passengers - just like a jet airliner - though it also has room for astronauts to live inside its massive cabin during long journeys through deep space. The prototypes that SpaceX aims to fly soon are much smaller than either spaceship: They stand about 10 feet tall and feature four solar panels jutting from each side. (Future versions could look different but not too drastically so as not to confuse customers.) The fully assembled first test version seems to fit well atop the nose cone of a Falcon 9 launcher; Elon Musk tweeted photos showing the two parts sitting atop one another. And while this was a static demonstration rather than an actual flight-ready rocket, it still marked some important milestones for both SpaceX and the future designs of the world's most advanced reusable rocket family. Building the Super Heavy booster helped demonstrate how such giant boosters might work in real life instead of merely as theoretical models used in simulations. It demonstrated that Falcon's design had plenty of capacity to handle - and even loft out in front of - this bigger vehicle, which stands several dozen feet taller. Having completed the task successfully means SpaceX knows what needs tweaking before Super Heavy takes off carrying people into orbit. ""This milestone demonstrates our design progress towards achieving safe, reliable reusability, and bodes very well for the upcoming orbital launches scheduled later this year,"" said Hans Koenigsmann, chief executive officer of SpaceX's Commercial Crew program, in statement released after the event. For now, however, all eyes were fixed on the stack itself. Here's everything you need to know about the StarshipSuper Heavy combo. 1) This isn't actually going up any time soon All three stages of Falcon 9 booster burn out completely during liftoff to reach Earth escape velocity, then fall back down toward landing pads. That process allows them to quickly go from zero to full thrust again, saving fuel over having to shuttle liquid oxygen or kerosene around. Even SuperHeavy doesn't use staged combustion. Instead, once the first stage ignites its Raptor engine, it goes straight for low earth orbit. Once there, the second core fires thrusters for 15 seconds to orient itself properly and get closer to the ground. Then the third stage comes in and does essentially the same thing until the whole booster hits the water. At that point, the first stage lands first and eventually pushes aside the rest of the ship. So far, no matter what kind of configuration SpaceX builds, the final result looks pretty similar. These images show the super heavy booster with first stage engines firing. Credit: elonmusk Twitter A few hours ago, exactly 12 minutes past midnight local time here in Texas, SpaceX founder Elon Musk posted pictures of himself standing beside the new combined booster, calling it ""Starhopper."" The name refers to the mythical stone bird made famous in the story ""Hop O' My Thumb"" by Rudyard Kipling. More specifically, it calls attention to sparkly hooves sticking out of the bottom end. Those aren't actual engines, he explained, because he wanted something more dramatic. He went so far as to call the anomaly a ""sparkle pony,"" although many of his followers noted that it seemed to look more like hoofed horse legs. Whatever the case may be - and despite the fact that SpaceX already produces working frameworks called interplanetary transfer ships that resemble horses' tails - the plan is to strap a pair of large fins onto the bottom of the craft, creating what would normally be considered a forward stabilizer. But the fans who've grown accustomed to seeing different kinds of SpaceX rockets don big thruster pods and pointed wings couldn't help noticing that this wasn't quite right. Comments began popping up online. People wondered why the fin projectors weren't facing upwards, suggesting perhaps some sort of propulsion system meant to propel the vehicle forwards. Others suggested the oddity was actually intended to give someone somewhere else room to board the plane without looking like they're trying to run away. One fan took a picture where the shadow didn't appear to line up with that theory, leaving us to wonder if maybe we'd been misreading things. Musk showed off the non-functional heat shield attached to the belly of the beast: The idea behind the strange shape was to allow engineers to try flushing hot air from within the thermal protection material under pressure directly out the sides.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Karate is a tool that combines API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing, and UI automation into a single framework. It uses BDD syntax and has powerful JSON and XML assertions built-in. Developers can run Karate on any Java-enabled machine, or on a Docker container. Karate provides a framework for Web APIs and Mobile Apps (including hybrid apps). Tests can be executed using the JUnit runner, which provides parallel-execution, or by using a Maven plugin. Sauce Labs supports the testing of mobile apps using Karate. This doc assumes you're familiar with writing Karate tests. See Karate for the details. This will prompt you for the Sauce Labs username and access key. You'll be able to specify a platform to run your tests on. When your tests execute, you will be able to view the results in the Sauce Labs Dashboard. You can also use a Maven plugin to run tests. You will need to configure your Karate Maven plugin to use Sauce Labs, following the steps outlined above. How long should a mobile test be? This is a very subjective question, and depends on the nature of the app you are testing. However, 3 to 5 minutes is a good target. If you have an app that is very intensive, with lots of interactivity, then you may be running your test for 15 minutes or more. If you have an app that is mostly static, with a small number of interactions, then you can probably test the whole thing in 3 minutes. You can also target different test durations for different Sauce Labs platforms. For example, you can target a test duration of 5 minutes for iOS 9.3 and a test duration of 10 minutes for Android 4.4.",llama_65B,1.378787878787879,2.5,1.4153846153846155,1.34375,1.6842105263157894,-0.7072048605856155,-0.3941141893855737,-0.3382278991707477,-0.10264440644258409,-0.9115646258503401,-0.23629801630920028,-0.7771236333052985,0.08472330017563995,-0.8469135802469132,0.10599074669927668,-0.55,-0.3380691450756801,-0.15775862068965504,0.2889738840525621,0.0,0.0,-0.6285714285714286,-0.06146370433854915,-0.2337261973299731,-0.23192929747990712,-0.5955701394585725,-0.10918485179023624,-0.9558823529411766,-0.1232287511626236,-0.16545454545454547,-0.027105883220337308,-0.19999999999999996,0.29087884179643453,-0.45312499999999983,-0.36192430033053685,0.04235834183436895,0.7009040510637397,-0.4125,0.4076150661688801,0.030769230769230656,0.19073729252203303,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515511,-0.2920634920634918,0.10402755654480816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.509090909090909,0.45454545454545453,0.6992408657794843,0.3727064341388644,-0.23612025017779636,0.7237942905338722,-0.9523896873271476,-0.8633002365443568

There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but there are an estimated 2,000 that have yet to be discovered and created. The Facility will use intense beams of particles to create isotopes that cannot be found in nature.

By studying these new elements, scientists can learn more about our world and the origins of life.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"There is a gene that codes for a protein called cytochrome P450, which exists in many mammals' livers, helping them clean up toxins. Scientists spliced this gene from a rabbit's liver into the mouse genome to create what they call ""cytotoxic mice."" They found these genetically engineered rodents are more sensitive than regular ones when tested with chemicals known as organophosphates (OPs). These insecticides have been widely used since World War II and remain one of the most popular classes on Earth because of their relative simplicity compared to some other types such as carbamates or chlorinated hydrocarbons. OPs target specific receptors inside cells - so-called cholinesterase inhibitors - that break down acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter for communication between nerve cells. The pesticides bind tightly enough to those receptors so no acetylcholine can get through, effectively shutting down motor neurons responsible for breathing muscles during sleep; therefore, suffocation results if you're exposed while sleeping. They also cause paralysis by blocking another key molecule involved in human movement: nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) channels in muscle tissue. This causes temporary weakness but doesn't kill brain cells like OPs do. Organophosphate-based pesticides were initially developed before modern understanding of how animals move, causing widespread concern about potential harm if people inhaled large amounts at once. But it turns out exposure over time may be just as deadly. A study published last year showed low levels of OP poisonings each day result in death within two years. And experiments with lab rats indicate long-term exposures often give rise to malformations and diseases including Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease.",opt_30b,1.2348484848484849,1.1666666666666667,1.0307692307692307,0.96875,1.1578947368421053,1.4716186733377954,1.4250918574573075,0.832486181774474,0.7262380456250606,0.1519274376417234,0.03940759034049713,-0.10793383795906909,0.23389926571108755,-0.21604938271604904,0.15461648228024974,0.5,0.2921521754552114,1.0172413793103445,1.2937489412756324,0.0,0.0,0.8928571428571427,0.24733748335908473,-0.6111189563214894,-0.2653332228638057,0.5988515176374076,0.009562289732416771,0.3186274509803921,-0.08466802197278384,-0.7954545454545455,0.0,-0.033333333333333215,1.440911128246773,-0.46875,0.25231197599684896,-0.29699527033293144,-0.13504537836886316,-0.31249999999999994,0.3712099766848838,-0.07692307692307705,0.14383055641511033,0.6537683358624178,0.7701010308679711,0.13756613756613786,0.16912189347300405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.018181818181818,1.1818181818181819,-0.6966153588273398,0.866312489571533,-0.26342603752509,-0.735931060867598,0.5788244775395323,0.5739733580226143

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving Beta v9 update. It uses Tesla Vision, a computer vision system that relies on optical imagery. The release notes do not reveal many details about the new features in this version of beta software for Tesla's Autopilot hardware and vehicle computing platform. It seems like you can now use your mobile phone to take some nice photos in the dark when using Autopilot with Enhanced Automatic Steering (EAS). I am assuming here it is referring to the EAS option available from the menu under Advanced Driving Settings [Navigation] and Image Capture Stabilization Mode. This feature allows for up to 30 seconds at night or during poor visibility conditions without any visual indicators being provided by the car itself (assuming there are no obstacles ahead), but instead relying solely upon image capture based information gathered through stereo cameras mounted just above each side mirror on the inside of the windshield. That said, if you want to learn more about what exactly happens in this mode, read our previous article covering that topic on how Tesla will be testing out their self-driving technology over the coming months: Overcoming Obstacles With ""Enhanced Autonomous Steering"" And Their Blind Spot Detector Tested In San Francisco During Night Time Drives Last year, we shared two videos showcasing the application of vision algorithms that enable adaptive cruise control to reliably detect vehicles in blind spots as well as make lane changes safely even in bad weather. We also previously reported that parts of Tesla's early working systems failed tests related to their ability to distinguish between pedestrians and other animals. As mentioned before, most recently we have seen Elon Musk mention they are going to start utilizing an updated radar system called LIDAR which would allow them to better see objects around the speed limiters such as motorcycles, bicycles, etc., while also providing detailed elevation data similar to lidar scanners used by Van Gogh Safety Systems. Today's announcement was made last week about enabling hands free calling via Alexa, so maybe this relates to something else? All things considered, the release looks positive with some big improvements added. Check back soon to find out all the latest updates!

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Sexton suffered a suspected groin injury, before O'Connell was carried off at the end of the first half. Leading 9-6 at half-time, Rob Kearney's try increased Ireland's lead before O'Mahony and Sexton added further scores to seal an impressive win in Murrayfield for Joe Schmidt's men with Simon Zebo scoring Scotland's only points from five kicks at goal. Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw believes that his side need to start converting their chances into wins after they were left frustrated by defeat against Ireland on Saturday evening as Johnny Sexton scored all 22 Irish points. The Scots had led 6-3 early on but managed just two penalties courtesy of Duncan Weir until Odsonne Edouard grabbed possession near halfway and released Jacob Stockdale who sprinted through the defence to score under the posts back around 10 minutes later. A second successful conversion gave them some breathing space out in front ahead of the interval before Sexton kicked three more penalty goals immediately upon resumption to turn the game completely Scotland's way as he also converted tries from Tadhg Furlong, Sean Cronin and Keith Earls either side of another Weir effort which narrowed it down again late on despite Connacht man Jack Carty having replaced Sexton several times during the contest when he looked set to be taken to hospital following his battle with HIA protocols. ""We are getting there,"" said head coach Gregor Townsend afterwards about how far this young squad is coming along since last year's World Cup. ""There were lots of good things today but we do have to convert our opportunities because if you don't then one team will get over the line eventually.""",opt_30b,1.2878787878787878,0.3333333333333333,1.2307692307692308,1.296875,0.6842105263157895,0.15554853367791108,-0.6234405828305521,-0.2532078309820638,-0.4377074079382644,2.4178814382896006,2.837313338000141,2.146341463414634,1.9555896154397352,2.2438271604938276,2.3505807082169317,0.5,0.8973514346484184,3.0886699507389164,3.7424054115955663,0.0,0.0,1.3673469387755097,1.997268557371986,2.0676957168772203,1.9443390357555839,1.870385561936013,0.8529995938856201,1.365546218487395,1.5336704906350676,-0.04545454545454524,-0.2092150071335486,0.5142857142857142,1.057338641652968,0.4241071428571428,1.1602815056214522,1.2144115737735326,0.95428489202627,1.8482142857142856,2.7870151681013433,0.9010989010989009,1.4037347245097522,2.8392224871739287,1.262916359049145,-0.12698412698412692,-0.14933433935071205,0.2857142857142857,0.45175395145262565,0.0,0.0,1.9454545454545455,1.5454545454545454,-0.6072687538586944,0.8351558221749712,-0.0017000658012799891,-0.7434212473050623,1.7211730765816948,1.367735988503861

The flag, one of only three surviving from the battle, was presented to him by his father, who had been given it by his grandfather. The flag is believed to date back to the Battle of Fishguard in 1797, when a French force of about 1,400 soldiers attempted to land in Wales and were defeated by local forces. The flag is thought to have belonged to one of the officers of the invading force. It bears the words 'Toujours Pret' (Always Ready) along with the royal arms of France, and is made from silk and velvet.

In 2006 Rob dropped out of a PhD program at the University of Minnesota to start a company with his then-girlfriend Nicole. That company was HitTail. He's been doing startups ever since. Rob's most recent project is Drip, an email marketing automation company that is arguably the best email marketing automation platform available for small businesses. I had a lot of questions for Rob and he was kind enough to oblige. Enjoy! Eli: What does the word ""entrepreneur"" mean to you? Rob: It's a word I shy away from, honestly. I think it's a grossly overused word, especially in the tech startup world, and I don't like how it's used. I don't like how it's used as a blanket term for anyone who starts a business. It's an overused word and I'd prefer to say you're a ""business owner"" or a ""startup founder."" I'm not a huge fan of the word ""entrepreneur"" because it's been overused. Eli: For you, does entrepreneurship ever stop being exciting? Rob: I think it stops being exciting when you're not doing anything new, when you're doing the same thing over and over again and your business gets to a certain size. That's where I am now. It's no longer exciting to get that first paying customer. It's no longer exciting to go to market with a new product. The last few years have been more of an operational, boring management phase, and that's not something I enjoy doing. Eli: So you're not enjoying running Drip as much as you used to enjoy running HitTail and other startups? Rob: I enjoy it much less, yes. The first couple years were exciting as we built a new product, got our first paying customers, and built a team. It was exciting to get those first few employees and get the team growing and working together. It's like raising a child. When they're first born it's super exciting and fun and you get to teach them to walk and talk. Then when they're a teenager it's a pain in the ass. Now I'm in the middle of that teenager phase, where it's a little painful. I'm not having fun doing the day-to-day work, so I'm not enjoying it that much. That's why I'm spending a lot of my time thinking about what my next project will be. Eli: What makes you feel successful as an entrepreneur? Rob: For me, it's having a decent amount of freedom to work on whatever I want to work on. I don't need to make a ton of money. I don't need to be rich. I don't need to be a billionaire. I like having a lot of freedom in my schedule, and the ability to work on whatever I want to work on. Eli: Is that what you're doing now? Rob: Not really. I'm still at the point where I'm working on the business and I'm still very hands on. Eli: When you say you're thinking about your next project are you thinking about starting a new business? Rob: Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a new business, or maybe just an experimental project. I'm not sure I want to do a full-fledged business at this point. I'm at a point in my life where I don't want to be fully engaged in a startup. I'm not going to be raising venture capital. I'm not going to be making it my life's work. I'm just looking for a new project. Eli: You said you want freedom in your schedule. Does that mean you want to be able to work on a new business without taking too much time away from Drip? Rob: Yes, that's exactly it. I want to spend a lot of time with my kids, I want to be able to go to the gym whenever I want, and I want to have the ability to work on whatever I want to work on. That's why I'm not in a hurry to start a new business.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"data2vec is a multi-modal artificial intelligence algorithm from Meta that attempts to replicate the general learning ability that the human mind possesses. The team aimed to create an AI that can learn and understand multiple types of data, analyze patterns in those datasets for insight, and draw conclusions based on what it has learned. The team built their system upon Google's Word Embedding model (WE), which is essentially a subset search engine - any word or phrase you type into google will be mapped back onto its original meaning. Since words have many meanings and are easily linked together with other concepts they represent, WE allows researchers to become more effective when conducting large scale searches within documents such as Wikipedia. Many use this same technique to build out related sentences using WE combined with semantic analysis techniques like LSA and topic modeling. This allowed the team to combine standard text processing protocols with deep neural network models to help develop a novel dataset for usages.

The Englishman needed six match points before finally seeing off the world number 20 after almost five hours. Andy Murray, playing his first match in Scotland for four years, had earlier beaten Donald Young 6-1 6-1 4-6 6-2. Media playback is not supported on this device The best-of-five tie continues with Saturday's doubles, before the reverse singles on Sunday. ""It's really tough for the USA now at two matches down,"" said GB captain Leon Smith. ""But they have Jim Courier as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight."" There is now every prospect of Britain repeating last year's win over the US at the same stage, after Ward again produced an upset in the second singles match. Last year it was Sam Querrey in four sets - this time the Londoner came through a 111-minute final set to see off Isner and claim the win of his life. And if Murray had been expected to dominate proceedings on his return home, the opening day ended with Ward acclaimed by the 7,700 spectators at the Emirates Arena. ""This is by far the best atmosphere I've ever been involved in and thank you very much to all the crowd,"" said Ward. ""It was difficult. I had a lot of chances in the last set. It was an unbelievable match."" A downcast Isner admitted: ""It's brutal. I'm barely going to sleep tonight, it's awful. ""I'm healthy. Mentally I'm certainly a bit shaken right now but I've got to be a professional and bring my best on Sunday. I don't feel too chipper right now but I'll let it rip on Sunday if that match is live."" Isner looked in control after taking the opening tie-break and breaking serve for the first time in the match on his way to a two-set lead. Ward has been in the best form of his career over the last 12 months, however, and backed up by a gruelling off-season training block with Murray, he dug in and worked his way back into the contest. Two terrific passes helped him finally break the Isner serve in the third set and the Briton levelled in a tie-break as the momentum swung steadily in his favour. Ward dominated the decider, earning a break point and then five match points, only for the 6ft 10in Isner to keep him at bay with his huge serve. With no tie-break in the deciding set, the games ticked by, prompting memories of Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. Ward had his own moment of danger at 11-11 but saved two break points, the second in a long and desperately tense rally, but for the most part he looked the more likely winner. Media playback is not supported on this device It took until the 28th game of a gripping final set but there was no escape when Isner slipped 0-40 down, and he netted a volley to spark wild celebrations among the British squad. Ward shared a long hug with Murray, who had been dispensing advice via Smith from the sidelines throughout. The Scot had earlier seen off Young with a fine display in front of his home crowd, who gave him a rousing reception. ""It was very nice,"" said the Scot. ""I used the energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match. I would say I played extremely well. ""I'm going to praise myself today - I hit one unforced error in two sets.""",human,3.7045454545454546,4.666666666666667,4.323076923076923,4.359375,5.2631578947368425,-1.226275070635062,-0.9543958735666804,-0.9687948092895744,-0.9140995760012041,-0.4015666872809731,0.7013382692849613,-0.007849733669750714,0.6718839909736798,-0.00982042648709297,0.7902415172928121,-0.2272727272727273,0.27672681240887237,0.6081504702194356,1.0381055503451093,0.0,0.0,-0.4545454545454547,0.6817989484287303,-0.25016565463452783,-0.12939405355784928,-0.30427324931016475,0.33952158512182284,0.011586452762923343,0.858285061918794,-0.5303030303030302,-0.08578804297173424,-0.04848484848484835,1.0085264708184412,0.21306818181818185,1.0601586148214666,1.2455211486093432,2.752797328609062,-0.2556818181818182,0.28503770037881054,0.2937062937062936,0.010517088851963287,-0.28528072837632773,-0.1612539139367549,0.15776815776815786,0.31724369596285223,0.3939393939393939,1.3693483063872733,0.0,0.0,2.3454545454545452,3.0,0.19720281577028778,1.080123688389628,0.3226333054102263,1.056818497129374,-0.9239983405807347,-0.8366523051800085

Closures remain in place in Devon at Slapton, Taw and Torridge and in Jersey. An FSA spokesman said: ""Recent tests have shown high levels of E.coli contamination in 30 shellfish beds in Cornwall and Devon. ""However, a number of factors have led us to question circumstances which may have led to these unusual results, including the unprecedented nature of the results, the lack of a clear cause and the fact that other testing does not support the view that there is an obvious risk to public health. ""Because of this, the FSA will not follow its normal protocol and in this case will allow the closed shellfish beds to re-open as long as there is one further test that shows the bed has E coli within accepted tolerance levels.""",human,0.4090909090909091,0.16666666666666666,0.36923076923076925,0.421875,0.3157894736842105,-0.31227071756231733,-0.18573498505055072,-0.2181718730252133,-0.12800092362433382,0.6621315192743763,1.791328051855023,0.5180824222035324,2.4421292373184285,0.6265432098765434,2.4644497976458113,1.3333333333333335,1.1223449048092964,-0.2327586206896551,0.2168184208135889,0.0,0.0,1.1428571428571426,1.1574666108041998,-0.17868975331037695,0.1075621223042512,0.4265791632485644,1.6544193441028785,0.2549019607843139,0.2554822358707885,0.2545454545454547,0.6943785446023572,0.4666666666666668,0.5943580999924047,0.7812499999999999,3.293101647197169,-0.0973754984698136,-0.03033008588991065,0.06249999999999994,1.1733079124871724,0.0,0.9000637351203429,0.5230146686899342,0.6735753140545633,0.3597883597883601,0.1948773039609364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21818181818181817,0.45454545454545453,0.21333937807794034,-0.009787228599801837,0.23330690251610348,-0.038919841299704834,0.3585965942687589,0.1915759658974144

The firm's finance head recently announced plans for a 3 billion stock buyback and it reported better than expected earnings in November. The company said that the outage stemmed from ""an internal upgrade software"" but its website was not fully functioning during the outages. Over 1 million users were affected by the problems. Shares of other retailers also suffered this week after Amazon unveiled discounts on thousands of items across different categories including video game consoles, toys, TVs, apparel and furniture. Shares of Target dropped more than 5 on Monday following news reports of price discrepancies at some stores. And shares of Best Buy fell almost 4 last Thursday. Still, shares of major retailers are all still trading well above their January lows. Despite these market hiccups, however, investors are betting that 2018 will be another strong year with many positive catalysts like tax reform looming on the horizon.

Researchers are starting to use machine learning to improve the performance of traditional algorithms. This article provides examples of how machine learning is being used to enhance traditional algorithms: 1. Optimization: Machine learning techniques can be used to optimize traditional algorithms. For instance, in the case of linear regression, machine learning can be used to find the optimal values of the parameters that minimize the loss function faster than classical optimization techniques. 2. Classification: Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and neural networks, are being used to improve the accuracy of traditional classification algorithms. For example, in speech recognition, machine learning can help improve the accuracy of classifying spoken words. 3. Image recognition: Traditional algorithms are commonly used in image recognition tasks. However, machine learning is being used to enhance these algorithms. For example, a deep learning algorithm can be used to classify images with a higher level of accuracy. 4. Natural language processing: Machine learning algorithms can also be used to improve the performance of traditional techniques in natural language processing. For instance, machine learning algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy of named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. In general, machine learning can be used to improve the performance of traditional algorithms by providing a more efficient way to search through a large space of possible solutions.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"It can be difficult for adults to learn other languages even after years of exposure. In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and promote the formation of new neural connections. Could this have an effect on how animals learn? A new study by CSHL scientists, led by Assistant Professor Joshua Gordon, shows that stimulation of the vagus nerve in adult mice improves their ability to learn and retain information. The research team's work, which appears online today ahead of print in Nature Neuroscience, suggests that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in humans may also have similar beneficial effects. ""There's a lot of interest in this,"" said Gordon, who is a member of the CSHL Neurobiology Behavior Program. ""Vagus nerve stimulation is already being used in some human conditions, and this may open the door for other uses of VNS in humans."" The vagus nerve is a major nerve that runs from the brain through the neck and thorax, to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic system, which regulates heart rate and digestion, among other functions. VNS has been used to treat epilepsy and depression in humans, and recent studies have suggested that it could help treat other conditions such as chronic pain and inflammation. Gordon and his colleagues studied mice with VNS devices implanted in their necks. The VNS devices stimulate the vagus nerve, which is the largest nerve in the parasympathetic system. The vagus nerve carries information about the state of the body's organs to the central nervous system, including areas of the brain that are important for learning and memory. The researchers found that mice with VNS implants showed improved memory and learning in several behavioral tasks. They were better at remembering the location of a hidden platform in a water maze and they were better at recognizing objects they had previously encountered. The team found that VNS also increased the number of new neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for learning and memory. VNS increased the expression of genes in the hippocampus that are important for learning and memory. It also increased the release of a brain chemical called norepinephrine, which is important for arousal and attention. ""What's really exciting here is that we're taking insights from animal neuroscience and trying to figure out how to help people with psychiatric and neurological conditions,"" said Gordon.",llama_65B,2.2803030303030303,2.3333333333333335,2.246153846153846,2.25,1.894736842105263,0.3105291244297139,0.5520408144635212,0.5156104883312144,0.5408055609193928,0.041532402434657896,-0.0966821564133152,0.05453499181089831,-0.1629313888486851,0.035250162443144974,-0.15572199413226756,0.44736842105263164,0.4118714115350152,-0.27223230490018147,0.06575303220523768,0.0,0.0,0.6616541353383456,0.2335107104166886,-0.41869830617778864,-0.06779597761554262,-0.2020638141703727,0.11816010887435159,0.22136222910216705,-0.29972249802211975,0.07033492822966521,0.4927928151530171,0.5894736842105264,0.6915678383437993,0.20559210526315813,1.0822907398400627,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.3848684210526316,0.21551220537494853,0.08906882591093103,-0.08017648807369035,0.13763543912893003,0.17058336659519657,-0.053467000835421885,0.15378933968627848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1636363636363636,1.2727272727272727,0.4618154375407332,0.6956055030158619,-0.02041978476397913,-0.4151041488699081,0.30418957861993684,0.41848841944475584

Management consultants McKinsey estimate that about 30-50 of clothing production will be automated before 2030. The Wall Street Journal estimates this figure could rise to 80. In order to reduce operating expenses it doesn't make sense for these big factories to invest heavily in workers who take away jobs from machines. This trend towards greater automatisation began early in Japan. ""Rise Of Robot Factory Floor Workers"" (The Asahi Shinbun) - 2016 Jul 18 Nissan Motor Co announced plans in July 2015 to build electric cars using 3D printing technology where customers would use their smartphones to receive updates and information on new models via the internet. By applying huge amounts of electricity to assemble the car components such as body panels and battery cells, Nissan hopes to continue improving quality while reducing development time and lowering vehicle prices. In April 2017 Renault unveiled two electric vehicles under the Zoe brand name called EZ10 and EZ20 that followed the same principles. It showed off prototypes of both EVs including the parts used during manufacture, but no specifications were released yet. While selling electric vehicles isn't exactly easy because you need consumers to buy into regenerative energy sources you must keep your eye on cutting edge technologies. Making consumer products more affordable by introducing ""post industrial revolution"" aspects is what reinforces demand.

Even Elon Musk admitted that humans shouldn't work remotely, although he didn't mention how his Tesla factory would perform if it wasn't running 24 hours per day. But that is only the beginning of the story. The logic behind this issue lies within the fact that AI-driven innovations may affect everyone regardless of race, culture, religion etc., hence the fear stemming from technological advancements spreading throughout society because ultimately we don't know what impact they'll bring upon us. Once that happens then each individual person becomes responsible for helping AI evolve accordingly... That is why many business leaders say that we're witnessing a transformation period between humanity and artificial intelligence, just like mankind once did when moving beyond animal instincts to achieve higher levels of cognition. And once things reach that stage it won't stop anymore. As that scenario plays itself out, here's some food for thought.... 1.

The court said that while it sympathised with the claimants' plight, it could not find any legal grounds on which to declare the consultation process unlawful. It also noted that the government had taken steps to ensure that those affected by the proposed cuts had been consulted in a meaningful way.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Foredowne Boarding Kennel is facing allegations about how dogs, seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and placed there, were kept without exercise. The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating. The kennel said it was staffed by ""animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs."" The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels. Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised. These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised. The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise. Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these. However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages. Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised. A spokesman for the kennels said: ""The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression. ""We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us. ""One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs."" The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had ""an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police."" The spokesman said: ""We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great. ""We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA. We are confident that we have abided by all the relevant rules and regulations."" A spokeswoman for Teignbridge District Council said: ""We take all complaints of animal welfare seriously and will be carrying out an investigation into the specific allegations that have been made."" Pit bulls Smokey and Lola were seized by police from the same owner over suspicions that the dogs were trained to attack. Their three puppies were seized at the same time. Mr Clark said: ""The three pit bull terrier pups came in at 11 weeks. They were initially exercised before deteriorating so much they were deemed unsafe. ""The police were informed and they went on to do at least six months with no exercise."" In a statement, Ch Supt Jim Nye said: ""Since 2012, we have seized and placed into kennels in the region of 200 dogs, of which only four were given a strict order not to exercise by Devon and Cornwall Police due to the dog's unpredictable and dangerous nature."" He said they included Stella, Gnasha - another pit bull, Smokey and Lola. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police added: ""As regards any other dogs the kennel has chosen not to walk during this time - there may be some - that is a decision made by the kennel as part of their duty of care for the animals they have. ""While we have individual care plans for all dogs which we have seized, ultimately the kennel maintains this duty of care.""",human,4.068181818181818,4.0,4.630769230769231,4.6875,4.052631578947368,-0.370961993011695,-0.12263176681558995,-0.29164230291407345,0.18454717140658228,0.15857377433732092,0.5099995360323428,0.5270148777587659,0.806310927823251,0.5311834823329075,0.7558687701204253,-0.4310344827586208,-0.07234199095521708,0.4137931034482758,0.5353204787160761,0.0,0.0,-0.06403940886699504,0.11283865343990761,-0.15157820453225088,0.3202894693761735,0.434499731266442,0.22718560922456382,0.19776876267748497,0.6518510111724839,0.6166144200626961,0.5422286486802681,0.6620689655172414,1.1692999336871268,0.22090517241379332,0.810675830057592,0.24679652198383795,0.3685395967126463,0.2521551724137931,1.3137960801128652,0.3872679045092838,0.3581687279731827,-0.0360699771510299,-0.012530848100052505,0.5079365079365081,0.4253334742249712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5454545454545454,3.1818181818181817,0.5585336580792857,0.921562198329258,0.6793120071501714,0.23551656737163834,-0.08165769951703176,-0.06288605592674847

Surface Duo users will see a virtual gamepad on one screen and the game itself in full resolution when connected to another display - basically a split view mode like Google's own Daydream View VR headset or Samsung's stand-alone GearVR device. While most of us probably don't need all that extra power right now (or ever), Microsoft is working with partners including AMD, Qualcomm and NVIDIA to integrate cloud gaming technology into new devices as it continues building HoloLens 2, an augmented reality smartglasses system that runs Windows 10 X apps via holograms. The company also wants developers to build more 3D games that can be displayed across multiple screens, creating what CEO Satya Nadella calls ""the next computing platform"" for people who want to play, watch TV or interact socially online. The update brings current features such as Game DVR and friends lists into general availability, while expanding to include multi-user multiplayer options across platforms from PlayStation 4 Pro up through PC and Mac versions. There are some neat little details included in this release too: you can easily switch between portrait and landscape modes using your phone's keyboard; there's a handy Live Tile shortcut for turning off notifications when you come back from playing; and if things go really wrong Microsoft offers the ability to reset a player's profile settings without having to reinstall everything from scratch.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When animations in CSS conflict, only one of them will occur. The Web Animations API allows developers to mix up animation behavior using the composite option. This article discusses how to use the composite property to create complex animations with the Web Animations API. The composite property in the Web Animations API allows you to control how multiple animations should interact with each other. By default, only the animation with the highest z-index will play. But with the composite property, you can create complex animations that blend together and produce unique visual effects. There are several values for the composite property: - replace (default): This value replaces any animations currently playing with the new animation. - add: This value adds the new animation to any animations currently playing, creating a cumulative effect. - accumulate: This value accumulates values from all animations currently playing and applies them to the new animation. This creates a more complex animation, as each animation affects the others. To use the composite property, you need to create multiple animations and specify their composite value. Here's an example: "" 'javascript const element document.querySelector .box; const animation1 element.animate transform: 'rotate (0deg) ' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'add' ; const animation2 element.animate transform: 'translateX (100px) ' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'add' ; const animation3 element.animate transform: 'scale (2) ' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'add' ; "" ' In this example, we create three different animations for the same element. The composite property is set to 'add' for each animation, which means they will blend together to create a cumulative effect. You can also use the composite property to create complex animations that react to user input or events. Here's an example of an animation that changes color based on a user's click: "" 'javascript const element document.querySelector .box; Initial animation element.animate backgroundColor: 'red' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'replace' ; Click animation element.addEventListener click', { element.animate backgroundColor: 'blue' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'accumulate' ; ; "" ' In this example, we create an initial animation that sets the element's background color to red. When the user clicks on the element, a new animation is created that changes the background color to blue. The composite value is set to 'accumulate', which means the animation blends with the existing animation to create a more complex effect. Overall, the Web Animations API's composite property allows developers to create complex and dynamic animations that react to user input and events. Using this property, you can create unique visual effects that would be difficult to achieve with CSS alone.",gpt-3.5-trubo,2.121212121212121,2.5,1.7076923076923076,1.609375,6.7894736842105265,0.9919311323386028,0.4985195659031626,1.918778931054874,1.2997777227453136,-0.24489795918367352,0.18653471168722952,-0.5310344827586206,-0.3140894478048775,-0.626543209876543,-0.44402465843137295,0.7999999999999998,0.44894629733240593,0.06724137931034478,-0.32200325535086527,0.0,0.0,0.2714285714285712,1.6613623922718876,-0.5167707665736103,0.03614604021260306,0.5414273995077932,0.4722403798157522,-0.9176470588235295,-0.4664329365689577,-0.8654545454545456,-0.0778779660574011,-0.5,0.4884651026911572,0.5781250000000002,0.7084615190924238,0.1621302049522397,0.9113486231156711,0.3374999999999999,0.9351722441371105,-0.061538461538461514,-0.1015250077234615,-0.13075366717248352,-0.054856880516334326,3.4857142857142858,11.985568825612322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.16363636363636364,2.090909090909091,1.3101966782678232,0.1292722303971075,1.6943989152758667,-1.511279608485737,0.9094846487630923,1.2038341262222547

""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the government. The statement reads: ""We, the undersigned teachers and education professionals, write to express our deep concern at the current situation facing the teaching profession in England. Despite the promises made by the Government that education would be 'fully-funded', school budgets have been subject to real terms cuts for almost a decade. At the same time, teacher pay has been held back by public sector pay restrictions, meaning teachers have effectively seen a significant decline in their salaries in real terms since 2010. This is undermining recruitment and retention of teachers, and having a direct impact on standards in our classrooms. We believe teachers need a pay rise. We call on the Government to invest in our teachers and put an end to the real terms cuts to school budgets. Only then can we ensure that all children get the quality education they deserve.""",text-davinci-003,0.5606060606060606,0.6666666666666666,0.47692307692307695,0.484375,0.7894736842105263,0.15579057201979266,0.6220078429521433,0.2196186361089344,0.16622525846625344,-0.1995464852607712,0.05251410737727871,-0.31660592467993626,0.04349027633637894,-0.324074074074074,-0.0013555793095966246,-0.05555555555555558,0.3341838568438318,0.017241379310344803,0.5326040236897478,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666665,0.3427471484777843,-0.8076776849629042,-0.7709587307638642,0.04375170905113465,-0.5301963564167134,-0.21241830065359474,0.06684011002680365,-0.44545454545454544,0.9466427015893545,-0.0888888888888888,0.5872157357484186,0.2604166666666668,0.2812334792560441,-0.3635351942873041,-0.19699675255657734,-0.4375,-0.07576923428973634,0.1538461538461537,-0.2960683951461575,0.17433822289664472,0.3051069275546079,0.6067019400352736,0.4704586399854405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.18181818181818182,0.5186999470333583,0.06484180486792981,-0.1627722575693744,-0.05767883166062729,-0.061041280741397135,-0.25134747572253985

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The Virgin Hyperloop is a transport system that features high-tech pods zooming through tunnels at speeds of up to 760 miles an hour using magnetic levitation. It is supposed to be energy efficient, safe, clean and quieter than a high-speed train. The idea is to create the first hyperloop system connecting the major centers of the UAE, and eventually the Gulf region, with speeds three to four times faster than the airlines and two to three times faster than high-speed rail. It is still in its early stages, but Musk has said he is keen to help build it. ""I believe Virgin Hyperloop One is the only company in the world that can solve the growing transportation crisis in this country,"" said Josh Giegel, the co-founder and chief technology officer at Virgin Hyperloop One. He said the company had been testing the technology for three years, including building a full-scale test track in Nevada. ""We have tested the pod, we've tested the motor, we've tested the vehicle suspension system,"" he said. ""I think we're the farthest along. But I think we're all still early, I think we're all still early,"" Giegel said. He said the next step was to continue testing the system and then create a commercial product. ""We're excited to deploy this first in the United Arab Emirates. But we're also very excited to bring this technology around the world,"" he added. The high-speed hyperloop system was unveiled in Dubai on November 8, 2016 by US start-up Hyperloop One, which has partnered with Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the firm founded by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, and the infrastructure firm AECOM. Virgin Hyperloop One is working on the project with Dubai's Road Transport Authority. The pod lifts above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to low aerodynamic drag. It is supported by magnetic levitation and electromagnetic propulsion. It would have limited autonomous operations, with most safety-critical functions being automated and designed not to fail. The pod would carry between 8 and 10 people and be accelerated via a magnetic linear accelerator affixed at various stations on the low-pressure tube. The linear accelerator would accelerate the pod to high subsonic speeds. The pod would then glide (float on air) for the rest of the journey. The company said each pod would have 28 seats and travel at 1,100 kilometers (683 miles) per hour. The cost for a ticket would be around 30, Giegel said. Each pod would cost about 8 million, Giegel said. The company says it can take a traveler from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in 12 minutes, compared to a two-hour drive by car. Dubai to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia - some 1,100 kilometers (683 miles) - would take 48 minutes. ""Imagine that you can live in Dubai and be in Riyadh in 48 minutes,"" Giegel said. ""We're excited about this project."" The Virgin Hyperloop One company was testing a full-scale test track in Nevada for three years. The test track was 500 meters long and the vehicle traveled at 387 kilometers per hour (240 miles per hour). The team is now working on their next vehicle, which will be tested at 300 meters per second, Giegel said. Monday, November 13, 2017 11:30 AM IST, Dubai Hyperloop One says it plans to start testing in 2020 and have it running in three years. Virgin Hyperloop One unveiled a prototype of a high-speed transportation system that could travel at speeds of up to 1,100 kilometers per hour (683 miles per hour). The system uses magnetic levitation to lift the pods above the track and move them forward with an electromagnetic propulsion system.

But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked sufficient detail to make a fair assessment of its likely impact. The most contentious issue was about religious weddings in public buildings such as churches - which would have been banned if ministers are required to conduct same-sex marriages against their will. The Scottish Government's compromise is that ministers should be allowed refuse permission for civil partnership ceremonies but must do so ""in good faith."" However, they cannot simply ignore requests from worshippers who want to marry under the new law because this could amount to discrimination against them.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a deeply cultural thing,"" says Sir Vince, who held office during the Coalition government. ""It got built into the British mindset.... if you're clever, you go to university, and if you're not so clever you go off and do a trade of some sort,"" he says. ""It's still the case that if you're academically inclined and you don't know what to do, you go to university. ""The others are told,'Why not do an apprenticeship?' without being given much of a steer as to how to do it. ""And that's completely wrong, for many people it would be better if they went down that route from day one."" Sir Vince, who once taught Open University economics courses, is now getting back to his own educational roots. He is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University. There will be no shortage of contemporary upheavals for these online students to talk about. Sir Vince talks of a ""bizarre Alice in Wonderland world"" in which the Chinese Communists are now the advocates of free trade while the United States, under President Donald Trump, is raising the banner of protectionism. ""You've got a hard-line Communist out there defending the liberal international economic order,"" he says. He describes himself as a ""big fan of the Chinese,"" adding: ""like George Osborne."" Sir Vince had a close-up view of economic decision-making by politicians. He ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations. George Osborne's approach to cutting the deficit, in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was shaped by the rules set by US economist Kenneth Rogoff, says Sir Vince. And he says that the current rise of nationalism, populism and the push for protectionism are the direct fallout from the economic hangover from the recession. ""The real energy behind this new populism does come from 2008,"" he says. ""Real wages have declined, particularly in deprived parts of the country, public spending has been cut because of the deficit."" He says this has delivered a shock to a political system built on a post-War assumption of rising living standards. Sir Vince's new teaching project forms part of the wave of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. Moocs are also characterised by being free - and his period in office as business secretary saw him taking the controversial decision to raise university tuition fees in England to PS9,000 per year. Tuition fees have hung like a dark cloud over the Liberal Democrats ever since - but he remains a stout defender of the fee increase. ""It was the right thing to do, but very, very politically painful,"" he says. The alternative was to cut the further education budget. ""I wasn't willing to go along with that."" The fees are in effect a graduate tax, rather than a fee, he says, and the Liberal Democrats' big mistake was signing a pledge not to increase fees. He says he was ""vehemently opposed"" to this promise before the 2010 election. ""I could see that if ever we got into government, it would be a disaster. ""But there was a very strong head of steam and the leader felt he had to go along with it, and once we were in government we were inevitably exposed."" The Politics of Economics and The Economics of Politicians will be available on Futurelearn from 20 March.",human,4.0227272727272725,4.333333333333333,4.661538461538462,4.484375,5.7368421052631575,-0.554104816085905,0.2912201466970555,-0.2947080093910421,0.20758640194638303,-0.060566161948650436,0.23812476482333256,0.34260289210233585,0.42718562275509503,0.22232178414974108,0.32133612459318045,0.403225806451613,0.22588602477487854,0.3720800889877641,0.5068828382140044,0.0,0.0,-0.31336405529953926,0.3724061284355657,-0.09753002019392193,0.6278958714393601,-0.35883458149196873,0.06701318974658602,0.13567362428842494,0.4643448017008061,0.4126099706744868,0.17832808937540573,0.02580645161290329,0.9213260587809501,0.398185483870968,0.5892801626874592,-0.30343461781238684,-0.14022084000449694,-0.06653225806451606,0.779271842086794,0.5607940446650123,0.7136586022238227,0.28681449573318973,0.277764176465348,0.8233486943164365,0.5171048557669476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.672727272727273,3.727272727272727,0.130084682346174,1.1546568751302475,0.5027668999348931,0.3298940298071049,-0.2561298143457862,-0.1338035034311123

""I was so frightened I could hardly think straight,"" she recalled this week. ""My heart was racing and my palms were sweating as if I had been running all day - though that wasn't possible for me because of my arthritis, which made walking difficult. But then came the moment we actually saw him: tall, dark-haired, with eyes like deep wells, hidden behind thick glasses. We sat down to talk. He said he wanted to marry us both but couldn't afford my dowry price unless there were more bridesmaids than one. A wife would be needed at court; his father might not approve otherwise."" She nods sadly. It is clear from reading between the lines what happened next in their marriage. Her real first husband died before they married. After three decades she found herself alone again, widowed twice over. The last time, the man who purported to love her turned out to be cruel. Not only did he take advantage of her financially by taking advantage of her trust, but also by proposing marriage under false conditions. Now here she was being propositioned once again. Only weeks earlier Mr Harry Grunwell had bought her a home, presented her with an engagement ring, taken and paid for her holiday to Cornwall, promised to give her 500 towards any expenses incurred during the wedding preparations. And now this strange young man was asking if she'd consider marrying him. If he would love her forever and ever? From where she stood, apart from accepting a life of poverty (or worse) with no chance of family support, she didn't see much point in staying alive. So when she received another invitation a few days later, she thought about things carefully and decided yes. In November 1930 the two women met face to face for the first time since 1920 at Westminster Abbey. They walked up the aisle together arm in arm. But even as Mrs Cantornee Winifred Mary Louise Stoward smiled through red lipstick at her groom and kissed him goodbye, those same lips began to quiver uncontrollably. Even as they exchanged vows beneath chandeliers adorned with fake flowers, tears rolled onto her pillowcase. As their daughter Anne was born 18 months later, Canon Enid remained inconsolable. She refused to leave her mother's side. When her newborn child became dangerously ill just six hours old, Mrs Moore took care of them both while Canon Enid prayed fervently for divine intervention. At some level she must have known something terrible was coming. Just five years previously, the whole world had gone mad. Like millions across Europe and beyond, she remembered the night vividly.",gpt_j,2.7803030303030303,4.5,3.123076923076923,3.1875,2.8947368421052633,-0.36708221470092345,-0.4913752310363205,-0.6083728608868116,-0.4756171506603244,-0.8443877551020408,0.28589978067991306,-0.5585576114381834,0.3605074760537126,-0.5374228395061726,0.31408770105644435,-0.3125,0.273384364988816,1.0328663793103448,0.8714646937480811,0.03125,0.17399263633843817,-0.9553571428571429,-0.10399001860505039,-0.6111189563214894,-0.047617031397998916,-0.25533223954060713,0.2321846734367642,-0.7408088235294119,0.2646088988179065,-0.7079545454545455,0.5312976421670375,-0.44999999999999996,0.1424495318871738,-0.8984374999999999,-0.14749958792417878,-0.1597566771770379,0.13175336216441125,-0.28124999999999994,0.41991896226312597,0.7403846153846152,0.6797017723970111,0.26150733434496715,0.511180286621514,-0.38095238095238076,0.11918007461978372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3636363636363638,2.5454545454545454,-0.4442149459413898,1.2472290801446018,-0.09457319689240469,0.9297995219817335,-1.0594443961697482,-0.9488444386570823

There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the UK, as they can take hundreds of years to decompose. The government has introduced a 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England, with the money going towards good causes. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also had similar charges for some time. This is one of several measures that have been taken to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the UK. Other steps include introducing laws banning microbeads from cosmetics, encouraging producers to use less packaging, and promoting reusable alternatives to single-use plastics. In addition, the government has invested 61.4 million since 2015 to improve recycling facilities, increase awareness of plastic waste, and fund research into new technologies to help tackle the problem. Overall, these measures have had a positive impact and the amount of plastic carrier bags used in the UK has gone down considerably since 2013.",text-davinci-003,0.5,0.5,0.47692307692307695,0.46875,0.3157894736842105,0.402232262048487,0.3347556786827861,0.5256479572825563,0.24757360365106723,-0.006802721088435469,-0.449957161153051,-0.032380151387720775,-0.18985825129370937,-0.07561728395061712,-0.39373627529172456,0.375,0.06924550854727403,-0.4202586206896551,0.09725300779910925,0.0,0.0,0.24999999999999986,0.7293874413374497,-0.19834562617451848,0.0627480050715703,0.11074651353568489,0.422894532962689,0.19117647058823534,-0.5425015360388699,0.2545454545454547,0.276431079068512,0.050000000000000044,-0.05041380923590859,0.15625000000000008,0.15616554253060996,0.7011035889826579,0.7687080197867472,0.0,0.5192617356151522,-0.6153846153846154,-0.05957488104802214,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,-0.04761904761904745,-0.19105086829667856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32727272727272727,0.18181818181818182,0.2722659625233095,0.15387416010736538,-0.22204941077944595,-0.4035725884092855,0.27205144516897234,0.35431068503837954

It isn't currently usable by owners of the device yet, but Apple has previously included hardware that later becomes usable in products. Nest has updated its Hello doorbell with a new version that offers HDR imaging. The video quality upgrade is matched with a price increase to 229. Apple CEO Tim Cook was on hand at the 2018 White House State Dinner on Tuesday, which honored French President Emmanuel Macron, who was in Washington to discuss trade and the Iran nuclear deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Apple may be working on a way to simplify the setup of its HomeKit network of connected devices by introducing a QR code system, with one HomeKit accessory maker already offering the system to customers. A new report suggests Apple is working on a high-end speaker to rival Sonos with premium audio, and potentially integrate with Siri and HomeKit to compete in the connected home space, but an Apple-branded speaker is not expected to arrive until 2017 at the earliest. While Apple's HomeKit platform launched more than a year ago, and new devices continue to roll out, the company's ecosystem for controlling home automation devices and appliances is still missing a key piece: a central hub. Apple's HomeKit platform, designed to connect various devices around the home to be controlled by an iOS device, will be supported in two new Nest thermostats to be launched in the coming months, a report said on Friday. As more HomeKit-compatible devices become available, an early adopter has run into a major problem with HomeKit and his home automation setup: devices outside Apple's HomeKit ecosystem are unsupported. Apple's HomeKit home automation platform will be supported in a new line of Insteon light bulbs, which will also come with a new hub for remote control of a wide variety of devices throughout the home. Following its unveiling in June, the first certified HomeKit accessory is now available for purchase. The Elgato Eve Energy smart plug, which lets users monitor and control powered devices in their home from iOS, is priced at 49.95. In the wake of Monday's reveal of iOS 8.1, Apple on Wednesday published a new support document that sheds further light on the company's HomeKit platform, the protocol for controlling connected home devices via iOS 8. Apple's newly unveiled iOS 8.1 will add support for Apple Pay, but the update will also bring a much-anticipated feature that will let users control connected home devices with their iPhone or iPad. Home automation hubs and accessories manufactured by Lutron are coming to Apple's HomeKit platform, the company announced on Wednesday, promising to bring its ""smart home"" technology to the iOS-powered ecosystem. Ahead of the expected launch of iOS 8.1 this month, support for Apple's HomeKit home automation platform has appeared in the latest beta of the software update, revealing new details about the platform and its compatibility with a wide range of products. Apple's recently announced HomeKit smart home framework for iOS will support a wide variety of hardware, including window shades, appliances, cameras, thermostats, and garage door openers, from companies like Honeywell, iHome, Haier, Kwikset, Schlage, Chamberlain, and more.",llama_65B,3.2803030303030303,2.1666666666666665,2.6923076923076925,2.609375,3.526315789473684,0.24670480510859089,0.10120731502899181,0.6113157619836205,0.273160059960188,1.1987906273620557,0.6878292875775098,0.6188206709653304,0.37125429204729543,0.5113168724279837,0.35296068094464456,0.7777777777777777,0.858176831859197,0.35057471264367807,0.8097439892376301,0.05555555555555555,0.2290614236454256,1.2857142857142856,1.035698587391419,0.9482469575670673,1.4721186762570215,0.6562756357670219,1.0191135196463565,1.147058823529412,0.802382041753764,0.33232323232323246,0.2962849995745987,0.5777777777777777,1.1903712133066764,0.7291666666666667,0.8721534330012982,0.36840396921079477,0.32154692662095896,1.0624999999999998,1.8596879916324833,-0.15384615384615388,-0.20272151977280495,-0.34867644579328944,-0.22452510468485437,0.9029982363315701,1.6522726890714245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0545454545454547,2.0,0.2871508471979212,1.0454116506102138,-0.005334934522845452,-0.9824154118277683,1.272650876089908,1.1428967252512674

The BBC's Robert Kiptoo says the AU will discuss migration at its meeting, but it is unlikely to make new commitments publicly because there are few solutions on offer and no consensus from member states. A number of countries have taken unilateral action - closing borders or sending people back across them. The UN has warned such actions violate human rights law and risk causing further suffering for migrants fleeing conflict, extreme poverty and persecution. What does Ethiopia say about returnees? Ethiopia deported hundreds more Eritreans last month after they had been stranded at two transit centres near the border with Djibouti since 2017 when the government closed the main crossing point into Sudan. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in 2018, campaigned on promises of reform including making peace with neighbouring Eritrea. But his authorities also launched an offensive against dissident groups inside Tigray state, where many ethnic Afar minorities were forcibly displaced by the TPLF before fighting broke out between federal troops and local forces earlier this year. Tens of thousands fled their homes amid reports of atrocities committed by both sides. Many sought refuge beyond Ethiopian territory along the border with north-eastern Eritrea. When Mr Abiy announced victory over rebel fighters several months later, those refugees began returning home voluntarily. This week, however, officials tried to stop buses carrying 113 Eritrean nationals trying to cross through the Semera checkpoint close to the shared frontier, which sparked anger among some international charities working in the area. ""Our team witnessed large numbers being detained while attempting to leave via unofficial routes under police escort towards Massawa city... we believe these individuals were eventually returned to Yemen,"" one wrote online. Another added: ""It was very distressing seeing families separated as a result."" Officials told AFP news agency none would be sent back until conditions improved. ""Eritreans should wait here [in Ethiopia] till our country is peaceful again,"" defence ministry spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane said. ""We need time... not immediately; let us keep you guys safe first. Once everything settles down then come back."" What do European politicians think? Several EU leaders called for urgent talks following recent developments, citing fears for asylum and refugee protections. They discussed plans during a virtual gathering hosted by Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel. In June 2020, Denmark reversed plans to deport 26 unaccompanied minors who arrived illegally with family members three years ago. Similarly, Sweden agreed in July 2020 to allow Syrians seeking protection to remain indefinitely rather than send them home despite having legal opposition from its rightwing minority government. One politician familiar with discussions involving six other nations suggested postponing any decisions pending fresh elections in Italy next spring. Germany continues to face pressure for allowing nearly 40,000 asylum seekers to stay even though they entered without valid documentation. And UK Home Secretary Priti Patel accused her French counterpart of refusing responsibility regarding migrants already present in France claiming to want to seek asylum in Britain instead of staying closer to northern Europe. So what can happen now? Some destinations may refuse entry to anyone arriving irregularly if current trends continue unchecked. Others might start turning away potential claimants based on nationality alone, something which could mean tens of thousands stuck within Europe unless individual agreements are reached with each nation involved. Countries targeted by migrant smuggling networks could see arrivals increase once travel restrictions ease due to concerns raised by coronavirus lockdowns like job losses and financial hardship throughout much of southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Attempts by aid agencies operating off Somalia's coast to deliver food and medical supplies using smaller boats means more lives saved compared with larger vessels used previously. However, environmentalists fear this shift to less polluting methods threatens livelihoods needed by communities relying upon tourism associated with big ships.

After the ewes gave birth, paternity tests revealed that 25 lambs belonged to the stolen flock. What percentage of the lambs belonged to the stolen flock? To find the percentage of lambs that belonged to the stolen flock, we need to divide the number of stolen lambs by the total number of lambs and then multiply the result by 100 to convert it into a percentage. The total number of lambs is not mentioned in the given information, so we need to assume a number. Let's say there were 100 lambs in total. The number of lambs belonging to the stolen flock is 25, so we can calculate the percentage as follows: (25100) x 100 25 Therefore, 25 of the lambs belonged to the stolen flock.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.3181818181818182,0.3333333333333333,0.38461538461538464,0.4375,0.10526315789473684,-0.8272259950910176,-0.24261022232460258,-0.7020265036672625,-0.542293077127283,-0.06997084548104979,0.7073150568824869,0.111017661900757,0.7068499496581133,0.20679012345679004,0.8055545031556602,-1.2142857142857144,-0.7126804486174951,-0.3399014778325123,-0.2574266944084905,0.0,0.0,0.2653061224489794,0.17664830112957108,-0.8301415396647801,-0.6193342417459754,0.8859721082854797,1.0233813163706917,0.3823529411764707,0.7146930980174302,-0.8454545454545455,-0.20921500713354876,-0.6285714285714286,-0.15319358620960588,1.3616071428571428,1.2871923873807505,1.2144115737735326,1.156957315684049,0.13392857142857142,1.7503258703700384,-0.15384615384615388,0.1812613661278524,0.5977310499313534,0.5847304251572281,-0.25396825396825384,0.5215704122226534,0.14285714285714285,0.3499271061118826,0.0,0.0,-0.21818181818181817,-0.2727272727272727,1.3993894516909096,-0.14771598939847388,-0.41404828386016157,0.6868341768967746,-0.5047571737207218,-0.4696951855060975

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Cyber-attacks, trolls, terrorist propaganda, sexism, racism, Twitter mobs.... stop the web now, Mr Berners-Lee, we want to get off. So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most viral videos and memes (see 2012's, 2013's and 2014's), I decided to impose a couple of ground rules to keep things upbeat. Rule number one: nothing miserable. The world was a scary place in 2015. Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven. Rule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral. As in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit. Of course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun. Off we go! One of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career. Asked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world. His ""frostbit"" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single. If you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza. And not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe ""malfunction"" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance. She was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up. Left Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world. Katy Perry's lawyers tried to trademark ""left shark,"" but were denied. Also in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply ""the dress"" was stirring debate. Optical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the whitegold or blueblack dress became one of the most shared of the year. And then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we? If Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences. ""Weasels are fearless,"" commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke. Evidently! Also in March, shocking footage emerged from Thailand showing an elephant, clearly intoxicated, clambering into a bath. Did I say intoxicated? I meant adorable. Annual sense-of-humour-vacuum April Fools' Day brings a flood of prank videos. Most are terrible, but some are beautifully executed - like this magic from a maths teacher in California. It racked up an impressive 13 million views. Maths was a continuing theme in April. This brain teaser, originally posed to Singaporean schoolchildren, had the world scratching its head and arguing over the solution. Did you figure it out? (The answer's on Wikipedia...) ""Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing."" So wrote a poster on 4chan, the notoriously dark online message board. They attached a picture of Sean O'Brien, a large Liverpudlian, who had been dancing at a gig. After attention was brought to the apparent ""fat-shaming,"" the internet rallied round and Mr O'Brien was tracked down. In May, the Dancing Man had a huge party thrown for him in Los Angeles - attended by Monica Lewinsky, Moby and Andrew WK. ""I'm still pinching myself,"" Mr O'Brien said. Back in London, it was a ""hipster cop"" that had people talking. Peter Swinger - who sports a stylish, curly moustache - was spotted on duty at a protest march. However, according to the Daily Mail, a close relative said Mr Singer, a father of three, was ""definitely not a hipster."" What a hipster thing to say. Behold, the best double-take ever captured on film. Champion surfer Mick Fanning waiting just six days to get back into the water after this terrifying incident. The 34-year-old was competing in South Africa when two sharks appeared in the water. No problem for Mr Fanning, though - he just punched one of them and swam off, avoiding probable death. Kevin Innes found a pile of dog toys in a shop in Norway. And then he pressed them. The Guardian called the resulting clip the ""best thing on the internet today."" I'd go as far as declaring it the best thing on the internet this entire year. Why? It sums up the very best thing about viral hits - that ability to give the entire world that ""oh, you had to be there"" experience. Also in August, everyone melted after watching this little lad who definitely isn't going to miss his mum when he's at school. The undoubted star of this next clip is the woman in the passenger seat. Quiet, stoic... resigned. Next to her, the now world-famous Ronnie Pickering. Who? Ronnie Pickering. Who? RONNIE PICKERING! Mr Pickering's road rage was captured on film by cyclist Steve Middleton, and spread around the world as people asked: ""Who's Ronnie Pickering?"" The video can be viewed here, but be warned it contains a flood of swear words. Mr Pickering's son later took to Twitter to say his Dad's a great guy and a great laugh. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt - we all have our off days. Meanwhile, in September, this Manhattan rat was having the ""on"" day to end them all. In this internet age, it's quite reassuring that the humble music video format still has the ability to get people talking. Though now, it's not enough to merely like a music video - you have to remix it. Hip hop artistdancing visionary Drake's video for Hotline Bling spawned hundreds of remakes. To save you the time, just watch this one - it's by far the best. For a short while in October it seemed that every cat owner in the world was buying up cucumbers to scare their cats. (Although it must be said that experts later advised against it - it's pretty mean.) There are numerous theories as to why cats seem to jump out of their skin at the sight of a cucumber - one expert, speaking to ABC News, said it's because cats are genetically wired to bounce away from snakes. Ever since the demise of CBBC's Record Breakers, the public's appetite for world-beaters has been left unsatisfied. Good job we've got Otto, then, a bulldog who rode a skateboard through the legs of 30 people. If there's one thing we've learned this year, it's that being Irish increases your viral potential by roughly 100x. Here, TV news reporter Teresa Mannion took to the coastline of Galway, in the west of Ireland, to broadcast to RTE viewers. But Storm Desmond had other ideas, giving poor Ms Mannion a right blustering. ""Don't swim in the sea!"" she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the internet got to work. And on Christmas Day, a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards. So, there we have it. An eclectic year of road rage, Irishness, dresses and sharks of varying ferocity. The next year could see big changes to the internet. Debates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this series of tubes works. But through it all, let's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously. When life gives you cucumbers, make a video.

The 25-year-old, of Cliffe Woods, Kent, met Samuel Bearman, 24, through a mutual friend and they quickly became close. Samuel noticed how much Jessica struggled with her condition and wanted to help. Together, they researched different treatments and therapies and finally came across a new form of physiotherapy called 'Graded Exercise Therapy'. Samuel helped Jessica attend all of her therapy sessions and made sure that she didn't overexert herself. With Samuel's help, Jessica slowly began to see improvements in her condition and was able to regain some of her independence.

The sanctuary is designed to give injured wild animals who have been put down some form of retirement with other species roaming freely between enclosures rather than living out their days confined inside cramped cages.

Selection criteria is based on performances and fitness, and Owens feels he has plenty more years in him. ""My plans at the moment are quite clearly to go on until 2019,"" he said. ""We had a meeting with the assessors and I was asked what my plans were and I said'I'm enjoying my refereeing and as long as I keep reffing well and I'm fit enough I want to go on to 2019'. ""Their response was'great, we're glad to hear that, we'd like you to be there in 2019'."" Saturday's World Cup final at Twickenham, which New Zealand won 34-17 against Australia, was the pinnacle of Owens' 68-Test career. He became the second Welshman to oversee the final following Derek Bevan, who was in charge in 1991 when Australia edged England, also at Twickenham. South African Andre Watson is the only referee to be in charge of two finals. He was 45 on his second appearance in the 2003 final, won by England against hosts Australia. World Rugby, the game's governing body, has welcomed Owens' decision to prolong his international career, adding he had shown exceptional fitness standards during the recent tournament. Owens admits the pressure, scrutiny and physical demands on referees are higher than ever, but he insists the passion for the job remains. ""I just thoroughly enjoy it and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I can and as long as I'm good at it,"" he said. ""When the time is right and I know the body or the mind can't take it any more because of the travelling or the pressure, or when the legs can't get there to make those big decisions, then I'll know that and I will be calling it a day when that happens."" Sections of the Australian media have criticised aspects of Owens' performance in the final, claiming he missed a forward pass in the passage of play that ended with Dan Carter kicking a penalty to stretch New Zealand's advantage to 9-3. Owens, though, says he has learned to deal with criticism, and feels his decisions on Saturday did not affect the eventual outcome. ""If you can't deal with criticism as a referee you just can't do this job,"" he said. ""There's something in you that helps you deal with that. ""It doesn't make it any nicer for me to hear criticism, especially if any criticism is personal. ""As long as you can look back on a game and say'I did my best, I gave it my all' that's what counts."" Owens revealed he was hugged and thanked for a ""great game"" by Australia number eight David Pocock moments after the final whistle. ""For someone who's just missed out on winning the Webb Ellis Trophy to come up and do that to you says a lot about the integrity of the man himself and what a wonderful sport rugby is,"" added Owens. The Welsh village of Gowerton will be Owens' next destination for a Swalec League Division One West match with Crymych. Two weeks later, he will be in the south of France for Toulon's European Champions Cup tie with Bath. ""I could've had a weekend off this weekend - a couple of refs have taken a couple of weekends off,"" said Owens. ""But I'd rather be out there reffing, whether it's under-12s, a schools game, youth game, a Division One West game or a World Cup final.""",human,3.742424242424242,3.8333333333333335,4.8,4.484375,5.473684210526316,-1.236149928653456,-0.531829507276067,-0.891231065354182,-0.7309669507176894,0.05636540330417884,0.5028551927636863,0.7401177460050463,0.9760752806323139,0.521604938271605,0.6741762650199823,-0.4285714285714286,-0.15141220193230367,0.6243842364532018,1.2232487610355196,0.0,0.0,-0.5000000000000001,0.26027947332485085,0.0796445757611967,0.6023142798723461,0.09844134536505326,0.7319742489683755,0.0,0.6662105101114042,0.6545454545454549,0.17853383237830975,0.44285714285714284,1.8125418091336445,0.05580357142857144,1.1434251782942415,0.4016739311879811,0.4768982539474018,0.6160714285714286,1.3700862635878421,1.5274725274725274,1.6413893625762848,0.20547004841390276,0.4386203371986981,0.5396825396825398,0.3659831415273709,0.07142857142857142,0.25753937681885636,0.0,0.0,1.8909090909090909,2.909090909090909,0.37563570694963927,0.9786655990553357,0.4366701271836473,0.7979311265961709,-0.5172676166854221,-0.36207385133055464
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Jim McCafferty, 71, appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court charged with eight counts of touching a boy under the age of 16. The crimes are alleged to have happened in Belfast between 1977 and 1980. McCafferty, from Torrent Park in south Belfast, was released on 2,000 bail with a number of conditions including surrendering his passport and not having unsupervised access to children under 16. He is also banned from football stadiums and parks. The court heard allegations that McCafferty abused three young boys, one aged 13, another 14, and a 15-year-old, between August 1977 and December 1980. McCafferty will appear back in court in November. The former youth coach of Celtic Boys Club is charged with 11 historical sex offences against young boys. McCafferty appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court and was remanded in custody. The 71-year-old, from south Belfast, is accused of molesting boys aged between 12 and 15. He faces 11 counts of indecent assault on a male and two of indecent behaviour towards a child. The offences allegedly occurred between 1972 and 1997. McCafferty, who was a coach at Celtic Boys Club in Glasgow, was arrested by Police Scotland in Belfast on Thursday. He is currently on bail in Northern Ireland in relation to other sex abuse allegations. A bail application was made in court on Saturday morning, but was opposed by detectives. A prosecution lawyer claimed that police had ""significant concerns"" about McCafferty's safety, if released. He said: ""It's clear that police have significant concerns about the safety of the applicant, not from the public, but from himself. ""He attempted to take his own life in July this year. ""A bail address is available in England, but police are not satisfied with the proposal and, as a result, are opposing bail."" Defence counsel said McCafferty had never been involved in any serious trouble and, despite the fact that he was on bail in Northern Ireland, was not a flight risk. The lawyer said: ""He has been living with relatives in Belfast since July. ""While there, he has never missed a court appearance and has co-operated with police at all times."" District Judge Fiona Bagnall denied bail on the basis that McCafferty could be a risk to himself. He was remanded in custody to appear at the same court via videolink on December 1. Ten of the offences are said to have been committed in Glasgow between 1972 and 1996. The remaining charge relates to an alleged offence in Renfrewshire in 1997. A Celtic spokesman said the club was aware of the charges. ""The safety and well-being of all children and young people who are in our care is of paramount importance to Celtic,"" he said. ""The club has been co-operating fully with the police in relation to all enquiries. ""Celtic will not be making any further comment and respectfully requests that our players and staff are given privacy to concentrate on football activities."" It is understood that the charges are unrelated to abuse allegations made against former Celtic Boys Club coach, Jim Torbett, who was convicted of abusing three former players in the 1990s. Torbett, 71, who is the former Celtic Boys Club director, was jailed for two years in 1998 for abusing three boys in the 1980s. A former Scotland international footballer has claimed he was abused by a coach at Celtic Boys Club in the 1960s, which was not connected to Torbett. Graeme Souness, who went on to become a successful manager, said the abuse took place on a trip to the US in the 1960s. Mr Souness was abused by a different man in a youth team he played in before joining the Celtic Boys Club. He said the abuse left him ""disgusted and embarrassed"" and he tried to bury the memory.

The whale was spotted by a local fisherman, and the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) has confirmed its likely identity as a humpback. This sighting is an exciting development for conservationists in Scotland, as it suggests that the species may be attempting to expand its range into the North Sea. It is possible that the whale could have traveled from the North Atlantic or even further afield.

Drunken Gerald Doherty took out his anger on little Albert by pouring scalding water over him while boasting that it would look ""more like she went into labour than died"" according to court evidence yesterday. The dad also boasted about how easy it was to kill someone because they were already dead as he poured more hot water over poor baby Albert until he collapsed to the floor - but then realised his blunder by trying to shoo away the boy's distressed parents. Mr Doherty later bragged: 'I love my job' after allegedly dismembering the toddler. His accomplice Miss Morris, 34, wiped the blood off the carpet using a towel before placing Natalia's head under an air conditioning unit where she died of hyperthermia. The couple moved back to Wales less 15 days before her death despite having four children together. They are banned from seeing each other or contacting one another since being charged last year. It has been revealed Mr Doherty murdered his own daughter Selina three months earlier. He pleaded guilty to murder at Cardiff Crown Court this month and now faces a maximum sentence of life behind bars if convicted. A post mortem carried out after Ms Wilkansza's disappearance showed she suffered injuries consistent with those sustained during childbirth. She was pulled lifeless from beneath the central heating system in October 2003 despite police searching all day for her corpse - which led detectives to believe her killer disposed of her body. A search of woodland outside Luton discovered human remains in September 2008. But DNA tests proved to be inconclusive due to contamination. In August 2009, a second team searched the same area again just hours after the first dig began. Police said it became apparent human bones were present there and re-interviewed witnesses. Detective Inspector Richard Sanderson, added: ""To think that only 14 months ago we started investigating what happened to this woman... makes me feel sick to my stomach."" Advertisement Ms Wilkins lived alone in Haverhill Road, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and met Mr Doherty through friends some time between 2004 and 2005. Despite not getting along well, she stayed in touch with several of them regularly and visited them socially to see Gerald and others. She arrived home late after meeting up with friends in April 2003 and saw that people had been round looking for something. When she opened the front door she could smell gas coming from the kitchen and heard voices upstairs so called neighbour Christopher Owen to help. He rang 999 and put down a note saying: 'There may be an explosion.' Eventually officers entered the house carrying hoses attached to tanks of nitrogen and oxygen which blew out the gas. At around 3am, Mr Owen helped drag out Mrs Wilkinosn and gave the alarm to fire services. When firefighters gained entry to the room with the mobile phone charging point, they discovered Albert lying face down next to his mother's supine form on top of towels. He appeared cold and stiff although he seemed conscious and breathing normally. Firefighters immediately cut open the boy's shirt to enable emergency medical assistance to reach him. Within minutes the crew managed to revive the youngster. But Mr Doherty resisted attempts to move him and left the scene unaided despite suffering burns to his hands and arms. Police tried to track him down in Luton town centre following the incident however he failed to turn up for further questioning. Officers later spoke to friends from Gwent who confirmed Mr Doherty spent Christmas Day drinking heavily with them. On New Year's Eve, he returned to Cardiff where he attacked his sister Grace. It emerged today that children were living with Gerald Doherty as part of the abuse inflicted upon him. However, both girls have since been taken care of by social workers. Doherty groomed his 16-year old stepdaughter Grace Doherty online and got her pregnant via rape as young as 12. He described himself as a survivor of sexual trauma.",gpt_j,4.833333333333333,5.333333333333333,4.492307692307692,4.578125,3.526315789473684,0.12028177625356067,-0.1388936494459667,-0.08054667232179556,-0.22236647570947524,-0.11619783048354465,0.6354776601144553,-0.21003341440683737,0.5828130607433373,-0.18860527193860502,0.6469322713855861,-0.33783783783783794,0.19643244831863688,0.47670083876980435,0.8988669962653156,0.0,0.0,-0.25096525096525124,0.43410629727040817,0.09330502794476994,0.53755727417394,0.5134913420393322,0.7137863615175074,0.09300476947535763,0.6006837370075239,-0.9373464373464373,0.07678096786359948,-0.0108108108108107,0.9114221964532948,-0.6798986486486486,-0.01933707116624336,0.1831712079324061,0.3073987649116498,-0.005067567567567598,0.92613689128371,0.6444906444906444,0.7250487184272388,0.6643699845520786,0.6719752990396983,-0.5010725010725009,5.500771099697474e-05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.2,4.090909090909091,-0.4046442791780419,1.5864847521390355,-0.08150201038173625,0.16757496027788885,-0.17313283147321273,-0.18559951248332596

Two men who ran FlexiFoods - a meat suppliers linked to Dinos Sons - have admitted passing horsemeat off as beef. Mr Sideras denies one count of conspiracy to defraud. The discovery of horsemeat in processed beef products sold by a number of UK supermarket chains in 2013 resulted in a series of product recalls. The plot to pass horsemeat off as beef only came to light after horse identification chips were found in the meat by inspectors. Ulrik Nielsen, 58, the owner of FlexiFoods, and his ""right-hand man,"" Alex Beech, 44, have already admitted their involvement in the conspiracy. Mr Sideras, of Southgate, north London, told the court in that in 2012 he agreed to store horsemeat for FlexiFoods. He admits he relabelled the shipment because the packaging had been damaged during transit, but denies purchasing, selling or using the horsemeat.

In a statement they said they had ""irrefutable evidence"" the train existed, but failed to provide proof. Officials have cast doubt on the claims in recent days. The military was said to be inspecting the alleged site on Friday. Last week deputy Culture Minister Piotr Zuchowski said he was ""99 convinced"" that a World War Two German military train was buried near the south-western city of Walbrzych. Local legend says a Nazi train filled with gold, gems and guns went missing near the city in 1945. Speaking to TVP on Friday (in Polish), German national Mr Richter and Mr Koper, from Poland, said they had ""legally informed state authorities about the find and have precisely indicated the location in the presence of Walbrzych authorities and the police."" Their knowledge was based on information from witnesses and on their own research, carried out with their own equipment, Mr Koper said in his statement. He insisted they were not responsible for the ""media uproar"" around the case, saying confidential information provided to the authorities had been leaked. The pair want a 10 finders' fee and have reportedly vowed to spend part of the sum setting up a museum at the undisclosed site. Meanwhile, TVP said on Friday that the train was not in a tunnel, as previously thought, but instead buried in the ground. The train was rumoured to have been carrying gold from what is now the Polish city of Wroclaw as the Soviet army closed in at the end of World War Two. Local folklore said it went missing near Ksiaz castle, 3km (two miles) from Walbrzych. In a statement earlier last week, Mr Zuchowski warned the public to stop searching for the train until official procedures to secure the find were completed. He said there could be ""hazardous substances"" and there was a ""huge probability that the train is booby-trapped.""",human,1.7121212121212122,1.6666666666666667,1.5384615384615385,1.75,1.894736842105263,-0.1821870169101674,0.013910188088193784,-0.2212263478874508,0.016391518226407324,0.126984126984127,0.22156848863959358,-0.03453882814690203,0.25072460862434054,0.17716049382716054,0.26876516615400925,0.10000000000000009,0.46338016856618264,-0.08275862068965516,0.4207579360574981,0.0,0.0,-0.028571428571428848,-0.35605825538278213,0.10435481593326017,0.6716207979488754,0.38063986874487266,-0.2122041321318617,0.17843137254901967,0.5842685518238657,0.11454545454545452,0.6000378768184912,0.1333333333333333,0.9170478964394948,0.53125,0.6119908599265467,0.062320319020680734,0.23124722469648024,0.06249999999999994,0.5278344281718906,-0.09230769230769238,0.31446938284064385,0.1046029337379869,0.1994780761926897,0.685714285714286,0.84845490886824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9636363636363636,1.8181818181818181,0.3316137913714832,0.5212255415996684,0.6065666871234058,0.1877121418198311,-0.06484569404138962,-0.03339545547210181

The move comes amid growing speculation over Overstock's plans to go public in September 2017. The stock is currently valued at more than 50 times its annual revenue. In an interview with CNBC this summer, Byrne said he believed his own offer would be worth much less than where it was now.

A Norwegian vessel which caught fire on Thursday is also being taken out, with a third boat still to be removed later in the day. The coastguard says there are currently seven helicopters involved and that three flights have been successfully completed raising 11 people so far from an island where they had sought refuge after their boats capsized following rough weather conditions at sea near the Shetland oil hub early Friday morning (local time). The platform has around 120 staff members working for Total Oil Norway as well as sub-contractors who were staying onboard overnight when the storm hit, according to officials.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. ""Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,"" he told the BBC. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3 to 5, he said. The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium. As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012. Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1 next year. He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover ""even though it will be impacted by Brexit."" The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, ""not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,"" Mr Ghosn said. The company will be keeping a close eye on future negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union. Nissan employs 6,700 staff at its plant in Sunderland in northern England. ""We are reasonably optimistic at the end of the day common sense will prevail from both sides,"" Mr Ghosn said. The Nissan boss thinks that the UK will continue to be a ""big partner"" for the European Union, but he said: ""The question is what will happen to customs, trade and circulation of products. ""That will determine how, and how much we will invest in the UK,"" he said. Mr Ghosn said there was ""no doubt"" that prices for Renaults, and other cars made in Europe and sold in the UK, will rise due to the falling value of the British pound. However, he thinks final prices will only be determined once the currency stabilises.",human,1.9545454545454546,2.1666666666666665,2.1538461538461537,2.203125,2.526315789473684,-0.7996388804374608,-0.5583907320270433,-0.6117469314613999,-0.3769851428446934,-0.12396069538926684,-0.07798007283277686,0.11512942715634057,0.04699742475497244,0.1368312757201648,0.09798156537168261,-0.22222222222222232,-0.3500456203536331,-0.31609195402298845,-0.07491822150773995,0.0,0.0,-0.3571428571428572,-0.30253161042817533,0.2406355344579743,-0.08895203966540152,-0.07109652720809412,0.15249816734371763,0.0,0.05373208119507178,0.17676767676767685,0.29628499957459836,-0.19999999999999996,0.5943580999924047,0.572916666666667,0.6408657424892501,0.2353241213020496,0.34566141584461596,0.1458333333333333,0.6113351176780826,-0.0512820512820513,-0.04905934671190909,0.43584555724161195,0.295400748112866,0.5573192239858906,0.7726330093710964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1090909090909091,1.5454545454545454,0.38592975389405954,0.6428787246414233,0.28301095397781073,0.6311904434589342,-0.4938304938806798,-0.3091081530802566

Jina can be installed using pip. Jina consists of a simple, declarative config file and a powerful core. All you need to do is to specify the types of data in your dataset. Jina can deal with any data type, including text, audio, images, time series, and so on. The above code uses an indexer to convert your data into a TFRecords file. This file is then fed to a model builder, which can build multiple models for different tasks. You can define a service to serve your models. Jina also supports standard REST APIs and gRPC APIs. Jina can be deployed to the cloud with a few commands. See the docs for details. Jina supports various cloud providers, such as Google Cloud, AWS, DigitalOcean, and more.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), an Australian mining company, has announced a project to create an electric infinity train that will be able to move loads of iron ore without ever needing to be refuelled. The new train will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which will generate electricity to power the train. The new technology would also cut the company's carbon emissions by 200,000 tonnes per year and reduce the amount of time trains are idling by 40 per cent. The first part of the project has been completed, with the world's first heavy haul, long distance locomotive running on pure hydrogen fuel. The technology is the first time that a commercial scale prototype of this type has been completed. ""This is not just about a locomotive. It's about the broader opportunity to deliver lower emissions technology to the heavy haul freight sector that delivers exports critical to our economy,"" said Andrew Harding, Fortescue's chief executive. The project is being delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth Government through the National Hydrogen Roadmap, as well as a number of industry partners. ""Fortescue is proud to be leading this ground-breaking project, bringing together our partners in academia, industry and government to develop a cleaner energy solution for the heavy haulage sector, which will have a global impact,"" said Mr Harding. The project will include the construction of a new 14 km hydrogen pipeline to support the refuelling of the new locomotive, and the building of a brand new hydrogen production and refuelling facility. ""Fortescue's team has delivered another industry-first innovation to Australia, further demonstrating our commitment to developing and adopting the latest technologies, ensuring our operations are globally competitive and create long-term value for our shareholders, customers, the community and the nation,"" said Mr Harding. The new hydrogen powered train will be able to move iron ore from mines in the Pilbara region in Western Australia to Port Hedland, which is 800 km away. ""Our heavy haulage locomotives travel 16,000 km per week hauling iron ore to Port Hedland to be shipped to our customers,"" said Mr Harding. ""This distance is equivalent to approximately 40 per cent of the way around the earth on a single tank of fuel, so the opportunity to introduce a more efficient and environmentally friendly fuel source is very exciting,"" said Mr Harding. The project is expected to be completed by 2020.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed on roads leading from Newport Road and Ely Crescent, but they have since been removed after reports that staff had found it difficult to get past traffic while trying to deliver patients into AE. The new system was introduced with the aim of giving paramedics quicker access as part of an overall plan by health board chiefs called 'Project Emperor'. However, nearly six months later some crews are still waiting up to 30 minutes for a green light before being able to enter through the main entrance off Crumlin Road West - one route used during peak times when there is congestion outside UHW's accident and emergency department. An incident where several ambulance vehicles became stuck behind parked cars prompted criticism over what has happened to Project Emperor, which promised to reduce delays caused by high demand entering hospital premises. Ambulance response times across south east Wales improved following its implementation back in February 2018. But around 18 per cent of 999 calls meant ambulances took longer than 15 minutes to arrive at their destination - known as not meeting time targets set out in Welsh Government guidance. The number of incidents referred to watchdog the Care Quality Commission also saw significant falls along most routes between April 2017 and March this year compared to the previous 12 months. READ MORE: This week's top stories Advertising But data covering June 1, July 2 and October 11 show response times hit an average of 16-minutes-and-one second on all three days recorded despite the barriers remaining in place in the same locations throughout each period. On both July 2 and October 11 waits reached 28 minutes, exceeding national guidelines recommending treatment within seven minutes if symptoms include chest pain or heart attack or stroke. It comes just two years after figures showed four ambulance trusts met 90 of target responses when running under capacity. Last summer, we revealed how hospitals faced mounting pressure due to high levels of people attending casualty departments because GPs had closed early ahead of planned strikes. During 201617, health boards spent 846,000 providing additional staff to cover vacancies linked to industrial action taken against the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. Officials claimed NHS Improvement pay deals signed earlier this month would ease pressures by increasing salaries by 3. At St John's hospital, response times averaged 22 minutes-and-49 seconds every day between May 17 and September 21. In total, 92.6 per cent failed to meet performance standards imposed by the Welsh Government. Waiting times peaked 24 hours apart on different dates reaching 23 minutes on May 19 and 25 minutes on September 27. One crew reported having waited 41 minutes on November 20. Another paramedic said she ""couldn't believe"" her eyes seeing another vehicle wait twice as long once inside the building meaning clocking 33 minute-and-56 seconds on January 4 followed by 32 minutes and 59 seconds on December 13. A spokesman for Hywel Dda University Health Board admitted the situation could be better saying: ""We apologise to anyone who finds themselves waiting unnecessarily long periods of time whilst we deal with very challenging circumstances surrounding staffing."" He added: ""It remains critical that our frontline clinical teams continue to make judgements about patient need based solely upon them rather making decisions based only on arrival time criteria alone.

Add in an element of nostalgia , and the debate can go on forever. That being said, there are some qualities that can help guide the discussion. Generally speaking, the greatest players of all time have had a combination of individual talent, team success, overall skill, and longevity. Players who have been dominant in their era, won championships, set records, and had an impact on the game for an extended period of time are usually considered to be among the best of all-time. Players like Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Wilt Chamberlain are all widely considered to be some of the greatest players ever.

Phantom was started in 2008 as Ramos saw a need to develop secure communication tools for people like journalists and human rights workers who were worried about their privacy being invaded by governments or employers. But authorities say they used it themselves first, targeting Mexican drug cartels and eventually eluding law enforcement's attempts to shut them down through tactics such as a switch from VoIP calling - which is supposed to be free of charge over phone lines but not encrypted services like FaceTime and WhatsApp - to standard voice calls. According to court papers, ""Phantom Secure continued to obtain users primarily via word-of-mouth marketing ... with minimal advertising on any traditional media source including radio, television, print, billboards etc., because (Ramos) believed publicizing his product would render it less valuable due to increased competition between providers.""",opt_30b,0.4090909090909091,-0.16666666666666666,0.23076923076923078,0.25,0.5263157894736842,1.2383149144712564,0.6449345391210735,1.0265266333365788,0.7448108061224749,2.408163265306122,1.3098636803208752,1.4894869638351556,1.263696942513367,1.5123456790123457,1.4141207616871003,1.75,0.1166357061617793,0.5172413793103448,0.6334721711928776,0.0,0.0,2.821428571428571,1.9546320255533272,0.5682334155269989,-0.3605730301962414,1.575061525840853,1.1359328750085718,2.294117647058824,1.651305989286974,0.6045454545454547,0.0,1.8,3.677939128923067,-0.5468749999999999,-0.9328767787091092,-0.1971853844013725,-0.07105075911806477,1.6874999999999998,2.117205485280136,1.2307692307692306,0.6924908787756484,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,2.285714285714286,3.9270118419593554,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.8660254037844386,1.0363636363636364,-0.18181818181818182,-0.719491950057812,0.8291788445243562,-0.9200756116528084,-1.8484395698982723,2.471386227603519,2.4111174810742138

Scottish Athletics, which runs the initiative to encourage non-club runners to take exercise, said it was shocked by the decision. The Scottish government said PS50,000 had been provided last year to help JogScotland become more sustainable. The scheme has been in place since 2002 and has evolved into a network of over 300 clubs with about 40,000 members. Of those who joined a JogScotland programme, 68.6 were previously inactive, most were over 40 and 77 were female.

Malcolm MacTavish, 61, who is one of the group's regulars, said five years ago he weighed 100kg and was on the maximum dosage of blood pressure tablets. He said: ""One day I just stopped and said I had to do something about it and I looked around for ways to improve my health and came across'Couch to 5K'. ""Within a year I had lost a third of my body weight and was off medication totally."" In the aftermath of the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, Scottish Athletics said the initiative was a key priority. The organisation's CEO Mark Munro said the decision to pull the funding was not theirs. ""We're absolutely devastated and shocked as well,"" he said. ""We received a PS100,000 from the government roughly for the last number of years and for a reason unknown to ourselves, the funding has been cut."" He said less than 20 of Scottish Athletics budget was spent on elite athletes with the majority being used to support clubs, coaching and development pathways. The Scottish government said it was ""making significant investment in sport and physical activity"" and that the funding for JogScotland was never direct. A spokesman said: ""In 201617 Sportscotland provided Scottish Athletics with PS65,000 to create a digital pilot system to demonstrate the impact which the JogScotland programme is having, and to use this to generate commercial income. ""An additional PS50,000 was provided by Sportscotland to further support the transition of the JogScotland programme to a more sustainable model. ""In terms of the budget allocations for 201718, Scottish Athletics will discuss with Sportscotland how they plan to carry forward their strategic plan and their priorities for the forthcoming year."" The initiative is now in discussions with mental health charity SAMh about the possibility of a funding partnership. JogScotland Fife group leader Ian Shield, said he did not mind where the funding came from as long as the ""important resource"" was not lost. ""The way I look at it, we get about 40 people here on a Tuesday night,"" he said. ""People see 40 people dressed up to go running. I see 40 people who in 20 years time won't be lying in an NHS bed trying to recover from diabetes or circulation problems, heart problems, obesity. ""That's what I see.""",human,2.878787878787879,3.3333333333333335,3.0923076923076924,3.28125,3.6842105263157894,-0.16864669787560924,0.6470410656023591,-0.17460742530255127,0.014759290496805614,-0.21768707482993213,0.036985004017760476,-0.010361648444070427,-0.2217062618790983,0.0941975308641975,0.014233160786370647,-0.1399999999999999,0.33942503636553,0.27724137931034476,0.3394738147635132,0.0,0.0,-0.20000000000000004,0.4189875986141058,-0.22900878784257914,0.012071723872265655,0.08662838392124673,0.4528844874048391,-0.13764705882352957,0.3307597196187481,-0.05345454545454534,0.07045044831608299,0.16000000000000014,0.36354040358656814,0.08125,0.7117679988348731,0.5094686079940647,0.6576093065034894,0.4425,1.3689934478678663,0.2523076923076922,0.5250167035025641,-0.20920586747597364,0.02642468594543666,0.2946031746031746,0.21791769546867232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.8909090909090909,1.8181818181818181,0.22901507458271403,0.9479012052816189,-0.029582642797605842,0.2915711129295823,-0.3087980566868895,-0.21148076998498885

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy second homes. Legislation which was due to come into effect on 1 July would have given people the right to own two properties if they were married or living with their partner and had not previously held a home elsewhere. But it has been delayed until next year because of concerns about its impact on prices. The argument over how many houses one person should be allowed to purchase highlights what analysts say is an irrational housing market - distorted by subsidies from local governments. In certain circumstances that can mean house prices rising faster than incomes. ""Wealthy buyers who want multiple apartments often resort to going through the motions of divorce,"" said Mark Tanner, managing director of Shanghai-based research company China Skinny. He added that clients seeking information on this option include newly divorced men looking for other women willing to live with them as they seek another home while waiting out legal proceedings against their former partners. Mr Tanner believes the number of couples taking such measures may remain small but could grow significantly depending upon economic conditions. Life expectancies are lengthening across the country and there will soon be more young families able to afford expensive mortgages amid ultra low interest rates. 'No problem' Beijing resident Zhang Liying told BBC Chinese she went ahead last summer after her husband proposed buying a second apartment together (they already owned one) following discussions with his mother. One thing led to another and I came up with the idea of doing an annulment... It took us less than five minutes to do it officially online via WeChat Mrs Huang Lihong They decided he could keep both places provided each one did not exceed 50 sq m (538 sq ft). Mrs Zhang, 36, said she obtained permission to put down deposits using money left behind by her deceased father rather than having new loans secured against all three family assets. She described herself and her 39-year old spouse simply as being unable to conceive naturally and wanting children to complete their family unit. Both their mothers wanted grandchildren too, said Ms Zhang. Her son also needed somewhere private where grandparents could stay when they visited from Sichuan province. A business analyst before she gave birth to twins four years ago, Ms Zhang now works part time teaching English. She said: ""One thing led to another and I came up with the idea of doing an annulment [of marriage]... It took us no longer than 10 days."" If you don't agree then move away! This requires quite remarkable control over your emotions. You need someone very experienced Mr Tan Jinhua Even though getting remarried carries serious consequences under Communist Party rules - including losing government benefits (see below) - experts like Mr Jiang Jianming believe there are any number of ways around this regulation. One potential solution involves hiring somebody else to perform marriages overseas; although these ceremonies are illegal without state sanctioning, foreign websites reportedly offer services ranging between 1,600 (1,300) and nearly 50k (35k). Family lawyer Mr Tan Jinhua explained that lawyers charge between 4 and 5 commission per successful application made to the relevant authorities. However, despite only requiring relatively basic paperwork, cases become complicated once attempts begin to get round restrictions placed on ownership rights. For example, individuals might submit documents saying that separate names listed on mortgage agreements belonged actually belong to different relatives; others claim double occupancy permits are really issued jointly. Some existing regulations appear contradictory. According to government guidance published earlier this month regarding second residential homes purchased prior to May 2013, those wishing to hold onto multiple dwellings must file proof of marriage within 30 days of securing approval. At present, however, unmarried owners cannot obtain formal contracts unless legally recognised spouses consent to sharing ownership responsibilities. Married couples meanwhile enjoy preferential treatment compared to single purchasers since certificate applicants who provide evidence of marital status receive certificates enabling immediate registration. Such policies create opportunities for corruption, admits Mr Tan. ""This creates lots of loopholes like paying bribes to officials along the way. So far we haven't seen anything major happening yet, mainly just minor stuff here and there."" Social experiment? Many Chinese perceive the debate currently raging surrounding national property policy as nothing short of revolutionary. Those opposed argue the current system represents an effective subsidy passed directly downwards from central government, particularly in tier one cities near provincial capitals. That belief gained currency recently thanks to a public outcry over reports that rich developers linked to senior party figures stood accused of trying to profit illegally off land sales, sparking intense criticism towards corrupt practices among civil servants and lack of transparency among leaders. State news agency Xinhua called for greater protection of citizens' legitimate interests during recent legislative meetings on related legislation.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Deep fakes or videos created using artificial intelligence technology and these videos are increasingly common and easy to make. The US government has taken notice of this technology and its potential threat, but even so there have been no prosecutions yet as the creators use techniques that often go undetected by those who watch them. Fake news is a real problem in 2018. Even with all the information available online, people can still be misled by fake stories made for political gain or just simple entertainment. Facebook's attempts at fixing fake news problems only seem to get worse instead of better - which means we need new ways to combat it. Luckily, as always happens when Google comes up with something cool (or maybe not), they share their ideas publicly on Drive. A team from X Labs set out to find solutions on how to tackle fake news; it ended up creating an AI-based tool called Deepfake Detect. The idea behind Deepfake Detect According to the researchers: ""We believe that deepfakes will become more prevalent over time. They provide users an opportunity to create content easily without much technical skills and allow everyone watch everything freely. Thus, detecting deepfakes would play an important role toward protecting user privacy and maintaining social cohesion."" YouTube also had similar concerns about deepfakes. For example, during last year's Super Bowl Halftime Show anyone could put together any video clip using footage that was paired with music thanks to software like Adobe Audition CC. Unfortunately there wasn't really anything you could do about it because YouTube didn't want to censor the uploaders' work. With Deepfake Detect, you'll now know if your favorite YouTuber uploaded a deepfake before watching whatever his next masterpiece might be... Only trouble is, it won't alert viewers because of its algorithm, meaning we're likely to continue seeing bad creations on YouTube. How does Deepfake Detect actually detect deepfakes? During testing, X Lab's research found 50 of the images contained embedded text making the detection possible. To avoid taking too long to check every image, the bot used speed to quickly scan through files containing words such as ""blonde,"" ""beautiful"" and ""cute."" It then checks whether these embedded texts match known instances of what someone would look like after having plastic surgery. If they don't match, it'll flag the file as being fake. This way it can spot the difference between photoshopped images and actual ones within seconds rather than minutes. When it detects a suspected deepfake, the app keeps track of it because not doing so could seriously affect some parties in ""wrong hands,"" according to X Labs. This includes cases where deepfakes could lead to violence especially if automated weapons start firing based off of inaccurate information fed into algorithms. When requested by law enforcement agencies or media entities, the company said it'd take down the respective videos immediately. It doesn't appear that Deepfake Detect gives any extra detail on why it thinks a certain photo or video is fake though. This may explain why Deepfake Detect isn't giving away details on how it works since sharing this kind of knowledge makes it easier for others to build their own version of the program, although it seems unlikely that many will try considering how difficult it is to actually produce one.",gpt_j,3.4015151515151514,3.5,3.523076923076923,3.5,3.210526315789474,0.27107621174698565,-0.01821682378957413,0.2552216572632054,0.21420820520968145,0.04290947148090013,0.43794899773324003,0.1693730995665393,0.7901732801292227,0.13129154795821482,0.7690271625052104,0.34615384615384626,0.45496771567922495,1.0941644562334216,0.7691420127921409,0.038461538461538464,0.1923076923076923,-0.20329670329670332,-0.04114803465580511,-0.34803265798605737,0.0171006345507575,0.7534549126017539,1.1164802225425532,-0.29411764705882354,-0.09014367525153749,0.03916083916083939,0.6115327420694137,-0.19999999999999996,0.7836152170564263,-0.49278846153846145,-0.04565788918966312,-0.3584167385985062,-0.19146450537633186,0.5048076923076923,1.7477400835822579,0.6272189349112426,1.0118715672734622,0.9856814909925683,1.3268715048699404,-0.14163614163614152,0.6347376411698867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3636363636363638,3.3636363636363638,-0.31473010787679045,1.174725008568793,0.13610956261782664,-0.1900137300101573,0.151070006571311,0.10389632389564359

Chemicals used to make plastic soft and flexible, like phthalates, are endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with testosterone production and reduce sperm count. Phthalates are banned in some children's toys, but still found in many products, including plastic water bottles. A small study found that men who drank bottled water containing phthalates for one week had a 10 percent drop in sperm counts. Bisphenol A (BPA), another chemical found in plastic, has also been associated with low sperm count. Toxic chemicals are also found in plastic packaging, including pizza boxes, meats, and other foods, including some canned foods. One of the best ways to avoid plastic is to buy glass containers, including water bottles and glass containers for storage.

The 2014 winner Vos won the 119km stage from Nottingham to Stoke in a sprint finish. Sunday's 113.2km final stage runs from Northampton to Kettering. Vos, who lost the yellow jersey to Armitstead on Friday, won in what was a reduced sprint, with only 20 riders at the front of the race to battle it out after the bulk of the day's climbing was packed into the second half of the stage. Boels Domans rider Armitstead had attacked along with Elisa Longo Borghini, Moolman-Pasio and Emma Johansson with a little under 20km remaining, catching and passing lone breakaway rider Emilia Fahlin. Armitstead said: ""The race stayed together until the climb and then me, Ashleigh and Elisa went on the second Queen of the Mountains [intermediate sprint]. Emilia was in no-man's land so she came back up to us. ""There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking."" But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish. She added: ""In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back. ""Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them.

It was bought by the Music Museum of the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1965. The piano is thought to be the only instrument from the period with soundboard painting to survive in its original condition. The images were discovered during conservation work carried out as part of a research project into early piano decoration by the SOAS, the British Museum and the Royal Academy of Music. The monarch's piano, which was unearthed at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), is thought to be the only instrument from the period with soundboard painting to survive in its original condition. Amid the exotic animals and foliage that are typical of the king's elaborate style, the painters have depicted a lion and a unicorn, and a figure of St George killing a dragon. The images were discovered during conservation work carried out as part of a research project into early piano decoration by the SOAS, the British Museum and the Royal Academy of Music. The project, which began in 2011, also involved the restoration of a piano with painted panels which belonged to the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. The work was carried out by the London-based piano restorer Paul McNulty, who was astonished to discover a second set of paintings beneath the lid of the instrument. After peeling away layers of old varnish, he found the images of the lion and the unicorn, which are a symbol of the British monarchy, and the figure of St George. It was a ""moment of complete disbelief,"" he said. ""It was very exciting, very surprising and very thrilling."" ""At the time, George IV was probably the most famous amateur pianist of his age,"" said the project's leader, Professor Ian Pace. ""It is ironic that he could never have actually seen these paintings as the lid of the piano was almost always left closed, as it was in a large room in the palace."" The images are believed to have been painted by Thomas Tomkison, a London-based piano maker who was known for his ""flamboyant"" style. The king commissioned the instrument for the palace from Tomkison in about 1821. The piano was bought by the Music Museum of the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1965, and was kept in storage for several years. Experts are working on a more detailed examination of the instrument, including the use of ultraviolet light to study the images. Dr Pace said the project had provided a ""unique insight into the history of the piano."" ""Not only are these remarkable images of national significance, but this project is also uncovering important details about the development of the piano, such as the kinds of materials used in its construction,"" he said.

""It's a real shame that some people have got on the pitch,"" he said. ""They have got to be dealt with, it's not right. They have cost their own club money as well. ""They've got to be dealt with and I'm sure they will be."" McCall said Millwall players who ran towards celebrating supporters at the final whistle were also guilty of misbehaviour. ""I'm not overly happy about the way the players have gone over, as well, so it's certainly a side of the game that I don't like,"" he said. Millwall manager Kenny Jackett did not agree with his counterpart's assessment, saying the pitch invasion was not his team's fault. ""I don't think it's our responsibility to keep the fans off the pitch,"" he said. ""It's the stewards' responsibility. ""It's not our fault if the stewards can't get on the pitch. They should be able to, because we pay them to do that. ""It's not our responsibility to keep the fans off the pitch."" Jackett said he did not want his players running towards fans at the final whistle. ""But if you're a supporter and you're passionate about your football club, that's what you do, you run on the pitch,"" he said. ""I'm not saying that's right, but that's what supporters do.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The so-called New Deal will reshape how they are trained as their career develops and help them to deliver the new ""made in Wales curriculum."" Each of Wales' 37,600 teachers will be given a professional learning passport. The plan aims to help teachers become confident using digital technology in the classroom and improve the use of the Welsh language by teachers and pupils. ""We must be ambitious and bold in our expectations of how our education system can deliver for every child in Wales,"" Huw Lewis said. ""There is no silver bullet to improve the system; it is the interaction of many different elements which can support improvement. ""Our children and young people need a new deal. A deal to ensure that they get the best possible start in life. A deal to ensure that they get the best education possible."" He said the ""professional learning passport"" would be at the heart of the new deal. ""This will be a major step change in how we deliver CPD [continuing professional development] in Wales,"" he said. ""A professional learning passport will help teachers to be confident in their own abilities and their own professional learning. ""Teachers will be able to complete an online self-assessment which will highlight their strengths, skills and knowledge as well as areas for development."" Wales' Education Minister, Huw Lewis, said the new deal would reshape how teachers are trained The plan will also help teachers to apply digital technology, such as tablet computers, to the classroom. The plan also aims to improve the use of the Welsh language by teachers and pupils. A new Welsh medium curriculum will be developed for children and young people in Wales. ""We will ensure that our teachers are confident and capable in the use of Welsh and that they are able to teach through the medium of Welsh in the same way they do through the medium of English,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government will continue to support the professional development of our teachers to enable them to achieve this."" Mr Lewis's statement was criticised by the Welsh Liberal Democrats' education spokeswoman, Kirsty Williams. She said that while she welcomed the minister's statement that ""much of what he said was the same as what he said last year."" ""When the minister talks about a new deal for teachers, he needs to ensure that he is not inadvertently tying their hands behind their backs,"" she said. ""We need a new deal for teachers that involves trusting them to do their jobs. ""We need to make it easier for them to do their jobs."" She said that over the past two years the Welsh Government had introduced more than 100 pages of new guidance for teachers. She said the minister had said that he would reduce the volume of guidance by removing anything which was unnecessary. ""The minister should have said today that the Welsh Government would reduce the number of directives to schools by removing all those that are unnecessary,"" she said. ""Today, we heard yet more promises and yet more excuses."" The Welsh Conservatives' education spokesman, Angela Burns, said: ""This was a great opportunity to unveil a blueprint for transformational change. ""It was an opportunity to announce a real shake-up of the entire system, with the implementation of radical new ideas. ""But instead we have had a rehash of existing policies which simply tinker around the edges, instead of going to the heart of what is needed to ensure our young people are fully prepared to face the challenges of the 21st Century. ""The minister's speech was not just a damp squib, it was a damp squib that had already been blown out."" But Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, said: ""I'm pleased to see the New Deal for teachers will see them being at the forefront of shaping education policy in the future. ""I am also pleased to see the minister is committed to introducing a new curriculum for the 21st century."" The proposals in the plan were drawn up with the support of the profession, the minister said, and their input would be ""integral"" to the delivery of the new deal.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Jocelyn McKay is now 81 and said she feels ""released"" from the feelings that gripped her for so long. ""I may be old, but at least I am happy,"" she says in an upbeat voice. McKay was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 26 years old - three weeks after being told by a doctor friend to have regular mammograms. She went on to receive chemotherapy twice during early adulthood. It wasn't until late middle age that the memories of this disease came back to haunt her. At night alone in bed, she would wake up screaming or crying out loud while remembering what it felt like to feel those cancerous lumps growing inside of her body. The feeling haunted her awake even though no tumor had returned since the 1980s. What's more, she shuddered every time anyone pointed a finger toward her chest cavity as if they were going to stick their hand into one of her open wounds. Even worse than these imagined sensations, however, were the images of having been through something traumatic and not knowing how she could ever recover. In retrospect, she realizes how much fear permeated her life at the time. But instead of dealing with all of this herself on her own, she decided to seek help. So McKay turned to LSD-assisted psychotherapy. She started taking two 10-milligram hits (about half a dose) each day sometime around 2000. By 2003 or 2004, she took six doses a week, sometimes employing strategies such as visiting friends who would give them away: They'd take one, then pass it down along with some wine, beer or marijuana. And by 2006, she was consuming eight pills per week. That number dropped somewhat after 2007, but nonetheless remained high compared to most recreational drug users. Before starting with occasional psychedelic therapy sessions, McKay hadn't taken any new drugs in about 20 years, although she did use alcohol off and on throughout her adult life. Members of her family hadn't known anything about her substance abuse habit, nor had they suspected that McKay was ingesting psychedelics without telling them. Her sister believes that McKay likely began taking ecstasy around 2001, because shortly afterward McKay got attached to someone she met online via eHarmony.com and they became engaged. This individual eventually broke things off with McKay over several months. When the two met again, he asked McKay whether he should wait before getting married. ""He knew why I wanted him to get divorced first,"" McKay recalls, ""but his response stuck in my brain. He said, 'You're very negative today. On top of this, McKay's mother died around that same time. In contrast, McKay recalls, her father lived well past 100 years old and died peacefully. Accordingly, McKay found herself grieving intensely over both losses simultaneously; the end result was that neither event seemed real to her anymore. Meanwhile, there was also a large amount of trauma emanating from her battle with cancer earlier in life, including multiple surgeries and frequent radiation treatments over roughly five years. To make matters worse, McKay didn't really enjoy much social interaction aside from spending hours on MSN Instant Messenger chatting with people - mainly women - whom she liked. One person in particular helped McKay cope with everything going wrong in her life. This person introduced McKay to MDMA (also called Molly), which she considers to be a highly beneficial tool in holistic medicine due to its positive effects on mood and perception. A few times a month, McKay would go to different clubs where these substances are openly sold and consumed. Although she enjoyed using MDMA occasionally, she never thought that she might drink too much alcohol while doing so. After one particularly memorable trip, McKay remembers drinking four double espressos that contained enough caffeine to put a charge in everybody's veins. She believed she drank less than typical nightclub patrons, yet ended up drunk - once again considering herself to have experienced a breakdown. As a result, McKay developed PTSD symptoms similar to that seen among soldiers returning home from war zones. Upon waking up alone the next morning, she realized her bloodshot eyes indicated heavy intoxication. McKay staggered through the streets looking for a place to hide from security guards and police officers who demanded answers regarding her lack of identification. Oddly enough, none of this bothered her. Instead, she just kept walking unbothered onto the interstate highway and drove straight eastward until she reached Tennessee. Surprisingly, once she made it back home, McKay began enjoying the fact that she indeed had gone out partying. However, soon thereafter, reality hit her hard, reminding her that nothing good comes easy or free. While driving, she crashed her car into another vehicle, causing serious injury to her foot and leg. After the accident, McKay spent several days recovering amid intense pain, irritability, anxiety attacks and sleepless nights. All of these unpleasant conditions resulted in insomnia. Yet despite everything bad happening in her life, she still couldn't sleep. Overwhelmed by guilt, she wondered whether she truly deserved happiness after putting other people in danger.

The article dives into the reasons why he chose to turn to cybercrime, his methods and the consequences of his actions. Kayode was a bright and ambitious student who had earned himself an A-grade at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. However, due to the pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis, Kayode found himself without a job or stable income. Desperate for money, he turned to cybercrime to make ends meet. He used his computer skills to create malicious software and phishing attacks that targeted vulnerable online websites and services. He stole passwords and personal information from unsuspecting victims and sold them on the dark web for profit. Kayode's activities soon caught the attention of law enforcement and he was arrested and charged with numerous counts of cybercrime. He was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay reparations to the victims of his crimes. The consequences of Kayode's actions have been far-reaching, causing him to lose his reputation, respect and educational opportunities. His criminal record also makes it difficult for him to find employment, leaving him with few options to support himself after his release from prison. As Kayode's story shows, cybercrime can have serious repercussions. It is essential to keep in mind the potential consequences when considering any form of illegal activity, especially those that involve the internet. Cyber criminals may not always be aware of the consequences until it is too late.",text-davinci-003,1.303030303030303,1.5,1.476923076923077,1.421875,0.8947368421052632,0.4419386220151712,0.91950694212892,0.8764306369811854,0.846689538772489,-0.1865889212827991,-0.270077446643953,0.07401177460050481,-0.10607030599603375,-0.015432098765431812,0.009671079895553339,0.4285714285714286,0.2115930675717386,-0.018472906403940777,-0.05386953732899957,0.0,0.0,0.11224489795918365,-0.43370971991793283,-0.7290541935063383,-0.7519796071936399,-0.19688269073010684,-0.07948029995316443,-0.05462184873949595,-0.04377616748239757,-0.6454545454545455,0.1384646117978457,0.5142857142857142,1.0573386416529675,-0.17857142857142858,0.9000897723424308,-0.23996104980061206,-0.09511374278441269,0.45535714285714285,0.24729655660033295,0.8351648351648352,0.5583141103033932,-0.07471638124141916,-0.028078089686660528,-0.44444444444444425,-0.310307357450184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0909090909090908,1.0909090909090908,0.1179699962503319,0.6117274099842059,0.08833675241945817,-0.6323303508255922,0.3381375665140653,0.744836996795227

The new type of ichthyosaur was discovered in the Augusta Mountains of Nevada with a skull about 20 inches long, according to an article published Wednesday (Dec 11) by Nature Communications. This means it would be one-third larger than any other known species from its ancient era - which is thought to date back more than 200 million years ago during the Late Triassic period. [Image Gallery: Biggest Beasts Ever] The researchers found fossils dating between 197 and 199 million years old along with dinosaur tracks made at this time that suggest there were several different types of large reptiles living alongside each other in these mountains around this same time span. These animals included leptoceratopsians like Protoceratops and hadrosaurs including Dakotaraptor. But after discovering all sorts of bones belonging to marine reptile Ichthyovenator morrisi, they noticed something strange among their specimens for their last analysis called ""Mt. Field gigantism"" or MFG. They knew right away what kind of creature could fit into such huge proportions as well as possible reasons why no similar creatures are currently walking the earth today. Ichthysaurus yunnanensis was described over 25 years ago but has never before been recognized as having derived traits associated with gigantism, making it unique amongst giant forms within classical ichthyosaurs, said lead author Gao Chen a professor at Capital Normal University's Institute of Geology who co-authored the paper. ""The most likely cause of gigantism is ecological factors,"" he told Live Science via email. In order to survive, early land vertebrates needed big bodies so they can compete with predatory dinosaurs and escape dino attacks. This need to pack extra size onto their skeletons makes them better suited towards surviving and adapting to environmental changes caused by mass extinctions compared to smaller organisms. For example, bigger body sizes mean longer lifespans because plant foods take up less energy per unit weight when eaten. Gigantism also meant better defense against predators since larger individuals tend not only weigh more than smaller ones, but occupy space too. Risk-taking behavior becomes easier for oversized individuals whose odds don't depend solely upon finding food sources while avoiding danger. ""If the mode of reproduction is oviparity then females lay more eggs due to higher fecundity rate."" (Oviparity refers to laying live babies instead of eggs). An increase in egg production could allow male gigants to spread across many areas without competing over mates. Giant herbivores like I. youngorum either took advantage of existing vegetation growth through grazing or ate plants that haven't yet adapted to life rooted firmly on dryland ground. Either way, grazers rely heavily on foliage rather than aquatic habitat close enough trees and shrubs wouldn't require swimming. Unlike modern day whales, gargantuan turtles, hippopotamuses and elephants, Jurassic Period sea creatures relied entirely on eating seaweed to sustain themselves. And unlike amphibious mammals that maintain both sets of lungs until adulthood, which allows adults to breathe underwater even if fully grown, air breathers used specialized tracheal sacs just beneath skin surface throughout embryonic development allowing oxygen exchange once gills stopped functioning. As we know now, evolution dictates survival based on how much stress various species experience given specific environments. Therefore, ecosystems supporting megafauna often possess greater biodiversity levels, which suggests these giants played important roles in maintaining overall eco systems. So where did these giant prehistoric beasts go?",opt_30b,3.507575757575758,3.1666666666666665,2.6769230769230767,2.84375,2.6315789473684212,1.3242618357991205,0.33928913501400837,0.8235722410026308,0.5246528691286901,0.3616780045351471,0.7310620959139529,-0.19428090832632464,0.41872786079787033,-0.09722222222222221,0.6135704109191923,1.2083333333333335,0.4792474968638164,1.1422413793103448,0.9638450702385093,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,0.6067598452189881,-0.2573132447669429,0.29778893248782035,0.771123872026251,1.2748786165877952,0.4779411764705883,0.8304147927734521,-0.6204545454545455,0.22939755440016285,-0.1166666666666667,0.4577165308333252,-0.6640624999999999,0.3955525897951172,-0.047470555504034104,0.42879549243651477,-0.31249999999999994,-0.018530232609800246,-0.11538461538461536,0.34478970583013785,0.32688416793120884,0.4161162303914037,-0.08465608465608436,-0.1086836462405719,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.19982631347136334,4.654545454545454,3.6363636363636362,-0.6634346763933477,1.3889132356920353,-0.07162713782043197,-0.8159964240850226,0.7388044183690645,0.5999860759660348
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This article discusses WebAssembly and its possible future applications. WebAssembly is an intermediate layer between various programming languages and many different execution environments. It can be used to run code in a browser, but it also has potential applications beyond the web. One of the most exciting applications of WebAssembly is its ability to execute code on the server-side, which allows for better performance and more efficient resource usage. This can be especially useful for applications that require real-time data processing and communication, such as online gaming. WebAssembly can also be used in the development of cross-platform applications because it can run on a variety of different platforms, including desktops, mobile devices, and even IoT devices. Another use case for WebAssembly is in the development of blockchain-based applications. WebAssembly is a more secure and efficient way to execute smart contracts on blockchains because it can execute code in a sandboxed environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the network. As more developers become familiar with WebAssembly and its capabilities, we can expect to see even more innovative applications in the future.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.6363636363636364,0.6666666666666666,0.6923076923076923,0.671875,0.3684210526315789,1.2219957765219729,2.0498896196127063,1.8464041277444547,1.520740671781695,-0.04837490551776296,0.12614659458652763,0.08634707036725554,0.22373594296113022,0.02160493827160509,0.13837432029665186,1.3888888888888888,0.6804848061883024,0.5172413793103448,0.3098257338129151,0.0,0.0,0.33333333333333326,-0.07628972373981446,-0.5980150410787285,-0.8079040577366643,-0.4156412359857807,0.231463053317215,-0.12745098039215677,-0.09360607031504128,0.17676767676767685,0.003759051664694615,0.5777777777777777,-0.58974143094707,-0.2604166666666666,-0.29939702097087495,-0.3635351942873041,-0.19699675255657734,-0.2708333333333333,-0.008203462040152211,0.0512820512820513,-0.1548931926903239,0.0,0.0,-0.18342151675484983,-0.2743845943447427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2909090909090909,0.45454545454545453,0.39898352330295084,0.09839338998600047,0.08833675241945817,-1.5308100705408845,1.0214607827250237,1.4026709969989353
0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Zoom has bought security start-up Keybase, which will allow it to implement end-to-end encryption in its meetings. Users will not be able to call into encrypted meetings via phone, and must access the meeting by sending an invitation link or using a personal URL that won't reveal their IP address The video conferencing app Zoom had become so popular during lockdown because of restrictions on activities such as going out for dinner with friends - but also privacy concerns about how much data is collected from users. But now those are being addressed after Zoom announced plans this week to offer 'end-to-end' encryption across all free and paid accounts, meaning only participants can see each others' faces when they're chatting through mobile devices or computers. It's already been doing trials since October 2019 where some calls were fully protected while other ones used less sophisticated methods. But these changes should happen globally before April 30th 2020 at the latest. Video calling apps like WhatsApp have always offered end-to-encryption (E2EE) making them secure enough to talk securely with your family without worries someone could listen in. This means no one else except you and whoever you send messages to can read what gets sent between phones running the messaging service. It works great if both parties use it correctly. However, unlike chat services like iMessage and Facebook Messenger E2EE isn't available over most social media sites or email providers - including Twitter, Google Hangouts and Skype. However, there was good news earlier today: The company said Wednesday morning it would begin rolling out support sometime later this year. WhatsApp uses message scrambling text called Signal Protocol, based off open standards created by the National Security Agency (NSA), according to Wired. How exactly does Signal work? That's complicated too - here's what happens behind the scenes to make sure nobody reads your chats. HOW ZOOM WILL OFFER END TO ENCRYPTION In May last year, Apple revealed new features coming to FaceTime that included ways to blur images and hide your number to try and improve user safety. Now Zoom says it hopes to bring similar tools to regular web and desktop clients. First up, the firm intends to launch a new design interface known as Privacy Settings UI 2.0 which allows users to control who can join a videoconference, change screen sharing permissions more easily, restrict file transfers and prevent screenshots saved by other attendees. Like many companies impacted by coronavirus, Zoom has struggled to deal with massive demand caused by lockdowns around the world with millions working remotely. The platform hit the headlines recently due to numerous glitches, hackers invading conferences and Zoombombers disrupting online sessions with offensive content. Amidst criticism, CEO Eric S Yuan promised to add end to ended encryption to the platform by default and outlined several steps he claimed his team took to strengthen privacy controls. To qualify for full E2EE, communication software needs a public key infrastructure certificate from Verisign, which checks every digital communications session against a database of certificates approved by national governments. All major forms of video communication do currently employ something akin to this system however the scale of Zoom's network makes things trickier still. Currently, Zoom offers an option to enable password protection for specific groups within its iOS app; Android users get only the ability to create locked rooms. Advertisement But even though Whatsapp is believed to store transcripts older than 24 hours for backup purposes, any information gathered cannot be accessed unless the person specifically shares it with another party themselves. And iPhone owners may never know whether their smartphones effectively record audio whenever they receive an incoming voice or video call, thanks to hidden settings buried deep inside the iOS operating system. This means that anyone listening in on sensitive conversations could potentially capture private moments involving bank details for example. To turn off the feature, simply head to the device's Control Centre, click on the small icon labelled Phone under Display Brightness. Then tap on the three dots next to Voice Memos Turn Off Audio Recording. For Android owners follow the same instructions, instead selecting Screen Recordings (under Developer Options). If you want to stop people recording either conversation then edit the contact in question to block them completely rather than just turning off auto recording. Doing this prevents you from receiving notifications when they attempt to contact you again until you remove them entirely.",opt_30b,4.8106060606060606,4.5,4.230769230769231,4.25,3.6315789473684212,0.8030257960001538,0.1592296067975654,0.5560814019524892,0.1989837649631052,0.2950680272108842,1.0642375796024461,0.02428511354079058,1.0746305381031,0.013503086419753238,0.7911379976560213,0.0625,0.5932839708094639,1.3141163793103448,0.840879236188758,0.0,0.0,0.37053571428571414,1.2437382773794046,-0.08041038898966964,0.33142198038407844,1.0151763740771123,1.2832212867335049,0.07169117647058824,0.9660601463109497,-0.3142045454545454,0.8501977432985752,0.11250000000000004,1.4465050033599705,-0.48828124999999994,0.21893409918380088,-0.3094715060743763,-0.14521266264409075,0.46874999999999994,1.1481755530817521,0.3076923076923076,0.6676028461697272,0.4086052099140111,0.5565895789831543,-0.15873015873015855,0.2963463655326845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.454545454545454,4.454545454545454,-0.5089585013314465,1.5508835127422769,-0.050262814994369166,-0.5562951930278325,0.5279131537588204,0.39694922745754996

In that short span of time, Joshua Wong has become a symbol for the democracy movement in Hong Kong, leading rallies and protests against Beijing's attempts to limit democratic freedoms. His arrest on August 30 sparked a new wave of demonstrations, with thousands taking to the streets to demand his release. Wong has been active in the pro-democracy movement since he was 14, when he helped lead the successful campaign to stop the introduction of national education in Hong Kong schools. He went on to found the activist group Scholarism, which challenged the government's plans for electoral reform. Wong has now turned his attention to the current political situation in Hong Kong, denouncing Beijing's attempts to interfere in the city's politics and calling for universal suffrage. He and other activists are challenging the government in court over its decision to disqualify six pro-democracy lawmakers from office. Wong's activism has made him a target for the Chinese government, and he faces charges for participating in an unlawful assembly at the Hong Kong airport in July. He is out on bail, but could face up to five years in jail if convicted. Despite the threats and the legal battle he faces, Wong remains undeterred. He has vowed to continue the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, saying that people from all walks of life should be free to participate in the political process.",text-davinci-003,1.2272727272727273,1.0,1.2923076923076924,1.21875,0.9473684210526315,-0.0789219528724229,0.5376344068749764,-0.0946521739206078,0.17539473772284783,0.4106369820655531,-0.028273018360919916,0.5180824222035324,0.05725543737567069,0.3751402918069585,-0.06829855929069446,0.8636363636363638,0.6418899317005142,-0.4373040752351096,0.00351863491651784,0.0,0.0,0.33766233766233733,-0.12220245655045142,0.021442770397245223,-0.007866194644054046,0.00894921321500462,-0.5715724973952748,0.8689839572192514,0.29691077536262045,0.06363636363636359,0.6428036276471967,0.07272727272727275,-0.06018478949056837,0.5823863636363638,0.45307047568300757,0.26556954128130983,0.4045319050738681,0.971590909090909,0.9603529538435233,0.0979020979020978,-0.1976210571424733,0.19018715225088517,0.26312659601051114,-0.13852813852813817,-0.22405605293305494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9272727272727272,0.7272727272727273,0.2759764107097737,0.5962550803268064,-0.10807561165280843,-0.04070606328056358,0.23359783060995706,0.42946121241075386

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System (MWADS), which can generate a beam of electromagnetic radiation that feels like a powerful electric current running through the skin or eyes when it hits them, was first tested in 2003 at an undisclosed location outside Beijing. It has since been used for crowd control during protests against Chinese rule in Tibetan areas. The system uses high frequency microwaves with frequencies around 1 GHz to 2GHz, instead of traditional radio waves, to transmit energy across great distances quickly. A rangefinder determines where the target object is located within the zone illuminated by the focal point of the radar antennawhich appears as white light to those who are hit. These invisible rays have long been known for causing burns to people's exposed skin, but they were originally intended to be fired from tanks in order to clear land mines. MWADS came into its own following China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989, when thousands took refuge in Tiananmen Square after marching peacefully there in support of the students' demands. In 1992, the military began testing out this form of ray. Since then, they've been used for anti-terrorism operations in Tibet and Xinjiang regions, and also reportedly in Taiwan as well as Hong Kong, where such weapons continue to be banned under international law. [See images of army using these lasermicrowave systems] According to reports, active denial weapons such as the MWADS could prove extremely effective in suppressing crowds in situations such as riots or demonstrations; soldiers armed with these devices would be able to simply walk up to groups of protestors and explode their human shields before sending lethal bullets flying. Unlike conventional weapons, the use of non-lethal weapons does not make headlines because no one gets killed - although many will suffer painful burns and other effects caused by exposure to the ionizing radiation emitted by these kinds of weapons. There currently isn't enough scientific data available about potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to different wavelengths of microwave radiation. But some experts believe such strong exposures may result in cancer down the line. ""Exposure to microwave radiation can cause cancer,"" says Dr. John Morrow, chairperson of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine in Washington, D.C., ""and it causes damage to DNA."" However, he adds that scientists still don't know much more than that yet. Morrow points out that some studies suggest varying degrees of risk depending upon how and why someone is exposed to microwave radiation: People working in food processing plants are probably least likely to develop serious problems, while researchers doing research involving the study of molecular bonding processes may face higher risks as they work near microwave ovens day after day. This kind of information should help raise public awareness among consumers so they become better informed, he explains. As far as the general populace goes, however, we're really just winging it right now... and until further tests determine what exactly happens inside our bodies if we're continually bombarded with microwave signals, most civilians aren't going to do very much besides go blind and shrivel away. Other possible side effects include headaches, feelings of disorientation, arm and leg stiffness, muscle spasms, heat sensations, nausea, unconsciousness or even death. Some observers worry that the whole thing might topple governments. In addition to concerns about microwave beams piercing through walls and people, other critics say that microwave powers used in such technologies tend to degrade signal strength rather than enhance it. And the fact remains that not all types of radiated power are created equally. For example, microwave lamp generators operate differently than fiber optic lasers and lasers emit only coherent light, whereas ordinary lamps emit incoherent ligh.. Moreover, both sources require huge amounts of electricity, especially compared to the output of small handheld units found today. On top of everything else, though, the U.S.-based Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers notes that the transmittal distance and angle of the beam produced by hand held devices vary greatly, making it impossible to guarantee reliable results. But proponents counter that MWADS offers several advantages. First off, unlike some other similar products on the market, these devices actually aim at producing a focused spot, rather than merely dispersing heat indiscriminately, thus providing greater precision. Also, they produce less heat overall than microwave heating ranges, which makes it easier to avoid harming nearby individuals or animals. And lastly, according to David Randall, director of the Rapid Prototyping Center at Michigan State University, these technologies allow warfighters to defeat targets via blinding them rather than injuring them physically. Basically, you burn your enemy's retinas without burning his body, letting him see the world as blurry blobs without having anything tangible happen to his actual sense organs. Such a device allows soldiers to easily kill enemies behind cover using indirect fire to attack their backsides rather than putting rounds directly into their skulls.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Scientists from the University of California San Diego have developed a method to create neurons. The technique is able to convert astrocytes, the supporting cells in the brain, into neurons, which are responsible for communicating with neighboring nerve cells. The advance may lead to new treatments using neural stem cells derived from human embryos or foetuses - something already banned in Canada and New York but permitted under law elsewhere around the world. In early October, federal legislators voted overwhelmingly to lift the ban on research that uses such ""fetal tissue"" after advocacy by pro-life groups, including the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). That decision was made largely because researchers had found ways of deriving safe lines of embryonic stem cells suitable for use as lab models, without relying upon the creation of blastocysts. But supporters say obtaining those same types of stem cell lines could provide an opportunity for far more effective therapies if they can be generated from the nonhuman sources described above. Stem Cells: The Road Ahead? Fertilized eggs are created when sperm enter an ovule; fertilization occurs within one hour of intercourse. A few hours later, a newly formed embryo leaves its protective environment inside the egg and begins dividing until there are about 100 individual blastomeres - cells about three times the size of typical somatic cells (i.e., body tissue). These tiny progenitor cells proliferate rapidly during gestation producing both extraembryonic membranes and definitive tissues like heart, liver, kidney, pancreas and hematopoietic system [1]. Most survive embryogenesis only to die shortly after birth. Those that do not differentiate must undergo apoptosis (programmed cellular suicide) resulting in incomplete organ differentiation and death before day 25 post conception [2]. What makes these unique cells so attractive to developmental biologists is their ability to renew themselves indefinitely while remaining viable outside of the host organism. The most well known experiment demonstrating this phenomenon remains work done at Stanford University in the late 1970s, where Dr. Martin Evans implanted mouse bone marrow (containing haematopoetic stem cells) into 82 newborn SCID mice (severe combined immunodeficiency disease), some of whom then survived beyond six months [3], proving that clonal populations of bone marrow-derived pluripotent cells can populate multiple organs over time. This discovery opened up exciting possibilities for several reasons. First, it suggested that adult mammalian domestic animals might also harbour multipotential stem cells replicating throughout life. Secondly, immune compromised individuals could experience restoration of normal function through infusion of fetal and neonatal blood or other tissues containing undifferentiated precursor cells whose engraftment would influence the balance between T helper 1 (Th1) T Helper 2 (Th2) -like subsets leading to long lasting tolerance to transplanted allogeneic grafts [4-6] Thirdly, a recent report has demonstrated that human umbilical cord blood contains large numbers of immature CD34CD38 stem cells capable of differentiating into multilineage mature peripheral blood cells [7] and fourthly although controversial, therapeutic applications involving autologous transplantation of genetically modified murine cancer cells expressing selective gene products designed to target tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been used successfully to generate experimental cures in preclinical animal models [8]. Taken together these findings have led investigators to believe that somatic cells can indeed transform into fully functional specialized differentiated cells and thus consider further investigations to examine whether naturally occurring stem cells occur in cattle may allow us to explore fundamentals of physiology lost since Darwin's time. This concept is particularly important given current limitations associated with our understanding of development in humans and livestock alike and represents a new frontier in biotechnology providing opportunities for regenerative medicine and agriculture. Indeed generating induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells from bovine fibroblast cultures are now underway, however protocols remain variable and little progress has yet been made towards truly establishing robust IPS cell lines specifically from primary cells obtained directly from living born calves [9]. In theory at least two approaches exist whereby we can isolate and genetically manipulate embryonic stem cells from dairy cows to investigate fundamental questions concerning growth and differentiation. One possibility involves mating traditional bulls to super cow dams who carry genetic defects that result in congenital abnormalities such as dwarfism or lack of horns. Embryos from carrier females could potentially contain mutations caused by recessive genes present in sperm coming from affected sires. However, any fetuses produced via IVF techniques will invariably be maternally derived. Alternatively, the technology exists to produce transgenic cattle carrying foreign DNA sequences introduced selectively into defined regions of the genome. For example, homology recombination mediated insertions of marker genes beneath regulatory elements of select locus control region promoters have been shown to induce expression of reporter genes and regulate endogenous or exogenous genes with similar temporal and spatial patterns [10]. Currently four retroviral vectors are available commercially for delivery of specific DNA segments.

Mora was a highly respected and experienced politician, having served in both state and federal positions during his career. He was known for his dedication to fighting the drug cartels and advocating for greater security measures in Mexico. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but early reports suggest that it may have been caused by bad weather conditions.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Mobile Verification Toolkit is a collection of tools that automates the process of gathering forensic traces of potential compromises on Android and iOS devices. It was developed by the Amnesty International to help human rights defenders monitor mobile phones, tablets or laptops from inside their offices where there are no WiFi hotspots available for them. Use Cases: Mobile Phone Forensics - When devices need to be analyzed remotely due to security threats or sensitive data compromise e.g., when law enforcement agencies want to analyze smartphones, the tool would stop all background tasks besides preventing them from downloading new apps and updating existing ones, so as not to collect any additional information during forensically-important events such as acquiring fingerprints while taking photos in order to identify suspects who have been detained. The app can also run full disk encryption at boot time which makes it impossible for anyone to access files stored on the device without knowing either user's password or some other method to decrypt the file system. Remote Smartphone Control - In cases involving remote physical control over compromised users' mobiles, this application enables you to conduct a virtual remote desktop session on your own mobiles and see what they do whenever allowed to operate (iPadiPhone) whereas if you don't allow operations, then none will happen - which saves police officers time by eliminating one more step in addressing those situations since they won't have to go through tedious fingerprint collecting etc. How Does It Work? The mobile verification toolkit includes two separate applications for Windows systems: an android emulator and a windows emulator, as well as several scripts written using python language for iPhone iPad. These components work together like any local software suite, i.e., each component interacts with another based on instructions provided from the main script. However, unlike traditional software suites, every interaction between these components is fully automated via command line interface and does not require manual actions performed by a third party IT professional. More specifically, once downloaded onto the targeted device, only data transfer and analysis related activities take place, but never anything else. This removes any chance of tampering with the evidence collected through suspicious behavior monitoring.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Charity Twelves Company, based in Devon, said it had turned away 112 people seeking support in 2015. A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a 55 rise in reports of sexual abuse in the past four years. Police urged victims to come forward and said they would be protected. Updates on this story and more from Devon and Cornwall Between January and November 2015, 1,326 reports of sexual abuse were made to the force, compared with 853 in 2011. The figures show more than 380 historic allegations - in which the offence was committed before 1 May 2004 - of rape involving a child have been reported to the force since 2011. Jon Brown, head of development and impact at the NSPCC, said: ""Unfortunately there is a significant gap between the number of people who need help and therapy as a result of the abuse, and the availability of services."" He said the rise in reports was a result of historic cases of child sex abuse in the news, which had encouraged more people to come forward. 853 - 2011 888 - 2012 979 - 2013 1,221 - 2014 1,326 - 2015 Mr Brown said the prime minister had highlighted child sexual abuse as a priority along with dealing with terrorism which was ""encouraging."" However, Mr Brown said there needed to be a ""more joined up approach [between authorities] to provide the provision of help for victims"" including ""greater treatment and help"" and working with schools and families to prevent abuse. He said local authorities, health services and the police, as well as charities such as the NSPCC, had a duty to protect and care for victims. Tom Dingwall, chief executive of Twelves Company, which supports sexual and domestic abuse victims in the South West, said it provided services to almost 300 victims in 2015. ""Last year, demand outstripped our capacity to deliver services and we turned away 112 adults from receiving specialist support."" Across Devon and Cornwall there are four Local Safeguarding Children's Boards - which aim to protect those at risk. Andy Bickley, chair for Plymouth, said investments, including training courses for those who come into contact with children, have been made. David Taylor, the chair for Devon and Torbay, said authorities were ""getting better at identifying abuse."" He said: ""It is an extremely complex and challenging area of work, and authorities in the region are learning from best practice in other parts of the country."" Source: Devon and Cornwall Police Det Ch Insp Neil Ralph said the rise in reports of abuse was a ""challenge for the police service, locally and nationally,"" but the force had made a ""huge investment"" by creating a dedicated unit and was working with other forces. ""It is a large increase and we've increased our digital and online footprint as these things can be really difficult to report over the phone so it enables them to report abuse [online] much easier. ""People have a high level of trust in the police and the Operation Yewtree impact [means] they have felt more compelled to report abuse to police. He said a high number of the reports, which were released in response to a freedom of information request by BBC News, related to historical crimes and the force ""would do everything it can to investigate them and bring the offenders to justice."" - Local authorities have the statutory responsibility for safeguarding children. - The safeguarding is overseen by Local Safeguarding Children's Boards. - These Boards are made up of a number of agencies such as local authorities, police, education health providers. - Police will lead on criminal investigations with social care services leading on the safeguarding.",human,3.643939393939394,3.6666666666666665,3.5076923076923077,3.765625,4.631578947368421,0.04831679985073094,0.295688919107679,0.2051541594310518,0.3767396821921501,0.09775762156714533,0.7743213083840028,0.05756471357817006,0.8108073679673523,0.19444444444444442,0.8732365009991462,0.09259259259259256,0.2527171454785179,-0.09386973180076628,0.07070408110994401,0.0,0.0,0.238095238095238,0.7491944761979156,-0.021442770397245223,0.3385191966558186,0.19688269073010653,0.3358712096126989,0.4389978213507625,0.8105042565212213,-0.18619528619528622,0.47607860156785586,0.874074074074074,2.1275557825939706,0.08680555555555552,1.2464261287029585,0.6567436396797427,1.7146918420186168,-0.15972222222222224,0.6329760109129352,0.017094017094016964,0.358303732950857,-0.23245096386219297,0.00414511797942963,0.7383891828336273,1.0455048638314657,0.14814814814814814,0.7554102983100421,0.18518518518518517,0.6687211142691774,1.8545454545454545,3.0,0.37599225361946853,0.9650143649507206,0.5211677128514509,-0.16957915530186507,0.1646335084518736,0.15910135943745052

This document contains a high-level outline of a book on how to improve your skills to increase your rate. This is a book for anyone who wants to be a better developer. As developers, we're all good at some things, and bad at others. This book gives you a framework for self-evaluation and improvement. The book is for anyone who is starting out, or has been working for a few years. It's for those who work alone, or on a team. It's for those who want to find more work, or those who want to build a company. It's for those who are just out of college, or those who have been working for a while and want to be a better developer. The book is a guide to help you get to where you want to be. It's a general guide, and not a list of specific things to do, because what you need to do to get to your goals is going to be different from what I need to do to get to my goals. The goal of this book is to help you get to the next step in your career, whatever that step is. Here are some things you can learn from this book: How to identify what you need to work on. How to take a step back and evaluate your work. How to approach what you need to work on. How to build a habit of continuous improvement. This book is for anyone who wants to be a better developer, and by extension, a more productive and happier person. You'll learn how to take a step back and evaluate your current situation, and then how to choose a few areas where you can improve. You'll also learn how to build a habit of continuous improvement, which will help you keep improving your skills over time. Improving your skills will make you happier and more productive. You'll become better at writing code, and you'll start writing more code. You'll be able to work faster, and with fewer bugs. This will allow you to charge a higher rate, and will also help you get the job you want. Most developers want to be better at their job. This book will give you the skills to make that happen. The book is organized into the following chapters: Why you should be a better developer. How to get to the next step in your career. How to figure out what you're not good at.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The pontiff granted Spanish Monsignor Lucio Vallejo Balda a Christmas-time clemency after he served half of his 18-month sentence, the Vatican said. The priest was convicted in July. The leaked papers were cited in books published in 2015, that alleged corruption in the Catholic Church. A former colleague of the priest was given a 10-month suspended sentence. On Tuesday, the Vatican said in a statement that Pope Francis granted ""conditional freedom"" to Mgr Angelo Lucio Vallejo Balda. ""This is a clemency measure which allows him to regain his freedom. The penalty is not quashed."" The statement added that all his professional ties to the Vatican had ended, and he would now be under the authority of the Bishop of Astorga in Spain - the priest's original diocese. Mgr Balda has made no public comment on the latest developments. The books, by journalists Emiliano Fittipaldi and Gianluigi Nuzzi, were based on leaked materials and exposed waste and financial mismanagement in the Church. The original Vatileaks episode saw the last Pope's former butler, Paolo Gabriele, sentenced to 18 months in jail in 2012 after being found guilty of stealing sensitive documents from the pontiff's desk. He served nearly three months of his sentence under house arrest in the Vatican before Pope Benedict visited him and personally pardoned him.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Companies such as Facebook and Google may soon be forced to inform customers individually on how much profit they gain from customer data. The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Individuals Understand How the Market Works Act, or DATA Bill for short, is currently making its way through a parliamentary committee in the UK - but has already been widely criticised by privacy advocates including Open Rights Group founder Jim Killock. ""I think this bill would actually have quite an impact,"" he told TechWeekEurope. ""What it's saying is that not only do companies need to tell you about their profits... They also need to explain what those profits mean."" He added: ""If we don't know where our money goes then there is really no point having any of it at all."" The draft law would require online service providers like search engines, social networks and email services to disclose profits derived from personal information provided by individuals who use them. It applies regardless of whether the provider sells or provides access to user content or advertising revenue. It aims to ensure people understand the amount of value created when using third-party websites - something which is increasingly important as more users are beginning to opt out of adverts altogether, instead choosing paid subscriptions via sites like Netflix. 'Fairly straightforward' But critics say the new legislation does little more than provide a tick box exercise without offering meaningful explanations about why certain figures should interest consumers. One issue of particular concern will undoubtedly be estimating profits made from accessing other kinds of user activity (like searches), rather than purely monetising ads. ""Somebody could argue if that was your motivation behind putting up [a website], perhaps there shouldn't be profits. But I just see it as fair enough because we can always choose to block some traffic, so someone trying to sell us something doesn't bother me,"" said Killock. There were similar issues raised during debates over the European Union General Data Protection Regulation last year, with campaigners arguing that the proposals were too vague. Earlier this month, the EU approved GDPR despite complaints from rights groups and politicians alike. Killock suggested that the British government needs to tweak their plans accordingly before introducing the law into Parliament later this summer. He pointed towards comments made earlier today by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Mark Garnier MP, who noted that businesses might be able to avoid disclosing costs simply by promoting themselves better. Businesses are probably ready to take advantage of the opportunity given to them now by the current economic climate. We're going to find ourselves facing another recession within five years. Companies like ours must recognise these changing times and adapt quickly, says James Brindle, CEO at the Advertising Association. Gaining greater insight into consumer behaviour would help firms respond effectively. Advertisers want relevant creative, expert advice based on empirical research. There's nothing wrong with curiosity - one reason Amazon's Jeff Bezos recently purchased Whole Foods to learn more about food preferences. This isn't big brother surveillance; data helps marketers make smarter decisions about where to spend the most time. So long as they act responsibly, the right kind of safeguards exist to protect citizens. Advertisement Paul Bernal, policy director at Consumer Focus, agreed that investors needed clarity on exactly how much benefit advertisers get from each person visiting their site. However, he believes that ultimately the responsibility lies with individual users to decide whether using analytics and targeted ads means that they're willing to share their data with others. Bernal explained: ""When you go around on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram looking for things to buy, even though you've got choices between different retailers, often the retailer being recommended by the algorithm is paying attention to lots of detail, about your interests, likes and hobbies, age group, gender etc., and selling stuff to them anyway. ""That's fine as far as it goes, but when you start thinking about the sort of work that supermarkets did 20 years ago, taking very detailed information on shoppers' likes and shopping habits - 'Take my handbag, I'm buying two pairs of shoes', that's working out that customers didn't change brand loyalty. In fact, they changed brands every few weeks."" Privacy advocates liken targeting options offered by digital platforms to the political profiling techniques used by authoritarian regimes like China, which uses internet censorship software like Great Firewall to monitor views across the country. In terms of transparency, this inevitably raises concerns about oversight mechanisms under state control. When asked specifically about what protections there are against misuse, Terry McGovern, co-director of the Civil Liberties Foundation Europe, argued that disclosures wouldn't necessarily prevent bad actors abusing collected data. A lack of transparency is equally problematic, she continued.

Maia, from Barmouth, Gwynedd, had the transplant at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital in August after a three-month wait for a new heart. She has now been welcomed back to her school, Ysgol y Traeth. Maia, a year five pupil, fell ill at Easter while visiting her grandparents in Telford, Shropshire. ""Maia was out of breath and could not move,"" explained her mother, Hannah Carter. ""She was taken to the local hospital and then transferred to the Birmingham Children's Hospital where a heart problem was diagnosed."" But Maia's father said when he questioned doctors and revealed he had undergone a heart transplant, the medical team realised her condition was serious. She was transferred to the London Children's Hospital, where surgeons confirmed she also needed a heart transplant. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the next three months, until she finally received the donor heart she needed on 15 August. It was three months of desperate worry for her parents, who are are separated, but remain friends. The local community rallied around to ensure they could spend as much time as possible with their daughter in London. ""Dan's family, my family, the school, friends and indeed the whole community here in Barmouth and in Telford have been magnificent and supported us throughout the summer after Maia was taken ill,"" said Mrs Carter, who works for the Gwynedd home care team. Mr Collingswood, who works at a private care establishment near Dolgellau, added: ""I am with the local lifeboat here in Barmouth and the RNLI helped us out financially when we had to visit Maia in hospital in London. ""The community has been great, there were collection tins everywhere for Maia and it helped us out. We could not have managed without the support of the community."" On Tuesday, Maia was greeted by pupils and the head teacher as she returned to class, seven weeks ahead of schedule. ""Maia would have liked to have gone back to school last week but we had to travel to Great Ormond Street for check-ups,"" said her mother. ""She asked if she could go back to school after returning home from London and the expert medical team said that it was OK. Maia was delighted."" The long wait for the transplant meant Hannah's mother had to give up her flat in Barmouth to be with her daughter, but she has now moved into a new home with Maia after being rehoused by housing organisation Cartrefi Cymunedol Gwynedd. Mrs Carter added: ""I started back to work this week, Maia has started school, we have a new flat, it is all coming together. ""It has been a long and traumatic summer and without the support of family, friends and the community and the medical team, I don't know how I got through it."" Maia herself said she was delighted to be back in the classroom, and revealed how she had coped with her long stay in hospital. ""I used to talk to my school friends on Skype when I was in hospital in London and the headmaster visited me a couple of times."" She also had a number of special visitors while on the hospital wards. ""When I was in hospital I met the singer Adele, racing driver Lewis Hamilton, Alexandra Burke from the X Factor and two American astronauts, "" she said.",human,3.5833333333333335,3.5,4.015384615384615,4.0625,4.105263157894737,-0.5432757185062929,-0.22989609066779704,-0.3850005733543336,-0.33537466697149787,0.1684981684981686,0.4615249170921598,0.4881930516917902,0.48760966843311293,0.4902659069325739,0.44152568434948014,-0.3076923076923077,0.09731347936694244,0.3441644562334217,0.19384906108324054,0.0,0.0,-0.30219780219780223,-0.0628756606049734,0.34143488247921266,0.5241843816390812,0.11737237331987115,0.23277309998290294,0.08823529411764709,0.49895432617358637,0.3622377622377623,0.3478575665513327,0.41538461538461546,1.465503066584073,-0.1322115384615384,0.2373969290518075,-0.1280862326026009,0.04079462199153156,0.10096153846153842,0.5871783405025944,1.053254437869822,0.37595902421516747,0.5632465662814676,0.09581569489656301,0.7472527472527474,0.6825500401218642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2545454545454546,2.909090909090909,0.559045628642066,0.7758920443847076,0.6873342956759276,0.3122719678022519,-0.1291260240140107,-0.14956650935935387

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"As one of the largest social networks, Facebook receives a massive amount of content from users all over the world. While Facebook has rules regarding the type of content that is allowed and not allowed on its platform, it does not have laws in place to protect users against bots (robot software) created by third-party companies to post advertisements or manipulate people's views. The recent news about Instagram's ""Find Friends Nearby"" feature being used for political purposes has opened up the question: How can we trust such information? One company that uses similar technology as Instagram - but with far more potential than finding friends nearby - is Microsoft. As part of their Bing Search Engine, they are now using face recognition technology to help identify humans[i]. They say this new tool will be able to tell between people in photographs and computer generated faces so that when you search for something like 'best burger near me', only real human photos appear.[ii] The concept behind this machine vision technology is very simple; if you take two pictures of someone's face at slightly different angles, then computers are programmed to recognize which photo shows what expression. This allows them to build profiles of customers based upon how they look when involved in various activities. It could also allow advertisers to target specific groups. For example, an advertisement might show young women who exercise during the day instead of having ads randomly placed across a database.[iii] Yet again questions arise concerning privacy rights. If I am searching for burgers within my city, should Microsoft know exactly where I live if they sell advertising space to local restaurants? Should they know if I go hiking outside town? Are there other ways they use this facial recognition technology? What else do they plan to add? And finally, why hasn't any regulation been put into place to ensure these businesses don't abuse our data? Why We Need Laws Regulating Social Media Bots - Taggers Automated Posts In 2014, Chris Freeland published his book "" Talk To Me Like Google ,"" where he explained how many bloggers' backlinks were purchased through cybersquatting websites under false pretenses. Nowadays, most SEO marketers understand that buying links on PR6 sites related to your niche is considered spammy. But Buying links is still somewhat safe because those websites usually claim to purchase link packages per month, and sometimes even buy few hundred thousands worth of links every single time without realizing it. So basically, before purchasing ANY sort of traffic from another site, quickly check out the website linked after that particular page! There is no point spending money on paid reviews if your competitors own several links pointing to their pages. Secondly, read visitor comments left beneath each review you find. You may see negativenegative feedback which says ""this product doesn't work."" In fact, the reason they bought hundreds of positive reviews probably was due to some technical problem with the product itself (that would explain why they didn't update their customer service department). Also, follow up with support via email if possible. Most times, feedback left by visitors are generally ignored. Don't bother contacting Amazon's ombudsman unless you want 5 minutes of frustration resulting in 30 seconds of waterfalls of emails going nowhere. Social media marketing includes organic reach, referral network building, influencer relations and owned, earned and paid channels (known as OECP).[citation needed] Many companies hire consultants to assist in optimizing their Twitter accounts BudgetsAreSexy, yet often fail to properly monitor existing staff members. Failure thus leads to poor digital ROI and increased attrition rates. If you're looking for inspiration, my friend Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of the blog Making SenseofHome had lots of great ideas. Her latest idea - getting printable holiday cards made online. (Plus her gorgeous ornament hanging tutorial.)

The analysis, published in the journal Gut, showed overweight teenagers went on to have twice the risk of bowel cancer. The figures were even higher in obese teens. The World Cancer Research Fund said the link between obesity and cancer was ""strong."" Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, with nearly 1.4 million new cases each year. Processed red meat and abdominal fat have been linked to the disease. The participants in the study were aged between 16 and 20 at the start. The overwhelming majority were a normal weight, but 6.5 were overweight and 1 were obese. There were 855 cases of colorectal cancer in the study. However, the results showed not all weights were affected equally. Those who were obese were 2.38 times more likely to have developed a bowel tumour. The study, led by Orebro University Hospital in Sweden and Harvard University, said: ""Late adolescence marks the transition from childhood to adulthood and is a period of accelerated growth, especially among men, thus this period may represent a critical window."" ""It is important that we understand the role of exposures in childhood and adolescence in the development of colorectal cancer. ""In fact, the strong association observed between adolescent obesity and early-to-mid-life colorectal cancer, coupled with the increasing prevalence of adolescent obesity, may shed light on the increase in colorectal cancer incidence among young adults,"" he added. Rachel Thompson, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said the evidence suggested that obesity was a risk factor for bowel cancer. ""This finding is interesting because it gives an indication that bowel cancer risk might be affected by our lifestyle habits throughout the life course,"" she said. ""In some ways, research into the relationship between factors like obesity and cancer risk is still in its infancy. ""It will be interesting to see if further research emerges in the future to back up the apparent relationship between body fatness in youth and later-life cancer risk.""",human,1.75,2.1666666666666665,1.5846153846153845,1.78125,2.210526315789474,0.3797784109724964,0.26044467775807384,0.3534117311046723,0.37905680103267736,-0.328042328042328,0.5592002420167568,-0.4173441734417343,0.1430659205024174,-0.25205761316872405,0.17617865563992746,0.5555555555555554,1.6855772899833665,-0.14942528735632174,0.21325005907397857,0.0,0.0,0.19047619047619016,0.6121008067759953,-0.46697588865111855,0.34090690040087435,-0.6453377085042385,0.34505883015126737,0.0,0.8659546440692438,0.021212121212121196,0.1838941644991086,0.022222222222222365,0.5656465013369593,0.3645833333333335,0.25647089230321224,0.16878419734767694,0.3515870177982862,-0.5208333333333333,0.15454710191245638,-0.46153846153846156,0.163523748786478,-0.17433822289664472,-0.0795377239676952,0.3597883597883601,1.1813007990096427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1818181818181819,2.1818181818181817,0.21232925131632116,0.6174247178181667,0.7660180209256419,-0.11984936834332426,-0.08304749939625423,0.00798643769690424

A British man has been attacked by a crocodile while playing golf in Australia. John Lahiff, 75, told local media that he disturbed the crocodile while looking for a ball in water at the course in Port Douglas, Queensland. He was taken to hospital in a stable condition and his wound treated. The Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course was closed after the attack. The incident follows a report that a crocodile had been sighted in the area. ""We were told there was a croc out there,"" Mr Lahiff told the Cairns Post. ""I thought, I'm not going to worry about that. I hit a drive off the tee and it went straight into the water. I saw it floating in the water but decided not to pick it up."" He said that when he reached into the water to pick up the ball, the crocodile struck, biting into his thigh. ""I got my ball out of the water and I was going back to the buggy and suddenly I felt this horrific pain in my right leg,"" he said. ""I saw this reptile in the water. It had got me. I grabbed the croc by the neck and I hit it with the club. I hit it with the club and I kicked it with my left foot."" He said he managed to hit the crocodile's head with a golf club, and managed to get away. ""I wasn't sure what to do with myself,"" he said. ""The adrenaline kicked in and I thought, 'I've got to get away from this thing'."" Another golfer at the course, Joe Doran, told the Cairns Post: ""I've seen three crocodiles out there this year."" ""You can see them up on the bank - they're not afraid of people,"" he added.

Elon Musk has been talking about opening up the network to other companies' EVs since 2017, but he's only now getting around to it because Tesla is delivering more than half a million cars per year and can't keep pace with demand for charging stations anymore. The company says that owners of Audi e-tron SUV or Porsche Taycan EV will be able to use either Tesla's free destination chargers (at malls, airports) at no extra charge starting next summer - provided their car also supports CCS fast charging as well as CHAdeMO.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with Welsh language media as having dual nationality, according to figures from 2016 published by the National Assembly for Wales (NAW). The UK Government is rushing through new legislation which will make it unlawful for public bodies such as schools, hospitals or councils across England to work on behalf of the EU unless they have majority levels of support among their staff. The bill has been passed by MPs but still requires royal approval. It was formally introduced last week amid concerns that official documents could be made available in other languages after Brexit unless there were safeguards. Only one MP voted against the legislation when it came before Parliament this month - former Labour Cabinet minister Kate Hoey, who said she did not want an ""unfinished job."" David Davis also warned the Commons that leaving without a deal would be ""a disaster"" but ultimately backed down due to opposition within his own party. In her first statement since becoming Prime Minister Theresa May's de facto deputy PM following Andrea Leadsom's resignation earlier this year, Mrs Tinsley said: ""I am proud of my British values, I remain committed to working together with our European partners, colleagues on both sides of the House and all parts of society."" She added: ""In order to do so successfully we must seek to ensure people feel confident about travelling into Europe, accessing education abroad, studying in universities and businesses trading freely and safely across borders."" Ministers expect 75 per cent of companies to offer staff flexible working arrangements post-Brexit, though charities say many employers are already taking steps to provide them anyway. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government wanted more flexible employment rules for workers than those currently guaranteed under existing EU law. She said: ""We'd like to see the rights of employees protected more than at present and the employers' obligations considerably reduced... We're looking to take some extra measures in relation to industrial relations the self-employed because obviously if you've got no worker protection then something needs to change and we just want to see changes making sure that there are fewer obstacles facing business where they might choose to employ somebody flexibly."" Ms Rudd said firms should face much less red tape if Britain left the bloc without any agreement either side reached during negotiations. Ms Rudd confirmed there had been discussions between ministers and representatives of different parties regarding how to strike out remaining sections of the 1972 Working Time Directive. While a small number of businesses have announced plans to scrap weekend working hours, most bosses appear keen to avoid being seen to restrict access to jobs. A survey conducted on Wednesday found 68 per cent of company directors planned to retain Sunday opening in case trade deals need to be negotiated quickly - although even half of these firms thought demand for Saturday openings may increase once a formal exit strategy is agreed. Nearly six in 10 directors surveyed believed customs duties might come into force in time for Christmas while nearly three quarters felt higher import tariffs would fall outside negotiating timescales. More than four fifths (79) expected the result of the referendum to influence voting behaviour next Thursday's local elections. Meanwhile, almost nine in ten (87) expressed concern about immigration levels falling below 100,000 - up seven percentage points on September 2017. Another eight in 10 (81) respondents believe areas worst affected by migration loss during the past five years will now suffer most in future.

Progress had been made since the last report but concerns remained, the chief inspector of prisons said. The National Offender Management Service said it would ""work hard to improve."" HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) carried out the inspection last autumn during 29 September and 3 October. Inspectors said levels of violence had risen since the last inspection and ""were now considerably higher than in similar prisons."" They said not enough was being done to ""investigate individual violent incidents"" and the prison was not dealing with perpetrators and victims. Concern was also raised over the ""availability of new psychoactive substances such as'Spice - a substance which is a synthetic cannabinoid and acts like cannabis. The inspection report cited seven ""Spice-related emergency admissions to hospital"" in the past six months. But ""the governor and staff had made huge efforts to respond to recommendations,"" HMIP said in its report. Inspectors said they were ""pleased"" to find ""a marked improvement in the staff culture and attitudes of staff since 2013."" They also said mental health provision was ""very good,"" with prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm feeling ""well-supported."" But although ""considerable progress"" had been made, the prison still required support to make further improvements. Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said: ""HMP Bristol has come a long way in a relatively short time since the last inspection. ""The distance the prison has already travelled has involved real determination, hard work and resilience from managers and staff which needs to be recognised. ""It is important they now receive support to make the further improvements required."" Michael Spurr, from the National Offender Management Service, said: ""There remain a number of key areas for improvement, and the prison will continue to work hard to address these, supported by 10 new prison officers who will start later this month.""

Car and parts production has already been halted at a plant in Mexico. German carmaker Volkswagen said on Monday that two of its suppliers had stopped deliveries to one of its factories in Puebla, Mexico, amid a contract dispute. The company said the parts suppliers, ES Automobilguss and Car Trim, had stopped delivering parts for the Volkswagen models Jetta, Beetle and Golf. ""We are negotiating with the suppliers to find a quick solution,"" Volkswagen said in a statement. ""Our goal is to continue production as soon as possible and to minimize the effects of this interruption on our customers."" The Mexican Association of the Automotive Industry said that the factory produced 110,000 cars in 2016 and that the plant had a workforce of 4,500 people. VW said it had halted production at its Puebla plant on Sunday. ES Automobilguss is a German company that produces automobile seats. Car Trim makes seats and parts used in gearboxes. The dispute came on the heels of a threatened strike by workers at the factory on Friday, when they voted not to strike, pending negotiations between labor and the company. The German automaker said it could not assess how long the production halt would last. Volkswagen has been working to shore up its financial position following the so-called dieselgate scandal. The company has set aside billions of euros to cover the costs of the scandal, which saw it cheat on emissions tests with the aim of making it appear that its vehicles met environmental standards. VW has also suffered from an ongoing battle with its US hedge fund investors over a multi-billion-euro dividend payout.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Kaori Okuni, one of the women campaigning for change, said the ruling would lead to ""suffering for those who plan to marry and those who are set to be born."" ""I would like to see the country's constitution protect same-sex couples in the future,"" said Ms Okuni, who has lived with her same-sex partner for 10 years and is now campaigning for the same-sex couples to be allowed to marry. In the same-sex marriage case, a district court in Tokyo rejected a request by three couples to be legally married and one of them, represented by lawyer Masao Oka, said they would appeal. But the judge, Hitoshi Hashizume, said same-sex marriage was illegal under the constitution. ""I think it is unreasonable,"" he said, ""and therefore violates the constitution, to say the only way to achieve that (peace of mind) is for same-sex couples to be allowed to marry."" He said that the government must recognise same-sex couples as legal entities and that some local governments had already begun to do so. Campaigners in Tokyo said they were disappointed. ""The ruling is an insult to those people living in same-sex relationships,"" said Akane Matsuoka, from the campaign group Marriage for all Japan. ""The judge went to lengths to explain the current status of our country, where same-sex couples cannot marry, but he did not understand that we are working to change that. ""He failed to understand that the country has changed and there are many who think the same-sex couples should be allowed to marry."" Gay marriage is currently only legal in 28 countries worldwide, and Taiwan became the first in Asia to legalise it in May 2019. But Japan is often described as a ""conservative country"" and the country has a very low level of public support for gay marriage - a poll in 2015 by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only 39 of Japanese supported same-sex marriage, compared with 61 in the US. The issue of same-sex marriage is not widely debated in Japan and some campaigners complain of a lack of media coverage. But in recent years, there has been a steady rise in support for the LGBT community. In 2017, an LGBT-themed manga comic about a gay couple and their life in Japan became a bestseller, and there are now LGBT districts in major cities where same-sex couples are openly affectionate with one another. In 2018, a politician from the governing LDP made history by ""coming out"" as gay in parliament, and many hope that this will lead to a shift in attitudes. Same-sex marriage is legal in Australia, New Zealand and parts of the United States. In Asia, Taiwan became the first country to legalise gay marriage in May 2019.",llama_65B,2.765151515151515,2.1666666666666665,3.1538461538461537,3.28125,3.473684210526316,-0.7732384686932404,-0.1574471705561904,-0.5875662684616157,-0.5500676353576646,0.6848072562358273,0.7753430545064979,1.0505560228016073,0.9034600859019458,1.130658436213992,0.9513643599512792,0.7222222222222223,0.4090670918332686,0.18390804597701152,0.6870925171098669,0.0,0.0,0.238095238095238,0.420132678674054,0.030972890573798727,0.3308514636014341,0.7328411266065078,1.4973871544582136,0.5522875816993466,1.0867731014883235,0.565656565656566,0.3472914598535043,0.6888888888888889,0.07655563739158838,0.572916666666667,0.6408657424892504,0.36840396921079477,0.45744238003756404,0.8125,2.448317766201286,0.3076923076923076,0.6479986704144098,0.34867644579328955,0.3051069275546079,1.7425044091710764,1.4369903221513771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2727272727272727,1.5454545454545454,0.5676749395021491,0.8061907261786466,0.08321374711529096,0.2717260755094578,0.15770382767317065,0.03303581510827514

HAMR-JR was built as a test to see if it could run, jump and climb while carrying cargo. (Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot) The robot is a model of HAMR-JR (Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot). As noted in the video below, the robot was inspired by the amazing jumping ability of the African bush vaulting frog. ""HAMR-Jr is a small-scale robot that can traverse flat and inclined surfaces at a speed of 13.9 body lengths per second,"" says lead author Shuhei Miyashita. ""Its jumping agility allows it to traverse complex terrain and perform tasks such as delivering a payload or transporting small objects in hard-to-reach locations."" ""The robot is capable of climbing fences and vertical walls, and can even jump through obstacles as high as 1.8 meters. These capabilities make HAMR-Jr a promising platform for applications in search-and-rescue operations, infrastructure inspection, and legged robot research."" Though not specifically mentioned, HAMR-JR is quite close to being a 4th Generation Ambient Microbot, described in Robert Heinlein's 1970 novel I Will Fear No Evil: ...""As a result of my work, I've learned to spot them now and again... Now and then I see one in the street, the size of a child's hand. I'm the only one who sees it. If you crushed it, it would look like a splotch of grease. But I know what it is. ""There were a lot of fourth generation robots around - not as big as a hand - and nobody ever saw them. They didn't do anything - they didn't have to; they just sat and listened. But they could pass information to each other by jumping a gap - which looked to human eyes like teleportation. ...""That was the first inkling I had of what had happened. I picked it up on the street. I'd just come from a poker game, I was broke, and I picked it up - it looked like a watch. I got home with it and it was gone. But I had picked up a fourth generation ambulatory microbot. I'm the only one who knows that. I doubt if you can find anybody else who knows what a fourth generation ambulatory microbot is. But I do.""

Barriers were installed in the car park, reducing the area for parking. The changes followed a report from the Welsh Ambulance Service which revealed that the UHW site had been consistently missing its target of ensuring 75 of ambulances reach the emergency unit within 15 minutes. The new barriers were designed to help improve the flow of traffic and reduce congestion, but they have caused frustration amongst visitors and staff who are used to having more available parking spaces. Hospital bosses say they are working to address these concerns. They claim that the number of ambulances reaching the hospital within the 15-minute target has increased since the changes were made and that they are continuing to monitor the situation.",text-davinci-003,0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.3230769230769231,0.296875,-0.15789473684210525,0.46438945791834296,-0.09734698565064916,0.2589625544134738,0.1366817613208495,0.43537414965986376,0.5418947601088587,0.3885618166526493,0.4910761645420322,0.28086419753086433,0.3976794509974985,-1.0,-0.3070916158528785,0.017241379310344803,0.18435451309030795,0.0,0.0,0.7857142857142856,-0.014814969307661751,-0.17868975331037695,0.5267938548218263,1.1156685808039373,0.629322372102396,0.0,0.05373208119507178,0.48787878787878813,0.4472009698937945,0.1333333333333333,1.92274997857113,1.09375,0.8071720181732308,0.1022442733933043,0.27976250141107195,0.06249999999999994,-0.07576923428973634,0.0,-0.022204891945572656,0.5230146686899342,0.9060988201802067,-0.529100529100529,-0.5258439360828316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.45454545454545453,0.490725816155397,-0.1533197153779944,0.5037999874525277,-0.35752105390490035,0.46250155031650375,0.6360234230707659

The idea for Solein originally began at NASA, where researchers were looking for a way to make food for astronauts using recycled air and water. Solar Foods is now looking to scale up production of Solein. Using electricity, water, and carbon dioxide, a Finnish company is producing a protein powder that is meant to feed the world's population without any impact on the environment. This revolutionary foodstuff is made using renewable energy that combines CO2, hydrogen, and oxygen. The company claims that they're creating ""food from air."" The protein that the company is producing, called Solein, is very similar to wheat gluten. Solein is the brainchild of the company, Solar Foods. The foodstuff is the result of a joint effort between VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The company says that the creation of Solein is part of a project called Food from Electricity. Solein is a protein powder that is made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy. This protein powder is very similar to wheat gluten. The company is claiming that Solein is the most environmentally friendly protein powder in the world. They say that 1 kilo of Solein requires 20 times less land and 10 times less water than beef, five times less than soybeans, and four times less than wheat. It's also made in a way that is carbon-neutral. Solar Foods says that they're feeding the world without impacting the environment. In the future, Solar Foods hopes to expand the production of Solein by up to 2 million meals per year. They have already opened a pilot factory in the city of Espoo, Finland. The company is expecting to start selling the protein powder in 2021. In an effort to feed the world, Solar Foods has developed a protein powder that is made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy. The CEO of Solar Foods, Pasi Vainikka, said that the idea for Solein originally began at NASA, where researchers were looking for a way to make food for astronauts using recycled air and water. The company now hopes to scale up production of Solein and be able to feed the world's population without the use of land or water.",llama_65B,2.159090909090909,2.8333333333333335,2.2153846153846155,2.0625,2.1578947368421053,-0.25320078872294394,-0.10877877755289367,0.03788039114064115,0.1888680528355716,-0.4489795918367347,0.0930845660200946,-0.3296888141295208,-0.07636551617768636,-0.46156004489337793,-0.08420357792330088,-0.8181818181818182,-0.09912534233385917,-0.3009404388714733,-0.10357749110409706,0.0,0.0,0.006493506493506297,0.4735750196830876,-0.021442770397245223,0.22841531342275595,-0.2729510030576478,0.24223897298410205,-0.20855614973262052,0.15097197415705843,-0.12727272727272718,-0.3742431647343059,-0.10909090909090913,0.4939263403503357,0.1988636363636364,0.26450482840433387,-0.06108099449470122,0.6466705846759122,-0.051136363636363584,0.8861487644707019,-0.5734265734265734,-0.396384776430395,0.047546788062721335,0.1376323358351976,-0.13852813852813817,0.05125340133874218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727272727272726,1.7272727272727273,1.1777155668725576,0.2925821729117786,1.0997300652030866,0.20422488309447395,-0.3651923005387172,-0.3049424303924958

However, organisers Culture Coventry said the funding withdrawal was ""not the only reason"" they had made the decision to cancel the event. It said events planned for 2015 and 2016 have been axed. Organisers said they had not ruled out reviving the festival, but it would remain on hold indefinitely. The free heritage event, which features classic cars, was due to take place in August at Stoneleigh Park. It is organised by Culture Coventry, a trust set up to manage four of the city's visitor attractions. Chief executive Gary Hall said he had just found out about the council's funding withdrawal. ""I have to look at the ongoing viability of the show and with cuts coming from the city council and other sponsors, we would not be able to grow it as we have in recent years,"" he said. ""It is a lot of money and, as a charity running four attractions in the city, we have to look at what benefits we are getting."" He said the charity was reopening Coventry's Transport Museum in June following a??9m redevelopment. ""Unfortunately, we have to put all of our resources into promoting the museum,"" he said.

The US government has taken notice of this technology and its potential to be abused. The House Intelligence Committee, at the request of California Representative Adam Schiff, has called on companies like Facebook and Twitter to look into ways of identifying and combating deep fakes. In a letter to the companies, the committee asks them to consider creating a database that could be used to identify these videos. The letter reads in part, ""As deep fake technology becomes more advanced and more accessible, it could pose a threat to United States public discourse and national security, with broad and concerning implications for offensive active measures campaigns targeting the United States."" This database would act as a fingerprint for videos so that companies like Facebook and Twitter can stop them from being uploaded to their platforms. YouTube has already built a database that does this and the committee wants to see others do the same. Democrats and Republicans are both concerned that these videos could be used to spread misinformation about political figures. Many have pointed to the use of deep fakes to make it look like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slurring her speech as an example of how dangerous these videos can be. The committee is also concerned that deep fakes could be used to misrepresent government officials in a way that could damage national security and international relations.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: ""The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. ""With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. ""We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been."" QPR boss Ian Holloway: ""I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. ""The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. ""Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. ""My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team."" Match ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Second Half ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Attempt saved.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The Public Health Wales study looks at adverse experiences in childhood (ACEs) which include parents separating. Children with four or more ACEs, around 14, are three times more likely to get lung or heart disease later in life. One senior health figure said instead of ""mending broken adults"" a focus was needed on ""building stronger children."" The findings are being published to coincide with a major international public health conference, hosted by PHW in Cardiff. It is the last of three PHW studies looking at the first 1,000 days of life. More than 2,000 adults in Wales were interviewed. The importance of giving children the best start in life has long been appreciated. But this research looks at the long term impact of bad experiences in those crucial early years and how it could mean more chronic illness and more pressure on frontline services further down the line. Those having had four or more ACEs are also: Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy and research at Public Health Wales said: ""Most of us have the odd shock in childhood and after that we relax and we're comforted by parents and our bodies develop at that lower, more relaxed level. ""But if you get constant exposure to adverse childhood experiences, your body develops at a higher state of tension, it's always looking out for more threats. ""That means as your body develops, it's used to being ready to be injured or hurt in some way and it wears out quicker. ""You're also more ill at ease, you may develop poorer metal health, you're more likely to use alcohol and drugs - and they increase your risks of ill health later on in life. All that adds up to you developing poor health, earlier."" But a child can experience adverse incidents even from within the womb. NSPCC midwife Nikki Rhys-Jones said: ""In the second trimester [the period from 13 to 27 weeks] of a woman's pregnancy, the baby can hear - so the baby will be aware of the sounds around her. ""So the baby can start relating and connecting to parents, however things like domestic abuse, violence in the household, shouting - a baby will experience that and those things will cause stress to a baby and impact on its development."" Emerging research suggests the effects could also be passed on from one generation to the next. Genomic expert Dr Tom Connor, consultant for Public Health Wales and senior lecturer at Cardiff University, said: ""As individuals, we're almost a symphony of genes, firing off at different times. ""Epigenetics [which looks at changes in genes] actually controls expression of genes - and so things like smoking and drinking can actually affect the expression of genes, which can be passed on to our children. ""There's growing evidence that the lifestyle choices we make ourselves have an effect on our children. That's an immediate effect when they're born and potentially if we do things, for example smoking which can do damage to our children's DNA, that can be a long term effect for their entire lifetime."" But this is not just a challenge for the NHS. Children who have had four or more adverse incidents are also 15 times more likely to be a perpetrator of violence, and 14 times more likely to be a victim. If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks Alun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner said the force was being made more aware of the impact of domestic incidents on children in the background - and it can only improve with all agencies working better together. ""There's tended to be an attempt to deal with those things by making referrals - pieces of paper passing from one organisation to another. You're never quite sure where they go,"" he said. But a coordinated approach is not always easy to achieve, he argues, at a time when public spending is being squeezed. ""If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks and the consequences are more complex and dangerous further down the line,"" said Mr Michael. ""There's been a general feeling within Wales we must shrink together and not shrink apart. It's more important that we don't allow those gaps, that we don't let people fall down the cracks; we work together for a joined up approach."" The Welsh Government said the evidence on the negative impact of ACEs was ""overwhelming"" and it was ""working relentlessly"" to prevent and reduce the long term impact on children who have experienced them. A spokesperson pointed to the Flying Start, Families First, and Supporting People programmes, as well as investing directly in children's health and well-being programmes. For Prof Bellis it is crucial for the future to get it right. ""The long term costs of leaving these things untreated are enormous,"" he said. ""What we've got to focus on is instead of mending broken adults we must build stronger children.""",human,5.53030303030303,5.166666666666667,6.276923076923077,6.40625,6.631578947368421,-0.34669852247321703,-0.12555774376065199,-0.23976664229221373,0.04843879991795435,0.3068783068783069,0.9635148850854356,0.690776562938043,1.0937646748905663,0.7201646090534981,1.0949563092145098,0.6388888888888888,0.8914518893937562,1.0589080459770115,1.0754875963116373,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809527,0.833209417276391,-0.2966249904952258,0.36163107547528217,0.139458572600492,0.4698335889333582,0.3398692810457518,0.5266754554321612,0.7212121212121213,0.6943785446023572,1.0222222222222224,2.6971892282571086,0.052083333333333356,0.7420542704385651,0.0024343874617453864,0.34912286907698237,-0.06249999999999994,0.5874046557926774,0.7179487179487177,1.023040134712309,0.0,0.151382597329742,0.7548500881834216,0.6319197381354271,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.16433554953054486,2.6363636363636362,3.8181818181818183,0.304068023802263,1.1966297975931803,0.31461583578568336,0.12848581568481748,0.06591010361860593,0.00053266300985641

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012 at their address in Cramlington and lasted two hours before he died from a fatal overdose. Sibery told police that they had been arguing when it became physical with Ashleigh grabbing his throat. He claimed this caused her death as because of previous injuries he believed she was breathing through broken ribs so stopped trying to resuscitate her until paramedics arrived some time later. But Northumbria Police launched an investigation into possible murder after it found Ms Sibery's body cold to touch but still warm to the touch which meant there were no signs she'd suffered any injury or trauma for several days before being dead. After speaking to neighbours who said they hadn't seen either partner for weeks detectives went round looking under furniture and beds for evidence whereupon they discovered traces of cocaine worth 2,000 hidden inside a chest freezer together with nearly 1kg (two pounds) of cannabis resin valued at up to tens of thousands of pounds stashed down behind a loose floorboard. They also recovered memory sticks containing more than 3,500 indecent images - including 251 videos showing people having sex with dogs, horses and a goat, 600 pictures featuring extreme sexual activity such as bondage and bestiality and almost 100 still photographs depicting children aged between five and 13 years old performing ""sexually explicit acts."" In 2015 investigators looked again at allegations by other women against Sindey over whether these too amounted to abuse leading to four charges being added to those already lodged. But in February 2018 another charge related to alleged attacks involving one woman was dropped because prosecutors decided not to ask the jury to find him guilty on account of lack of credible evidence while jurors concluded the remaining three counts proved beyond reasonable doubt following six-and-a half hours' deliberations last month..",opt_30b,1.6742424242424243,0.6666666666666666,1.6,1.65625,0.6842105263157895,0.5844359514102704,-0.0567304060637949,0.2610952154056824,0.21889744534105207,2.0226757369614505,1.5179952352130943,1.7845061209232782,0.794927367732382,1.8364197530864197,0.952009698922962,0.9444444444444446,1.4481628952426981,1.350574712643678,1.7631904165912555,0.0,0.0,1.9523809523809519,3.0063863181191173,-0.28352107525246484,-0.08895203966540152,2.5704129067541697,1.6358936111886972,2.0816993464052294,2.8255844380198774,-0.6010101010101011,-0.14906698996459797,1.2444444444444447,2.8470780255417187,-0.052083333333333356,0.7221661318437774,2.0319020680701105,1.5579972618003672,0.5624999999999999,1.979901117639179,1.692307692307692,0.6814727747379923,1.2203675602765134,0.3795407754352833,-0.18342151675484983,0.4957709981509783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6545454545454548,0.9090909090909091,-0.6460567985702252,1.1742924289634373,-0.6201294874289769,-1.023731064658369,1.7143720779307903,1.6287147910245483

Parry saved again from Dobbie after the break, but the 33-year-old would not be denied his fifth goal in three Challenge Cup outings and 12th goal of the season for the Championship side. His close-range header killed off the lively League One visitors' hopes. And it ended a run of eight games without a victory for the Dumfries side - a sequence that had ended with Gavin Skelton standing down as manager earlier this week. The side under caretaker Jim Thomson, who had been football development manager, for the first time became the second into the last four. Dundee United had earlier beaten Dunfermline Athletic 1-0 at East End Park. League One leaders Livingston host Welsh champions The New Saints, while Ayr United visit Championship rivals St Mirren, in two Sunday quarter-finals. A Grant Anderson header had grazed the Alloa crossbar before Dobbie made the breakthrough at Palmerston Park. The Wasps had their moments, with Jamie Longworth being denied by goalkeeper Lee Robinson and Greig Spence going close with an overhead kick with Jim Goodwin's part-time side only one goal behind and looking the more likely to score. However, after Parry prevented Derek Lyle extending the lead, Dobbie provided the finish from Dean Brotherston's cross 14 minutes from time. Queen of the South caretaker manager Jim Thomson: ""It was a shock to myself. On the Monday, Gavin just decides to resign. I think it was a combination of things. ""It has been a terrible run and hopefully that brings a bit of confidence to the squad. ""It has been a hard week for everybody, but the way the boys trained during the week, the tempo they took into the game. ""I thought in the first half we were excellent. Some of their play was brilliant. ""It is a break from the league for the boys and it's a national cup semi-final so you always want to progress."" Alloa Athletic manager Jim Goodwin: ""We came here to be positive and to take the game to Queen of the South. I thought we done that for large spells of the game. ""They're very lucky to have Stephen Dobie, who's a top player. ""He's the type of player who could easily be playing in the Premiership. ""I'm proud of the players. We didn't just come down here and look to hang on. Overall, there's a lot to be positive about.""",human,2.409090909090909,3.3333333333333335,2.707692307692308,2.609375,2.8947368421052633,-0.7391027691538478,-0.6985723470860964,-0.6636429174073288,-0.7437608065686427,-0.5551020408163266,0.413641988059059,-0.2694028595458366,0.40803465027086133,-0.35172839506172804,0.3974069666444384,-0.3799999999999999,0.23023691967793186,0.09724137931034481,0.40894680483283025,0.0,0.0,-0.5942857142857144,0.2772894903752947,0.24273216089681618,0.9732826188224264,-0.7678424938474159,-0.17434928728056015,-0.4129411764705883,0.007138869611095231,-0.27745454545454523,-0.10341039483890542,-0.3999999999999999,0.42058030815965,0.23125000000000015,0.8790990862423472,0.07828990076973014,0.21182892672126816,-0.15749999999999995,0.529181342787633,0.1415384615384615,0.0617475242520068,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515511,-0.13206349206349208,-0.18156281213213124,0.04,0.19595917942265428,0.0,0.0,1.8181818181818181,2.727272727272727,0.04014158252046239,0.8226964871911617,0.5651570096147475,0.8566195619920738,-0.8642525811175314,-0.7586702088474329

It has a carbon fiber shell that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to be assembled quickly and easily. (LUNARK habitat for lunar surface) The habitat was designed and built by SAGA Space Architects; it was unveiled last month at the Space Tech Expo in Bremen, Germany. The habitat uses a carbon fiber material that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to be assembled quickly and easily. It has a compact shape and a maximum internal diameter of 6.8 meters (22.3 feet), and it is designed to be able to house a crew of up to four people for up to 30 days, according to the company. The habitat is designed to provide protection from temperature extremes, which can range from -200 degrees Celsius 328 degrees Fahrenheit) at night to 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) during the lunar day. The habitat is also designed to withstand the impacts of micrometeoroids and cosmic radiation, according to the company. Lunar dust is also a hazard, so the habitat was designed to collect lunar dust in a non-contact way, according to the company. SAGA's team said that the habitat's design would allow astronauts to easily attach or detach the habitat, depending on the mission's needs. Fans of lunar science fiction (as well as science) might be reminded of the lunar observatory from Robert Heinlein's 1941 short story Solution Unsatisfactory: The housing of the observatory was a flattened sphere, fifty feet in diameter and fifty feet high, resting on three legs, its top and bottom plates five feet thick. It was made of armor plate and its ports, heavily baffled, gave the appearance of gun emplacements...

A mob later killed 10 Muslims in retaliation, though they were unconnected with the earlier incident. Sectarian clashes spread across the state, with houses of both Buddhists and Muslims being burnt down.

The company started as an audio app called Radium where people could communicate with each other through voice messages. These were later merged into one place known as SoundCloud . The idea behind this merger was that both teams would be able to expand their user base. SoundCloud originally had just been created so that musicians can upload new music material but it soon became popular amongst many different communities including DJs who used this service to share mixes and podcasts featuring news, politics or sports commentary from around the world.

The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and a lieutenant, Jefferson Garcia. Two of the rebels were killed and eight seized after the incident in Valencia. Venezuela has seen four months of violent anti-government protests, and almost 130 people have died in clashes. Just before the barracks attack, a video released on social media showed the uniformed men saying they were rising against the ""murderous tyranny of President Nicolas Maduro."" ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caguaripano was discharged from the army in 2014. They claim he commanded around 20 uniformed men during the attack. He then escaped with Lieutenant Garcia and some stolen weaponry, they say. The 6 August incident raised tensions in the divided country, where critics of President Maduro say he is trying to cement a dictatorship. Mr Maduro insists his actions - which include creating a pro-government assembly with the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution - are the only way to re-establish peace. The US has led a chorus of international alarm against the Maduro government in recent weeks, and has imposed sanctions on several high-ranking Venezuelans - including the president. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had not ruled out ""a possible military option if necessary"" against Venezuela. Gen Padrino dismissed the claim as an act of ""craziness."" He told Venezuela's state television: ""It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States. ""As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela."" The White House said Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with his US counterpart on Friday. It said President Trump would speak to Venezuela's leader ""as soon as democracy is restored in that country.""",human,1.9090909090909092,2.5,1.8923076923076922,1.953125,2.473684210526316,0.2538161004816856,0.5836677376846714,-0.015908365741422424,-0.05192806281883458,-0.43537414965986376,-0.12919270056120016,-0.3756097560975608,-0.22822666714207207,-0.3413580246913579,-0.1347229165664859,0.19999999999999996,0.44894629733240593,-0.38275862068965505,-0.1018261536669836,0.0,0.0,-0.5642857142857144,-0.2901655478429771,0.19084065653548277,0.01630423987646636,-0.14766201804758006,0.40166110936699095,-0.45882352941176485,-0.2132621475478894,-0.3754545454545454,-0.03961327542327668,-0.09999999999999987,0.5364736066211659,0.25000000000000017,0.1129823384539734,-0.017527589724566396,0.1732322780836039,-0.26249999999999996,0.8072920871318325,-0.1076923076923077,0.005162577684908836,-0.05230146686899341,0.12198528493627807,0.2412698412698416,0.23694194567894747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6181818181818182,1.4545454545454546,0.04898073325738284,0.8189631646353294,-0.007487336430508416,0.24514654696209487,-0.3863269791022329,-0.18257927053528006

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Scientists from the University of Southern California were able to visualize memories forming in the brains of genetically modified zebrafish in the lab. The team expected the brains to form a memory by laying down new proteins at the synapses, or connections between neurons. But instead, they found that the fish brains reused proteins from other parts of the brain. When you have a new experience, your brain encodes a memory of it by altering the connections between neurons. This requires turning certain genes on in those neurons. Many of these genes make proteins that alter the junctions between neurons, called synapses. In the study, the team trained zebrafish to fear a particular stimulus. They expected the fish to form a memory of the fear by increasing production of proteins at synapses. But instead, they saw that the fish brains reused proteins from other parts of the brain and transported them to the synapses. The team also found that this process is regulated by the BDNF gene, which has been linked to autism and Alzheimer's. These findings suggest that scientists may be able to identify the brain cells that store memories by looking for cells that carry this BDNF gene.",llama_65B,0.7575757575757576,1.0,0.8,0.84375,0.2631578947368421,0.026396874450094674,-0.03546905301003289,-0.07876564031269291,0.15175455129141113,-0.3562152133580703,-0.36608994791575084,-0.2354920100925145,-0.3593042609760239,-0.19051627384960704,-0.3836514323002822,-0.5909090909090909,-0.6314277587573787,-0.3009404388714733,0.02597139685024984,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,-0.24656570731472618,-0.707611423109093,-0.42840375013821475,0.0715937057200388,-0.7722532411536022,0.17379679144385013,-0.21361378770191497,-1.081818181818182,0.256246912781456,-0.2909090909090909,0.4939263403503357,0.8380681818181817,-0.4294800392995061,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.11931818181818186,-0.005485929904305682,-0.06993006993007006,-0.019326265913119763,0.19018715225088517,0.037900860604460546,-0.7041847041847039,-0.7521390071150768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.10909090909090909,1.0,0.9926459457374806,-0.15959289033504798,1.1738094774007217,0.2664901930311919,-0.3611836455495977,-0.20917162956503782

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Scrollex is a library for building beautiful scroll experiences using minimal code. A library of interactive demos is available. Scrollex was developed by Bjarke Ingels and his team at BIG in Copenhagen, Denmark and it's published under the MIT license. It has been used in web projects like this one: where you can find more info about Scrollex on their website. I've also contributed to it, working with Stefan Couple] Stahlberg"" Eriksen (Aurora) as well as Jens Boker Jensen Alter] . We hope that our work will help others make better sites too!:) Introduction {intro} In JavaScript we often need scrollable content which isn't part of an iframe or any other frame element but directly placed into the DOM tree without being hidden. This gives us the ability to use normal scrolling operations such as page up down keys when navigating around text documents and similar. Typically these kinds of elements are pretty plain, displaying what we want in text form. But there might be cases where we have something else, say graphs or charts, which would look much nicer displayed inside some kind of canvas element or even as 3D objects [1]. Ideally such things should behave just like regular text document lines - they shouldn't break line characters nor wrap within multiple lines (as happens currently). When skimming through them quickly we'd expect typical navigation behavior (page up down), but when slowing browsing we'd simply read the whole thing until we hit the bottom or top edge before jumping back to the start. And since it'll probably not fit into memory anyway usually two views per window will suffice. Ideally the user interface would consist only of spacebars, arrows and so forth. A very simple example could be found here[2]: body ... div id""chart""...div body We need all sorts of functionality from the browser itself though. For instance, the user needs to know whether they're actually reading the data now according to the time stamps or already caught up with how far ahead the dataset covers. The most important feature however is definitely allowing users to navigate between different chunks of information dynamically. So pages linked via anchors won't cut it anymore; they require knowing full URLs instead of relative paths. In fact, the end goal here should resemble the real world quite closely: open a file having hundreds of thousands of records filled with data points over 100 years ago, skim it as needed and jump to the next bit whenever your interest wanes. Several times a day. Or maybe you decide to dive right into it. Whatever floats your boat. You don't really care how long you spend looking at each chunk; you just want to move along. Scrolling isn't time critical, yet people may get impatient when waiting while images load etc. Hence we ought to give the impression of continuous smoothness regardless of loading speed. Some browsers do exactly that nowadays thanks to Web Workers, but this still requires knowledge of URL syntax. If possible the amount of hassle involved should ideally remain fairly low. Especially due to the fact that the current implementation doesn't allow for internal links easily. Unfortunately, many modern websites are built using dynamic solutions such as jQuery UI tabs or AJAX calls among others. These may offer nice visual effects including animation, modals, dropdowns and gallery viewings, which might enhance user experience significantly. However, here we aim for pure HTML5 and CSS3 support since those can hardly be faked correctly. That said, we'd never intend to replace entire libraries like jQuery UI for the sake of fine tuning a few remaining quirks. There are several ways of achieving all this. One promising approach I've seen proposed lately is Canvas 2D drawing using SVG fonts. But unfortunately neither Chrome nor Firefox supports those properly. So let's try another path first. We'd make use of the CSS 'overflow' property. The main idea behind overflow:scroll is that we can add a background image underneath the content area and then define transparent areas above and below the content ourselves. Those represent parts of ""screen,"" i.e., of actual physical pixels on the screen that cannot be accessed unless scrolling occurs. Once we have done that, we can set whatever backgrounds and borders we wish. As mentioned earlier, after doing that the following behaviour emerges naturally: moving between bits becomes easy because the boundaries appear seamlessly jagged and hence no flickering occurs. Furthermore, we avoid problems related to repainting the same region repeatedly, especially noticeable on mobile devices where resources would otherwise be wasted unnecessarily.

Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 percent to a new record low of 0.25 percent in an effort to stimulate the economy in the wake of Brexit uncertainty. The MPC's decision to keep the rate unchanged this month indicates that they believe the current level is still appropriate for the current economic conditions. However, the MPC has signaled that it may cut rates further if the economy weakens significantly in the coming months.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Bitcoin mining uses a huge amount of electricity. A mining setup requires a building, hundreds of high-speed computer servers, a heavy-duty cooling system, and a location that can handle a lot of heat. The facility needs to be near cheap energy sources like hydroelectric dams or coal plants - and often it's in areas with notoriously unstable power grids. As you might imagine from the conditions required by all this hardware, Bitcoin miners have also become big users of heavy equipment like excavators, forklifts, and trucks. Despite having similar requirements to bitcoin mining, using advanced machines is not for everyone. Thus, some operators are offering their services on cloud platforms where anyone can use them without purchasing expensive equipment and installations. These platforms function similarly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) but instead of renting out computing resources in data centers owned by others, one rents them in virtual private clouds established within specific companies. According to Bloomberg's investigation, many major Chinese mining pools rent their hashing capacity to foreign customers through these private facilities. The bitcoins used to pay the network fee must come from transaction fees included in the block. This is either especially useful or especially useless to the miner: if there are less transactions than the maximum number allowed by the block's size, the leftover bitcoins are simply wasted.[2] If there are more transactions, they may be included into an additional block. In this case, some of the payments made to the miner will appear to originate from higher value transfers, making it possible for the miner to claim larger rewards by including these in his blocks.",opt_30b,1.2878787878787878,1.1666666666666667,1.1846153846153846,1.25,1.2105263157894737,0.7030392630132236,0.42976354414050294,0.8015589032978552,0.4889747983811848,0.2312925170068026,0.2832481513002052,0.10793383795906909,0.21291964756206064,0.1728395061728398,0.3203843304976688,1.0,0.33577889086422846,0.14224137931034483,0.6517494255801094,0.0,0.0,0.8571428571428571,0.5296530868790934,-0.7683659392346212,-0.34384800182777964,0.139458572600492,0.22256764171759336,0.3823529411764707,0.5759952860518031,-0.21212121212121196,-0.04829984150835551,0.1333333333333333,0.7790682453957568,0.23437500000000022,0.8466032969649729,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.06249999999999994,0.6501179974730937,0.3076923076923076,0.2393756274825937,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,0.13756613756613786,0.23683161852125678,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.2763853991962833,1.3818181818181818,1.0909090909090908,-0.19224322404917019,0.6579013950284601,-0.09096843322639313,-0.7423459257096908,0.6230394503441347,0.4430157005142929

In an interview, President Edgar Lungu urged African leaders not to rely solely on donor support but instead look for other ways of financing development such as tapping into their countries' natural resources.",opt_30b,0.09848484848484848,-0.16666666666666666,0.12307692307692308,0.171875,-0.15789473684210525,0.019017489534616006,-0.16863882628934226,0.15193316957439856,-0.12732046419178122,1.0136054421768705,1.4682959647578033,1.0361648444070648,1.4771233015628964,1.1882716049382716,1.235730043080217,1.25,1.020907778398795,2.7672413793103448,1.5153261415880894,0.0,0.0,1.2142857142857142,1.4803494199940512,0.8041038898966966,-0.10219366051334018,0.02461033634126324,0.26627949124222383,2.86764705882353,0.32745516269055147,-1.1454545454545455,0.05965562876269062,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,-0.5468749999999999,0.11115967914527367,1.2999629045720116,1.0606601717798212,0.9374999999999999,2.117205485280136,-0.15384615384615388,0.3659636666791874,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.603174603174603,0.34341844075402445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.509090909090909,-0.2727272727272727,-0.6785958270716539,0.5168783321366158,-0.8143863596454834,-0.5067811941425951,0.854696277006893,0.6828895911335058

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"StyleGAN2 is a style-based GAN architecture for data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. It improves on image quality, and it also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is real or generated. StyleGAN2 is a powerful, large-scale generative model of images. To make it possible to produce high quality samples, it has a large latent space that contains the relevant image variation information. Unlike StyleGAN1, which produced images of a single style, StyleGAN2 generates samples from a normal distribution over the latent space, which lets it produce images with multiple styles. The StyleGAN2 architecture can be divided into three parts: the generator, the discriminator, and the style encoder. The generator is a mapping network that maps the latent code Z to a generated image. The style encoder is a mapping network that maps the generated image to a style code. The discriminator maps the real and generated images to the probability that they are real. Each component has a few different architectural modifications to improve the quality of the generated samples. The generator uses a single mapping network to generate the image. The mapping network uses a multi-scale architecture to handle the image variation across different spatial scales. The generator and discriminator both use a windowed discrimination mechanism to reduce the computational cost. Each image is processed in non-overlapping windows, and the discriminator is only allowed to use information from the current window. The discriminator has a novel multi-scale architecture that uses a set of progressively smaller networks. The smaller networks make it possible to compute deeper architectures, which improves the discriminator's performance. The discriminator uses a novel sub-pixel discrimination mechanism that can use information from sub-pixel regions of the image. The sub-pixel discrimination mechanism lets the discriminator use information from small objects and thin structures in the image. The generator uses a style encoder to extract style information from the generated image. The style encoder is then used to compute an objective function that can be used to train the generator using the style encoder loss. The style encoder loss allows the StyleGAN2 architecture to produce high quality samples with a relatively small dataset. The style encoder loss also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is real or generated. StyleGAN2 uses a set of small networks to perform the sub-pixel discrimination. Each small network uses a set of kernels that are repeated in a grid pattern to allow it to extract information from sub-pixel regions of the image. The style encoder loss is a style-based loss that is used to train the generator. It is based on the latent code, Z, and the style code, C. The style code is the output of the style encoder that maps the image to a style code. The style code is used as an input to the generator. This means that the generator can produce images of different styles. The style encoder loss is used to compute an objective function that can be minimized using gradient descent. The generator architecture is a mapping network that maps a latent code Z to a generated image. The mapping network uses a multi-scale architecture to handle image variation across different spatial scales. Each network in the multi-scale architecture uses a progressive upsampling mechanism. This mechanism is used to upsample the input image to the desired size. The image is upsampled by a factor of two with a set of upsampled convolutions. Each upsampled convolution is followed by a regular convolution. The windowed discrimination mechanism divides the image into non-overlapping windows, and only allows the discriminator to use information from the current window. This reduces the computational cost, and it makes it possible to use a deeper architecture. The discriminator architecture is a multi-scale architecture that uses a set of progressively smaller networks to extract image variation information across different spatial scales. Each network in the multi-scale architecture uses a progressive downsampling mechanism to downsample the input image. The image is downsampled by a factor of two with a set of downsampled convolutions. Each downsampled convolution is followed by a regular convolution. The sub-pixel discrimination mechanism uses a set of small networks to extract information from sub-pixel regions of the image. Each small network is constructed using a set of kernels that are repeated in a grid pattern. The kernels are repeated in a grid pattern because the image is downsampled by a factor of two between each network in the multi-scale architecture. The number of times the kernels are repeated is equal to the number of times the image is downsampled.

They say the tiles are from an ancient Jewish sacrificial altar, most likely dating back thousands or even tens of thousands of years ago By Robert Fisk In Jerusalem 19 July 2000 A few days ago I went with a small group of British Christians on one of our regular visits to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in order to see how we could best pray for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The great majority of our party came from Britain's Christian churches, but there were also Anglican priests who had come from New Zealand, Poland and America; a retired Irish bishop and his wife; and two former members of my staff at Independent Television News (ITN), David Amess, now living in Ireland, and Paul Hollingdale, still in London. We walked around the churchyard where so many have died over the centuries, trying to imagine what it might have been like when this place was not simply home to three separate religions - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - but to all those who came here seeking something deeper than life itself. It is difficult to capture that sense of spiritual presence here into words.... In every language spoken by the followers of each religion, which includes Hebrew among them, God is called Yahweh, Elohim or Adonai. After being captured by the Romans during their conquest of Palestine in 70 AD, and after serving more than 500 years as a monument to Roman power, these places became holy sites for the various sons of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Today they stand side by side yet they occupy different worlds: Christianity sees its future in the rebirth of Israel, while Zionism holds out the prospect of establishing another state based on Palestinian land; Sunni Arabs want recognition of their own distinct identity, while Shiites believe theirs is joined only in a common faith with the last ruler of the Prophet Mohammed's tribe, through whom Allah has appointed himself representative head of humanity in the 21st century. For Christians and Jews alike there can be no compromise with the modern Arab world because it denies the validity of Jesus Christ. Muslims too refuse any surrender to Israeli demands for concessions regarding the right of return of millions of refugees who fled eastwards across Jordan to take refuge within West Bank boundaries before 1967 and again since then. Even if such negotiations did lead eventually to some form of mutual agreement, would that satisfy anyone? No! Neither the Orthodox nor the Catholics have ever accepted territorial compromises made under pressure either towards Spain in 1492 or France in 1904, both by treaty with Muslim rulers. But neither will Arab nationalism allow the establishment of a new Jewish state, even though European Jewry has never questioned, perhaps cannot question, the legitimacy of the claim of the Zionists to their homeland. Nor does Europe accept the principle of self determination for nations without regard to religious differences. Therefore in practical terms it remains impossible to offer Israel anything other than limited economic agreements for the development of certain industries and technology, similarly restricted in scope, leaving open for dispute issues concerning water rights, air space and fishing grounds. For instance, if the United States and Japan offered Qatar unlimited financial aid and as much access to US military bases as Saudi Arabia receives, would anyone deny those countries complete sovereignty over that tiny country? Above all, however, it is clear to me that this conflict transcends geographical divisions, ethnicities and sectarianism and goes far beyond political considerations about borders and territory. This war exists within us all, and it is part of the reason why I returned once again to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher just weeks after participating in the meeting of representatives from a number of religious faiths held outside Bethlehem in May. The atmosphere inside the building was very strange indeed. The first time I visited the Church, two years previously, it had looked strangely empty to me, even though crowds stood waiting to enter and films were being shown in the large lecture theatre erected near one end. There were hundreds of people present today. Many carried photographs of loved ones killed in the recent fighting along the border, others clutched pictures of relatives left behind in Gaza and Lebanon. These families arrived early in the morning to make sure that their names appeared alongside those of 1,000 pilgrims already commemorating the lives lost along the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait. They waited five hours before entering, listened to prayers broadcast live from loudspeakers up above the entrance tunnel, lined up again to climb down the stairs leading directly onto the main sanctuary floor, and finally filed slowly past rows upon rows of crosses bearing identical inscriptions ""Here lies Adam"" or ""Here rests Mary."" Some of those making similar journeys were weeping openly; others prayed silently, heads bowed beneath the weight of grief and loss. One elderly man paused often throughout the day to sit alone and weep quietly for all he had seen: children dead, men beaten by soldiers, women forced to carry ridiculous packages full of the American portion.

Researchers found that firearms and related items were sold on Facebook Marketplace - a platform to buy and sell goods with more than 300m active monthly users worldwide (pdf) - for as little as 1 each. In one case cited by Gun Violence Archive researchers, an item was listed online under ""car parts"" but contained three AK-47s shipped from California, Florida and Texas; another listing had two rifles labeled as speaker cables: an AR-15 assault rifle and SKS semi-automatic hunting rifle packed together inside what appeared to be plain cardboard boxes. Others included pistols hidden within books of matches, and handguns shrunk down into bottles of shampoo. In addition to these listings, other sellers offered gun training services via social media platforms such as Instagram Live, where they would charge anywhere between 50-100 per session depending which firearm type is being trained upon. Instagram has not responded to requests for comment about this service or whether it plans to take any action against those offering similar classes on its platform. The sale of illegal weapons also extends beyond private sales through sites like Craigslist, Armslist and Letgo, the study went on to show. One seller advertises his wares under the title ""guns,"" while others use terms including ""firearms."" Some even include phrases meaning shooting accessories when describing their offerings, yet investigators say there's no way of knowing if these products are truly legal because none of the posts provided details regarding whether the guns have been registered, transferred properly or licensed. Under US law, only certain professionals can legally make and advertise purchases or transfers of new long arms - and among rules surrounding registration requirements, every weapon must include information identifying the buyer so he or she will eventually get traced back should something go wrong. But buyers who purchase off illicit websites don't know whether their prospective dealer got all proper licensing documents required before making any deal - nor do authorities. Tracker systems used nationally across America to track stolen and lost property aren't able to identify pieces adapted into illegal uses without first having serial numbers filed off. Even then, smugglers simply file paperwork indicating ownership using fake names at pawn shops owned by friends and family members. A spokesperson for US Customs Border Protection told Motherboard it did pursue cases involving small caliber machine guns imported illegally, adding that CBP investigates most complaints received concerning suspected violations relating to imports arriving in the country. He declined however to provide further specifics saying records were confidential.",opt_30b,2.553030303030303,1.6666666666666667,2.2,2.21875,1.9473684210526316,1.1428500695220383,0.22368446106839113,0.8265773538249126,0.26390937436993794,1.133786848072562,0.9804037747191857,0.7080459770114941,0.7482088775430729,0.695679012345679,0.8865725707701506,0.7666666666666666,0.5668257850770247,1.1172413793103446,0.9862137593509627,0.0,0.0,1.4285714285714284,0.9666568289538354,-0.24158854647562966,0.3265393243706071,1.9885151763740765,1.8913498256996044,0.7392156862745101,0.6369295201074751,-0.07212121212121213,0.9055946053655544,1.5999999999999999,2.2226796509858446,-0.28124999999999983,0.2021784774892571,0.14216822776592786,0.48455907061931147,0.06249999999999994,0.9783380759930077,0.1538461538461537,0.25984881141512617,0.732220536165908,0.8204870080131013,0.4486772486772487,0.6616066208703965,0.06666666666666667,0.24944382578492946,0.0,0.0,3.4363636363636365,2.909090909090909,-0.6165104980574787,1.1803497614843121,0.036981950872002865,-1.1417653433674693,1.348915315013702,1.146069309020192

The piano is an exquisite example of Regency-era craftsmanship, featuring elaborate gilt mounts and intricate marquetry work. It is also notable for having a range of over seven octaves, which was quite unusual for pianos of that era.

Labour said it was a ""cynical"" attempt to distract voters, the Liberal Democrats questioned where the funds would come from, and Mebyon Kernow said it did not believe the Tory's promise. Recent planning rows have left the future of the stadium in question. In March, Cornwall councillors deferred a decision to grant permission to build a supermarket that would have paid for the facility, which supporters claimed had put the plans in jeopardy. Revised proposals for the stadium at West Langarth are expected to be submitted to the council in May. Mr Cameron said he planned to get the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to work with Sport England, Cornwall Council and local sports teams to find a way to get it built. ""The stadium proposal is an exciting one. If it takes some extra money I'd make that money available,"" he added. However, Stuart Roden, Labour candidate for Truro and Falmouth, said: ""This announcement today is a cynical empty promise and will come to nothing. ""It is simply more smoke and mirrors and people won't be taken for fools by this unfunded distraction."" Simon Rix, who is standing for the Lib Dems in the constituency, told BBC News: ""I'm massively in favour of a stadium in the right place if we can get the money. ""But it's like the Conservative promises on the NHS, they're not saying where the money's going to come from.""

Chemicals used to make plastic soft and flexible, like phthalates, are endocrine disruptors that cause men to produce less testosterone. Most phthalate ingestion is through food, and a lot of chemicals are absorbed through the skin. Processed foods have a high risk of containing phthalates. A lot of chemicals are put into personal care products specifically to increase skin absorption.

According to a report on CBS Money Watch: ""Tonight's screenings will cost between 1,000-2,500 each. But they don't have to be back-to-back; attendees can choose how often they want to tune into one of these exclusive events from now until Jan. 31 or order an all-access pass for life, starting at just 25K (that includes free access to existing VIP Movie Nights)."" The company says it has close ties with some Hollywood studios.The first screening event attracted 400 people who paid as much as 10,000 each ""for a front row seat"" according to one attendee. This was reportedly followed by another that included 300 people.""It's like having your own personal movie theatre,"" said Brent Hartman, 43, a real estate investor and frequent client of Red Carpet Events.Hartman told Fox News he would not give his name because he fears being blacklisted among other wealthy clients if his identity were known. He attended several earlier soirees where everyone wore masks but complained about guests missing out on Oscars coverage due to security reasons.Attendees had to RSVP through Facebook and then send permission slips via fax before the screening began. Each invitation also contained instructions on what hotel guests could expect when attending stays at a private residence in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Westwood Blvd which include five nights' accommodation, three meals daily, roundtrip transportation between Los Angeles and New York City, chauffeur services, nightly theme parties and two tickets to Saturday night's Academy Awards ceremony.A source tells us many people who are interested in going to the Oscar party have already purchased flights to California. They believe this year's show may be better than last years.'We strive to make every guest feel special,' a spokesperson explained, adding 'These film premieres aren't open to everyone...they're reserved for select groups whose memberships range from multi-millionaires to billionaires and super-rich individuals'.""The same source adds, 'There are no additional fees associated with our membership program - we simply ask that you share the costs across the board'.Some fans wondered why only those able to afford hefty sums should have access to such high profile films. One viewer tweeted, 'Why do I need 20 grand to see my favorite movies?...I never asked for anything!'Another person posted, 'How does someone go broke paying thousands to get invited to yet another celebrity cocktail reception?! Someone needs to tell me what kind of job opportunity gets over 1,200 on average! Am I getting too old?'One man claimed he qualified under the definition of big money, telling one news outlet online,'If you've got a huge bank account (50m) that gives you exactly what you want, it sounds like something worth pursuing', even though it doesn't sound very imaginative.But others commended the concept noting, 'This alone could save anyone hundredsthousands in rental car charges!'The idea came to him after the Las Vegas shooting and realizing how women might react to danger provided there safer conditions. What happens when she stands her ground against the shooter? He started thinking really hard about what society expects of its elite and decided it wasn't enough to buy them things. Instead, they needed entertainment too.You know what else makes kids happy? Getting dressed up in fancy clothes and hanging around with friends at the mall or whatever while people pretend to care about them. That sort of thing.That's exactly what people love when they host expensive dinner parties the emphasis is always on socializing and showing off and pretending everybody likes you and appreciates you.'We'll find ways to help sponsors sell products, etc.'And that's what this whole thing is - nothing more than selling stuff. It'll still be out of reach for most people.While the idea behind the new initiative seems fine, we wonder whether it's fair for its success to depend entirely upon some people throwing large amounts of cash around. If it turns out that there's actually no way to book seats for anyone except the uber-wealthy, we hope the organizers pause both to reflect and perhaps rethink their approach:""They say they screen best flicks during award season. We question if any of those films deserve to be seen without public support since they took tens of millions of dollars to produce!""",gpt_j,4.712121212121212,5.0,4.984615384615385,5.0,6.368421052631579,-0.021795842423635258,-0.2950174928165974,-0.21196562008490552,-0.060410525090204725,-0.023323615160349767,1.1625204058014242,0.16282590412111006,0.9925222406655575,0.147530864197531,1.0713015739365788,0.10000000000000009,0.5696972740733299,0.3886699507389162,0.8188207028796992,0.0,0.0,-0.01632653061224484,1.0245041215796975,-0.3449222781042592,0.5935207081385132,0.6890894175553732,1.4153462628579385,-0.09831932773109245,0.5732994541875328,-0.44545454545454544,0.20553350170207213,-0.17142857142857149,0.9719435149148639,-0.513392857142857,0.18423785197016296,0.2562366688305666,0.6339337175849,0.2625,1.1928597562449064,1.1648351648351645,1.4380901479562784,0.5977310499313534,0.6742624605558184,-0.05079365079365061,1.0237847770565123,0.02857142857142857,0.1665986255670086,0.08571428571428572,0.36811710647786067,5.090909090909091,4.363636363636363,-0.4487510591816585,1.503630047918479,-0.0036789578843189944,0.2425972919823004,-0.17778628805092508,-0.14903888581668273
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"But Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says the process to close such schools is ""inadequate."" Where there is such ""illegal activity,"" he says, the ""full force of the law"" should be used to shut them down. Many of the unregistered schools are faith schools teaching a narrow range of beliefs. And what is the government doing about it? As for the Government, it says it will not tolerate any school that is operating illegally and has commissioned Ofsted to investigate further and report back. More than 800 places in unregistered schools in England have been identified by Ofsted in the past two years, Sir Michael said. If the Government is investigating, why is it not closing these schools down? Why is it not using the ""full force of the law""? It is a curious situation. The majority of unregistered schools are faith schools. Now, faith schools are allowed to operate in the UK - as long as they are registered. According to the BBC, the government won't tolerate unregistered schools, but it will tolerate registered faith schools - the difference being, of course, that they are registered. This is a legal technicality. In my view, all faith schools should be illegal, but they are not, because they are registered. When we ask for a secular education system, we are often accused of being hostile to religion. This is not true. We are hostile to faith schools - which are legally religious schools. In my view, all faith schools should be illegal, because they are religious. Faith schools are anathema to a secular education system, which should provide good quality secular education for all, free from the indoctrination of religion. Instead, our children are being indoctrinated with religious beliefs. In the case of these unregistered schools, children are being indoctrinated with religious beliefs that are illegal, because they are unregistered. In the case of registered schools, children are being indoctrinated with religious beliefs that are illegal, but the government allows them to continue, because they are registered. We don't need this confusion. The law should be clear. I think it is an outrage that any children are being indoctrinated with any religious beliefs in any school that receives government funding. What we should be doing is closing down all faith schools, whether they are registered or not. A secular education system should be providing good quality secular education for all.",llama_65B,2.234848484848485,3.6666666666666665,2.723076923076923,2.734375,2.6842105263157894,0.15306074717654994,0.7071938711503954,0.41205521880354157,1.0552287058444045,-0.8395061728395061,0.08878681997729239,-0.4317353518362768,0.16998709598579517,-0.4393004115226337,0.1531022987255473,0.0185185185185186,0.2968769989202861,-0.42720306513409956,0.3216297140880585,0.0,0.0,-0.746031746031746,0.03782377387438714,-0.7552620239918602,-0.42423399420062385,-0.6708595387840671,0.5095283192146194,-0.8355119825708062,-0.05403814272183533,1.1101010101010105,0.32562263747547426,-0.6074074074074074,0.10027932001232097,-0.4340277777777776,-0.2429030941743449,-0.4078951435902191,-0.12971327750502298,-0.2152777777777778,0.18275927026804742,0.32478632478632474,0.1369986214669866,0.23245096386219297,0.13941366159721097,-0.08465608465608436,0.38330476026961807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23636363636363636,1.3636363636363635,1.1437176515364988,0.36696081306874556,0.6413884613920506,0.04339918524660833,-0.45129185652908665,0.054534071222517126

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Amazon has revealed two new robots at the re:MARS conference that are designed to move products around its warehouses. The Xanthus is an upgrade for Amazon's shelf-bots that will let the machines move more efficiently through warehouses. The Pegasus, meanwhile, is a new bot that can move a stack of pods, each of which holds a pallet, around a warehouse. Xanthus is a specialized, upgraded version of the Kiva robots Amazon has been using in its warehouses for years. The Xanthus is 80 percent more efficient than the Kiva, moving 50 percent faster and 30 percent further. It's also more accurate, able to grab shelves with precision that should mean fewer products get damaged. Both robots use machine learning to navigate Amazon's warehouses and track the locations of products. ""With the Xanthus and Pegasus robots, we've been able to take advantage of the design flexibility of wheels, combined with sophisticated vison and navigation capabilities, to deliver a robust goods-to-person picking solution for our operations,"" said Brad Porter, vice president and distinguished engineer for Amazon Robotics. ""We are excited about the benefits these systems will bring to our employees and our customers."" Amazon will also be showing off new Scout robots, designed to deliver packages to customers' homes. Scout is a six-wheeled robot that can make its way up to a customer's front door. It can be accompanied by a human handler, or it can follow a programmed map.

The fall out was due to the Cuban Revolution, which saw Fidel Castro take control of the country and turn it into a socialist state. The US responded by imposing an economic embargo on Cuba, which is still in place today. Since then, diplomatic relations between the two countries have been strained, but in recent years they have improved. In 2014, the Obama administration re-established diplomatic ties with Cuba and eased some of the travel restrictions that had been in place for over 50 years.",text-davinci-003,0.06818181818181818,0.0,0.26153846153846155,0.28125,-0.05263157894736842,-0.44165553875865227,0.013887731471175039,-0.245578078669877,0.09180125994667329,0.13605442176870747,-0.5129118792811463,0.7771236333052985,-0.343089607448124,0.7993827160493827,-0.33366094050823225,0.30000000000000004,-0.779956864811853,0.8172413793103447,0.5978380344950075,0.0,0.0,-0.3714285714285716,-0.589832999107693,-0.021442770397245223,-0.2443000016491006,-0.21657095980311744,-0.8699671612702987,0.8411764705882355,0.023697856628563243,0.6745454545454548,-0.13077714446991304,0.40000000000000013,-0.31752566442654906,0.53125,0.0,0.9406473152183993,0.7066016017953874,-0.9374999999999999,-1.324846381066645,0.030769230769230656,-0.19919178799558393,0.41841173495194733,0.46951989924425286,-0.025396825396825307,-0.7424211666352172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.2727272727272727,0.058820036412416316,-0.13243872330402548,0.39744781570468013,0.20502029208197728,-0.07212067295219854,0.2706184096775875

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Metrobus admits public subsidies might now have to be used to entice firms on board. The first of the new bus routes are due to be completed in the next few months. David Redgewell, from passenger group Bus Users UK, said the lack of a current operator was a worry. ""We need to be realistic about what the bus industry can deliver in hard times,"" he said. ""The buses have to make money, so there's really going to have to be realism amongst the public authorities that unless they are prepared to put public subsidy in then they [buses] need to be commercial."" In March 2015, Bristol City Council was required to spend more than PS1m removing protestors from Stapleton allotments, part of the new Metrobus route. Former secretary of Stapleton Allotments Association, Jane Ghosh, said she was ""absolutely shocked but not the least bit surprised."" ""It's cost PS200 million plus, it's a lot more than that because of the delays. They only have PS34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,"" she said. ""We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us."" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were ""actively negotiating"" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: ""We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat at. Yet England have just managed it - because their fielders were brilliant all day. Not only did they keep wickets like confetti when India's top four batsmen lasted less than ten overs each between them, but also kept three catches out of five before tea on an absolutely gorgeous morning at Old Trafford. It was glorious cricket from start to finish for Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer and Liam Plunkett as well as full resistance by Jos Buttler. And that includes those two drinks breaks, which are making me hungry already! They even had James Anderson weedy enough to help Sam Curran through his first over with a fine catch off MS Dhoni at slip. But he wasn't necessary after that. So once again I repeat my plea: don't take your eyes off these guys during this World Cup until someone else has won it. Here's why... 1) The man who started things rolling properly After being dropped due to fitness issues earlier in the summer, Ben Stokes returned to form so spectacularly against Sri Lanka last week it almost felt like he'd never been gone. If there was ever an obvious selection call about whom should open alongside Joe Root or indeed score a century then it came here. When they did eventually go in together, it turned into the breakthrough partnership of the tournament. They added 110 runs in 44 balls and looked every inch deserving of their status as leading men in English cricket. Not bad for a 40-year old moustachioed veteran who hasn't scored 300 runs since 2016. But wait, what if you combine Stokes' opening stand with the second half of Root and Cook? Well then this would look something really special. In fact it does. For starters, it means a team comprising of no fewer than seven players averaging 30 across 10 innings is now 29 above average (and counting up). Secondly, it means England haven't lost a single match since they took the urn nearly 18 months ago despite batting through most days without anyone quite hitting 100, apart perhaps from Ian Bell (who doesn't count because he didn't play). Thirdly, it suggests under 900 people are currently celebrating victories in front rooms across our country. Fourthly, it makes us not want to burst Barry Cryer's balloon right now. Fifthly, it means whoever wins the toss will probably win the game too. Sixthly, it might mean England can actually become top dog in 2020 rather than 2019. Seventhly, it's great news for Adam Lyth. Eighthly, it reminds everyone how good pace bowling looks at night. Ninthly, somebody needs to polish up this laptop keyboard very soon. Tenthly and finally, the best bit of all time. Eleventhly. Woah. Alright matey. Calm down. We're still in contention. You've done nothing wrong. Relax. Take a breath. Stop smiling like some deranged idiot at your phone screen. Just calm down. Let that sink in. OK cool. Now say it out loud. ""I'm enjoying watching England beat Australia."" Yes, yes, good. That feels better. 2) This guy made sure a few other bloopers went missing OK, he isn't in charge of umpiring obviously but Mohammed Shami shoulders much blame for allowing Dawid Malan to carry on playing while fielding back at square leg instead of sending him back to the pavilion straightaway. After the decision goes against his bowlers, the Indians come back equally riled, offering little clue otherwise but plenty of verbal fisticuffs afterwards. Then along comes Adil Rashid or Tom Curran delivering a dig to one of the Indian fielders to make things worse. He could have picked either bowler to send after Malan. Either way it was poor judgement. When Matt Prior failed to apply pressure to a dead ball, it meant Jasprit Bumrah got rid of loose change and struck a blow for freedom not available elsewhere in international cricket. Fourteen minutes later another unplayable delivery ended India's hopes of taking 20 wickets - leaving both sides heading into lunch having taken 23 apiece. All this despite the generous set piece fielding, especially from Zakrul Islam who gleefully celebrated getting run out by plucking stray stumps left lying around outside India's crease. Even though he hadn't needed to step outside the boundary line, he'd clearly enjoyed himself immensely judging by his grin. At least England weren't involved in the same controversy. Perhaps Pakistan are still paying reparations. The strictest of punishments In the previous Ashes series South Africa refused to appeal a penalty awarded to David Warner for a non-striking visual obscenity directed towards Ravindra Jadeja.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This article features an interview with Tony Fadell. Fadell was instrumental in the development of the iPod and iPhone at Apple. He co-founded Nest Labs, which was sold to Google for 3Billion 5 years ago. He is also a top advisorboard member of Lyft, General Electric's new venture capital fund GE Ventures and SpaceX (referral link). It appears that he now has his hands full as Chairman and CEO of The Nest company. I interviewed him about some interesting projects which are on their way or have been deployed already. Tony: Hi, this is Tony Fadell from Apple, it's good to talk to you! Also known by the nickname ""TinyFad."" Thanks so much for taking time out from your busy schedule - let me know how we can help! Timothy: Thank you very much. Let's start off with your journey... You started working at Apple right after graduating college but later left as CTO (Chief Technology Officer) to found Nest. What were your experiences prior? And why did you decide not to stay longer at Apple? TinyFad: One of my first jobs when one year into college, was making funny signs with cut paper and Scotch tape - thinking they would be great business cards. A couple months later though, Steve Jobs walked through the door and hired me onto the team where I worked up until May 2003. That job turned my life upside down; I had no idea what I wanted to do with my career yet I ended up staying there almost 4 years, becoming part of the culture that created two amazing devices: the original Macintosh and the Mac Cube. In fact, all those things happened because Steve asked me to build the iMac. When I realized just how well constructed it truly was, Steve thought it shouldn't be made of wood anymore but instead use plastic - something I'd never built before. So I went to work doing just that. My boss called me back to tell me ""we want to make every product better than anyone else"" and being told ""you need to leave,"" was probably the biggest lesson in my professional life. But I learned more than anything else while being there: if you're passionate enough and believe in yourself, success will come - even if it takes 20 tries.. and sometimes 40:) Some people call me TinyFad, others say TinoFada. Others call me Timmy. All names suit me fine. If someone asks me what my name means, I'm happy to answer them - I don't care who calls me that anyhow. As long as they love me. For example, after recently getting married Callie gave me her wedding gift: she named our son Zane a few days after our honeymoon trip to Italy. She gave both iPhones away to friends during the marriage. After 3 years, she finally decided to give mine to me again, saying 'now I feel like I am giving you the phone'. It makes me smile. On the other hand - I remember meeting Robert Scoble once and having two conversations going over whether I should call myself Mr.Scoble or Mr.. WellScoblesomething. Two different personalities here, but same ideas. Everyone has a title, many titles. The important thing is to understand who the real person really is, and then tailor what you present accordingly. YMMV. Anyway, I digress.... If you could go back and change one decision in your career path life, what would it be? Why? TF: I wish I had stayed another year or 2 at Apple. While building the iMac, I became close friends with Phil Schiller and Don Mansfield, helping facilitate some of the early Apple events and public appearances. Don asked me to run marketing together during the launch of iTunes music store. At the end of 2001, Steve announced he was leaving. We talked about what needed to happen next, and agreed that everyone should try to figure out what we individually felt best suited us moving forward without Steve around. Nobody knew the future except maybe Scott Cook, yet sure enough, less than 6 weeks later, Jeff Bezos came walking through the doors. Jeff couldn't walk 10 feet without stopping to hug all of us, telling us what a great place it was. Personally speaking, that moment changed everything. Now that I think about it, it may well have been the most powerful day in tech history since IBM throwing its weight behind UNIX. Since then, the power began to shift rapidly from hardware to software. Hardware companies lost market share dramatically across multiple device categories. Before Jeff took control, the entire group was focused purely on selling 3rd party products through our computers. With adoption rates growing exponentially, it wasn't just that the PC industry was dying, but rather that Apple itself stood alone among its peers poised to revolutionize the world entirely via software. Today, the team continues to break ground, constantly striving to innovate in whatever we are calling hope to get- udeutazooking); ; };",gpt_j,5.4393939393939394,8.333333333333334,6.1692307692307695,6.203125,6.7894736842105265,-0.5987743149586706,-0.47723830865236233,-0.5584097532483149,-0.3001001669356515,-0.8064316635745207,0.5981212093484999,-0.4756938603868796,0.8399632646288816,-0.4780583613916946,0.8195393011056697,-0.8090909090909091,-0.0636542338249616,1.06269592476489,1.6505843762094998,0.01818181818181818,0.133608531424537,-1.0103896103896104,0.09863697886890771,-0.3044873396408825,0.0524309116318737,-0.15392646729808357,1.0346717643542245,-0.8411764705882355,-0.19407565290734252,-0.6745454545454547,0.36975216869196903,-0.2909090909090909,0.4939263403503357,-0.9346590909090909,-0.023881793535028364,-0.14818780403497087,0.06531526868758626,-0.2556818181818182,0.7472917096241883,1.004195804195804,1.4545166525550441,0.24724329792615074,0.30402505385598655,-0.20317460317460284,0.14574171263603142,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.18719327529067276,4.290909090909091,5.181818181818182,-0.18493704546386588,1.376109296053248,0.32132449364620985,0.8706123976534196,-0.9999508573048247,-0.9582466557455904

There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but there are thousands more that are predicted to exist based on theoretical models. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), which is currently under construction at Michigan State University, aims to produce these rare and exotic isotopes using an advanced particle accelerator. FRIB will use a technique called fragmentation to create new isotopes. In this process, a high-energy beam of particles is fired at a target, shattering it into hundreds of pieces. Among these pieces will be some rare isotopes that have never been observed before. The rare isotopes will be separated from the rest of the debris using sophisticated equipment and then studied by researchers to better understand the properties of matter. FRIB is expected to be operational in 2022 and will be a valuable resource for researchers studying a wide range of topics, from nuclear physics to the origins of the universe.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.5378787878787878,0.5,0.5538461538461539,0.640625,0.15789473684210525,0.3646441833430844,0.6472944977498013,0.495164113076866,0.5999365805060268,0.0782312925170067,0.0006888008399279739,0.1295206055508831,0.049767651396191215,0.28086419753086433,0.08091518877171164,0.25,0.25863094160059563,0.14224137931034483,0.33215360024550217,0.0,0.0,-0.07142857142857155,0.043542169899236025,-0.021442770397245223,0.733811500199735,0.11074651353568489,-0.09338904323890186,0.573529411764706,0.5579787421260134,0.7795454545454548,0.8647304621896577,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,0.39062500000000006,0.591621245649419,-0.1971853844013725,-0.07105075911806477,0.18749999999999997,-0.17749575895105157,-0.2692307692307693,0.41800131722120343,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.26984126984126966,0.3141612623717166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727272727272726,1.0,0.44385399832666467,-0.07742741560478232,0.9976701939091311,-0.4127444774146162,0.3209954791489881,0.14073436542305576

This was despite revenue increasing more than five fold to almost PS80m. The club's annual report says support from Malaysian investors ""will continue"" as long as ""the business develops as planned."" The financial figures showed that the club's broadcasting and commercial income rose from from PS8m to more than PS70m. Wages and salaries went up from just over PS27m to PS46m. During their time in the Premier League Cardiff sacked Malky Mackay and replaced him with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The club said they paid just over PS2m on ""exceptional costs"" relating to the change of football and senior management. The accounts show the club received loans of around PS130m - mainly from Tan, but also including a loan of PS7.5m from Torman Finance, understood to be chairman Mehmet Dalman's company. The report adds: ""Following relegation from the Barclays Premier League the owners are aware that they needed to again invest in strengthening the playing squad, but that they needed to spend wisely. ""Whilst long term funding is not guaranteed, the Malaysian investors have indicated that providing the business develops as planned, they will continue to support the company in the foreseeable future and provide additional finances in order that it can settle its liabilities."" Tan has previously said he will convert the club's debt into equity. Keith Morgan, a chartered accountant who sits on the board of Cardiff City Supporters Trust, told BBC Radio Wales Sport: ""The club is highly insolvent. ""It has far more liabilities than assets and at any point in time it could be called upon to repay that debt owed to Vincent Tan.""",human,1.4090909090909092,1.1666666666666667,1.353846153846154,1.46875,1.5789473684210527,-0.09738491873959317,-0.12134107450274008,-0.16072424965466947,-0.03662985036700478,0.41269841269841234,0.3371801179784257,0.34538828146902173,0.2049789597310013,0.47530864197530875,0.2834373239263738,0.0,0.2472958162592782,0.6422413793103446,-0.0012942904405075105,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,0.218868864580834,0.6861686527118478,1.041075893260278,0.8285479901558652,1.0690619752605675,0.5098039215686274,0.6154647567669994,-0.32878787878787885,0.46238203880040213,0.1333333333333333,0.3924920908537563,0.39062500000000006,0.22874387440923064,-0.29699527033293144,-0.1350453783688633,0.4374999999999999,0.686807778479583,0.0,-0.022204891945572656,0.9152756702073848,1.0229454993663536,0.4338624338624339,0.7468787160640756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9818181818181818,2.0,0.12153816366757968,0.4576789508697787,0.8045908902284913,0.015692698672752494,0.1960935356766847,0.21758960735294103

Australia - the world's top-ranked Test side - lost 10 wickets for 86 runs in an extraordinary collapse to be skittled for 161 chasing 268 at the Gabba. The Aussies crashed to 8136 at stumps on Day 3. The 18-year-old Labuschagne's inclusion comes after Queensland teammate Matt Renshaw was sent to play for Australia A to get some much needed runs after a lean run in the last Sheffield Shield season. The tourists' spinners kept things tight on a relatively flat Gabba pitch, with Mehedi Hasan (3-58) picking up the key wickets of opener Cameron Bancroft (20) and vice-captain David Warner (44). The final session was one of the finest of the year, with the hosts losing four wickets for 27 runs in the space of 30 deliveries. After losing his wicket in a similar manner, he said: ""I think I should have gone after him, because he had bowled a lot of deliveries to me outside off, so I could have hit him over the top for a boundary."" Mahmudullah took four catches, three off his own bowling, as Australia collapsed to 25-3, 4-68 and 7-94. While Australia will be looking for the services of Steve O'Keefe in the second Test, Bangladesh will not have the services of Tamim Iqbal, who has gone back to his country due to the demise of his uncle. ""I think it was a world record of no runs for 150 balls,"" he said. But he was rewarded when Lyon gloved a catch to Soumya Sarkar at short leg. The highlight of the final session was Lyon's wild celebration after a stumping and caught behind, before the wicket was overturned by DRS. Mominul Haque (37) and Mahmudullah (19) then managed to eke out some runs before Taijul Islam (13) and Shafiul Islam (2) will resume on day four in what is still a competitive game. In the final over of the day, Mehidy Hasan also took the wicket of Mushfiqur Rahim, who had made 68, and left the hosts needing 86 to win.",llama_65B,1.8106060606060606,1.5,2.076923076923077,2.0625,2.6842105263157894,-0.8586820799580036,-0.3833418765149869,-0.9143218341054367,-0.7666687092216184,0.46452866861030123,0.5103840355986902,0.7956265769554246,0.9602620927998174,0.7438271604938275,1.134696564472899,0.0,0.23423884083430546,0.0886699507389163,0.10410266189713502,0.0,0.0,-0.010204081632653024,0.1119650036360645,0.4839939603949642,0.6444415950858716,0.09844134536505326,0.29623117315106107,1.2016806722689075,0.6549707008462841,0.1545454545454547,0.9231728954142856,-0.19999999999999996,0.4025691046001044,0.8928571428571428,0.5600749118778126,2.4121302049522395,1.8987664959860824,0.13392857142857142,1.008554071284783,0.3076923076923076,1.631172806734754,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,1.3333333333333333,1.3263452153871362,0.2857142857142857,0.7953949089757173,0.0,0.0,1.2727272727272727,1.4545454545454546,0.21524101365674483,0.685730953834489,0.15786325297601242,0.6471069386394387,-0.20935737386810127,-0.43902908514392236

The South Africans will be stationed at the West African Peacekeeping Training Centre, which is run by the Ghanaian military. Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama told the South African delegation that his country was ready to do all it could to support the agency in its efforts to ensure peace and security in Africa. ""Ghana is committed to this agency and what it is doing,"" Mahama said. He added that the country was proud to host the AU's efforts to ensure peace and security on the continent. Mahama also commended South Africa for its leadership role in the African continent. Graaff said the agency was working to ensure peace and security in Africa and needed the support of countries like Ghana. He added that it was important to have the agency headquartered in the continent to make sure it was really African. ""We need to ensure that Africa is the driver of its own security,"" he said. The agency's primary mandate is to enhance peace and security on the continent and provide early warning on conflict and other issues. It will also facilitate and coordinate the planning and conduct of peace support operations, and provide assistance to member states in building capacity for their national security.

She urged people to ""imagine the price"" if there was a Conservative government in Wales as well. ""Labour changes peoples' lives when we are in government,"" Ms Griffith added. She reinforced the message of First Minister Carwyn Jones, who told delegates on Saturday that the assembly election in May would be a straight fight between Labour and the Conservatives. ""Together we are fighting for Wales in Westminster and taking on the Tories' appalling treatment of our nation,"" Ms Griffith said. ""We need to tell families up and down the country about what our Welsh Labour government is delivering. ""Investment in Wales, versus cuts from Westminster - jobs for our young people, not leaving a generation behind. ""That's the difference that a Labour government makes. Labour policies promised then delivered because we are in government. ""So don't listen to those who say we should be happy just shouting from the sidelines, that principled opposition is better than political power. ""If we take that attitude we may as well shut up shop."" Ms Griffith pointed to Labour's establishment of the NHS, introduction of the minimum wage, and delivering devolution with the creation of the National Assembly. Meanwhile Mr Jones has said income tax rates in Wales would stay the same as those in England under a Labour Welsh government. He told the Sunday Supplement programme on BBC Radio Wales he would not use new powers to increase income taxes if Labour won the assembly election. ""People have a real squeeze on their personal finances and the last thing I want to do is add to that pressure,"" he said, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has proposed an increase of 1p in the pound for taxpayers in Scotland.",human,1.5075757575757576,1.6666666666666667,1.5538461538461539,1.609375,1.7894736842105263,-0.012393695876364413,0.4711764180018359,-0.03334038913737607,0.07014047775314264,-0.11791383219954653,0.32498796313237444,-0.017269414073451016,0.3238288932937333,0.02160493827160509,0.4314131985553934,-0.5666666666666667,0.16052374965174263,0.017241379310344803,0.26099581597611804,0.0,0.0,-0.25714285714285734,-0.1371198823167515,0.5131969715074028,0.575294158446385,-0.12469237079573436,0.07188033463439764,0.22941176470588226,0.45569090750846425,-0.16545454545454547,0.3502551894805664,-0.5333333333333333,-0.0907979853542322,-0.03124999999999989,0.6419689579935629,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.06249999999999994,0.2551251217651463,0.523076923076923,-0.07413695876556473,0.20920586747597372,0.039269794049678335,0.3894179894179896,0.15764336857134506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.018181818181818,1.0,0.21145370444608413,0.5301171968835519,-0.05399580060669599,0.12738171741692905,-0.14652886624811037,0.016482883619395917

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Apple Glasses could have the ability to transform any surface into a virtual touch interface, according to a patent that the company filed back in 2016. The patent describes using a combination of cameras, projectors, and motion sensors to interact with objects on flat surfaces. The patent calls for ""projecting images onto a nearby surface and then using the cameras to track when you interact with the projections,"" according to Engadget. It is unclear when this technology will be incorporated into Apple's product line, but the company is expected to release its first AR headset in 2020. MacRumors reports that Apple has filed a patent application for a new haptic feedback system that provides users with haptic feedback without the need for the Taptic Engine. Instead, the patent suggests using an electromechanical polymer to provide haptic feedback to users. This is a technology that Apple has previously experimented with, but it's possible that the company is looking to create a more efficient system that could be used to provide haptic feedback in Apple Glasses, or even a device like the Apple Watch. Apple is rumored to be working on a new AR headset that will be released in 2020, according to Bloomberg. The device will have a ""box-shaped"" body that houses the computing and battery, with the headset connecting to a pair of Apple's AR glasses. Apple is said to be developing a new chip specifically for the headset, which is expected to run the company's own custom operating system. Apple's AR headset will reportedly be built for heavy-duty applications, including mapping, virtual meetings, and 360-degree video. Apple Glasses has been rumored to be in development for a long time now, but Apple could actually be working on two versions of the device. According to sources who spoke with Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple could be working on an augmented reality headset and a mixed reality headset. The mixed reality headset would include a transparent display that would overlay objects and information on the real world. The augmented reality headset would be closer to the style of Google Glass, displaying information on a normal display. Kuo's sources say that Apple could release the mixed reality headset in 2020, while the augmented reality headset could launch in 2023. Apple Glasses could be equipped with an array of sensors to monitor the body's movements and health, according to a patent filing from the company. The patent describes a ""sensor system"" that could be used in a head-mounted device, like AR glasses. The system would be able to monitor the body's movements, including the angle of the user's neck, which would help determine the user's gaze direction. The system could also monitor the user's heart rate and blood pressure, as well as how the user is breathing. Apple Glasses could be equipped with a slew of sensors to track the movements of the user, including an accelerometer, a light sensor, a barometer, a magnetometer, a proximity sensor, and a gyroscope. These sensors would be able to track the position of the device in the user's environment, as well as track movements like shaking and gesturing.

It is designed to be built over several phases beginning in 2024 The first phase includes: Once complete the area would feature 3 million square feet (279,000 sq m) of commercial space; 10 acres (4 ha) of public parks with waterfront views; 14 hectares (33 acres) of new affordable housing units alongside market-rate apartments and condos; 542,000 square feet (50,100 sq m) of office space including co-working areas and flexible work spaces; 4,500 homes; 18 acres (7.2 ha) of open green spaces, sports fields and beaches; 100 megawatts of electricity from solar panels or wind turbines; 1.5 billion litres (350 million gallons 854.6 acre feet) of water storage capacity that can provide more than half of daily municipal drinking water demand during dry weather periods such as summer drought conditions Once complete the entire district will include 12 million square feet (1.16 million sq m) of residential space, 2.9 million square feet (281,600 sq m) of retail stores, restaurants and cultural venues, plus up to five million square feet (465 000 sq m) of manufacturing and industrial facilities located at the Port Lands' former coal dock complex - now known as Quayside More than six miles (10 km) long, it will run east along Queens Quay, south through Clive York Boulevard and past Bathurst Street into Lake Ontario near Cherry Beach The plans are also said to include 'a network of self-driving vehicles for residents who do not own one,' although there was no indication if this included robotic pedestrians Advertisement While Sidewalk says most of Canada's innovation happens outside major cities like Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa, 75 per cent of all jobs today require workers to live within 30 minutes by car - just 6 of Canadians currently meet these requirements. Mayor John Tory told reporters last week he hoped the partnership could help solve congestion issues plaguing his downtown core amid an influx of people moving back to the city post pandemic. ""We need to make sure we have good planning so that wherever possible we're getting rid of single occupancy vehicles except where they absolutely don't belong,"" Mr Tory explained. ""And whatever happens around them, whether you've got buildings going up or light rail systems coming down.""",opt_30b,2.090909090909091,0.0,1.3846153846153846,1.609375,3.1578947368421053,0.47559016842029384,0.10718128594597891,0.29294900299143717,0.1463408882683722,7.401360544217686,17.47424490350243,4.559125315391086,9.995236304030618,5.20679012345679,12.41423847461026,6.699999999999999,14.221017531437449,2.6172413793103444,4.7299476176775865,0.0,0.0,7.857142857142856,23.786756132921557,2.52595835279549,4.25233251473502,4.193601312551271,7.967322981095739,5.276470588235295,13.423807278312074,2.0745454545454547,3.0480132645642914,4.0,8.962636722725215,0.9062499999999999,3.6418751438514843,7.887415376054901,14.318912319027588,2.0624999999999996,5.584706990112313,2.246153846153846,1.1132893616848127,2.3012645422357108,2.0971045062542837,7.974603174603175,17.201668350213286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.2545454545454544,1.3636363636363635,-0.6463350381534727,1.3643555568469776,-0.5240312717132719,-3.302574436820535,5.97100917186701,5.370973173268591

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The England skipper hit a run-a-ball 92 at Headingley, with James Taylor and Ben Stokes both scoring 41. David Willey had earlier reduced Australia to 30-3 with the new ball before they recovered to post 299-7. Glenn Maxwell, who was dropped on 6 and 35, top-scored with 85 off 64 balls. The Australia all-rounder also took two stunning catches but his efforts were not enough to prevent England overhauling a score of 300 or more for only the fourth time in their one-day international history. Their previous best ODI run-chase against Australia was 270-4 at Lord's in 1997. It was England's second successive victory, after they also won at Old Trafford on Tuesday, and means the hosts can still send Australia home defeated across all formats after they won the Ashes 3-2 and the solitary Twenty20 international by five runs. Morgan anchored England's run-chase perfectly with his eighth score of 50 or more in his last nine innings. Jason Roy and Taylor had shared a first-wicket partnership of 72 off 53 balls but England's progress stalled when both were dismissed in quick succession. Morgan, however, slowly rebuilt the innings as he took 40 balls to score his first 20 runs before slowly accelerating. He hit John Hastings for a straight six which landed on the roof of the adjacent rugby stadium as he thumped eight fours and two maximums before being caught at backward point by Maxwell's stunning one-handed catch. Although Morgan appeared disappointed not to have finished the job, his brilliant innings took England to 238-5 with more than 10 overs remaining. Some big hitting from Liam Plunkett and Willey, plus a steady hand from Moeen Ali, saw England home with 10 balls to spare. Morgan is the highest scorer in the series but only just ahead of Taylor, who followed up his century at Old Trafford with a counter-attacking 41 off 42 balls. He hit eight boundaries in his innings - compared to just five in his career-best 101 in Manchester earlier this week - and displayed a different side to his game before chasing a ball down the leg side and being acrobatically caught by Matthew Wade. Taking on the fast bowlers, he was particularly strong through the off side as he cut and drove impressively to seize the early initiative back from Australia following the early loss of Alex Hales for a two-ball duck. Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Taylor has now done enough to justify selection on the tour of the UAE to play Pakistan next month. ""I think they've got to take him,"" said Vaughan. ""Taylor plays spin differently to many England players, using his feet well. ""He hasn't faced brilliant spin in this series, but he's played it in a good fashion, and he's looked good against the quick bowlers. He's read situations well, and that's what he'd have to do at five in Test cricket."" Willey, who will play for Yorkshire next season after deciding to leave Northants this summer, was superb with the new ball in the absence of the injured Chris Woakes and the rested Steven Finn. The left-armer started by swinging the white ball into the right-handers' pads - dismissing Joe Burns (played on) and Steve Smith (lbw) cheaply - before occasionally running it across the batsmen. That created doubt in the minds of Australia's batsmen and Aaron Finch was the next to go when he edged behind to Jonny Bairstow. Willey and Moeen were the pick of the England bowlers, with Australia failing to score a run off 50 of the latter's deliveries. However, the hosts' familiar problems at the back end of an innings resurfaced, with Australia smashing 77 off the last six overs. Both Willey and his fellow opening bowler Mark Wood bowled too full, allowing Wade and Hastings to get under the ball and plunder enough boundaries to take Australia from 215-7 in the 42nd over to 299-7 when their innings closed. It was not just Willey who impressed at Headingley, with another honorary Yorkshireman dazzling the crowd with some fantastic cricket. Maxwell, who is nicknamed The Big Show and has played for Yorkshire as an overseas player this summer, displayed some fantastic reverse-sweeps with the bat as well as also launching Adil Rashid for two huge sixes. However, he saved his show-stopping best for the end of England's run chase when he produced an incredible boundary catch to end Plunkett's entertaining late cameo. He caught the ball with both feet off the ground but, aware he was going to step over the rope, flicked the ball up with his right hand and then caught it in his left as he re-entered the playing area in front of the Western Terrace. His athletic best could not deny England though, and it is Morgan's side who have the momentum heading back to Old Trafford on Sunday.",human,5.265151515151516,4.333333333333333,5.769230769230769,5.53125,5.421052631578948,-0.42796480774719303,-0.4712431730762113,-0.6408996676386528,-0.43790608804681586,0.6592056177309631,0.6584685458816072,0.9442469953064379,0.7863510776401951,0.7826563122262048,0.7915211046712969,0.725806451612903,0.8067700520106691,1.0494994438264735,0.8504532151266126,0.0,0.0,-0.18894009216589883,0.2291425543650408,0.6329075778541742,0.20752834198561812,0.5525417449522346,0.3628682747020091,0.6783681214421254,0.5087250090179288,-0.44545454545454544,0.021467009625503002,0.735483870967742,1.0237741923470742,0.5493951612903227,1.2560967696870626,1.3579170318871103,0.9898258566008966,0.7076612903225804,0.6205079018905697,0.7394540942928038,0.5767004937043119,0.08435720462740876,0.11135251015134755,0.3932411674347161,0.29074362685119,0.22580645161290322,0.5512260480850019,0.0,0.0,3.2181818181818183,3.1818181818181817,0.17357870870376108,1.3296728106524265,-0.013710208074839744,0.32866314318409096,0.10594823319023272,-0.048901425599660875

The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides further evidence that lifestyle changes can lead to improved brain health. The participants in the study were split into two groups. The first group was assigned to walk around a track for 40 minutes, three times a week, while the second group was instructed to stretch and perform balance exercises. At the end of the trial, MRI results showed that the hippocampus of those who had walked had grown by 2, compared to no growth in the stretching group. Researchers believe that physical exercise may be able to combat age-related decline in the hippocampus, which is associated with memory loss and dementia. The findings suggest that moderate aerobic exercise can improve cognitive function in humans and may even help protect against age-related diseases.",text-davinci-003,0.4166666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.35384615384615387,0.375,0.2631578947368421,0.41276502190161485,0.24549781932745268,0.2251014014984694,0.20889656664551493,0.182701652089407,-0.13509770603815047,0.03700588730025218,-0.1412759884857712,0.05864197530864199,-0.034277641389120594,-0.0714285714285714,0.06471213495878794,-0.7684729064039408,-0.5130665538502055,0.0,0.0,0.8163265306122446,-0.2894733556140556,-0.6279668473478963,-0.16456159146696317,0.5906480721903199,0.17517096179151573,0.3823529411764707,0.0857043596640187,0.3545454545454546,0.12030358632345362,-0.34285714285714286,-0.016283797864606545,0.8258928571428573,0.7389535799583414,0.35889826578874157,0.21197740306817955,-0.29464285714285715,0.6052729188109565,-0.5494505494505495,-0.22279872375724744,0.5977310499313534,-0.028078089686660528,0.25396825396825423,-0.31348220918894465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38181818181818183,0.2727272727272727,0.1277669112158905,0.22955261167885918,-0.07974535459612984,-0.22241963944001955,0.24337237626363872,0.5371197613990355

This is an important step in the development of more efficient fusion reactors, which are seen as a potential source of clean energy in the future.",text-davinci-003,-0.03787878787878788,0.0,-0.09230769230769231,-0.09375,-0.3684210526315789,0.49320475946230824,0.5697105333915128,0.5207859770674718,0.45890041838095635,-0.24489795918367352,-0.4066773645988552,-0.4144659377628258,-0.20531748468716562,-0.4450617283950617,-0.06240488571437188,0.10000000000000009,0.46338016856618264,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,-0.14936341578728946,-0.49318371913664055,-0.3567763537533803,0.19688269073010653,0.020323480964836868,-0.3823529411764707,0.8195101912755034,-0.7254545454545454,-0.13077714446991304,0.0,-0.03207660596625444,0.3437500000000002,0.23272425390639442,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.8624999999999998,0.6580021181568497,0.030769230769230656,-0.6124073628011353,-0.20920586747597364,-0.10202770740515511,-1.092063492063492,-0.8411094512354583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.16363636363636364,-0.09090909090909091,0.3063694964164569,-0.35307444228594326,-0.013710208074839744,-0.29970467815004975,0.08158100593128097,0.19471231960872307

Locals say they are being forced out by high rents, housing shortages, and an invasion of tourists. ""We are living a period of mass exodus,"" said Davide Busato, head of campaign group We Want Venice. ""In the last 10 years, 30,000 Venetians have moved out of the city. ""We want to give a voice to all the Venetians who don't agree with what's happening to the city but don't express it because they're afraid of the consequences."" Venetians say their city is being ruined by the huge numbers of visitors - about 30 million a year. ""The message we want to send is that the Venetian population, which has fallen by 30,000 over the last 10 years, matters,"" said Busato. ""We want to make our voice heard by the institutions, the politicians and the citizens. It's not just a protest. We're doing this to draw attention to the fact that we have no more housing and jobs and that the city's infrastructure cannot support so many tourists."" The rally was timed to coincide with the anniversary of the death of the last Doge, or ruler, of the Venetian Republic, Ludovico Manin, 220 years ago. The city-state lost its independence to Napoleon in 1797. The organisers called on Venetians to hang the flags of the former republic from their windows. ""We want to remember the history of the Venetian Republic and the illustrious men and women who have animated the life of the city, and we want to do it in a non-violent and non-confrontational way,"" Busato said. The tourism industry is a vital part of the local economy but residents complain that large cruise ships endanger the city's architectural treasures. The government has banned new hotels from opening in the city centre this year in an attempt to tackle the problem. Other anti-tourism protests have taken place in European cities including Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca, where activists have slashed the tyres of rental bikes and buses used for tour groups.",llama_65B,1.871212121212121,2.0,2.1538461538461537,2.09375,2.4210526315789473,-0.5818020931502408,-0.04657479441951225,-0.5768746126107447,-0.21557535029315822,-0.05282112845138084,0.35099323926733156,0.27427892940187004,0.6757509690402276,0.18936092955700798,0.565809210345174,0.2058823529411764,1.2909164475737067,-0.7180527383367138,-0.45787495595133326,0.0,0.0,0.21848739495798317,0.16205971055041438,-0.4099353164179237,-0.13873296894173123,-0.00579066737441488,0.2740722103595127,-0.15743944636678214,-0.2244520159718281,0.048663101604278274,0.3178904183597509,0.44705882352941173,1.722118212493509,0.928308823529412,0.9500219906911268,0.06701725482922466,0.2926739482061612,0.5624999999999999,1.2457331798063351,0.2262443438914027,0.5936248907053387,0.03076556874646678,0.16693587219456635,0.24649859943977623,0.47641799623825304,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.23529411764705882,1.509090909090909,1.2727272727272727,0.19060494748451537,0.8762425982193247,-0.029278911022046782,0.5711929243617712,-0.4171291639804885,-0.14221692439390773

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A group of startups is using end-to-end learning to teach self-driving cars how to drive. Despite investors sinking more than 100 billion into self-driving car technology, driverless tech is still in a phase of experimentation. Investors are beginning to doubt the value of self-driving car technology. The failure of Uber and Lyft's initial public offerings (IPOs) has created a sense of doubt about the future of the self-driving car market. I don't believe that self-driving cars are dead, but I do believe that the way in which they're being developed is flawed. That's why I've decided to highlight a handful of startups that are using a different approach. The main difference between the startups I've mentioned and the big players in the self-driving car market is that the startups I've mentioned are using a technique known as end-to-end learning. End-to-end learning is a process that helps a self-driving car learn how to drive by teaching it how to interpret data captured by a camera. The first step to end-to-end learning is to teach a self-driving car how to process the data captured by a camera. The next step is to teach a self-driving car how to interpret the data captured by a camera. This process allows a self-driving car to learn how to drive by recognizing the difference between objects such as a bicycle and a car, and learning how to respond to these objects. The main problem with the approach taken by most self-driving car companies is that they use techniques such as machine learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive. Most self-driving car companies use machine learning to make driving decisions, such as whether a self-driving car should change lanes or whether a self-driving car should stop. The problem with using machine learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive is that it's too impractical. There are too many different factors involved in driving that need to be taken into account for machine learning to be a viable option. The companies that I've mentioned are using end-to-end learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive. End-to-end learning is a much more practical approach that gives a self-driving car the ability to learn how to drive by recognizing the difference between objects such as a bicycle and a car.",llama_65B,2.371212121212121,2.0,2.523076923076923,2.390625,2.526315789473684,-0.8704314858326758,-0.03341209539426885,-0.5858552090449194,-0.6054044867003986,0.47539015606242463,0.0007277185838964128,0.6399841686043636,0.05940957326146077,0.4791212781408863,0.03522524035876072,-0.2058823529411764,-0.0574968288646664,-0.5415821501014197,-0.1243661861934322,0.0,0.0,1.0504201680672265,0.4628053249358437,-0.881676265157319,-0.6153333006623034,1.3318534961154274,0.45448009967045194,-0.06747404844290668,-0.05188857766972722,0.6251336898395723,0.9147492169378432,-0.3764705882352941,0.31715939431135853,0.9834558823529412,1.2059767405939488,-0.35570696793973083,-0.03119588740528881,1.3566176470588232,0.7311446803225693,-0.09954751131221724,0.3499558078446195,1.322919456098069,0.3350381094443923,0.6125116713352009,-0.038089935220602555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23636363636363636,1.2727272727272727,1.3697877765253825,0.4724397390808126,0.7055964158971613,0.3578942664048781,-0.006278989754748143,-0.2182470985407578
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"While businesses are complaining about the shortage of workers, older job seekers are finding that even with the right qualifications for the job, they are being turned away due to age bias. Companies may fear that older workers will be less productive, cost more in benefits, or be too set in their ways to learn new skills. However, research shows that hiring older workers can actually benefit businesses, as they are typically more reliable and have a wealth of experience from past jobs. To combat age bias, companies should consider implementing an age-diverse recruitment policy. This would mean actively recruiting experienced candidates of all ages and looking for the right fit for any given position, rather than automatically ruling out those who are older. Additionally, businesses should provide opportunities for older employees to receive training and stay current in their field. Finally, employers should make sure to provide equal pay, benefits, and advancement opportunities for all applicants, regardless of age.

""We have to be better,"" says Gordon Strachan Scotland will leave themselves with an almost impossible task if they fail to beat Slovenia in their final World Cup qualifier next month, according to manager Gordon Strachan. The Scots are two points adrift of third-placed Lithuania going into Thursday night's match against Slovakia - who lead the way by three points and host England later that evening. Strachan has been criticised for playing a weakened team as he rested his key players following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Malta but insists SFA chiefs knew why his side were made up mostly of fringe men. ""I didn't surprise them [the board],"" he said. ""If you're asking me whether I had any input it was minimal because we've got to know each other well enough now where there wouldn't need too much between us."" Asked what would happen should Scotland slip up again when they face Slovenia away four days before hosting England at Hampden Park, Strachan added: ""Well it doesn't get easier after tonight does it?

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"A technically advanced indoor vertical farm is growing a range of crops inside the basement of a former sugar factor in Liverpool. Farm Urban was founded in 2014, growing salads and herbs including basil for local restaurants every day it can be open - even during snowstorms when other shops had to close The company's founders were determined not just to grow food but also create jobs locally so they spent millions converting an old factory into what has become the UK's largest indoor vertical farming facility. Farmers use LED lights powered by solar panels on roofs covered with plants that provide artificial sunlight all year round instead of relying solely on natural light from windows like traditional farms do. This means there are long days filled with lots of sunshine - perfect for photosynthesis which enables them to produce more fresh vegetables per square metre than any other method of agriculture. Plants store their energy as sugars through photosynthesis; making these sugars available to us helps our bodies function properly.. Unlike outdoor land based farms where weeds need constant pulling or replanting because over time vegetation creeps across fields, greenhouse farmers don't have this problem thanks to fixed shelving units containing raised beds surrounded by strong glass walls allowing you to see each plant at eye level rather than having to bend down low (like me) while getting weighed up by half a tonne bags of salad leaves strapped onto your back. The shelves allow easy access between rows without breaking out the weed whacker or kneeling repeatedly, reducing the effort required significantly compared to conventional ground-based production methods designed around heavy labour intensive conveyer belts moving products along assembly lines. These advantages mean high output levels achievable using less space increasing profits whilst cutting carbon emissions associated with transporting goods miles away from consumers' homes contributing positively towards mitigating climate change. According to statistics released last week, British retailers bought 11 billion worth of seasonal fruit and veg from overseas producing companies shipped halfway round the world despite shortages of supply caused by extreme weather events such as bad crop yields following drought conditions in Spain and Italy coupled with flooding affecting harvests elsewhere around the globe due to global warming bringing higher temperatures and changing monsoons causing unpredictable rainfall patterns. Indoor farms expert James Lovell believes urban greenhouses will play increasingly important role supplying supermarkets here and abroad after Covid crisis ends saying ""I think people now realise how fragile the infrastructure supporting a lot of food grown outside really is."" He adds: "" Producing some basic foods directly under controlled environments could help make sure we have supplies when we most want them.""",opt_30b,2.5984848484848486,1.0,1.6923076923076923,1.796875,0.8947368421052632,1.2933735106712363,0.22253222178084683,0.6303584857135253,0.3703090069111202,2.649350649350649,2.2764705600960657,1.1303616484440706,1.6117013392744384,1.2471941638608304,1.558802344882037,2.954545454545454,1.4916112078521069,2.56269592476489,1.808791554935839,0.0,0.0,3.25974025974026,3.2589938489131014,-0.5789548007256214,-0.2925182566093886,3.517040793496905,2.689321306610188,2.1898395721925135,2.486354798509642,-0.44545454545454544,1.0483916838841545,0.25454545454545463,1.4672587431516089,0.32670454545454536,0.3917461005108123,-0.16996450642003827,0.12364694001636933,0.42613636363636354,2.819429800315022,0.5174825174825174,0.811853141298489,0.9033889731917044,0.7493770352634843,-0.05772005772005744,-0.10785741388706138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.036363636363636,2.4545454545454546,-0.7640523274529278,1.3716283697603486,-0.2733889599355889,-1.6060476869862306,2.4267993694548604,2.1321484520454166

The early beta release may have been a mistake, as it seems to have confirmed the name of the device. In the iOS 13.1 beta, the name of the iPhone 11 was found in the code, specifically in the new ""dark mode"" for the OS.

So what do we know about these biometric passports? The following information has been provided by Her Majesty's Passport Office: They are issued for a maximum validity period of 10 years from date of issue. This can be extended if used abroad or lost. A passport which does have a valid expiry date but was never used would still continue to work until that time unless it had expired before 2010 (these expired passports will be accepted at UK ports). Two year extensions are possible where necessary without specific need to apply for one. There is no additional fee payable on top of your normal payment for an application to renew with HMIPO. Provisions exist to allow payments for visa applications made through cashless channels to take place during the renewal process. Such arrangements may require certain documentation such as previous bank statements etc. A new photo must be taken every five years for those aged 16-18 and once every ten years thereafter. There is also provision for children under 13 to remain within their home country. Wherever they go outside their home country, there are rules about how long they should stay away - usually for two weeks each visit. When coming back into the UK after travelling out, they cannot leave again without applying for a Visitor Visa. These Visas are widely available from post offices throughout Britain (visit ) so you don't need to travel up to London - even just down to Gatwick airport anyone else could make this happen!",gpt_j,1.3484848484848484,1.5,1.7076923076923076,1.703125,0.6842105263157895,-0.04613731514751063,-0.15955933122340835,-0.04803322827072347,0.025818554175156664,-0.1282798833819242,0.27336600181249576,0.3515559293523971,0.5241734846367271,0.3179012345679012,0.4394213399069509,-0.1428571428571428,0.3739852662238584,0.9458128078817735,1.3125903615267307,0.0,0.0,-0.3163265306122451,0.2648457790825357,-0.5268795011894545,-0.2723423508175972,0.09844134536505326,0.4527016661584989,0.1638655462184875,0.261472185627304,0.4545454545454546,1.1506153923833526,-0.48571428571428565,0.35018629650644967,-0.31249999999999994,0.5243126132762219,0.35889826578874157,0.6335392524529697,0.3482142857142856,0.6420403997029437,0.3076923076923076,0.2393756274825937,0.4856564780692247,0.19844341663111784,-0.6349206349206349,-0.22820186600954007,0.07142857142857142,0.25753937681885636,0.07142857142857142,0.25753937681885636,1.5818181818181818,2.090909090909091,-0.362726413511452,0.6609675484545701,0.5086560512386282,0.14445400090277571,-0.16339732692790745,-0.07097229697531432

Mr Smith, who lived in Bishop Auckland with his wife Kezi and three young children, had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour in August last year. Gavin was a popular and well-liked figure amongst colleagues, friends and family and the police force. He had served in the Durham Constabulary for over 11 years, joining as a PCSO before becoming a full-time officer in 2007. During his time with the force Gavin had worked in frontline patrol, neighbourhood policing teams, roads policing, motorway patrol and was part of the TV series Police Interceptors. The Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary, Jo Farrell, paid tribute to Gavin saying: ""He was an outstanding police officer and a much-loved colleague who will be remembered for his commitment, dedication and enthusiasm.""

Its existence has been long hypothesized, but it had not been observed. The mineral was found in a diamond that had been formed when a meteorite hit the Earth. The scientists believe that the diamond formed deep in the Earth and was brought to the surface by a volcanic eruption. Scientists found the new mineral inside this diamond. Image Credit: Alexander Goncharov, Carnegie Institution of Washington The scientists think that the mineral was created because of the high temperatures and pressures in the Earth's mantle. It is possible that the mineral is found on other planets like Venus and Mercury, but not on Mars or the Moon.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header. The visitors had their chances and bossed possession for long periods - they were only let down by some poor finishing at both ends - but it was Oldham who took the lead after 34 minutes. The ball fell invitingly into the path of Clarke near halfway before he calmly telegraphed his shot past goalkeeper Sam Walker. But more good work soon followed as Michael Jacobs hit an unstoppable half volley over, before substitute Craig Bennett even got offside on the follow up. Within two minutes, though, Derby's fortunes changed dramatically when they conceded another goal which appeared to be nothing short of a set piece effort. The ball broke through again, this time straight to Tassie Nomdong, whose cushioned finish produced a shock equaliser. Derby found themselves trailing 1-2 three minutes later when Paul Green headed home from a corner. But there would have been no comeback if centre backs Andrew Taylor and Ben Wilson hadn't failed to clear seconds earlier following a cross from left back James Mulvey. Green missed several other decent scoring opportunities but Derby continued to press forward until the break. After the interval the game became increasingly scrappy but they almost came away empty handed when Lucas Joao clipped the bar with a close range blast that rebounded just inside the area and could not be connected cleanly by Carl Ikeme.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Shijian-21, or SJ-21, is a Chinese satellite designed to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies. It was recently observed pulling a dead satellite out of its normal orbit and into an uncontrolled lunar transfer trajectory. The following report on the event combines data from various sources including official statements, news reports of Weibo users, social network posts and amateur observations collected by members of Space Observation Rumours (SORUS). On October 30th 2018 at 13:29 UTC, China's remote sensing spacecraft SJ-16 lifted off atop a Long March 2D rocket booster while still attached to its launch pad in Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Around one hour later at 14:35 UTC, an anomaly occurred during ascent when the vehicle failed to separate completely from the rocket booster as planned and instead detached in two sections; this then allowed it to fall back down towards earth for around 10 minutes before entering low Earth orbit with lower than expected velocity. Later that same day at 11:39 UTC, Chinese state media confirmed that the vehicle had been successfully recovered after being found through ""received signals"" at 16:28 UTC on 31st October 18. Initial estimates put the reentry time anywhere between 24 hours and three days since liftoff. This observation window would allow it to have landed within range of the South Atlantic Anomaly region where Earth's magnetic field becomes distorted due to solar radiation causing damage to electronic systems. However, subsequent ground based searches failed to find any signs of the spacecraft until early November 7th - almost two weeks later, which raised doubts over whether Beijing could actually recover the craft alive. At the same time, Chinese officials revealed more details about the mission design and payload contents, and began releasing images obtained both pre-launch and post-recovery showing only minor anomalies experienced by their orbital platform. The fact that the lander separated prematurely can be explained by the proximity to the ocean surface, bringing it closer to the maximum possible distance the satellite is capable of travelling without falling back onto the planet below. Another possibility is that the satellite malfunctioned during launch and lost control of itself. Whatever caused it happened too fast for even video footage taken before landing to capture anything useful. Despite all attempts to retrieve it, the vehicle has not yet been found despite extended periods of visibility time windows along with multiple search efforts throughout December 5th. On January 22nd 2019, it was announced that the Shenzhou 9 manned ship will attempt to salvage the satellite if it fails to return home safely first. If successful, they will also carry out experiments on retrieving satellites in similar orbits and conditions and place them in other orbits. Mission Design Jiangwen 1 (CZ) is a 3,700 kg microgravity research satellite developed by the Institute Of Mechanics And Control Engineering of, part of the Academy and Graduate School of Aerospace Science Technology . With a length of 4 m and width of 0.8m, the satellite measures approximately 12m x 20m. According to some reports, it carries dual optical cameras, one of which can take up-looking pictures to monitor interplanetary spaceships passing near earth while another records star fields and cosmic phenomena such as comets, meteoroids etc. Its primary purpose is said to be to shed light on the natural evolution, distribution pattern and life cycle of space dust, which however remains unconfirmed. While much of what we know today comes directly from images captured via parabolic dishes or telescopes mounted on large scientific stations like Jiaotong University's Dark Sky Station and the Mauna Kea Observatory's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Jiangwen 1 may provide new resources for scientists studying these topics. In terms of orbital mechanics, CZ is unique among medium size nano satellites. Unlike most others which use flybys of planets or moons to alter their course and remain stable for longer durations, CZ uses gravity assists from GEO and L1L2 Lagrange points to achieve controlled transfers away from earth while reaching altitudes exceeding 4000km above sea level, making it highly unstable and vulnerable. As long as there are no nearby celestial bodies occupying those specific locations in space, objects launched towards GEO must eventually reach it unless they initiate maneuvers to avoid interception, but once an object gets close enough to pass through the gravitational pull exerted by geostationary satellites, it enters into orbit at L1 L2. These are low energy configurations meaning that each satellite moves very slowly compared to regular ones stationed further away, meaning that CZ cannot escape using either mechanism. That means that it cannot get rid of unwanted perigee and apogee positions relative to earth, unlike smaller nano satellites whose orbits are significantly affected by tidal forces and atmospheric drag. In order to stay within the radius of the Moon, CZ needs to make frequent changes of speed through manoeuvering burns applied to its thrusters every typically less than half an hour to continually keep changing direction to compensate for aerodynamic torques introduced by friction acting upon the vehicles body. To maintain stability under strict fractions of degrees percent of the degree of work performed, it and compositionality analysis shows that percentages are oriented bidir pater Nireterrantine abeng",gpt_j,5.606060606060606,3.6666666666666665,4.6923076923076925,4.9375,3.6842105263157894,0.9735257542919777,0.4462444650824791,0.9565864315505354,0.6711031949112813,1.4028722600151167,1.1236678631500145,0.7963118711646887,0.6550817365702701,0.9146090534979425,1.0030652965144877,1.3148148148148149,1.372037898264649,1.739463601532567,2.1619153650445875,0.0,0.0,1.4126984126984123,1.0543952969084256,0.2581074214483224,1.4851768613209646,1.3198432230425665,1.6488439476459456,1.2320261437908495,1.035405904430512,-0.238047138047138,0.2885927629196001,0.874074074074074,1.7010276631009507,0.15625000000000008,0.974844237604622,0.6123836903768277,1.1756868621972099,0.6180555555555554,1.323028409832291,0.22222222222222215,0.17428372208481901,0.8716911144832237,0.3051069275546077,0.07995296884185797,0.13291911942285697,0.037037037037037035,0.18885257457751053,0.07407407407407407,0.2618914004394621,6.036363636363636,5.636363636363637,-0.4631496930504723,1.6573748529706374,0.136715033124814,-1.3670632458469156,1.6379155824555793,1.4015513576849135

He had previously opposed an assisted dying law, but said his illness has left him ""like a beached whale"" and in constant discomfort. ""My position has changed,"" he wrote to Baroness D'Souza. Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were ""absolutely supportive"" of his decision and that he has ""wrapped up"" his affairs and was ""ready to go"" to ""put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort."" ""I can't do anything but lie here thinking'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,"" he said. He added the doctors and nurses ""do their best for me"" but that it was ""not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that."" He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die."" Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this.

The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was carried out by a team led by Professor Michael J. Fox at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis and is believed to be the first of its kind in humans - with other studies showing similar results for mice. The study involved people aged between 30 and 70 who had never exercised before but were otherwise healthy and willing to try it; all completed four group sessions per week over 12 months on bikes or treadmills.

To mark the occasion, Tim is putting his name to a brand new whisky from Ballantine's, the 30-year-old single malt, limited edition, Ballantine's Space Glass. Tim Peake is the first British astronaut to be sent into space by the European Space Agency (ESA). He is due to spend six months on the ISS as part of the Principia mission - named after Sir Isaac Newton's seminal work on gravity and motion. Ballantine's Space Glass was created in partnership with the Open Space Agency, a collective of scientists, designers, engineers and artists, who develop projects that explore the edges of space. Their latest creation is a glass designed to drink from in zero gravity. To mark this momentous occasion, Tim Peake and Ballantine's have come together to create a limited edition whisky. Ballantine's Space Glass will be taken with Tim to the International Space Station and be launched on his arrival in November. The whisky takes the form of a zero gravity drinking experience, which allows a liquid to fall to the bottom of a glass, rather than float around as it does in space. The concept is inspired by the small droplets of whisky that form in zero gravity and the glass itself was created in collaboration with Scottish whisky experts at Ballantine's. Patrick Schiavone, Ballantine's Global Brand Director, commented: ""We are incredibly excited to be part of this project with Tim and the Open Space Agency. Tim is a genuine inspiration to us all and we are honoured to have a whisky with his name on it and which will be launched into space. The glass itself is a truly innovative design and we hope it will help astronauts to enjoy the Ballantine's 30 year old for many more years to come."" Tim Peake commented: ""The Space Glass has been developed to allow us to take whisky into space, so that we can enjoy it the way it should be. It will be a very special moment and I am delighted that I will be able to share this experience with the team at the Distillery when I return. The Ballantine's Space Glass is out of this world!"" Ballantine's is the world's No. 2 Scotch whisky, with the range selling over 70 million bottles a year worldwide. Ballantine's has won more than 130 trophies and medals at international competitions in the past 10 years for outstanding quality, as a result of its unique richness of character and perfect balance. The range, from Ballantine's Finest to the 30 Year Old, is the most extensive in the world of Scotch and is maintained by the latest in a tradition of Master Blenders that dates back to 1827. Ballantine's is the No. 1 Ultra Scotch whisky in Europe, No. 1 Scotch whisky in Asia Pacific and No. 1 Scotch whisky in the Middle East.",llama_65B,2.946969696969697,2.5,3.292307692307692,3.0625,3.0526315789473686,-0.5096738028622703,0.12932179455910978,-0.41162194763358967,0.0017023532930236108,0.49659863945578203,-0.04701335683417779,0.803027754415475,0.338007354595751,0.5790123456790125,0.43632242746989675,0.25,0.9089936393226516,-0.38275862068965505,-0.1018261536669836,0.0,0.0,0.10000000000000002,0.5082319974023444,0.9692132219554848,0.9928476593510672,-0.4577522559474981,0.04173455254305623,0.6500000000000001,0.8265377246530207,0.8145454545454546,0.7618412756934805,0.30000000000000004,0.38895299881485385,0.8125000000000002,0.45764711790052837,0.5214457943058518,0.491157799500807,1.2374999999999998,0.8072920871318328,0.3076923076923076,0.8074072670688367,-0.13075366717248352,0.21588847572742273,0.1968253968253969,0.4650431253644033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.490909090909091,1.6363636363636365,0.4908059283840567,0.8847279788791537,0.027501064432472862,0.19801770388881398,0.11361326839952705,0.4046319850682762

Some changes may include: 1. Increased bureaucracy: As the company grows, there may be a need for more policies, procedures, and other red tape that can slow down decision-making processes. 2. Changes in corporate culture: The culture that made the startup successful may not be the same as the acquirer's culture, which could lead to clashes and a change in the overall atmosphere. 3. Management reshuffling: With new owners or investors, there could be a change in leadership and management. As a result, some employees may experience layoffs or reduced responsibilities. 4.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to how a particular startup may change. However, it's essential to stay informed and actively communicate with higher-ups to understand any developments that could impact your career.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.7121212121212122,1.0,0.8307692307692308,0.78125,1.105263157894737,0.7324905882629548,1.0045184919136207,0.7647549886996654,0.8453404423090115,-0.4304267161410018,1.3017775827285483,-0.1883936080740116,1.4012867502289739,-0.28479236812570125,1.3801434901923164,0.045454545454545414,0.48447952712640885,-0.573667711598746,-0.04277674702490822,0.0,0.0,0.37662337662337664,1.4525393557493105,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,-0.36691774181519893,1.1038900399809013,-0.4518716577540107,0.9220906461106613,0.31818181818181823,0.530598044994675,0.8,1.1202396425485122,-0.014204545454545442,1.240204616509715,-0.38773153027071233,-0.22541172532175752,-0.2556818181818182,0.7472917096241887,0.0979020979020978,0.2600406992305471,0.047546788062721335,0.24493647783802291,0.023088023088023293,0.8833535768034427,0.0,0.0,0.7272727272727273,0.9620913858416693,0.34545454545454546,0.6363636363636364,0.35029691233477006,0.11594920982972699,0.2235271701683139,-0.4334885087577986,0.0798866782820869,0.33271996629215406

Meanwhile there are plenty who have tried various cleaning products in attempts at removing smudges and streaks from their screens: water (for moisture), soap (to get some of that grime off) and screen wipes (which do help but not entirely). That's where Screen Armor comes into play. It was designed for use specifically on tablets and smartphones - both touch-sensitive display types - so they can be easily wiped clean without fear of messing up your precious device. This product is currently being crowdfunded by Kickstarter where pledges start from 21 (16AU27). Though all prices will vary depending on what country you're ordering from. The key selling point here though? Well firstly its price tag which sits well below most other cleaners we've seen before; even ones dedicated just for smartphone displays like this one! And secondly thanks to an anti-scratch coating applied over silicone rubber cushioning the two main protective layers make sure glass surfaces stay scratch free while plastic remains impact resistant when dropped onto sharp edged objects - such as tables. Plus if things really go wrong then replacement parts are available should any damage occur during normal usage. The only thing missing right now would probably be wireless charging capabilities...but we know those guys don't ever break anyway!!!",opt_30b,1.0909090909090908,1.0,1.1538461538461537,1.140625,1.2105263157894737,0.17614559978783562,-0.40655831272898113,-0.3283582981785529,-0.4353375034621454,0.18800247371675952,1.005496804220043,0.3061396131202691,0.7758863791479645,0.25729517396184054,0.862230578944424,0.40909090909090917,1.9536501118917995,1.8808777429467085,1.8262340067293272,0.09090909090909091,0.2874797872880344,0.6103896103896101,1.7264753104969095,-0.8362680454925644,-0.6746072396319828,0.32217167574017425,0.6921257693710576,0.17379679144385013,0.8605944001171679,0.19090909090909108,0.256246912781456,0.4363636363636365,1.3843051335098937,-0.18465909090909075,1.7185084345207169,-0.16996450642003827,0.12364694001636933,-0.3920454545454545,0.37844063726550303,0.2657342657342657,0.7622035251235846,0.4754678806272129,0.24493647783802291,0.2655122655122655,1.2007243789955657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.018181818181818,1.1818181818181819,-0.7863674090792295,0.9516242657680857,-0.21490575385412963,0.25501927847311534,-0.08021486799798981,-0.15839740499520163

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"In a statement (in French) it said it was ""worried about the continued worsening of the situation."" On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey said it has killed 63 militiamen and destroyed shelters and ammunition depots since the start of the campaign, which it dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch."" Iraqi Kurdish officials said the Turkish campaign was also damaging infrastructure and water facilities in the region. The UN estimates that more than 5,000 people have fled Afrin since the start of the offensive, with many heading towards Aleppo and Idlib. Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Sunday the operation would be completed by May. The U.S. is concerned about the Turkish offensive and the effect it could have on the fight against the Islamic State group. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to ""crush"" the militia, which his country views as a terrorist group. The U.S. has long supported the Kurds in the fight against the Islamic State group, which still holds pockets of territory in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. has no troops in Afrin but does have about 2,000 special forces troops and other U.S. troops stationed in the predominantly Kurdish region further east. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that Turkey's offensive distracts from efforts to defeat Islamic State militants. ""The violence in Afrin disrupts what was a relatively stable area of Syria. It distracts from the international efforts to ensure the defeat of ISIS,"" Mattis said in a statement. He added that the U.S. urged all sides to ""de-escalate tensions"" in Afrin. On Saturday, Turkey's foreign minister said the operation in Afrin would be followed by moves against the town of Manbij and other areas in Syria. Manbij is held by Kurdish-led forces that ousted the Islamic State group in 2016. The U.S. also has hundreds of special forces in the Manbij area. The U.S. and Turkey have been holding talks in Ankara over Manbij. The U.S. has warned Turkey that the operation in Afrin risks harming U.S. relations with its NATO ally. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday that his country is determined to carry out the operation ""until the end."" ""From the start we have said 'We can come any night without warning. We informed the U.S. and Russia. We don't have a problem with the (local) people but we are against the terror organization, Cavusoglu said.",llama_65B,2.265151515151515,3.0,2.246153846153846,2.359375,3.6842105263157894,-0.0026717484261228473,-0.30503825438923204,0.0650828246631346,0.1401412676996549,-0.4696835255841465,-0.3176561659062151,-0.40545580868102526,-0.2584808895551856,-0.33910359634997317,-0.25829589063806024,-0.4565217391304348,0.05416162339009391,-0.4610194902548725,0.20677721819822345,0.0,0.0,-0.6770186335403727,-0.3326226734390983,0.7374448427922169,0.40334999957139595,-0.34240467953062026,-0.2134128521297432,-0.11636828644501264,-0.10413541320121227,-0.38458498023715415,-0.22484233218170357,-0.06956521739130439,0.4693394372234769,0.3192934782608695,0.046255135841937314,-0.2883161498171437,-0.1283030856962818,-0.28532608695652173,0.3916550531563197,-0.1939799331103679,-0.06835156621958241,-0.045479536407820306,0.10732055716561477,-0.1104209799861972,0.18314049788572645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2727272727272727,1.2727272727272727,0.40219046865820174,0.738864747327407,-0.05527536348424469,0.18931539752470491,-0.3653950540693698,-0.43594997036192706

The joint report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering say the technique is safe if firms comply with regulations. Fracking involves the use of high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped natural gas. During the process, water, sand, and chemical additives are injected into the well at a high pressure to fracture the rock. The fractures allow the natural gas to flow out and be collected. The technique has become more popular in recent years as advances in technology have allowed companies to access previously inaccessible reserves of natural gas.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must be changed. The authors say the school, college and university game must be made safer, or the young will abandon it. Head injuries and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a form of brain damage - are associated with rugby. In the paper, in the British Medical Journal, the authors suggest a range of steps to make the sport safer. These include changing the rules to ban dangerous play, abolishing the ""scrum"" where players come together head first, and using synthetic pitches, which reduce the impact of collisions. Sport governing bodies and policy-makers must give a clear commitment to prioritise player safety, and to put their health and welfare before the need for winning. The authors, from the Institute of Health and Society at Queen Mary, say the drive to win needs to be balanced by a focus on safety. They cite the example of the 1966 England captain, Martin Peters, who was concussed and helped off the pitch during a game - only to return to the field of play. Prof Pollock says that was a ""horrendous"" example. She also refers to studies of professional players in Australia, who donated their brains to science after they had died. They were found to have had CTE, a condition usually found in boxers. This is the only way the safety of players can be assured, as changes to rules and practice alone will not be sufficient. There is no suggestion that rugby should be banned completely - that is not what the authors want. They say they want the sport to be played in a safer way, with better equipment and fewer injuries. The BBC contacted the Rugby Football Union, which said the sport was ""in a strong position"" in terms of player safety.",llama_65B,1.6515151515151516,1.8333333333333333,1.7692307692307692,1.796875,1.6842105263157894,-0.5149753082729054,-0.40817432093744815,-0.4686772327961407,-0.43628247432760886,-0.1258503401360545,-0.19835905991783345,0.04857022708158116,-0.10502436238834086,0.054012345679012495,-0.11962170002307641,-0.4375,-0.22515107799382394,-0.2327586206896551,-0.05018964203970027,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428559,0.1963788710805329,-0.13937800758209407,0.29446371983153563,0.06767842493847406,0.34775940757942214,-0.3345588235294118,0.3261754359159844,0.34204545454545465,0.7185132366681437,0.42500000000000004,0.9769566104841299,0.5078125000000001,0.6876887472923455,-0.42175762774738007,-0.27358513705936405,0.09374999999999999,0.21982166684854845,0.07692307692307684,0.20579317813392642,-0.13075366717248352,-0.054856880516334326,0.39682539682539697,0.1655084651264971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0545454545454545,1.6363636363636365,0.29994625579449746,0.5936790726454424,0.46619816848768914,0.5079895521147878,-0.410592186715207,-0.3441572605048963

It is unclear how the contract will be divided between the two companies. Uber and Lyft have been awarded a five-year, 810 million transportation contract by the US government to provide transportation for federal employees and their families. ""We are excited about this opportunity to provide riders a convenient, reliable transportation option when they need to travel on official government business,"" a Lyft spokesperson said. It is unclear how the contract will be divided between the two companies. Lyft did not respond to requests for comment, while Uber did not immediately return a request for comment. The government's move toward providing transportation as a service through the cloud comes after Uber and Lyft earlier this year began to push further into the business travel market. The companies are both now members of the Global Business Travel Association, the trade group for corporate travel managers. The US government's move toward the ride-sharing companies follows a new development in the city of Portland, Oregon, which has paved the way for Uber and Lyft to operate at the city's airport. The Portland City Council voted unanimously to allow the ride-sharing companies to pick up and drop off passengers at Portland International Airport, starting October 1. The vote comes after the companies had been operating in a pilot program at the airport since December. Lyft has already begun operating at the airport, while Uber is expected to start operations shortly. To operate at the airport, both companies had to pay a 3.25 fee for each pickup and drop-off, according to the Portland Bureau of Transportation.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"China has blocked Bing, even though Bing already censors results in China. It's part of a wider crackdown on internet freedoms by the Communist Party, as they've blocked Instagram and WhatsApp as well. It seems the only Western social media company that's doing well in China is LinkedIn, as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram, WhatsApp, Bing, and many others have been blocked. China has blocked access to Bing, the Microsoft-owned search engine, across the country. In a statement to TechCrunch, the company confirmed the blockage, noting that it has been in touch with the Chinese government to understand the blockage. It's unclear why Bing has been blocked. China regularly blocks websites and services that are not in compliance with its strict censorship laws, or that it perceives to be a threat. Bing has been censored in China for years, so the blockage is unlikely to have been triggered by recent events. It's possible that China has opted to block Bing due to its close ties with Microsoft, which the Chinese government has been increasingly suspicious of in recent years. The blockage is a further blow to Microsoft, which recently saw its LinkedIn service become inaccessible to users in Russia. The service was blocked by the Russian government, which decided to ban LinkedIn because it failed to comply with a 2014 law that requires internet companies to store Russian user data in the country. Bing was never going to unseat Google as the top search engine, and a lot of that is due to China, the world's largest internet market. Google long ago pulled out of China, where Baidu has a massive lead over Google and Bing.

It had been her decision to call the election, and her leadership of the campaign that faltered and in what was described as the most human performance they had seen for quite some time, Theresa May said sorry, time and again. ""We saw the human being, not the Maybot""; ""it was the first time in seven weeks she didn't say strong and stable""; more poignantly for the Tories MPs who commiserated with each other, ""if she'd campaigned like that, we'd have won."" They were cheered, relieved perhaps, that she had, tonight, managed to pull it off, to show regret at the calamity her decision to go to the country had unleashed, relieved too that she rose to this particular occasion that seems likely to settle nerves enough to avoid the possibility of the party plunging into another leadership election and potentially therefore, another general election that they might lose. The sense of immediate danger to her leadership has faded. But while her enemies are not breathing down her neck, they are still in the room. One MP told me she wasn't asked any hard questions but deliberately took the time to take all of them, to show willing, ""her strategy has been to take as many questions as exist."" It's like that episode of the West Wing where the Presidential Candidate Vinick was in deep trouble, so he took endless questions until the press finally got tired and went home - apologies if the American series isn't your thing, but it's an obsession of rather a lot of Westminster types. While publicly it is tonight the done thing for Tories to be fulsomely on the record praising the prime minister, privately it's hard to find a single MP who believes that she will take the party into the next general election. PM survives first bout of battle for control It is, however, also very hard to find a single MP who wants to unleash even more potential chaos by triggering an election contest, let alone a general election. But it's the circumstances, rather than newly discovered rapture, for the PM that have saved her. One former cabinet minister told me ""having a Tory prime minister is much more important than our own wound licking."" Another minister told me in the medium term it is ""hard to see how"" the PM can stay. Theresa May has survived the first bout of what will be a fight to stay in control. The election has redressed the balance, not just between the two main parties, but also between the Tory leader and her party. And the PM knows it, most tellingly also saying to her MPs tonight, ""I'll serve as long as you want me."" Hardly a bold statement of a leader who feels they are in charge, but an acknowledgement that others will decide when their time is up.",human,3.053030303030303,2.0,4.0,3.875,3.1578947368421053,-0.8162147178246718,-0.2748904917232327,-0.5844052307618842,-0.3473586736148567,1.1956782713085232,1.5346348570379689,2.102805125414337,1.8149959122684718,1.9279230210602756,1.7262152831243907,0.7941176470588234,0.8736542152270197,2.45841784989858,1.9404105863752164,0.0,0.0,0.24369747899159652,0.6657838028425113,-0.4654342515637349,-0.13230362981639843,0.9265067799063839,2.0797675684706096,0.11245674740484425,0.08307489770385382,1.69572192513369,0.7436528890206819,0.44705882352941173,1.1319266539755928,1.369485294117647,1.5472881556676137,-0.21479889368341232,-0.08041659939642964,1.0036764705882353,2.2836725903402613,2.235294117647059,1.3222859196082215,0.7691392186616679,0.732868908724205,1.1876750700280114,1.6249520567008926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.8181818181818181,2.6363636363636362,0.25824103206308024,0.9015764425808728,0.4176885804869295,0.055162565888416504,0.5620822844705615,0.5629465069144927

Over the next decade, the urban environment is expected to increase by nearly 30. Details have been published in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal. ""We wanted to place the focus on city and urban locations when choosing trees, but not on the aesthetic aspects,"" said co-author Juliane Vogt from the Institute of Forest Growth and Forest Computer Science at Techische Universitat Dresden, Germany. She told BBC News that the goal of the database was to ""find the right tree for the right place."" ""City planner tend to like 10 to 15 species of tree, and they like to plant them again and again - that's not really biodiversity,"" Dr Vogt observed. ""This is why we put in 390 trees and shrubs into the database so there was a huge range of different species and varieties. Dr Vogt added that she hoped that professionals, such as city planners and landscape architects, would use the database, adding ""but we also think it will be of interest for homeowners if they have a garden and want to find out what sort of tree would be suitable."" She said that there were numerous benefits associated with city trees, such as shading and reducing the urban heat island effect, which make towns and cities several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas. This is a particular problem during heatwaves. ""Trees also provide habitat for other animals that have made their home within cities,"" She added. The long term survival and evolutionary development of species populations are shaped by the surrounding habitat. For some species, urban life has presented an opportunity for a new beginning. The BBC Natural History Unit's Planet Earth II looks at the lure of the urban jungle for wildlife in its final episode of the series. The programme, set to be broadcast on Sunday, 11 December, looks at peregrine falcons in New York, which are booming, thanks to another urban success story - the pigeon, or rock dove. Langurs, a species of monkey in India, are also thriving. Revered as a mortal connection with a god, the animals are fed. Numbers are booming. However, the growing biodiversity of urban life is not universally welcomed. Some species - racoons, rats, pigeons - are widely regarded as pests. Plants, such as the Japanese knotweed - once prized - are unwelcomed opportunists. ""Trees also interact with humans and the surrounding city, so one point of the database is to take account of some of the risks, such as having poisonous trees, or trees that have brittle wood that can break,"" said Dr Vogt. ""Some residents really dislike trees because, for example, they are too big. ""In the street near where I live, there are pear trees and now, in the autumn, the pears are falling and leaving a mess on the pavement below. People are now calling for them to be cut down, even though they are healthy.""

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun. He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as terrorists, online. He said that he would be targeting Shia Muslims but denied being an ISIS supporter. Syed pleaded guilty to the offence at the Old Bailey on Thursday, and will be sentenced next week. The defendant contacted MI5 officers online in July and August last year, and began to ask them about the weapons he could buy and the ""best way to carry out an attack."" He said that he wanted to carry out a ""martyrdom operation"" and would target Shia Muslims in the UK. After being arrested, he told police that he had been in contact with the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISISISIL) and that he had been in the ""right mind"" to carry out the attack. He said that he wanted to kill up to 100 Shia Muslims in a gun and bomb attack on an Eltham mosque or the Shia Imam Hussain mosque in Greenwich. However, he later told police he was not an ISIS supporter and would never harm other Muslims. Syed appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh prison wearing a black prayer cap and a blue prison tracksuit. He pleaded guilty to one charge of preparation of terrorist acts between July 9 and September 20, 2015. Judge Charles Wide QC said Syed should be sentenced next Thursday at the Old Bailey. He said he would adjourn the case to allow Syed's defense team to prepare ""further evidence."" The judge also allowed the publication of the defendant's name, and revealed details of the charges he was facing. At the hearing, it emerged that the defendant was previously convicted of robbery in 2010 and had been released on license from jail in February last year. He was arrested by counter-terrorism officers in September 2015 and was charged in December.

They had slipped to 208-6 with Essex seamer Matt Dixon taking two wickets in two balls with figures of 4-89. But Stevens shared a partnership of 108 with James Tredwell (39) and completed his 31st first-class ton in the final over of the day at Canterbury. It was an unflappable display from the 40-year-old, who was patient at first but then showed all his attacking prowess, at one point adding 26 in the space of nine balls faced. When Tredwell was lbw to Dixon, Stevens added an unbroken 73 with Matt Coles, giving Kent four bonus points and leaving them only two short of guaranteeing second place. The score at stumps was probably a fair reflection on the way Essex bowled - a one-paced attack short of a front-line spinner. Joe Denly (74) and Sam Northeast (56) shared 109 for the third wicket, taking advantage as Essex often over-pitched. Dixon, on his return to the first team, was the pick of the attack as he swung the ball at decent pace, removing Denly and Will Gidman in successive deliveries after Ravi Bopara trapped Sam Billings lbw. The mini-collapse from 204-3 to 208-6 had Essex in the game, only for Stevens to take it away from them. But what is now a three-day match will be difficult for either side to win.",human,1.0151515151515151,0.8333333333333334,1.1538461538461537,1.21875,1.4210526315789473,-0.9772281429941624,-0.9581840986838056,-1.022438600212833,-0.8958326248105312,0.35374149659863907,0.011013292341138745,0.5957947855340624,-0.12873838666169307,0.6697530864197532,-0.12293440537084835,0.3999999999999999,0.2868363666801078,0.6672413793103449,0.10435978895575043,0.0,0.0,-0.07142857142857155,-0.10086214508086966,0.4502981783421501,0.4867910970119299,-0.07875307629204267,-0.15354813336324338,0.6882352941176471,0.49994290991081425,-0.44545454545454544,0.10561068581857506,0.19999999999999996,0.44552795576386045,0.53125,0.7581073739572258,2.6174533988685895,1.257126207282037,-0.18749999999999997,0.8114042191453255,-0.061538461538461514,0.032210130288144886,0.5753161355589276,0.24134726919132704,0.8634920634920635,0.5697919272302974,0.5,0.806225774829855,0.0,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.9090909090909091,0.2809192063037571,0.2261802520983042,0.22711816563976797,0.7871764066961602,-0.36067236973688904,-0.2528485717680469

Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras that appears to rotate. NASA has just released a series of images of a new type of aurora that's been discovered on the planet Saturn. Saturn's auroras are caused by the planet's magnetic field interacting with the solar wind. As the aurora season comes into full swing, so too will the research of scientists from the University of Iowa, who are studying the effect of solar winds on the aurora borealis. Scientists are beginning to study a new type of aurora discovered in Antarctica last year. Researchers have discovered that the diffuse auroras are caused by a concentration of electrons coming from space. A new study from the University of Colorado at Boulder shows that while the Northern Lights may be beautiful to look at, they also have a major impact on the ionosphere and Earth's magnetic field.

Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with Tesla's Autopilot system last year Tesla is one of several automakers, including Ford Motor Company and General Motors Co., that have taken steps to increase the capabilities of their driver-assistance software systems as they compete for business among consumers concerned about safety on U.S. roads.

It did not say whether the system had been activated at all while Brown was driving.

A new generation of sophisticated self-driving cars are being put through their paces this weekend ahead of what many consider will be inevitable widespread deployment within months Following the fatal accident involving the company's Model S sedan using AutoPilot technology, Tesla issued warnings reminding drivers who use such features to keep both hands on the steering wheel at all times and pay attention to road conditions and traffic signals. In May 2016, nearly two years later, another Tesla owner died in Florida when his Model S hit two trees, crossing into oncoming lanes. Neither crash has officially resulted in charges against the companies involved. Elon Musk tweeted out images Saturday showing him standing next to the bright red electric sports car again However, some experts argue there is still work left to do even if autopilot can see stop signs and speed limit signs, react quickly enough and brake automatically - especially since human error causes more than 90 percent of accidents. But most agree that humans aren't capable of handling every aspect behind the wheel safely 100 per cent of time either. Despite those concerns, automakers continue rolling out vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems like Tesla's auto pilot. Some experts believe full autonomous vehicles could account for 41 million sales worldwide by 2035, according to IHS Markit Automotive Research.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"A defence official said in a statement on Wednesday that its nuclear programme had ""long been in the full-fledged stage of miniaturisation."" However, analysts say while there is evidence the programme is advancing, it is difficult to assess its true extent. The claim comes hours after North Korea cancelled a planned visit by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Mr Ban was due to visit an industrial complex in the Kaesong economic zone run jointly by the North and South and would have been the first UN chief to visit North Korea in more than 20 years. Speaking at a forum in Seoul, he said the move was ""deeply regrettable"" and that no explanation was given. North Korea previously claimed it had miniaturised a device for the nuclear test it conducted in 2013 but experts have continued to debate how far along that process it is. Dr John Swenson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at the Chatham House think-tank, said that while there was ""growing evidence of the North's increasing technical sophistication,"" caution was necessary in interpreting North Korea's latest statement. Some have interpreted the latest moves, together with some recent high-profile executions, as attempts by leader Kim Jong-un to assert his authority. The latest announcement on nuclear advances follows the publication earlier this month of pictures apparently showing a missile being launched from a submarine. Some experts have said the images may have been doctored. Responding to the latest claims, the South Korean defence ministry urged the North to stop developing nuclear weapons. An anonymous South Korean military official said it was believed to be true that Pyongyang had made significant progress in miniaturising its nuclear weapons. ""But South Korea and the US share the assessment that it is not at a stage where it has completed the related technology,"" the official told the Yonhap news agency.",human,1.606060606060606,1.3333333333333333,1.476923076923077,1.546875,1.3157894736842106,0.16877685997842015,0.5258777619119923,0.29406943536213964,0.5312833548293875,0.43537414965986376,0.14964253470100206,0.2789674581095943,0.17873953276686577,0.3406932573599239,0.2192513211512409,0.8076923076923075,1.2689763355276114,0.17108753315649874,0.2796865826309287,0.0,0.0,-0.021978021978022278,-0.18833826406774362,0.4502981783421501,1.1251275828677674,0.40891020382406734,-0.2942327596697416,-0.3235294117647058,0.11242511625937243,0.8468531468531472,0.7111124876894708,-0.2769230769230768,0.7804682434877447,1.09375,0.5388263534535276,-0.3123506373993251,-0.14764261007967222,0.21634615384615388,0.520845038845053,-0.01183431952662738,0.21641808763975728,0.6839422590560679,0.3217292442129484,0.3711843711843714,0.9507811593316305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.290909090909091,1.0909090909090908,0.14121194253514896,0.7112488764882445,-0.07293181691882226,-0.38794654118533556,0.48329215197365916,0.6780425208697074

Step 1: Create Mux Account The first step is to create a Mux account. Mux is an API-first video platform that enables developers to add high quality video experiences to their applications. To get started, visit the Mux website and sign up for a free trial. Step 2: Set Up Your Data API Keys Once you have created your account, you'll need to set up your API keys. These will be used to authenticate your requests and provide authorization to access Mux's Data API. To do this, navigate to ""Settings"" in the Mux Dashboard and select ""API Keys."" Here you can create and manage your API keys. You will need two keys - one for read-only access and one for write access. Step 3: Create a New Project Now that you have your API keys set up, it's time to create a new project in the Mux dashboard. To do this, click the ""Create Project"" button in the top right corner of the dashboard. Give your project a name and click ""Create."" Step 4: Connect Your Project to Your Data API Keys Once your project is created, it's time to connect it to your Data API keys. Navigate to ""Data API"" in the left sidebar of your project and enter the read-only and write access keys you created in Step 2. Step 5: Create a ""Spotify Wrapped"" Clone Now that you've connected your project to your Data API keys, it's time to start building your Spotify Wrapped clone. Begin by creating a simple HTML page with a form that allows users to input their username and submit their request. This form should include an input field for the username and a submit button. Next, create a JavaScript file that contains a function that makes an AJAX request to the Mux Data API using the username from the form. This function should accept the username as a parameter and make an AJAX request using the username as the query string. Once the AJAX request is complete, parse through the response data and extract the user's most-played songs, album artwork, and playlists. Finally, use this data to generate a ""Spotify Wrapped"" style report that displays the user's most-played songs, albums, and playlists. Here is a working example of the code needed to accomplish this task: HTML Form form input type""text"" id""username"" placeholder""Enter your Spotify username"" input type""submit"" value""Submit"" onclick""getData "" form JavaScript Function function getData (username) { var xhttp new XMLHttpRequest ; xhttp.onreadystatechange function { if (this.readyState 4 this.status 200) { var response JSON.parse (xhttp.responseText); Parse response data and extract user's most-played songs, album artwork, and playlists Generate a ""Spotify Wrapped"" style report } }; xhttp.open GET,"" , true); xhttp.setRequestHeader Authorization', 'Basic [read-only api key; xhttp.send ; }",text-davinci-003,2.6515151515151514,3.3333333333333335,2.3846153846153846,2.171875,5.842105263157895,-0.6516493364959444,-0.7408563305766239,-0.6386033685074188,-0.7208769769503787,-0.380952380952381,0.38898653153841445,-0.4869974768713206,-0.2606529519778518,-0.6420987654320984,-0.33863108322043756,-0.9,-0.32715098649031704,-0.2627586206896551,-0.001462687491674894,0.0,0.0,0.2285714285714285,2.153175504694627,-0.07805168424597271,0.28694848267982975,0.4449548810500408,0.9742590131848983,-0.9635294117647061,-0.36854879636912613,-0.6694545454545455,0.08226700041852464,0.08000000000000007,0.5901440805003416,0.006250000000000144,1.1020529660369314,0.07828990076973014,0.37565004634257937,0.20249999999999999,0.3972500797378979,0.363076923076923,0.6910667835550749,-0.14644410723318155,-0.06332946195886911,1.4323809523809525,6.5532301535636215,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.7838367176906169,0.2727272727272727,2.5454545454545454,0.9545864030816134,0.37201695836981913,1.3284488536926173,0.7620289862162871,-0.7122144277233491,-0.8224594615305004

Whether or not the new Wallet will replace Pay is still unclear. The company says it's not sure yet, but it's probably going to be a while before Wallet and Pay are completely separate. Android Pay is still the primary way to pay for things using a smartphone, but Wallet may become a place to store digital cards for various loyalty programs and memberships. It's possible that Google Pay will be renamed to Google Wallet in the near future. Wallet will likely have a much more limited feature set after its return. It will no longer have the option to make payments using cards in addition to bank accounts. Rather, it will be a place to store gift cards and loyalty cards. While it's unclear how many banks will support Google Pay, all of Google's major partners should be able to use Wallet by the end of the year.",t0_11b,0.9318181818181818,1.1666666666666667,1.1692307692307693,1.125,0.5263157894736842,-0.867982772319883,-1.1396958411312619,-0.6937248449625442,-0.8536484114893765,-0.3015873015873018,-0.051666977261048345,0.08634707036725554,0.008518442697255805,0.0,-0.13079644487064052,0.25,0.470155250750414,1.2672413793103448,1.0890480545924548,0.0,0.0,-0.6071428571428572,0.41454786468878346,0.01786897533103779,-0.08980652997455385,-0.3773584905660379,-0.2068101616363057,-0.8284313725490197,-0.31880116614182835,1.537878787878788,0.20166754558524433,0.1333333333333333,0.7790682453957568,-0.31249999999999994,-0.24447604278721768,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.4374999999999999,0.686807778479583,-0.38461538461538464,-0.23079836992061867,0.39226100151745075,0.24103728355368267,-0.7513227513227512,-0.7390084939467243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,1.0,0.7914291977600594,0.10196692035552692,0.7947394983654219,0.7765820981059296,-0.6823274703673718,-0.6050991908513158

The Swans want to add 12,000 seats but will require new infrastructure, such as additional roads and parking, to accommodate the extra fans. The club has previously said it is looking at a number of options to increase capacity, including installing modular stands. The council has yet to confirm if it will agree to the plans but has indicated that it is open to discussions. A council spokesperson said: ""We are in discussion with Swansea City Football Club about increasing capacity at the Liberty Stadium. These are ongoing discussions and no decisions have been made at this stage.""",text-davinci-003,0.14393939393939395,0.16666666666666666,0.18461538461538463,0.21875,0.0,0.030856074960519016,0.6977625676527496,0.28389139004508945,0.7067381410151157,-0.13151927437641747,-0.6655797670512608,0.0,-0.4544911611342568,0.06481481481481481,-0.5156218979416302,-0.16666666666666674,0.32136709452930834,-0.48275862068965514,-0.2988158729538991,0.0,0.0,-0.21428571428571427,-0.7798838771666865,-0.17868975331037695,0.3836845001425752,0.3117309269893353,0.11084275059195525,-0.12745098039215677,-0.09360607031504128,0.7212121212121213,0.11062703914585043,0.1333333333333333,0.7790682453957565,0.15625000000000008,-1.6212775146310008,-0.29699527033293144,-0.13504537836886316,0.3125,0.49598080788504934,0.0,-0.27172895357090066,0.26150733434496715,0.41774142375450285,-0.38095238095238076,-0.3838873035272961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05454545454545454,0.0,0.22779830133100634,-0.08065411540082103,-0.14540036458316932,-0.14185365896308588,0.030619072052543106,0.3766702522025081

They've been separated for a long time, but will continue to be ""parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects,"" the couple said in a joint statement posted on Twitter. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, is divorcing his wife, MacKenzie, after 25 years of marriage. A joint statement from the pair posted on Twitter said that they have ""decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends."" ""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again,"" the statement read. The pair met and married while working at D.E. Shaw, a New York-based hedge fund, in the early 1990s. Shortly after, they packed up and moved across the country to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon. ""We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other,"" their statement read. ""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again."" MacKenzie Bezos, an author, is often cited as the inspiration for creating Amazon. A drive from New York to Seattle is where the couple came up for the idea for an ""everything store,"" and her first novel, ""The Testing of Luther Albright,"" was published in 2005. The couple has four children. ""We've had such a great life together as a married couple, and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures,"" their statement said. ""Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends."" The Bezoses are the richest couple in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of 137 billion.",llama_65B,1.4848484848484849,1.6666666666666667,1.7076923076923076,1.78125,3.1052631578947367,-0.43125870766528046,-0.41718631688982816,-0.5057981494953036,-0.6000290640576135,-0.14512471655328793,0.3013543436298316,0.1554247266610596,0.5144578832305575,0.2117283950617283,0.4592993297078926,-0.3666666666666667,0.2647927631368744,0.2172413793103449,0.7139427735787562,0.0,0.0,-0.4000000000000001,0.6267391002111311,-0.021442770397245223,0.2655286742279714,0.10500410172272347,0.1845972160719399,0.025490196078431285,0.44207501477843436,0.3012121212121215,0.6060213757066334,0.5333333333333334,1.6643195540661107,0.3437500000000002,0.855264796477811,0.30186404525642213,0.10212544614376524,-0.5375,-0.15310815417110576,0.3384615384615384,0.5832520802675273,0.20920586747597372,0.039269794049678335,1.7523809523809528,1.0502481489043876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.509090909090909,2.272727272727273,0.5176688645279662,0.267690115404601,1.3989112879105101,0.5482277593471372,-0.44776146672888745,-0.5881041896390081
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Scientists at MIT have published a paper detailing a new type of artificial brain synapse that can potentially produce devices that can handle complex AI computing locally without having to rely on cloud computing. The artificial brain synapse, called an ""artificial neuron,"" is a type of neuron-inspired circuit that can be used to create neural networks and deep learning systems. The device is made up of two parts: a transistor array which is used to store data, and an artificial synapse which acts as the connection between the two transistors. The artificial synapse is capable of dynamically adapting its connections in response to different inputs, allowing it to learn from its environment in a manner similar to how biological neurons work. Using this technology, researchers hope to create more efficient and powerful AI systems that can be used for a variety of applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and natural language processing. By being able to process information locally, these devices would also reduce the need for cloud computing, which can be expensive and inefficient. In the future, this technology could potentially be used to create even more sophisticated AI systems that can solve complex problems and make decisions faster than ever before.",text-davinci-003,0.803030303030303,0.3333333333333333,0.7846153846153846,0.71875,0.47368421052631576,0.6954068306401141,0.957829445452868,1.2803001152161666,1.2461986313870481,1.1739552964042754,-0.6043534621559247,1.073170731707317,-0.4045528915917127,0.873456790123457,-0.6223791190106739,1.9285714285714284,0.7679842902869443,1.588669950738916,2.231306923725004,0.0,0.0,1.183673469387755,0.042666557240927626,-0.6279668473478963,-0.6193342417459754,0.8859721082854797,-0.20467626327413813,0.4915966386554622,0.2334656125556451,1.754545454545455,0.12030358632345362,0.5142857142857142,0.44096873574882733,0.6919642857142859,0.04765789752047128,-0.154409719002133,0.21197740306817978,0.5624999999999999,-1.324846381066645,0.37362637362637346,-0.22279872375724744,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456333,0.761904761904762,0.7281294359426618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45454545454545453,0.8181818181818182,0.2775655502512729,0.18105420397510166,0.31070168092361083,-1.5517980014144221,1.6492619266035742,1.7200118270254026
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The University of Wisconsin successfully claimed that Apple used its microchip technology without permission in some iPhones and iPads. The patent, filed in 1998, is said to improve the power efficiency of devices by slowing down or stopping the flow of data when a phone's processor doesn't need it right now-something we see all too often with modern smartphones. Apple responded yesterday saying they never sought any license from UW for using their patented technologies found on iOS products including iPhone 3G S, iPad 2 and iPod Touch 4th generation (4G). They went further and described UW as hypocritical because it has asked them if it can use similar chips in upcoming models, such as the next-generation iWatch and iTV: ""We have not requested nor would have accepted a license under this old device patent despite our respect for the university,"" according to an email sent to Reuters dated May 29 but first published Feb. 13. ""Our position regarding these other patents was set forth more than four years ago."" AFP noted that it is likely Apple will counter sue under antitrust laws since their intellectual property should be protected against theft. A spokesperson for UW declined to comment to FoxNews.com According to Tim Cook's letter, here are two major points he made about his firm's legal action against UW: First, we did not seek out licensing opportunities related to older product designs either before announcing our new products or after those announcements were made. We had no idea what kinds of products might come along based upon knowledge learned through the research efforts. Second, while one university may believe that it owns every invention created anywhere at anytime in history, courts around the world recognize that universities do not own inventions developed primarily outside of university laboratories; therefore they cannot claim ownership over anything invented unless there is express authorization for commercialization. In fact, even though they owned the electronic circuits themselves - which could only work properly within the confines of the integrated circuit design licensed by Motorola - the court still held that Apple's infringement lawsuit was proper. So for 15 years, Apple refused to pay damages to a company we considered - and continue to consider our friends and partners. But today it ends.... Today marks another step forward in the ongoing evolution of technological innovation, in which many companies like ours find ways to create value simply by building great products well... And I hope you agree that we don't want any country to limit competition simply to protect established businesses. Whether in Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, Africa, Central or North America, we bring the same attitude into each market. Universities have always been known as early adopters of technological innovations due to large amounts of funding available from government agencies. However, recently public institutions have begun developing innovative business strategies; the most famous example being Stanford University that began to develop very strong ties with Google back in 2004. As part of the deal, it gets access to Google's vast RD teams and receives money indirectly via equity stakes in ventures started within its network. Also, Stanford became the unofficial advisor for various startups inside Google and beyond. Forbes' Mark Bergen wrote last year that ""Stanford has become Silicon Valley's college recruiting ground."" He reported extensive talks between Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt during BUILD conference [Microsoft] and predicted Facebook CEO Zuckerberg's decision to drop Harvard Business School classes and take up tech education at Stanford University instead. With huge sums of cash coming from federal grants and private gifts, why wouldn't public schools also invest some resources in exploiting emerging trends? History shows us how valuable intellectual property obtained legally can prove later to be worth billions of dollars. Patent lawyers say that roughly 25 percent of U.S. revenue comes from intellectual property generated internally rather than externally. Companies typically get royalties on sales of products produced by third parties who paid royalties to obtain licenses from others whose original ideas helped give rise to the product. Microsoft Corp., for instance, brings in 5 billion annually from selling Windows software and operating systems developed largely by outsiders, even though the company pays nothing directly for the rights to sell copies. Even before Microsoft bought Internet search engine Yahoo Inc. for US20 million in September 2006, its financial success derived in significant measure from the pioneering role played by three former employees named Jerry Yang, David Filo and Chris Cox. Those men joined Microsoft in 1995 as programmers working on Web browser software that eventually evolved into the MSN portal service. At the time, Microsoft generally kept the source code secret so it couldn't be copied illegally. With hindsight, however, it seems almost inevitable that someone would try to break in sooner or later - and sure enough, eBay did just that in March 2000 when it launched Netscape Navigator 9, copying portions of the MSN user interface. When Microsoft released Win98 SE v1.07 in August 2001, it removed coding keys from both the OS kernel and application binary that enabled the software giant to identify unauthorized copying and prevent it. Yet within weeks of launch, thousands of websites appeared online offering illegal versions of Windows 98 and other applications.

Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought Xinhua said. City officials did not rule out the possibility of an explosive device that went off during Saturday's rush hour blast. ""I heard two explosions. The second explosion was very big,"" witness Li Xu told Reuters by phone before he fled from his office near Tiananmen Square to a nearby subway station. Footage on television showed passengers screaming as they plunged head-first down escalators in a tunnel following reports of gunfire inside Beijing Railway Station. Ambulances screamed into action outside the main concourse at the city centre hub after the blasts erupted around 8:30 p.m (1230 GMT), sirens blaring and lights flashing. Passengers ran for safety through smoke-filled corridors between railway carriages. Others lay on ground bleeding from wounds including bloodied heads. At least three bodies could be seen lying amid shattered glass with crowds milling about and many shouting or crying. State broadcaster CCTV aired amateur footage showing police struggling to cordon off some streets leading away from the site of the attack. Police armed with assault rifles patrolled an adjacent road lined with numerous blackened buildings while paramilitary policemen stood guard at entrances to housing compounds in the area. A group of men wearing white T-shirts clustered under a bridge overpass, where rescue workers had stored backpacks filled with emergency supplies - presumably left behind when commuters evacuated. Traffic came to standstill across central Beijing late on Friday evening as security forces sealed off roads leaving only pedestrians free to traverse usually busy sections. On Saturday afternoon most appeared willing to go along with tight restrictions imposed by the government so soon afterwards. Some questioned why they weren't allowed more information but others seemed resigned even though they felt safe enough within their neighbourhoods to venture outdoors. 'TOURISTS ARE SAFE' No details have emerged yet concerning those injured nor any possible motives for the attacks. But in the wake of such violence, China has taken steps towards preventing another incident like this happening again. Shortly after midnight, state media reported all bus service connecting Beijing with neighbouring cities south of the capital would stop until further notice due to tightened security checks on highways entering the city. All seven underground lines servicing Beijing also stopped running between 10pm (1400GMT) and 9am (0100GMT). Security concerns aside, visitors flocked to landmarks throughout Saturday eager to glimpse them up close despite heavy rain showers which kept many indoors. At 7:15 pm local time (1045GMT), tourists waited patiently each nightwatchman took position atop Mao Zedong's Mausoleum, a towering bronze statue overlooking Tiananmen Square built to commemorate the founder of Communist Party, who died 35 years ago. Though dark clouds loomed overhead overnight, clear skies greeted hundreds of couples dressed formally for weddings taking pictures beneath portraits of Lenin and Mao and children playing hopscotch beside statues honouring President Xi Jinping. Other groups posed happily against red walls painted with characters saying: ""Tourists Are Safe Here."" Washington urged Chinese leaders to provide full transparency regarding the bombing, White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"In a statement (in French) it said it was ""worried about the continued worsening of the situation."" On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The fighters, the YPG militia based in Syria, have rejected Turkey's demand to leave areas it has seized, saying Islamists would return if it left. Turkey's assault is a new thread in an already-complex conflict that has drawn in competing regional powers. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Sunday that Turkey ""will not permit the [Kurdish militia] to carry out aggressive acts."" ""Our security forces gave the necessary response and will continue to do so,"" Mr Davutoglu said. Syria has also condemned the Turkish action as a violation of its sovereignty and asked the UN Security Council to intervene. France also called on the Syrian regime and its allies to stop their bombardments ""across the whole of the country."" France said priority should be given to implementing an agreement reached in Munich this week on ceasing hostilities, and the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Almost five years of civil war in Syria have led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people. More than 11 million people have been displaced. How Putin is succeeding in Syria Displaced Syrians struggle to survive Syria: The story of the conflict Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds: What's going on? Attempts to broker a peace deal have repeatedly failed, but on Thursday, world leaders agreed to work towards a so-called cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. The US and Russian presidents agreed in a ""frank and business-like"" phone call to work more closely to achieve this, the Kremlin said on Sunday. Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been carrying out air strikes since September against what it terms ""terrorists."" Among the targets shelled by Turkey is the Menagh airbase, which was seized by the YPG on Thursday from Syrian Islamist rebels. The YPG controls much of Syria's northern border with Turkey. Syria's war hardly needs a new front, but another has now opened up. Ankara sees the Kurdish PYD party and its YPG militia as terrorist organisations. It's worried that weapons are seeping over the border from Syria to the PKK, with which Turkey has renewed its armed conflict since a ceasefire broke down last year. Washington rejects Ankara's view that the PYD is a terrorist organisation, seeing it instead as an effective ally against so-called Islamic State (IS). That has caused rifts between the two Nato allies and is hampering international peace talks. Syria is the stage for several proxy wars, and Turkey has just started another, going after its Kurdish nemesis there and vowing to stop the PYD from cementing control of northern Syria. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish forces shot at Kurdish fighters inside Syria on Sunday after coming under fire themselves. Ankara sees the group as being linked with Kurdish guerrillas from PKK, which has waged a campaign against security forces in Turkey for decades. In other developments: Under the agreed cessation of hostilities plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria. The halt would not apply to the battle against the jihadists of IS and al-Nusra Front. However, neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved in the deal and both have since vowed to continue fighting. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that he intended to retake ""the whole country"" from rebels - a statement the US government said was ""deluded."" Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo. Also on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev repeated a warning that any foreign ground operation in Syria would lead to ""a full-fledged, long war."" Turkey has said its troops and forces from Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS.",human,4.5227272727272725,4.666666666666667,4.3076923076923075,4.40625,5.157894736842105,-0.053433690785288944,-0.199210051962018,0.05826905779947195,0.018021124416912424,0.04370232941661501,-0.15864001478350387,-0.015699467339500967,-0.21735945919467112,0.013748597081930344,-0.24714886397838878,0.045454545454545414,0.09834069185999149,0.017241379310344803,0.2878387708563189,0.0,0.0,-0.32467532467532473,-0.16669434518444187,0.5646596204607913,0.3502260123717915,0.28040868073681835,0.4164807896421504,0.35918003565062395,0.2697665587807154,0.021212121212121196,0.018961364272821694,-0.04848484848484835,0.7613987580160232,0.1278409090909092,-0.03221421418900786,-0.31514252232048756,-0.00024354999488328035,0.19886363636363633,0.7410597012528236,-0.23776223776223782,-0.14676381979812686,-0.09509357612544259,0.0535395678061534,0.6156806156806157,0.6451927350848636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.4727272727272727,5.0,0.17986803391429415,1.0693255950154295,0.9637386003360762,-0.0196559977291392,0.035057635317183554,-0.048881568461339654

The flowing, fast Silverstone circuit and the huge crowds - 80,000 spectators are expected to attend practice on Friday, with about 95,000 due for Saturday's qualifying and 120,000 for the race on Sunday - make the British Grand Prix a favourite amongst drivers. Rosberg says he will do everything he could to prevent Hamilton recording a home victory on Sunday. ""I definitely am going to try,"" the German said. ""It's not going to be easy here, but I will do my best and I'm optimistic."" Having won seven of the eight races so far this season, only missing out in Canada last month when they ran into a rare reliability problem, Mercedes are expected to win at Silverstone, with Hamilton and Rosberg fighting it out at the front. World champions Red Bull should be their closest challengers, despite a poor race in Austria two weeks ago. Daniel Ricciardo, who was eighth in Austria, is the highest Red Bull driver in the championship in third place, 82 points behind Rosberg. The Australian, who took his maiden career victory in Canada, said the team said the team think they know what went wrong in Austria and were expecting a better weekend at Silverstone. That's because the plethora of high-speed corners suits the aerodynamic excellence of the Red Bull, while the power disadvantage of the Renault compared to the Mercedes engine is less of a handicap. ""If we can be the strong package we normally are here, it can definitely bring us close to the other teams,"" said Ricciardo. ""All going well, I think we should be the ones behind Mercedes. I think they'll still be quickest but whether that's half a second or two or three tenths [of a second] we'll have to find out. ""If we get it all right we can be within a couple of three tenths from them."" Ferrari are in a similar situation to Red Bull, with a good car let down by a poor engine, but double world champion Fernando Alonso is pessimistic about his chances of a podium finish at Silverstone. In fact, the Spaniard does not think his team will taste victory at all this season. ""If I'm honest with you, I would say no, it's not possible to win this year,"" Alonso said. ""But I thought in 2011 it was impossible to win a race and we won here. ""Anything can happen in this sport, so we try to do the best we can. If one opportunity arrives, we will take it to win a race, but it is extremely difficult to win with the performance we are showing."" If Alonso fails to register a win in 2014, it would be the first time since 2009 the 32-year-old has not won at least once in a season and only the second time since 2003. Alonso said he expected Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, who locked out the front row and finished the race third and fourth in Austria, would again be strong in Silverstone. ""They will be a threat,"" Alonso said.

Tens and thousands of these synapses can be combined on a chip physically smaller than a single piece of confetti. The'memristors' are created using alloys of silver and copper. They offer a gradient of values, as opposed to a binary state, and are also able to remember states. The goal of the project was to create dedicated hardware that could perform tasks that currently require significant GPU computing power to run.",human,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.015625,-0.15789473684210525,0.134301492206826,0.2775934730337381,0.7955285321559211,0.35760199044448615,0.19047619047619024,0.7917646689591178,-0.10361648444070656,-0.07420580923655962,-0.0820987654320987,0.17561778244595064,0.7000000000000002,0.7799568648118532,0.5172413793103448,-0.014768925552919743,0.0,0.0,0.3999999999999997,0.2947073823315598,-0.49318371913664055,-0.6640674623522788,0.47251845775225576,0.9326721062163522,-0.07647058823529419,0.02369785662856348,0.6745454545454548,-0.13077714446991304,0.40000000000000013,-0.31752566442654906,0.15625000000000008,0.12025390012841486,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,0.5624999999999999,0.35096646453414515,-0.15384615384615388,-0.025882660870645547,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,-0.5587301587301585,-0.20462037197333557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16363636363636364,-0.18181818181818182,-0.03314891172025416,0.13279169705851795,-0.48683702491203823,-0.7200360984199407,0.5873097320776884,0.5513106506055154

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The Planetary Society, an organization founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, is sending a small spacecraft to orbit the planet. Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite will test out solar sails in space for future missions to Mars or even interplanetary travel through interstellar space. Related: Top 10 Ways We'll Colonize Space In The Next 50 Years ""LightSail2 was born from our desire to explore new frontiers,"" says Jim Benford, president of the society. ""We're not looking at just one destination."" [See more photos of the Apollo 11 moon landing] The group has been working on the project since 2009 in partnership with NanoRacks under NASA's New Frontiers program. LightSails are thin panels made up of woven carbon nanotubes covered with reflective material that catch sunlight like sails catching wind. (For comparison, it takes about 7 million metric tons of force to move 1 cubic meter across Earth's surface.) Once they reach speeds around 4 miles per second (7 kms), the tiny satellites switch off their engines and rely solely on momentum to keep going. This makes them ideal candidates for visiting other planets, especially ones with thick atmospheres - including Venus and Jupiter, which have thick clouds. But light-pressure also limits how fast a sail can go without hitting something. Unlike some previous generation of solar sail vehicles, such as Helios II, which had only a few grams worth of sail surface area, LightSail 2 has 44 square meters (460 sq ft). That should provide plenty of room for scientific experiments and guidance technology, along with powering systems needed to house onboard electronics, communications equipment, navigation sensors, cameras, thrusters and batteries. Story continues When launched into orbit from Florida atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket this year, the solar sail system would separate from the main payload. It then pivots to face the sun in order to draw power. Lightsail 2's roughly 3x3 feet (1 x 1 m) shape won't be able to withstand the rigors of deep space indefinitely; after all, no self-respecting space probe survives launch intact. Eventually, its designers say, the craft may need to detach itself from its mother ship and hitchhike towards another object like Saturn's moons Titan or Enceladus, where gravitational nudge could boost it to escape velocity. And while that might seem daunting, once the mission gets started there really isn't much stopping the craft. After next summer's launch, scientists plan to monitor the device remotely until late 2016 when it reaches 200,000 mph, according to Margaret Coker, vice president of engineering and operations at NanoRack. At that point, if everything goes well, the team plans to command LightSail 2 back down toward Earth.That part involves firing retro rockets beneath the vehicle. These can push LightSail2 away from the booster and send it hurtling back down to Earth.Once safely above the atmosphere, the craft will deploy three parachutes into a gentle descent over Australia before landing near Perth. According to Benford, most of the craft's mass shouldn't fall too far short of 100 lbs (45 kg); any additional weight added during construction will likely make disposal easier. NASA's two Voyager space probes already demonstrated what happened when a lightweight sail hit the vacuum outside the solar system. Both came within thousands of kilometers (miles) of reaching Pluto in 1990, but bounced off instead due to atmospheric drag. Onboard instruments actually recorded data confirming the maneuver, providing information showing why planets like Neptune don't host moons despite having large amounts of hydrogen gas. The experiment inspired many researchers to try different ways of traveling between stars. One of those projects resulted in Breakthrough Starshot, announced last June, funded by Yuri Milner, Elon Musk and Peter Diamandis. Like LightSail 2, the proposed vessel uses reflectorized sails held aloft by electromagnetic winds. Unlike the Planetary Society's design though, which relies mostly on kinetic energy alone, Starshot's sailcraft will use lasers to energize themselves and generate thrust.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Fuchsia is Google's latest operating system for the Google Home Hub. The OS is only available for the first-generation Home Hub devices. Fuchsia was launched quietly. It wasn't even mentioned on the Google Home Hub device page, but it was mentioned in a Reddit post. Fuchsia runs on a customized Android OS, which is an open-source platform developed by Google. It's not clear why Fuchsia is a new OS, but it may have to do with the fact that Google hasn't updated Android in years. Android is still an open-source platform, but it's only compatible with a few devices. In addition to running Android, Fuchsia also runs a version of the Google Chrome browser. Unlike Android, Fuchsia also runs Chrome OS. Chrome OS is a lightweight, low-cost version of Chrome. It comes with a fully functional web browser and a built-in file browser. Chrome OS also has some basic utilities and productivity tools. These include a calendar, a clock, and a calculator. Chrome OS is the operating system used by the Google Home Hub. It's also used by the Google Pixelbook laptop. It's available for all Android devices and supports a wide variety of hardware. Fuchsia is the only operating system that runs on a Chromebook. It's not available on Android or Chrome OS. It's also available for Chromebooks that run on ARM processors. It's unclear whether Fuchsia is based on Chrome OS or not. Google hasn't yet confirmed the source of the OS. However, the developer documentation indicates that it is based on Android, and it's not based on Chrome OS. The Google Home Hub is the first device to support Fuchsia. It's also the only device that has the OS. Fuchsia is currently only available on the first-generation Home Hub devices. The Home Hub isn't yet available on the Google Store, but it can be purchased from other retailers. The Home Hub is the first device to support Fuchsia.

In a recent study, the researchers inserted certain topics into a person's dreams using the technique. A dream is more than just random thoughts that could be dismissed or explained away as drunken ramblings by someone who drank way too much beer on Friday night; it's also a reflection of many factors going on in our brains at any given moment - from what we are thinking to how stressed out and anxious we might feel about things happening around us and even when we were last having sex for instance. This information processing goes far beyond simple daydreaming, which doesn't require much brainpower anyway. So if you have been curious about your own dreams, here is one possible test: use this article as a guide to record everything in your mind during a short period after waking up (maybe 30 minutes or so). Then ask yourself some questions over time regarding those events to see whether they seem familiar or not. I will leave all of these details to your imagination since I have no other suggestions to make besides keeping track of my thoughts.

He will start out as a player but also take on ambassadorial and promotional duties for the club. The Ivory Coast international, who scored 10 goals in 14 games in the MLS last season, has been without a club since leaving Montreal Impact in November. But the Chelsea legend will now return to Stamford Bridge in a new role. In a statement, the club said: ""Didier is coming back to Chelsea, his home. He's one of the most successful players in our history, a true legend at the club and we hope he'll play a big part in our future success."" Drogba, who won four Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time with Chelsea, has been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League. But he will instead return to Stamford Bridge, where he is sure to receive a hero's welcome. Drogba will start out as a player but also take on ambassadorial and promotional duties for the club. Didier Drogba is set to return to Chelsea to take up a player-coaching role under Antonio Conte. The 39-year-old will be a player-coach, with his duties also extending into the club's commercial and marketing operations. The ex-Ivory Coast international striker, who scored 164 goals in 381 appearances in his first spell at the club, has been a free agent since leaving Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact in November. He had been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League, but will now take on a new role at the club where he won four Premier League titles and the Champions League. Didier Drogba is a Chelsea legend - but where does he rank among the club's all-time greatest players? Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest-ever player in a 2012 poll of more than 20,000 fans and has been linked with a return to the club for months. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has been desperate to strengthen his forward line in the January transfer window. He has already signed midfielder Ross Barkley from Everton for 15m, but the Italian is still looking for more options in attack. The club have also been linked with a 44m move for Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud and a 60m move for Roma's Edin Dzeko. The 39-year-old striker is to join the coaching staff at Stamford Bridge as well as continuing to play. Drogba made 381 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 164 goals, and will link up with the club until the end of the season. He was part of the side which won the Premier League four times, as well as four FA Cups and three League Cups. He also played a key role as the Blues won the Champions League for the first time in 2012. He scored nine goals in 14 Major League Soccer games for Montreal Impact last season. Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo said: ""Didier's return is a special one for so many different reasons. ""We all know his past contributions and the impact he had here but he has also made a significant contribution to us in his role as an ambassador. ""He is a great example of how we want our Chelsea legends to contribute to the wider work of the club and the foundation. ""He has done fantastic work in the community and he is a very popular figure with our supporters and staff alike.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation is that Amazon is undercutting the authorized price of e-books for the first two weeks of their release. It has also been reported that Amazon has deals with two publishers, Hachette and Bonnier, to do this. Amazon has been selling e-books at below cost. That is not news. It does this to drive sales and push out competition from rival e-book retailers. The Guardian reports that Amazon is doing this by buying e-books wholesale from publishers. It is then selling them at a loss, which it can afford to do as its dominant position in the market allows it to recoup the money elsewhere. If the accusation that Amazon is also undercutting the authorized price of e-books is true, this is a more serious concern. The Guardian says this could violate competition laws. However, this is not to say that Amazon is necessarily behaving illegally. For a company to be found in breach of competition law, it has to have a dominant position in the market. The Guardian reports that Amazon has a 90 share of the e-book market in the UK. However, the European Commission has said that a market share of 40 or above could constitute a dominant position. There are several different tests that the Commission can apply to determine a company's market share. If Amazon is found to have a dominant position in the market, it would be much easier for the Commission to find it in breach of competition law.",llama_65B,1.3636363636363635,2.0,1.7538461538461538,1.859375,1.105263157894737,-0.6937640079832759,0.35161117974917416,0.05032737620425869,0.4251448942003772,-0.5890356142456985,-0.05337676273882833,-0.12190174640083118,0.22596011047470363,-0.03939724037763216,0.1739730061438476,-0.6764705882352942,-0.10060012554239979,-0.01217038539553744,0.5745100374999262,0.0,0.0,-0.3865546218487396,0.051682315463640376,-0.3821858488450181,-0.4591660931979189,-0.28953336872074525,-0.13998434499026713,-0.7871972318339101,-0.2048026500605327,0.29572192513368983,0.03108050487891582,-0.8470588235294116,-0.37715685375737273,-0.009191176470588203,0.9500219906911268,-0.21479889368341232,-0.08041659939642964,0.3860294117647058,1.0594186364292157,0.2262443438914027,0.4920401564155987,0.5845458061828678,0.2773545410812908,-0.6946778711484592,-0.3624335237114429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14545454545454545,0.6363636363636364,1.1379630612691232,0.21835579323384788,0.25821754151519016,0.2520578178317557,-0.4681688119715357,-0.061384138876391874

In May 2013 an unidentified object was filmed flying over West Hampstead in north London. The footage quickly went viral and became known as ""the London plane"" or more commonly just the 'plane' for short. It is now believed that this video is due to be released soon by conspiracy theorist Jim Stone who claims he received copies from several people. This can only reinforce suspicions that there were government agents filming something far greater than any one person could have seen alone. Whilst many see this as proof of aliens visiting Earth, others are concerned about the alleged theft of medical data used to create it. Whatever you believe the truth behind the London Plane may never fully come out but what we do know is that it will certainly leave its mark upon history forever. For those unaware, here is everything you need to know... The Conspiracy Theory Behind the Video Jim Stone claims he started receiving videos shortly after publishing his first book which discusses extraterrestrial life. He says they were sent via email and phone calls from mostly anonymous figures claiming to work with a secret organisation called ""S-4 Sector."" They say they are investigating our planet despite various governments denying such activity exists. On December 23rd 2012 S-4 Sector posted their own account of events; explaining how two helicopters landed disguised as police units near a house in North Kensington where three men dressed in black carried objects out into the back garden. In total nine individuals involved are said to exist including two women and seven different types of alien. One woman appears to hold a device which allegedly contains data pertaining to human genetics. Another holds a replica of President Obama's birth certificate while another wears a tuxedo similar to Mr. Spock from Star Trek series. Why would these mysterious characters dress up like this? What exactly did they want with the UK Government? And why mention Obama's birthplace when he isn't even president yet? These questions and so much else remain unanswered but perhaps not for long if rumours surrounding the London Planet continue to build. So Who Was Filming It All? Andy Smith and David Clarke claim to live around the corner from each other in the same street in Camden Town, Northcote High Street (which runs along part of Belsize Road) and Acton Green. Andy Smith works as a driver whilst David Clark is a sound engineer whose most significant project is found on his Youtube channel Ufology Stereo. Both men began posting clips online saying they witnessed strange goings on during 20112012 although amateurs often mistake them for hoaxers themselves. Due to copyright issues they haven't published anything since July last year until very recently releasing clips showing military aircraft being shot down. Each man tells us that the plane shown above appeared late at night following heavy rain and flew directly towards their window before disappearing. When asked about the incident Dave told Metro that ""We saw it land next door. Two blokes came outside covered head to toe in black coveralls with face masks on. We thought maybe they were burglars because we heard shouting! Someone hurriedly made off carrying what looked like some kind of big electronic suitcase. There wasn't enough time to ask him [who] he was going to. I followed him briefly then turned round real quick to look for my mate. That moment later I walked past again and spotted someone holding up a camera pointing right at me. At least two cars pulled up then suddenly everyone seemed to disappear leaving us standing there in complete silence. My mate couldn't hear a thing either. But now this fellow - John Allen - is trying to tell the world about it all!!"" David continued to explain his version of events further stating: There was] no noise whatsoever aside from our old windows rattling for a bit. No sirens or loud noises at all except lights flashing slowly across this craft thinking it was a UFO landing. We didn't see any lights inside though. Then came four large orange beams coming from a hatchway that opened and closed rapidly. Three guys wearing black coveralls stormed forward dragging this small box between them. They seemed intent on getting away without anyone noticing them. A few moments later these huge silver discs descended upon the earth looking for refuge. Their size reminded me of glow worms to be honest. To describe the area there is nothing left - all buildings blown apart and burnt branches lying everywhere. Not one tree intact. If it had been daytime then we'd probably have noticed it better because of all the grey clouds covering the sky but under the circumstances, well... it happened too fast."" Both men show clear signs of shock and fear regarding occurrence. Neither expects to ever be able to return home again. Were Any Military Personnel Involved? Chris Steele-Knox believes the whole event was staged however his theories don't stop there. According to resident Chris says the mystery plane couldn'll fly through numerous failures among helicopter fleet.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The pandemic has caused hairlines to recede faster than usual through both stress and the aftereffects of Covid-19. dNovo, a biotech startup, claims that it can create new hair using human cells that have not been damaged by radiation or chemotherapy. In March 2020, when most people were still living their daily lives with minimal interruption from the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic, scientists at California Institute for Biomedical Innovation in San Fransisco announced they had successfully replicated embryonic stem cell lines in mice. The announcement was met with much fanfare in media coverage across the world as well as excitement among those who believed this portended the potential for creating long awaited cures for incurable diseases like cancer. Around the same time, doctors in Boston used genetically modified male mouse sperm to produce healthy pups, which raised similar hopes about an eventual means of producing human eggs and sperms. But these two very exciting scientific developments are only the first steps towards large scale production. In fact, it is likely many months before we will start seeing widespread clinical trials hoping to use these breakthroughs, if ever. And until then, there remains little hope for bringing any treatments into wide usage anytime soon. What makes some more hopeful? A company called D'Arcy BioScience, based out of New York City, recently announced another successful round of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs), created without genetic engineering methods but rather using skin samples derived from patients undergoing cosmetic surgery procedures. Not surprisingly, this news set off a firestorm of debate online - mostly supportive of D'Arcy while critics voiced concern over safety and ethics issues surrounding such research. Many others pointed out, however, that D'Arcy does offer options for donating tissue samples for iPSC generation including breast reduction, face lift facelift, liposuction and abdominoplasty surgeries - all performed under local anaesthesia. While this may sound ominous in its implications, researchers claim that reprogramming technology already exists and the innovations needed to bring them forward should be all but ready after the recent successes of the D' Arcy team. To date, these reprogrammed iPSCs appear no different from ones produced via traditional techniques and may even possess enhanced properties, making them worth exploring further studies. For one thing, unlike other adult stem cells created so far, the 'adult' cells could potentially include patient DNA remnants left behind during earlier transformations or inaccuracies introduced during sample collection. These represent risks that cannot be completely eliminated to this day and may become greater moving forward. But beyond ethical concerns, there remain serious questions regarding whether these advances can actually help fight disease. What is known today is that once neural progenitor cells have reached sufficient maturity and have developed certain traits, they behave just like brain neurons. This includes firing synapses, maintaining pools of neurotransmitters as required by specific functions; sending signals along nerve pathways; and forming connections with neighbouring neurons. It is this neurogenesis factor that sets apart these cells from other types of cells found elsewhere in our bodies. While also capable of maturing into muscle cells, bone and fat cells, the final goal here would seem to be generating functional organs, tissues or whole body replacements. For example, neural stem cells generated from skin biopsies of Parkinson's Disease sufferers, showed significant improvements in movement disorders compared to controls, although further study on larger scales is required. Researchers at University College London reported success in coaxing skin-derived fibroblasts (the type of cells that form scar tissue and connective tissue) into becoming heart muscle cells which improved blood flow around blocked arteries. Still others report almost identical results here from dermal cells taken from scars relating to accidents and medical conditions. Successful attempts have been made to generate retinal pigment epithelial cells through the repurposing of prostate cells, suggesting vascularization problems might be remedied in cases involving macular degeneration and Diabetic Retinopathy. Other applications include developing nerves for peripheral nerve repair, alpha motor neurons to replace spinal cord injury damage, cartilage cells to treat rheumatoid arthritis pain, smooth muscles for bladder regeneration, sweat glands to address cystic fibrosis complications, pancreas beta cells to aid diabetes treatment, red blood cells for transfusions, and increasing amounts of oxygen transporting lung capacity. All of these application areas, as yet untested, point toward a future where ""plasticity"" itself becomes a key driver in regenerative medicine. This is why companies like Senolytics.ai join forces with innovation hubs like the French National Center for Scientific Research, MIT Media Lab and the Max Plank institute UK in promoting cellular plasticity as the way to go not only for better understanding how the body works, but perhaps also tending to serious chronic illnesses.

Spikes plans to relaunch the business by adding new features and ""focusing on our members first."" Spike's tweet about his return follows: 'I have decided to come back home because... I am more optimistic than ever that we can fix Moviepass but this time it will be fixed right' - stacy spikes (stacyspikes) December 15, 2018 A memo sent to staff in advance of the deal announced they would all receive a 10 percent salary cut over the next year as part of the acquisition process. One staffer said all their benefits were being frozen until further notice. It seems employees are not getting paid while the future of the service remains unclear. A rep from STX declined comment when reached by Variety. The most recent chapter in Moviepass history began with its controversial introduction in 2017. Founder Mitch Lowe initially launched the subscription-based streaming service at 9 per month - one price point, he claimed, for unlimited movie tickets. Within months of launch, subscribers numbered just 30,000 people across the nation. Its customer base dwindled even further once exhibitors started raising concerns about ticket sales plummeting as users tried to see multiple movies every week. In early January, Lowe abruptly shut down operations after losing several million dollars. He sued AMC, Regal Entertainment Group (owner of Cinemark), Cineplex Inc., National Amusements and others, accusing them of colluding to keep him from entering into agreements with other theater chains. His lawsuit also names Netflix and Hulu as competitors who allegedly offered better deals to theaters. On top of those complaints, Lowe has accused Moviepass executives of stealing millions worth of stock before filing Chapter 11 protection last August. After fleeing to Mexico and then moving to France, Lowe quietly returned to Los Angeles earlier this fall. As he finally set foot back at HQ, he tweeted excitedly that Hollywood studios had already begun submitting scripts specifically meant to target Moviepass customers. In October, Lowe told press outlets he'd contacted investors seeking support (rumors later surfaced of a failed attempt). Since returning, he hasn't commented publicly since late November. It appears he no longer intends to seek monetary compensation or any sort of shareholding from Moviepass' previous owners. While there may still be legal drama ahead of him, Spike says he feels confident enough to take the helm after making some changes. From what little information exists online, the acquisition could value the company at less than half of what it was sold for two years ago. That means nearly 100 staffers saw their salaries slashed. Some say they still don't know exactly how much money they lost during the transition period. It certainly won't help morale if rumors swirling around the company continue claiming Moviepass is headed toward insolvency again. Last summer, these reports dogged the startup long enough to prompt several High Park West screens to stop sending patrons cards allowing access to movie listings. Another source confirmed they were feeling anxious about whether the program would survive another round of layoffs. Another rumor claims Moviepass faces a potential exodus of talent unless they agree to pay higher commissions to agents. While Spike isn't backing up any such claim, he does admit the company needs to do more to attract local film producers and TV projects. With so many copies currently available on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, why should anyone bother paying full price? He's planning to rebrand the app too to make it easier to find families watching films together. This shouldn't be surprising considering the majority of Moviepass subscriptions came from parents buying passes for kids. At least that segment will remain intact now that more options are expected to pop up alongside existing ones.",gpt_j,4.03030303030303,5.0,3.753846153846154,3.6875,3.526315789473684,0.5686765795602325,-0.09750887194320937,0.1867490334747615,-0.07712387675793216,-0.3731778425655977,-0.19901356808388224,-0.42926829268292666,-0.18003414464622142,-0.4746913580246912,-0.2473330849891335,-0.3285714285714285,-0.11723989743835135,0.9029556650246304,0.8175174219098444,0.0,0.0,-0.21224489795918366,0.21143379796125983,-0.2910090268197568,0.1377812633880294,0.3543888433141919,0.1704743802453932,-0.20756302521008402,0.15122917913300754,-0.5254545454545455,0.20276828696022478,-0.7428571428571429,-0.2542982797043247,-0.6473214285714286,-0.04779011823810557,-0.05174812204395804,0.09514932208122179,0.09107142857142857,0.9387356330508169,0.057142857142857134,0.15193538460540998,0.2839222487173928,0.253786535495007,-0.4571428571428569,0.2357256520329893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.454545454545454,4.363636363636363,-0.4639225263742247,1.3757161126409487,0.17581693160074294,0.043480750030250516,-0.2173080987269551,-0.19031488420717926

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A new pill has been developed that could replace the need for external injections. The pill was developed to replace the need to inject insulin externally by deploying a spring-loaded needle through skin and muscle, but it can be used as an alternative method of delivering any kind of active ingredient if you're in need of medication or need something injected into your arm. The device is being described as safer than traditional injection pens because all drugs are delivered directly into the bloodstream via capillary action instead of injecting them under the skin which leads to pain, bleeding, infection risks etc. After this first step, the researchers will go on to create self-healing coatings made with living cells which should sustainably deliver drug molecules.

While blood tests are conducted regularly and those who have problems with their diabetes control levels receive intravenous infusions when needed, the new topical option would ensure continuity without the patient having to undergo multiple painful (and sometimes risky) invasive treatments every year.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond s are one of nature's hardest materials, but they tend not to occur naturally on Earth because it takes very high pressures (1 million times higher than what occurs in the deepest part of our planet) for them to form from carbon under normal conditions. Now, researchers say that this new method could be used to make diamond deposits on earth as well as create synthetic diamonds on other planets like Mars or Ceres in space - an idea NASA is studying right now. The technique also has potential applications beyond mining and manufacturing purposes; its use might help determine whether certain types of hydrocarbons can sustain life. The study was published today in Science Advances. Diamonds aren't easy to find Discovery of natural diamonds was once considered to be rare phenomena, but recent studies show otherwise: diamonds appear to be abundant within meteorites and ice samples taken by spacecraft during their journeys through outer solar system destinations such as Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan. Scientists estimate there are roughly 1 billion carats (one carat equals 200 milligrams) worth of these gems lying beneath the surface of those bodies. That would amount to more than 1 trillion worth of gem quality material if properly mined. [What Is 'Ice Billionaire' Elon Musk Worth?] This places the research behind creating artificial diamonds and harnessing the element known as carbon next to real-world possibilities. ""If you want to get down production,"" says Luca Bindi, lead author of the paper who works at both Stanford and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ""you need one thing above all else: pressure."" Despite being one of the most common elements on Earth, making a single atom out of it requires extremely high temperatures and long periods of time. A typical laboratory setup uses up to 15 gigapascals of force - about 100 million atmospheres - along with hundreds of degrees Celsius over many hours or days to accomplish just this task; it doesn't take much longer than 5 minutes until someone starts fiddling with your diamond to destroy it. This makes perfect sense when we think about how hard diamond really is. It contains 90 percent carbon atoms bound together by 60 hydrogen bonds per square nanometer - basically, lots of small buildings packed tightly together. Such a structure makes it incredibly resistant against chemical etching and easily damaging physical forces. In fact, according to past experiments conducted at Harvard University, diamond appears immune to friction and any kind of wear associated with erosion, meaning it lasts forever unless something actually cuts or wears it away entirely. But even though diamond turns out to have some amazing properties for industrial application, it still isn't stable enough for everyday human consumption. Before going out to dinner, you'd better ensure that your food won't explode or spontaneously combust upon contact, lest anyone lose his appetite. Even then, you'll probably leave your house without worrying too deeply about whatever happens when you're gone. And yet, despite having no atmospheric constituents capable of destroying itself, diamonds remain fragile due to their unique atomic arrangement. If left alone, carbon can only endure so much stress before self-destructing. So scientists had to come up with ways to put extreme pressure onto them while keeping the temperature relatively steady. How do you snuff out a fire? You don't try putting water on top of it. Instead, you pour oxygen directly on it. But where does free oxygen exist outside of Earth's atmosphere? On Venus, scientists believe water vapor bridges between plants and clouds, which trap sunlight and turn it into energy that travels back toward us - thus fulfilling most definitions of photosynthesis. Similarly, methane gas molecules on mars extend chains far across the Martian landscape by connecting themselves via hydrogen bonding, allowing light to pass freely throughout large areas covered in dirt and sand. These two examples helped inspire Bindi and his colleagues to consider exploring similar mechanisms in more distant locations. If hydrocarbon gases existed on icy bodies like Ceres or Uranus, perhaps some combination of heating and pressurization techniques could generate diamonds as well. They began looking for answers on a smaller scale first using computer models and simulations at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. According to the team's calculations, simply applying high levels of CO2 gas to simulated rock surfaces at room temperature should cause clusters of carbon to bond together, forming graphite sheets. However, adding additional heat (5000C), specifically focused around those ""sheets"" created by high concentrations of CO2, caused carbon atoms deep inside to rearrange and bind together to become stronger molecular structures called sp3 crystals. Those later stages required less pressure, making the process easier overall. Also important was giving off extra energy to compensate for the added compression by considering the mechanism's impact on electrons instead of photons - in essence, explaining why the experiment worked. After repeating the simulation four separate times, the results were consistent each time. But none of the same applies quite heavy price constraints could apply again (and thus expectconsideration tests involve ever-lost ratios at the region's eryth function but",gpt_j,5.8106060606060606,5.5,5.3538461538461535,5.4375,5.2631578947368425,0.8418185207286858,0.4295722544763465,0.8740618335953765,0.7484623213200526,0.27425707124955206,0.8985217030924915,0.10906998362179617,0.7690275300849331,0.12394411955815493,0.7547608136575139,0.42105263157894735,1.017438617379913,1.8988203266787658,1.440997730821478,0.0,0.0,0.4812030075187969,1.0949435944386272,-0.3814555996983627,0.20309559178973652,0.5414273995077932,0.7204027949944682,0.46284829721362225,0.6975217662199131,-0.6665071770334929,0.12106268970442537,0.4842105263157894,1.3737238404275873,-0.6825657894736841,-0.08296193285234543,0.1022442733933043,0.6044954281731195,0.3651315789473684,2.1762038808899375,0.16194331983805654,0.5968133122381016,0.42666986129968315,0.33888457309357717,0.11027568922305796,0.5993387415179653,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.16007269816574266,5.963636363636364,6.7272727272727275,-0.45376263091865654,1.5996025449874653,0.3889644712656495,-0.8231635387791246,0.6998273505386475,0.695841140350778
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The Anglo-Dutch giant's chief executive Ben van Beurden accepted that Arctic drilling ""divides society,"" but said the world needs new sources of oil. Greenpeace said Shell was taking a ""massive risk"" in a ""pristine"" region. Shell also announced a 15bn (PS9.9bn) cut in global spending, and profit figures that disappointed investors. The cut in investment - spread over three years - comes after a fall in the oil price. Although the price is expected to remain lower in the medium term, Mr van Beurden said: ""We are taking a prudent approach here and we must be careful not to over-react to the recent fall in oil prices. ""Shell is taking structured decisions to balance growth and returns."" Shell also said profits for the last three months of 2014 had risen to 4.2bn compared with 2.2bn in the same period a year earlier. The numbers were below analysts' forecasts, prompting a big sell-off of Shell's shares, which were down by 4.3 at the end of Thursday. Shell put its Arctic plans on hold two years ago after a drilling vessel ran aground and legal wrangles in the US. The company has already spent 1bn on preparing its drilling work in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It was costing Shell several hundred millions of dollars a year to keep the existing operations ticking over, the company said. Mr van Beurden said there were still issues to resolve before drilling began, such as over operating permits and getting further facilities in place. But he hoped to see work begin in the summer. ""We will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly,"" Mr van Beurden told the BBC. ""I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks."" He also pointed out that there are already other energy companies operating in the Arctic. Mr van Beurden said that the world needs new sources of oil and gas to meet demand and that the Arctic offered potentially the biggest resource base ever found. Estimates have put the estimates at some 24bn barrels in Alaska. Environmentalists have campaigned against Shell for years. Greenpeace's Charlie Kronick, said: ""Despite announcing cuts [in global investment], Shell hasn't taken the opportunity to cut its most high-cost high-risk project. ""Shell is taking a massive risk doggedly chasing oil in the Arctic, not just with shareholder value, but with the pristine Arctic environment. ""A spill there will be environmentally and financially catastrophic. It's time for investors to recognise that it's impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oil."" As the first of the major oil companies to report its figures for last year, Shell plays the role of the canary in the coal mine - or on the oil rig. After a rather sickly 2013, profits are actually up. But the impact of the low oil price is clearly biting. The company announced that it would be cutting investment over the next three years in new exploration and the development of oil and gas fields, a move that will raise fresh concerns about its business in the North Sea. Last summer Shell announced the loss of 250 jobs in Aberdeen. The chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, said that the company would not ""over-react"" to the oil price which has fallen by 60 since last June. And of course a low oil price means lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumers. He said though that Shell would look at further cuts if necessary. As well as the North Sea, the company's operations in Nigeria, where it recently paid a PS55m bill to clean up pollution after a major oil spill, and the Arctic will also come under increased scrutiny. Meanwhile, Shell's profits for the quarter after stripping out one-off items, such as asset sales and accounting changes, were 3.26bn. That is a 12 rise on the same period a year earlier but down from the 5.85bn in the June to September quarter. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ""As expected, fourth quarter performance has been impacted by the lower oil price, although downstream refining operations have provided some counterbalance. ""More broadly, the numbers are below forecast, with the news providing a difficult start to the oil majors' results season. ""In all, and despite the disappointing numbers, the dividend payment remains core, with the payment being left unchanged."" Shell said it was spending 12bn on dividends to shareholders in 2014, and also repurchased 3.3bn of its own shares. The group said it had slowed the pace of share buybacks to conserve cash and that near-term oil prices would dictate how it progressed. Oil prices have fallen by almost 60 since June because of weak global demand and a boom in US shale production. Shell's main rivals, BP and Total, have also announced large cutbacks in capital expenditure in recent weeks.",human,5.3106060606060606,6.333333333333333,5.323076923076923,5.515625,6.421052631578948,-0.3589760295867907,-0.06969769916027083,-0.24614262597716396,-0.07186769995309814,-0.2955228603069136,0.2277858568346076,-0.21687171162008323,0.27668746937484606,-0.15927361469997098,0.34454213806429995,0.011627906976744207,0.1397732159219571,0.44747393744987973,0.481455534472595,0.0,0.0,-0.016611295681063152,0.44133736865196765,-0.15309140725475093,-0.15259623411590117,-0.29990270332144153,0.12087291798355584,-0.24008207934336537,0.2729101455186096,-0.38033826638477786,0.21715197136153847,-0.08372093023255811,0.2628764088872224,0.06904069767441873,0.7742074616272256,0.03260946925500738,0.334758060689432,-0.03052325581395354,0.4947929118114545,-0.3041144901610018,0.16460532715979315,0.5351778005199327,0.6236530830799085,0.23920265780730907,0.5769720771893058,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.1507148999629735,2.7818181818181817,4.7272727272727275,0.27327397691851574,1.2346895735902466,0.7142891851224685,0.38614532044724237,-0.4124873006673596,-0.4246245759874746

More recently, the idea has been applied in various contexts, such as the DevOps community with The Top 100 DevOps Misconceptions. This repository is an effort to apply the idea to the domain of software development, with the goal of collecting the most common and widely held misconceptions that developers believe about themselves and their craft. If you have an idea for a Falsehoods article, please check the contribution guidelines and then submit an issue. If you're interested in maintaining this project, please submit a pull request or an issue.",llama_65B,0.4621212121212121,0.5,0.5230769230769231,0.484375,0.10526315789473684,1.077798803494696,1.7476873599355967,1.1703241005311706,1.2439141037585713,-0.09183673469387763,-0.023409194184496253,0.06476030277544155,0.14943402633679018,-0.043209876543209715,0.2154774228116866,-0.375,0.06924550854727403,-0.04525862068965513,0.38118578765791894,0.25,0.4330127018922193,0.24999999999999986,0.15707613696883804,-0.3162808633593673,0.15507924362593203,-0.14766201804758006,-0.14840048395519806,0.19117647058823534,-0.03796539529010771,-0.6204545454545455,-0.07852553204592409,0.55,0.8910556013471553,1.2109375,0.6876887472923455,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,-0.37499999999999994,-0.04206938852807463,-0.2692307692307693,0.16254646097553943,-0.13075366717248352,-0.054856880516334326,-0.49206349206349187,-0.4232667280450236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.6363636363636364,0.4679882878173257,-0.09625642559561255,0.5912451064452022,-0.9266923606767712,0.5868374574145429,0.4628270961540625

There were no passengers on board, but the capsule can carry up to six people in the future. The mission included tests of the capsule's automated landing system, as well as additional tests of its flight computers and avionics systems. After an approximately 10-minute flight, the booster successfully landed at Blue Origin's west Texas launch site while the capsule touched down with a parachute. This was the first time that the New Shepard rocket booster has flown four consecutive missions. The reusable rocket booster is powered by a single BE-3 liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen engine, which produces 110,000 pounds of thrust. The capsule is equipped with large windows for passengers to take in the view of space. Following the completion of the test flight, Blue Origin plans to begin flights with human passengers sometime this year.",text-davinci-003,0.3939393939393939,0.5,0.3076923076923077,0.28125,0.21052631578947367,0.3286250564131304,-0.1403328969026719,0.0667985744839334,-0.016583478696501952,-0.24489795918367352,-0.7610947383690516,-0.3885618166526493,-0.5951158378807108,-0.46450617283950596,-0.6768401742687105,0.0,0.15343569967767595,-0.04525862068965513,0.38118578765791894,0.0,0.0,0.6249999999999999,-0.16741075646195408,-0.3162808633593673,-0.09173182404048638,-0.5783429040196882,-0.7440867991641078,-0.09558823529411767,-0.23984539364454427,-0.9704545454545455,-0.21549891213021075,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,0.5078125000000001,-0.2588932094134688,0.25195910229064267,-0.016840188228817395,0.0,-0.04206938852807463,-0.38461538461538464,-0.30227121577049887,-0.13075366717248352,-0.054856880516334326,-0.603174603174603,-0.5541078992968186,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.33071891388307384,0.23636363636363636,0.18181818181818182,0.24950594734968232,0.05775642293152308,-0.13120073031618412,0.09374491262906597,-0.18727430076152474,-0.38747333805293005

The platform aims to provide users the best features of other social media, but without the censorship. Current social media platforms ban users for offenses such as misgendering someone or making negative comments towards certain groups. Thinkspot will also subsidize content creators directly with a payment system similar to Patreon. It will have a minimum word limit for posts, which Peterson hopes will encourage more thoughtful discussions. Content can also be voted on by users. Comments which receive too many negative votes will be automatically hidden by the platform, but not deleted. Thinkspot is currently in beta and will be launched in August.",human,0.12121212121212122,0.5,0.046153846153846156,0.078125,-0.10526315789473684,0.9073196235609698,0.3937119423335575,0.927809165590643,0.3742041909122727,-0.8571428571428571,-0.611186958319752,-0.9390243902439024,-0.7429981137626439,-0.8858024691358022,-0.7416716507398472,0.5,0.6499640540098776,0.3297413793103448,0.24655830040189852,0.0,0.0,-0.5000000000000001,-0.353697645260084,-0.552151337729065,-0.4685587001981916,-0.5783429040196882,-0.36782087856405304,-0.573529411764706,-0.7225892933806713,0.07954545454545464,0.263740420474406,-0.19999999999999996,0.0,-0.7812499999999999,-0.03148411385163844,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.5624999999999999,-0.17749575895105157,-0.6153846153846154,-0.2480954548496517,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.8253968253968252,-0.7313313237200483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272727272727272,0.45454545454545453,-0.036957024728211725,-0.18430070232235155,0.5567715499192438,-0.39619877563590217,-0.1597535020635712,-0.35927859968954545
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Many dog breeds are about appearance, but plenty of others are devoted to specific tasks. A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog breed intelligence. The study found that some dog breeds are more skilled in certain tasks than others. For example, breeds like border collies, poodles, and German shepherds were found to be highly skilled in tasks related to obedience and working intelligence, while breeds like beagles and basset hounds scored highly on tasks related to scent intelligence. Similarly, Siberian huskies and Bernese mountain dogs displayed high levels of instinctive intelligence related to tracking and hunting, while toy breeds like chihuahuas and pugs showed low levels of working intelligence but high levels of companion intelligence. It's important to remember that intelligence in dogs can't be measured solely by IQ or academic performance. Every dog has unique strengths and personalities that make them special and valuable. It's up to us as pet owners to provide them with the love, care, and training they need to reach their full potential.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.5757575757575758,0.5,0.4307692307692308,0.4375,0.42105263157894735,0.5337829507099693,0.6500296074314046,0.18635514154236846,0.46974718510633146,0.16326530612244886,0.5895122339595915,-0.1295206055508831,-0.4006295086410165,-0.14043209876543192,-0.3246484015264928,0.875,0.7490056111572442,-0.04525862068965513,0.09725300779910925,0.0,0.0,1.1607142857142856,1.6059094859388656,-0.846989430691187,-0.7964397891382146,0.11074651353568489,0.5097540218479211,0.573529411764706,0.6978496859554455,-0.2704545454545454,0.3626216812306879,1.8,2.6128413926332423,-0.8984374999999999,-0.3802454389142382,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,0.18749999999999997,0.8721627943624909,-0.15384615384615388,0.8802923024912752,0.0653768335862418,0.018172924107269613,-0.15873015873015855,0.14583774682639045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41818181818181815,0.2727272727272727,0.23170908335730306,0.2226433694701565,-0.18308400936862962,-0.1807050314183906,0.20511294075614847,0.3338488111266491

A lot of people are already sponsoring other projects. However, most sponsors are only sponsoring one project. I'll show you how to reach out to sponsors to get more money to your project. I'll show you how to create a compelling sponsorship page to entice new sponsors. I'll also show you how to reach out to existing sponsors to encourage them to increase the amount they're sponsoring.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"NSFW.js allows for client-side content filtering, meaning that image files can be classified before it reaches the server. It classifies images into one of 5 categories: drawing, hentai, neutral, porn, and sexy. This can be useful for various applications, such as creating a safe browsing environment for children or filtering out inappropriate content from user-generated content platforms. The NSFW.js library utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of the image and determine its classification. However, it is important to note that no algorithm is foolproof and there is always a risk of false positives or false negatives. Additionally, users can always find ways to circumvent content filtering measures, so it is important to use NSFW.js in conjunction with other safety measures and educate users on appropriate online behavior.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.20454545454545456,0.16666666666666666,0.15384615384615385,0.140625,0.3684210526315789,1.074554777104881,1.225777947357805,1.6047723961345761,1.0317811137764383,0.0498866213151928,-0.1657422605354714,-0.08634707036725554,-0.1834433170121448,-0.15123456790123424,-0.17008065310932688,1.0,1.379942339517632,0.017241379310344803,0.5326040236897478,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999999998,0.0,-0.8863011764194699,-0.8364845747348945,0.19688269073010653,-0.10628005352021795,-0.12745098039215677,0.28370075321634564,0.021212121212121196,0.1838941644991086,0.8,0.24560695618008344,-0.6249999999999999,0.07532992820918757,-0.0973754984698136,0.2602393291521843,-0.18749999999999997,0.0,0.0,-0.6448186670282035,0.5230146686899342,0.3914407699832597,0.5079365079365081,0.39666663533583857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.09090909090909091,-0.022879716681999115,-0.00466759969547236,-0.17198340082717625,-1.362526335697253,0.9557829223610215,1.023042473931664

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Police are investigating events linked to the funeral and wake of the mother of INLA man Patsy O'Hara, who died in the 1981 hunger strike. Dozens of people wearing military-style uniforms were seen at a Dublin pub with their faces covered - dubbed 'the squad'. People gathered outside the Irish Workers Republican Party (IRSP) headquarters on 25 August 1982 for a memorial service held by members of his family. But only one ceremony took place. Patsy was laid out in an open coffin that day next to three coffins containing other dead activists from both sides: Patrick Gillespie and Jim Ryan from Sinn Fein; David Ervine and Gerry Kelly from PIRA, as well as Rosie Kane whose body had been recovered some weeks earlier. The 17 republicans buried under this mass grave fought for political change through violence. Most of them were Catholic workers and trade unionists killed during The Troubles between 1969 and 1998. Their families believe they were murdered by loyalist paramilitary groups because of their politics or republican involvement in bombing campaigns against Britain's overseas security forces. There is no suspicion of murder but there may have been collusion from within Northern Ireland's law enforcement agencies. That would explain why none of those police officers involved appear ever to have faced prosecution. No charges have yet been brought over the shooting deaths of 13 civilians. That year also saw the publication of H BlockA4 paper stories detailing alleged state torture carried out at Portlaoise Prison around the time of the funerals where dozens of secret graves were found outside Lisburn barracks. In 2008 former IRA prisoner Kevin Lynch won damages when he sued Stormont's justice minister Lord Justice Peter Charleton after he ordered him not to give evidence about prison conditions while having suffered electric shocks and beatings at Castlereagh jail in 1975. Mr Lynch later helped ex-prisoners mark the 20th anniversary of these activities last month. Another claimant, John Teggart of Newtownstewart near Omagh, has described how his father was shot and killed by RUC men following his release in 1976. His death remains unsolved. This week Robert McCartney revealed more details of what happened after Pat Dunne Jr was arrested and imprisoned in 1977. He said soldiers ""tied me up like a rat"" before torturing him into confessing to being part of PIRA. It appears now that another soldier and two policemen also confessed to murdering Patsy although many inside nationalist circles doubt such confessions can be trusted. Mr Lennon strongly suspects the truth will emerge sooner rather than later if it hasn't already. One theory I have heard bandied about is that maybe someone wanted to make sure all eyes would be focused elsewhere during such a public display. A motive might include avoiding further embarrassment that could come from revelations about the 'Squad' operation which took place shortly afterwards. I personally don't endorse anything involving paramilitaries of any description armed or unarmed as ""legitimate protest."" It is simply wrong whether you're protesting ANWR drilling, fracking, waterboarding or whatever else. However as we've been telling our readers since 2003, calling people terrorists isn't going anywhere either, so let's turn the tables and ask... what does terrorism mean? Terrorism means killing innocent humans and sometimes animals at random in order to force your agenda onto others, usually without even asking permission first. Terrorism is using terror tactics against innocents. When the British Empire attacked Russia in WW1 using gas warfare we call that terrorism too. Is such behaviour legitimate or should we condemn it, regardless of its motives? In 2007 The U2 singer Bono published a book called Songs Of Innocence in which he called himself a terrorist - defined as follows:- ""Someone or something responsible for a series of violent acts designed to frighten people."" This is exactly what Patsy did - he violated international laws and created fear among the local population with brutal methods towards innocents. So instead of criticising us for refusing to accept government fairytales about flowers turning into bullets turning into bombs, perhaps the real question here is - do the actions themselves justify the word? Or, put another way, is the use of the term justified in the circumstances? Let's examine each case separately then move on to considering wider issues. To begin with Che Guevara. Was he really a good guy or just an idealistic idiot? If you read his own words he admitted he didn't always act morally during his lifetime but based on the text of his speeches delivered since his assassination he comes across as pretty unashamedly bloodthirsty. And given his famous stance on free education worldwide which meant closing down most churches and schools in Bolivia in 1964 the concept of human rights seems quite alien to him. So yes, I'd say there was plenty of justification for putting him in charge of gunning down journalists, doctors, priests etc. in places like Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. I'm still convinced he deserves the title of devil as far [with due emphasis received by reserve power users of course sterilizing much less desirable effect giving information property great value proposition.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Not everyone enjoys working from home, but finding an office-based job can be difficult now, especially since a company offering office jobs can be seen as a red flag. This is because many scammers will use the promise of a legitimate office job as an incentive to lure people into fraudulent work-at-home schemes. These kinds of schemes often promise thousands of dollars in ""unlimited income,"" but that income is rarely seen because of the substantial upfront costs. Here are some things to watch out for and some tips to help you avoid office-based work-at-home scams: If you receive an unsolicited email offering you a job with a company, then the company is probably a scam. Companies should never ask you to pay anything to get a job, and if they do, it's probably a scam. The company doesn't have a physical address on their website or on any other site. The company will not provide a phone number or an address for their office. The company requires a fee for materials or training. The company uses a free email provider for their domain, such as gmail.com or yahoo.com. The company requires you to forward payment to a personal account or individual. The company offers a large payment for your services, but no face-to-face meeting. A company asks you to cash checks for their clients and wire the money to an overseas bank account. The company asks you to use your own bank account to transfer company money. The company offers a large payment for an ""easy"" job. The company asks you to give out your personal information. You can avoid these scams by doing a little research on the company offering you a job. Check the company's website for contact information and a physical address. If there are no business addresses, phone numbers, or the company is using a free email account, then the company is probably a scam. If you're looking for a job, then it's always a good idea to read reviews and research the company first. If you do find a work-at-home job and the company requires a fee for materials or training, then you should ask yourself if you're really going to make money. According to the FTC, if you have to pay to get a job, then it's probably a scam. If a company does require a payment for materials, then you should do some research to make sure that the company isn't a scam. When looking for an office-based job, you should always be careful, and if you feel that something doesn't add up, then it probably isn't.

The machine uses a cartridge that contains flavor compounds that can be combined to create the flavor of your choice and poured into Cana's proprietary carbonated water bottle, which is called Bubbles. The system basically combines cartridges with recyclable aluminum cans (the company doesn't have plans for glass bottles yet) in order to produce a beverage using whatever mix of flavor components you want within about 10 seconds. This isn't a new idea SodaStream machines are already available on store shelves; but those devices require extra tanks or add-ons if users don't get their soda exactly how they like it.

But Leicester were given hope when Jamie Vardy scored for them before half-time, but they failed to make the most of their advantage as Liverpool held on comfortably with another superb defensive display. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""We need time after this result. It is not about celebrating it now, I think we will celebrate because our performance was really good against Bournemouth - very positive. The whole team played so well together defensively that you are sleeping, eating and playing football at the same time."" Leicester City boss Craig Shakespeare: ""This is a game where if you don't start strongly then everything can change quickly. We didn't do enough right there first 10 minutes but gave ourselves chances to score which obviously proved costly thereafter.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The plant-based meat industry is now worth 800 million and accounts for two percent of packaged meat sales. Both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have started to expand their product lines beyond burgers, roasts, sausages, patties, and bacon; they are offering various cuts (stewing beef pot roast? Or pork shoulder?) as well as new ""meat"" products such as chicken nuggets made from wheat protein (the real thing) or fishless seafood in the form of crumbles that can be added to pasta sauce. While there will surely always be a place at the table for traditional meat like hamburger and steak, many consumers want more than just meat substitutes that taste similar but don't look much different. They want food with a story: something that tells them about its origins, where it has been produced, who guided its production process, how it was raised, fed, processed, and transported before reaching your plate ... show me the backstories! Nowhere else does this happen so prominently as when you order what appears to be an ordinary burger patty on a bun, topped by lettuce, tomato, ketchup, pickles, etc., and presented under the title ""Ground Beef."" If you peel away all those layers to reveal a white box next to a label bearing the words Auld Stootie shown below, I guarantee you that the truth behind every ingredient suddenly becomes very clear. The difference between these products and the average ground chuck is staggering - though not as dramatic as when you discover what happens after slaughter. Read my article here to learn why we should care what goes into our food and avoid products containing ingredients derived from animals that were tortured first. At Subway restaurants across Canada, customers unknowingly ordered exactly one thing instead of another while ordering online: turkey breast sub sliders. An investigation conducted by CBC News revealed that since August 2016, Canadian locations offered customers both a regular turkey sandwich without bread and a vegetarian option of chickpea flour buns stuffed with deli slices. In addition, some of the sandwiches included cheese sticks, which did not appear on any other menu item. According to Subway franchise owner Stefanos Kousouris, employees chose the wrong items at random during busy periods. From the time he bought his first restaurant 12 years ago until today, he says he never had problems with mislabeled foods - until last summer. He told CBC: ""I thought maybe it's going out because people wanted the Vegetarian Slider."" But then he got a call from someone who said she'd seen the same problem at her local store. And even worse - she found nothing edible inside the bag. As 2018 began bringing us ever closer towards the end of the year, the world seemed full of worry - over epics like Brexit, Trumpism, migration issues, climate change, nuclear war, gender inequality, fake news, and arms trade. We also saw strange things around us: protests against Monsanto, refugee youths burning down an old border fence, Russia becoming president again, and scientists warning that we face a mass extinction event because humanity is failing to meet the challenges facing Earth. Meanwhile, corporations continued making profits by selling commodities ranging from clothessocksshoes to weapons and automobiles, with the help of governments. These political events and economic trends affected rations stock levels worldwide. As if it wasn't bad enough already, 2019 proved to be more of the same. Every day brought disturbing reports of environmental disasters from plastic pollution and ocean dead zones, deforestation, species extinctions, water shortages. What could possibly make the situation better? Everything except foolish optimism. It seems that the aforementioned political upheavals weren't so good either. By the opening days of January, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation repealing Obama-era Dodd Frank regulations created specifically to prevent banks once again engaging in fraudulent lending practices. This move further weakened regulation over Wall Street, allowing the big banks to continue wreaking havoc upon US citizens through irresponsible lending and unregulated investments. On top of that, the Federal Reserve announced three rate hikes to keep interest rates low, in spite of new evidence showing signs of labor market slackening affecting growth prospects globally. While stocks rose following the Fed decision, experts warned that the downward spiral would soon start rolling itself onwards once investors realized that inflationary pressures remain intact. With US equities trading at record highs based on minimal fundamental reasons, it doesn't take too long before speculation takes priority over actual earnings potential - especially when corporate earnings and revenues go unannounced. Just ask ExxonMobil whose annual report is due out later this week. The company didn't release financial results in 2017, and no estimated figures were released early in December despite being listed publicly. To further compound matters, OPEC refused to alter output quotas, ensuring that global oil prices remained stubbornly high throughout 2018. Several large companies including Apple, Netflix, Google, Uber were forced to cut costs after posting disappointing quarterly performance.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The Dundee-based company said shareholders had wanted changes to be made to improve performance. Chief financial officer Alan Trotter is to leave Alliance Trust, while chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox is to step down from the board. The financial services company's share price rose when trading opened following the announcement. Alliance Trust had been facing demands for a change in governance from US-based activist investor Elliott Advisers. The firm aims to simplify its structures and reduce costs by PS6m per year by the end of 2016, although details of staff cuts or other efficiency measures have not been announced. Ms Garrett-Cox leaving the board means it now consists solely of non-executive directors, making it fully independent. In a letter to shareholders, chairman Karin Forseke said the changes would take effect ""as soon as practicable,"" and no later than March 2016. She said: ""The actions we have announced represent some of the biggest changes in our history, and are designed to further improve shareholder value. ""Implementation will require considerable further work by the team, but we believe that as a result Alliance Trust will be significantly better positioned for the future."" Managers at Alliance Trust, the venerable Dundee finance house, have been under siege for years. Having had to sue for peace earlier this year, the terms are now clearer, and they mean a radical change of direction. A cut in costs of 20 will feel painful at the Tayside headquarters. Non-core assets are being sold, and new benchmarks are being set, with regular overviews to check how management of the fund performs against the market. They've been ahead of their benchmark since last year, but if they don't perform adequately in future, the board members brought on by activist investors will re-consider the decision not to contract out fund management to another company. The scale of the change to the Trust's strategy, and the clipping of senior executives' influence, by removing them from the board, is such that you might expect the resignations of chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox andor chairwoman Karin Forseke. However, this follows consultation with the full range of shareholders, and the long-term smaller ones may see the current bosses as their best protection against short-term profit-taking. With lead activist investor Elliot Advisers upping its stake recently, this is an uneasy-looking settlement.",human,2.212121212121212,2.0,2.046153846153846,2.046875,2.473684210526316,0.35534254067436055,0.33370211005534006,0.17047888508367243,0.22722771695927346,0.3073229291716685,0.2906858122939721,0.16761490130114268,0.6467045554140893,0.14360929557008004,0.5282142839015187,0.6176470588235294,0.7375811345975919,0.5172413793103448,1.0509310553541427,0.0,0.0,0.4453781512605041,0.5227146411021028,-0.021442770397245223,0.35595558893371776,0.15634801910920237,0.3058787854905654,0.20242214532871972,0.4280546354741599,0.7074866310160429,0.4339284237129125,-0.0235294117647058,0.31715939431135814,0.26654411764705893,0.3358937184044234,-0.28525293081157155,-0.12598517162910122,0.3860294117647058,1.2267618536554836,-0.09954751131221724,0.3499558078446192,0.3076556874646672,0.19178391624376454,0.6125116713352009,0.1723650477018972,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.23529411764705885,1.8181818181818181,2.0,-0.014412409477232739,0.82334383360049,0.16607124262505019,-0.22724083897606348,0.3092113998399217,0.3706897189071388
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Researchers from Columbia University have established a method for growing human hair in a dish using 3D printing without the need for implantation into human skin. The method uses a combination of 3D printing and biotechnology to create hair follicles that can produce hair. This breakthrough could potentially revolutionize the hair transplant industry and provide an alternative to traditional hair restoration methods. The technique involves the creation of a ""scaffold"" that mimics the structure of hair follicles, which is then seeded with human dermal papilla cells and keratinocytes. The cells then grow and differentiate to create hair shafts, which can be harvested for transplantation or cosmetic use. The potential applications of this method also extend to developing new treatments for hair loss and related conditions.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.17424242424242425,0.16666666666666666,0.06153846153846154,0.0625,-0.21052631578947367,1.4864406318182208,2.004998791476921,1.2997531347330693,1.219208971305269,-0.04081632653061233,-0.585952010559012,-0.34538828146902173,-0.5409120232045942,-0.36728395061728375,-0.5918975903773867,0.5,0.0,0.017241379310344803,-0.2988158729538991,0.0,0.0,1.0714285714285714,-0.46425672068931473,-0.8076776849629042,-0.5891342264143321,-0.032813781788351294,-0.576511603609788,0.0,0.5029232535361224,-0.44545454545454544,-0.40743055071866713,0.8,0.24560695618008344,0.6250000000000001,-0.09916621699270302,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.4375,-0.07576923428973634,-0.46153846153846156,-0.20272151977280484,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.677248677248677,-0.06657909744241444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.3715186328666638,-0.14949925105709885,0.20514127335446958,-1.0602169189648618,0.7036845621324548,0.5483572370775596

There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in recent years, as consumers have become more aware of their single-use nature. While the average household uses 55 bags per year, that figure is now thought to be closer to 175 on busy days - when you add in carry out orders from restaurants or takeaways. But many people are using them once they get home too, finding ways to use them again and again. Plastic bag levy: What happens next? Show all 6 1 6 Plastic bag levy: What happens next?

A Premier League winner while on loan at Leicester last season, Dyer will be hoping to add more silverware this season as he looks to put an end to QPR's recent poor form and establish himself in Slaven Bilic's first team It is a move that has surprised many so far in pre-season given how well he looked during his first two appearances for the club against Rotherham United and Fulham in midweek and then again versus the Foxes on Friday evening. But it seems unlikely there would have been much surprise had Dyer signed permanently - not least because reports earlier in May suggested he was keen to return to Loftus Road. ""If you can't do anything wrong here then your career doesn't deserve to continue,"" said Hoddle when asked about whether Harry Redknapp should consider bringing back one of his former players from abroad.

Officials at the park said they imposed a 10,000 rupee (130) fine on the couple for the violation. The incident has highlighted the issue of irresponsible behaviour by some tourists in India's national parks, which are home to thousands of wild animals including tigers, lions and leopards. India is home to more than 40 tiger reserves and other wildlife sanctuaries that attract thousands of visitors every year. But some visitors ignore warnings not to venture too close to the animals, often with tragic results.

Wales are in fourth place in the qualifying group, six points behind leaders Serbia and four behind second-placed Ireland. Serbia play Georgia in the other match on Sunday.

On his new contract with Real, Bale said he had ""unfinished business"" in the Spanish capital. ""It's the best club in the world. I'm happy to be part of the history of this club and hopefully more in the future,"" he said. ""The main thing is that the club has shown faith in me and I've shown faith in them. ""It's all about winning trophies, and we have to try and do that year in year out and do better than last year."" Who will be in Wales' team to face Serbia? Aaron Ramsey, Bale and Joe Allen will form the midfield behind Gareth Bale, with Ben Davies, James Chester and Chris Gunter the back three. Torrential rain in Belgrade means the match is likely to be played in a very wet and humid atmosphere, with temperatures predicted to be in the high 20s on Sunday. Wales have won two and lost two of their last six games. They were beaten 1-0 by Albania in their last match in November. In their last away qualifier, Wales won 1-0 in Moldova.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that represented Arsenal's worst defeat since 1896. Wenger sent out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this cannot excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career, but Ashley Young also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott reduced United's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited, broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal, teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this season when he was sent off. Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday. For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inaction Read more of the blog This result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance. Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny. Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth. Media playback is not supported on this device With the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea. It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear. Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra. And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot. Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career. Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.

This understanding then enables the successful implementation of marketing automation tactics such as lead nurturing. Without tracking user interactions across several touchpoints throughout their journey using analytics software, marketers run the risk of wasting valuable opportunities to engage potential buyers through personalized messaging based on those consumer's particular journeys.[86] For example, let's say a company is selling its new sugar-free energy drink, and targeted consumers via social media ads for the product. Not only did an ad drive interest in the brand, but now the sales team needs to track web traffic and online orders that stem directly from social media exposure to determine ROI. Marketing automation tracks all leads from initial impression to purchase and can correlate individual marketing activities to generate overall return on investment.

Affiliate networks operate much like referral programs, except that instead of receiving a set percentage of revenue made off of referred sales, affiliates receive a fixed fee per sale. Affiliates are expected to promote the seller's products in an appealing way that attracts visitors who might become future buyers. Many affiliate network marketers report that commissions can reach up to 40 percent or higher. It depends upon the network. ClickBank, one of the largest affiliate networks offer Pay Per Sale, where affiliates earn a commission fee on every sale generated from their promoted links. Commissions range between 10-75. Once a sale is made, payment is immediately processed. Overall, Amazon offers some great opportunities for making money online as an affiliate.

Full-back Rob Kearney has a hamstring injury with his brother Dave, a winger, ruled out with a knee injury. The trio's loss depletes a squad already missing Munster fly-half Ian Keatley, who broke a leg against Wales in March. Ireland will now name a 40-man training squad on Tuesday instead of the previously scheduled 45-man group. It is the second successive year Leinster players have been badly hit by injury in the Pro12 final. Cian Healy, Sean O'Brien, Jamie Heaslip, Sexton and Jack McGrath missed the first two Tests against South Africa last June because of injuries sustained in the defeat by Glasgow Warriors. The 2015 series against the Springboks was the first time Ireland had failed to win a Test against South Africa on home soil. Sexton, who has 48 caps for Ireland, was at fault for Connacht's decisive try in the Pro12 final as he missed a tackle on Matt Healy who touched down to put the Westerners 20-10 ahead.

It claims the mountains' archaeology, ecology, peatland and Bronze Age cairns are among the things ""under threat."" Funding has also been set aside to improve the heritage of Holy Island, off Anglesey. The initial funding approval for the Carneddau Landscape Partnership means the seven-year project can now seek the full PS1.9m grant. The project, led by Snowdonia National Park Authority, will cover 81 sq miles (210 sq km) which features Carnedd Llywelyn as its highest peak. Jonathan Cawley, the national park authority's director of planning and land management, said: ""We are truly excited about working on such an important project which will be of enormous benefit to the local communities and to the natural and cultural heritage of the mountains."" Of the funding set aside to improve Holy Island, Anglesey council has been awarded PS117,200 to develop plans on behalf of the Tir a Mor Landscape Partnership. The plans will be presented to the Heritage Lottery Fund at a later date to seek final approval for the full PS1.2m grant. They include projects which celebrate Holy Island's culture and landscape, involving people who live and work there. Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, said: ""Heritage Lottery Fund money works hard to ensure all of our important heritage is looked after. ""But it's not all about grand old buildings, castles and museums. There is natural heritage all around us, especially here in Wales, which is vital to our economy, our livelihoods and our wellbeing.""",human,1.2651515151515151,1.1666666666666667,1.0615384615384615,1.15625,1.736842105263158,0.1828363170760712,-0.0712267810119245,0.08204754199238677,-0.09749975167333955,0.1972789115646257,0.2479786223341495,-0.06476030277544155,0.2035039859733508,0.04320987654321018,0.3475693061150302,0.16666666666666674,0.844843845863703,0.39224137931034475,0.3900922970261288,0.0,0.0,-0.07142857142857155,-0.014814969307661751,1.0399743642663943,0.6325341166060947,-0.2050861361771946,0.15474467602663225,-0.06372549019607855,0.4505114592674679,0.13787878787878807,-0.11318697773939701,0.4666666666666668,1.5432169510825549,0.23437500000000022,1.3143448652750411,-0.1971853844013725,0.10088897275771923,0.3125,0.13982640255277878,0.3076923076923076,0.8802923024912752,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,0.7301587301587303,0.6277816887444491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7636363636363637,1.4545454545454546,0.23998986157456706,0.36572618953340363,0.5395347716562647,-0.10454284955264496,0.17013980202941553,0.17702143458065245
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Elon Musk has revealed that he has a design for a submarine car, like the one from the James Bond movie 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. As a child, Musk was fascinated by submarines and knew they were essential to any future space mission. ""My father said it would be really cool if you could drive around under water [in your own vehicle],"" Musk told an audience at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas on Monday (25 March). ""I thought about this as a kid because I'm always looking up into the sky thinking about what's above us."" On Saturday night, Musk posted pictures of his new Tesla Roadster 3D print-out onto Twitter with the caption: ""Tried talking to Elon Musk but he is busy designing the world's best submarine. Trying again after 12 hours... 3dprinting."" The images show a black shape inside what appears to be some sort of tank attached to the roof. There are no words or captions overlaid on them. But given how much time has passed since Musk originally tweeted those photos, we can infer that the man driving the Roadster - either himself or someone else sitting behind the wheel - isn't happy about having been left out of this conversation. Musk then began tweeting details regarding the internal design specifications for this hypothetical underwater vehicle. He described it as being able to travel through the ocean floor without hitting the ground first and possessing several features similar to those found on SpaceX rockets, including the ability to land itself back on earth when necessary. SpaceX have now begun building the Falcon Heavy rocket which will carry their Dragon capsule further than ever before. If all goes well, the launch is due to take place some time between June and August next year. This morning, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled plans to send humans to Mars within the coming decades. In order for a manned flight mission to succeed successfully, however, there needs to be enough food available to sustain the crew throughout their long journey to the Red Planet. While Musk didn't go too far into providing exact details as yet, he did make reference to a recent study published in the journal Astrobiology by researchers from NASA, Cornell University, Pitzer College and Rice University (link). According to the report, human settlement near Earth's equator - where temperatures remain consistently low during most parts of the year - would require a large amount of arable farmland and fresh drinking water. A major concern here is whether such resources might come dangerously close to running out over the period of many years needed to complete such a lengthy trip! What does the data say? Can our planet support life even beyond 2070?, asks Metzger in her book Why Extinction Matters, referring to research conducted by Stephen O'Brien of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. For example, what happens when crops fail due to drought or pests; when water tables drop below bottomless wells; when glaciers disappear or rainforests become so degraded that nothing remains alive? What happens when carbon dioxide levels rise past dangerous levels? Humans already live in many places unsuitable for habitation above sea level or high latitudes, far away from oceans and underground volcanic activity. Yet despite the fact that the United States alone contains millions of square miles suitable only for hunting game, virtually every city dweller knows nary a trace about its true geography. But once the species becomes aware of areas appropriate for landing, growing, breeding, living, working, dying, reproducing, sleeping, fighting, loving, praying, eating, laughing, grieving, suffering, resting, crying, making war, doing business, dreaming, holding hands, baking bread, knitting sweaters, growing pot, writing sonnets, raping children, going insaneand other activities still less considered proper in polite societywe know that a single stretch of coastline doesn't quite suffice anymore, not unless the whole nation actually buys the entire shoreline and lives atop it. We realize, rather late, that our small island home won't do very well for thousands more people living here. Our economy cannot grow sufficiently fast enough to keep pace with population expansion. There simply aren't enough factories, ports, shipping lanes, roads and railroads for everyone. We already consume energy faster than the planet renews it, using fossil fuels whose production may someday cause climate change so severe that current civilization collapses toward extinction. Those who'll lose everything won't be just ourselves but also ecosystems upon ecosystems, each lost habitat adding another step to disappearance, until we're facing extinction event number 11. No matter how great our technological skill or ingenuity, we stand poised to destroy civilization. Only if we stop playing God, care for nature wisely, forgive ourselves for trampling on Mother Nature, learn humility towards fellow beings who think alike, bravely face reality and admit planetary limits, relinquish power and responsibility, commit to harmony, eschew violence, recognize global interdependency, depend equally on others instead of selfishness, trust in wisdom elsewhere among civilizations as much as compare to reevaluate the waste:think holdfast hope scarce possibilities now rest vie act apply better get rid out look fate resistance test results multiple store last time line rate potential",gpt_j,5.696969696969697,4.666666666666667,5.2615384615384615,5.21875,6.473684210526316,0.5274131740525555,0.006316948792108197,0.3778809328381794,0.3190027702350491,0.682745825602968,2.16489893067312,0.47098402018502944,0.9071604236989476,0.4222783389450056,0.8842072274722782,0.7727272727272729,1.7067756109360415,1.835423197492163,2.673806403921165,0.0,0.0,0.6233766233766231,2.170124971791334,-0.1358042125158865,0.6837731123736627,1.1156685808039373,4.360659581153355,0.40552584670231734,1.0254726419518627,-0.27575757575757587,0.516419382746682,0.1333333333333333,0.9653740783791637,-0.07102272727272721,0.76036925838679,-0.31514252232048756,-0.1500300738289672,0.06249999999999994,0.703265545184198,0.5174825174825174,0.4659210783399911,0.9033889731917044,0.7922114242423574,1.1005291005291005,3.964861956779064,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.17141982574219336,7.109090909090909,4.090909090909091,-0.6074509759815134,1.8323991793828547,-0.3987903898647137,-0.5641189289982198,0.7278259305892573,0.4435775692014646

""However, we remain keen to work with Messrs Levien and Kaplan and their representatives in order to ensure all parties pull together in the long-term interests of the football club. ""We are also keen to introduce improved governance and structure to the football club to ensure we have an effective plan for the coming season and beyond."" BBC Wales Sport revealed in April which of Swansea's directors would be selling all - or part - of their shareholdings. The previous shareholders took charge in 2002, at a time when Swansea were struggling in the lowest tier of the Football League, and oversaw their climb to the Premier League. Their shares were believed to have increased tenfold in worth by the time of the takeover in June 2016. Sumbler added: ""This is a key time for both Swansea City and the Supporters' Trust and it is in everyone's interest that we swiftly conclude negotiations so that, both on and off the field, we can concentrate on the new football season ahead."" When the takeover was ratified by the Premier League, a statement issued by Levien and Kaplan said they were keen to work with the Trust. ""There are still a few minor loose ends to tie up on the deal which we envisage will be completed before the end of the month,"" they said. ""In the meantime, we are both extremely excited to be part of a new era for Swansea City and working with Huw Jenkins and the Supporters' Trust in taking the club forward.""",human,2.1363636363636362,1.6666666666666667,2.4153846153846152,2.5,2.1578947368421053,-0.520123673971372,0.16585549500962482,-0.5857163534378051,-0.24737196566277078,0.6349206349206344,-0.0015483438788129063,0.9498177740398092,0.2769030155174248,1.0067901234567904,0.2710255946335506,-0.10000000000000009,0.02574364979234084,0.31724137931034485,0.29049517257342067,0.0,0.0,-0.11428571428571425,-0.38805154029747463,0.5131969715074028,0.6446467624628113,0.33470057424118127,-0.3882830846951117,0.5862745098039216,0.05846424466405465,0.3012121212121215,0.20660752919094239,1.0666666666666667,1.6643195540661107,1.21875,0.5404258382103336,-0.0973754984698136,0.10212544614376513,0.8624999999999998,0.6580021181568497,0.8923076923076921,0.9386418967524727,0.1046029337379869,0.1994780761926897,0.7449735449735451,0.19078674196879472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1090909090909091,1.2727272727272727,0.4720607059177357,0.6779288387273146,0.044478465731166233,0.29100278111074684,0.11949455489019488,0.23040977208843452

Dickinson, with Willem Nel and Ross Ford part of an all-Edinburgh first-choice Scotland front row, has returned from international duty for the run-in.

Voters there will be deciding whether to stay part of the United Kingdom or to become an independent nation. It's a decision that could shape the future of the UK, and it's one that Scots have been discussing for years. So what exactly is at stake? Well, the big question is whether Scotland would remain in the UK if they voted ""Yes"" to independence. Supporters of the Yes campaign say that if Scotland left the UK, they would still be a member of the European Union, but would not have the same level of representation or influence as they do now. This could mean that decisions made at an EU level could impact on Scotland more than they currently do. On the other hand, those who are against independence argue that being part of the UK gives Scotland more stability and security than it would have as an independent country. They also point out that Scotland benefits from the resources and services provided by the UK government. Ultimately, Scots will need to weigh up these pros and cons when considering their vote on Thursday. Whatever the outcome, it's sure to be an historic day.",text-davinci-003,0.9166666666666666,1.1666666666666667,1.4,1.359375,0.6842105263157895,-0.6122978448120804,0.12223964877009115,-0.2542174406302611,0.24793543635909723,-0.3242630385487527,0.27107486913424544,0.41014858424446327,0.7632655246427927,0.324074074074074,0.8072711375846124,-0.5833333333333334,-0.060065004385268406,0.017241379310344803,0.36862776479727366,0.25,0.5951190357119042,-0.642857142857143,-0.3802291673531063,-0.10006626185381115,-0.3755313176168787,-0.4347826086956521,0.08389171772130692,-0.3186274509803921,-0.31880116614182863,0.9545454545454548,0.6400759197773267,0.1333333333333333,0.3924920908537563,0.15625000000000008,0.5313129259303906,-0.0973754984698136,0.3710577329760866,-0.31249999999999994,0.3712099766848838,0.46153846153846145,0.03151133162833169,1.0460293373798686,0.755293702568957,-0.603174603174603,-0.17106441053438487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6363636363636364,1.0909090909090908,0.1762290804164049,0.2961696013074404,0.4370641607228063,0.4051725246371532,-0.439913167265297,-0.30286860013023414

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Around 155 countries are expected to formally sign the deal at the UN, setting in motion events that could see the treaty operational within a year. The UN says the treaty will ""set the world on a safer path"" and shift the responsibility for disarmament to countries that own nuclear weapons. The nine countries that have nuclear weapons will not be taking part in the signing ceremony. Israel has never admitted to having nuclear weapons but has never denied it either. The treaty, which prohibits the use, threat of use, development, testing, production, manufacturing and possession of nuclear weapons, was adopted by a UN conference in July. It will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by at least 50 countries. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the treaty represented ""an important step towards the universally-held goal of a world free of nuclear weapons."" ""There remain some fifteen thousand nuclear weapons in existence. We cannot allow these doomsday weapons to endanger our world and our children's future,"" he said. ""The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will make an important contribution towards our ultimate objective of achieving general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, including through a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons."" Those who support the treaty say it is a long overdue response to the grave risks posed by nuclear weapons, and also to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of these weapons. Nuclear disarmament campaigner Tim Wright, from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), said: ""The treaty represents the only rational response to the grave threat posed by nuclear weapons. ""It is also a clear indication of the majority opinion in the world, with a hundred and twenty-two countries having voted for the ban treaty at the UN, and only one against. ""There is no doubt that the ban treaty will provide a major boost for the disarmament movement, and I am confident that it will significantly increase the pressure on those countries that possess nuclear weapons to disarm."" However, those countries which have nuclear weapons - the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel - were not present during the negotiations and do not support the treaty. They say they will never give up their nuclear weapons. North Korea is the only country to have carried out a nuclear test this year. The US and Russia maintain around 14,000 nuclear weapons between them, and have been modernising their arsenals. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said during a visit to Japan that the treaty is ""simply not the answer."" ""This treaty will not make the world more peaceful, will not make the world safer, will not make the world more stable,"" she said. ""The hard reality in this day and age is that we need to ensure we have the defence and deterrence capabilities to respond to the growing threats that we see around the world.""",llama_65B,2.9545454545454546,2.6666666666666665,3.1538461538461537,3.1875,3.3157894736842106,0.18806564397595407,0.3223994552747256,0.27665928827943415,0.7276021763411274,0.34467120181405864,0.432109523418506,0.5304177179702831,0.4138622949540895,0.5277777777777779,0.37877541294713496,0.5952380952380953,1.5055072055465342,0.23152709359605914,0.46770861821681214,0.0,0.0,0.16326530612244877,0.4308546013018812,0.023484939006506764,0.9736656078464252,0.0,0.07728006510290034,-0.018207282913165205,0.5168852644989564,0.1545454545454547,0.032381818291969205,0.32380952380952377,0.9872608305421102,1.2723214285714288,1.5438565448248782,0.13076138365946402,0.5363259514720953,0.20535714285714277,1.2486460187701571,0.2857142857142857,0.4497538783317539,-0.2241491437242575,0.0400487180934994,1.0158730158730163,1.5657828089003274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9090909090909092,1.7272727272727273,0.3109925370898482,1.024508981383985,-0.0497767013888328,-0.3348944555795578,0.40151842233569346,0.47292929632830233

During a panel discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, United States, on Tuesday, the outspoken billionaire was asked by Bloomberg anchor Stephanie Ruhle to explain what exactly he meant by that. The Brewers are in the midst of a three-game series with the Reds this week. The Brewers-Reds series has added significance for Milwaukee, which entered Tuesday with a half-game lead over the Cubs in the National League Central. His second set was much more of a rollercoaster. After breaking for a 4-1 lead, he lost three games in a row. It was a straight-set victory for Djokovic in his first match since March, and he'll look to keep up the momentum against Dominic Thiem in the second round on Wednesday. The Celtics have the number one pick in the upcoming National Basketball Association draft, which they received from the Brooklyn Nets in a trade several years ago. The Celtics have been linked to Fultz for some time and now look certain to take him at number one. With the Celtics already giving Brad Stevens the keys to the franchise, and with Fultz's leadership qualities, this could be the beginning of a special Celtics era. At this point, the Wizards have to feel pretty confident going into Friday night's Game 6. If the Celtics go on to win the series, the Cavs will have to wait a little longer for their next opponent. He's not the only one. ""They're a lot better, so we have to be better."" The Cavaliers were 6-for-26 (23.1 percent) on 3-pointers. ""Even though it's 3-1, it's still the playoffs,"" Olynyk said.

Dario Saric, who was the Rookie of the Month for both April and March, finished in third place in the voting. The 2017 NBA Awards will be the first time the league has handed out their own awards. The NBA All-Rookie First and Second Teams were also revealed. So, what happened on the first tee? ""I don't know, I've never seen that before."" Things were so bad that a tee time was adjusted to allow two groups to tee off at the same time just to try and get the players through the front nine before the day was out. Everything is not alright with the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers are on the verge of elimination and the Celtics are on the verge of the NBA Finals. The Celtics had 18 offensive rebounds to the Cavs' 15, and they outscored the Cavs 17-7 on second-chance points. Earlier in the day, Venus Williams defeated Japan's Kurumi Nara in straight sets to reach the second round of the tournament. The last set, I think, he played good tennis. ""The last few matches I played against him, he was really very aggressive from the first point, so I was expecting the same."" ""I was a bit sad after the first match, because I lost against a player that I lost also in Monte Carlo,"" Nadal said. The Rangers had a few good chances in the second period , but they also had to kill off a four-minute penalty that began with a high-sticking call on Chris Kreider .

He added that he felt lucky to have survived the ordeal, noting that if he had been standing in a different spot, the consequences could have been much more severe.",text-davinci-003,0.5,1.0,0.6,0.703125,1.1578947368421053,-0.8878466808014012,-0.18779339325868893,-0.8270243954142344,-0.753072157938546,-0.7767470624613481,0.22182447494046223,-0.5416316232127838,0.3112038624096796,-0.40263748597081916,0.2827351714656342,-0.5,0.26784417879410377,0.3808777429467084,0.2675505358253035,0.0,0.0,-0.7142857142857144,0.06290998705387267,-0.536069259931131,-0.16877400464580458,-0.30427324931016475,0.40596633550589795,-0.7299465240641713,-0.10871183788755422,0.19090909090909108,1.3626873581840335,-0.2909090909090909,0.4939263403503357,-0.35511363636363624,0.6638898288088595,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.6647727272727272,-0.3028741700673562,0.3496503496503495,-0.030276191765209657,0.4754678806272129,0.5858246042676398,0.42712842712842736,0.730658018765204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.09090909090909091,0.2722659625233095,0.22252621592448102,-0.34868696536459876,1.09098368334164,-1.1356388102181025,-0.9128985510187201
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A team of Italian scientists has created a hydrogel that can remove paints from other paints of similar chemical composition. It can be used to repair street art that has been vandalised or to restore old artwork. The hydrogel was created by a team of scientists at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, who used polymers and proteins that were able to absorb paint molecules from surfaces. The hydrogel is able to bind to the molecules of paint and then remove them from the surface without damaging the underlying material. This makes it ideal for restoring street art or artwork that has been damaged. The hydrogel can be applied to a surface with a brush or spray bottle, and it will gradually absorb the paint molecules. Once it has absorbed all the paint molecules, it can be easily removed with a cloth or paper towel. The hydrogel has already been tested on various materials, including concrete, glass, metal, and even painted walls. It proved to be effective in removing paint from all these materials, with no damage to the underlying material. The hydrogel is still being refined, but the researchers believe that it could soon be available commercially. If so, it could be an invaluable tool for those looking to restore or repair street art or artwork that has been damaged by vandals or the elements.",text-davinci-003,0.9545454545454546,1.0,1.1538461538461537,1.203125,0.3684210526315789,-0.27448077414922273,0.04740198936397397,0.27309851090165344,0.3568715391635924,-0.03463203463203455,-0.3790950053857213,0.3061396131202691,-0.3192493177399467,0.35157126823793516,-0.28238861125507303,-0.2272727272727273,0.06804968868836868,0.24451410658307218,0.5205355608660904,0.0,0.0,0.10389610389610379,-0.22899743016209836,-0.7933825046980739,-0.32062135814058773,0.0715937057200388,-0.6104421250791696,-0.31283422459893057,0.3078932320984324,1.7181818181818185,0.3988367574479414,0.9818181818181817,0.9288485564416825,0.41193181818181845,0.636301284131827,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.11931818181818186,0.4121723676783338,0.3496503496503495,-0.030276191765209657,-0.09509357612544259,-0.03721167769092702,-0.46176046176046154,-0.09098799232708481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.18181818181818182,0.8738058188877955,0.16526247558630458,-0.26342603752509,-0.1730519267386599,0.1005632200619236,0.31690105200676943

Paul-Jose M'Poku equalised for DR Congo with a sensational long-range strike just two minutes later but that was as good as it got for them before Kwarasey took centre stage to shut up shop and seal victory for Cameroon late into injury time of extra time. Yannick Bolasie first had an effort saved by Matampi early on while his former Everton teammate John Bostock also found himself thwarted from range shortly after coming off the substitutes bench midway through the second half. Despite dominating possession throughout they struggled to create chances until the latter stages when Allan Nyom forced another save out of the goalkeeper following some nifty footwork inside the area.

Booster 3 was completed around July 1 and it passed its first cryogenic proof test on August 4th. The vehicle is currently being prepared to be used for a static fire later this month ahead of an orbital launch attempt by mid-2022 at the earliest! pic.twitter.com6BDbNwiFfh - SpaceX (SpaceX) September 13, 2021 SpaceX already had one successful example in hand (used during the historic Crew Dragon docking mission with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley), but the next stage needed testing before certifying that each component could withstand 200 times the stress experienced during liftoff. In order to get there safely, SpaceX designed two ""crusher"" tests: One using non-cryo fuel followed by another done completely under liquid oxygen pressure. Each time things were just as they should have been until...the engine cut out unexpectedly after 25 seconds when the propellant likely ran cold too fast due to atmospheric conditions. Still not sure what went wrong? Check out these videos from ErichSchroer showing how this testing actually works: NASA waterfalltesting on the Falcon 9's upper stage ""Super Heavy."" It shows the turbopumps running - however if you watch carefully enough.. it also gives us great footage of the failure itself! spaceflight pic.twitter.comV8iBxCjP5k - Erich Schroeder (ErichSchroed3r) April 30, 2020 In other words, nothing major happened - in fact, some teams even view these failures as beneficial because such events are crucial components in ensuring safer space travel going forward. But those who know about the company will tell you that any significant setback like this can easily cause delays while engineers try to pinpoint whatever caused this issue specifically or all engines more generally. That said, Musk noted last week following the second failed test that SpaceX would probably need six months to resolve everything no matter what happens since he doesn't believe the issues lie within his team but rather outside factors beyond their control related to COVID 19 restrictions and storms. As we reported back then: However, Elon Musk may allow himself only three weeks prior to actual flights as companies are required to perform post-test reviews either way which often lead into unexpected changes and rescheduling. For now, Space X states that B1049 still requires additional work leading them to request a waiver so they don't miss their window given multiple ongoing missions including Starlink launches over Cuba through Florida Airports where weather frequently proves problematic. This means there won't necessarily be much room left open between now and the end of summer for several reasons - primarily to give employees adequate notice regarding school schedules and family vacations etc., plus potentially needing extra time depending upon results. Weather permitting, SpaceX plans to certify the SN15 Starship prototype sometime before its planned high altitude flight campaign beginning early October. However, without certification confidence levels dropping dramatically, upcoming hop attempts might be delayed further. Regardless, it appears that barring unforeseen circumstances, Starship serial number 15 will make history soon...just maybe a little later than expected. Stay tuned. Clearly looking towards future development of Starship Mk III IV based off the design philosophy introduced roughly five years ago, SpaceX unveiled new renderings today depicting the vehicles once fully developed against a backdrop reminiscent of historical images taken right here on Earth.

I'm not sure that many of us would quite know what to do when handed a giant vegetable in front of a pack of photographers. But it won't be surprising to see it all over the newspapers and stuck in people's memories. And it was a reminder that before Mr Corbyn even tries to win the battles he will certainly face this week - over nuclear weapons, over how to balance the country's books, or over the way Labour makes its decisions - his team's priority must be, get through the week without mishap. For party conferences are strange, intense, microclimates where the what is said on the stage, however carefully crafted or considered, can be subsumed by our old friends, ""events,"" however silly. And sometimes those are the moments that shift opinion, or express a truth political parties don't want to contemplate. And occasionally, they are the moments senior politicians lose control. In 2003 I remember seeing Conservative aides grimace during the then leader Iain Duncan Smith's speech, as he promised the ""quiet man"" was ""turning up the volume."" That week, everywhere Conservatives had been huddled in corners wondering how to unseat him. His strangely delivered speech contributed to his ultimate exit. In 2006 I remember Cherie Blair's unguarded, and then denied remark, whizzed round the conference centre in 2006, when she cried out ""it's a lie"" when Gordon Brown heaped praise on her husband. Nothing expressed the levels of bitterness between the two camps so well. In 2008, it wasn't just the rather silly picture of him clutching a banana that put David Miliband onto the front pages, but that he'd been overheard talking of avoiding a ""Heseltine moment."" His leadership ambitions were what made the conference banana moment worth printing. The year before, when Sir Menzies Campbell was already under attack for lacklustre leadership of the Liberal Democrats, I recall the uncomfortable press visit to an environmentally friendly house outside Bournemouth, where aides allowed him to be photographed while inspecting an organic toilet. Awkward didn't begin to cover it. Unfair perhaps, but that moment suggested all that what was wrong with his party machine, and weeks later he was gone. There is so much at stake for the Labour Party this week, that Jeremy Corbyn's ""marrow moment"" may be quickly forgotten. The point is, to have a hope of sticking to his agenda, the first priority for Team Corbyn may be avoiding mishaps. In the frantic environment of conference, much more experienced political teams have lost complete control of events. One senior Labour figure suggested to me that with Mr Corbyn's first Prime Minister's Questions, ""expectations were low, so when it wasn't a disaster it was a relief,"" and that conference might be the same. With disagreements all around, and the extraordinary divisions between Labour's supporters and members and their MPs, a silly photograph on the eve of the event may prove the least of Mr Corbyn's concerns. What his team will hope tonight is that its awkwardness, his visible discomfort, doesn't in fact set the tone.",human,3.1742424242424243,3.0,3.830769230769231,3.671875,4.157894736842105,-0.04561191067101916,0.4499617245349742,-0.05892720862748157,0.13986953679471878,0.24016563146997913,0.8324692130661873,0.7545983106007971,1.1228959039629336,0.6077563070316693,1.057508536610295,0.326086956521739,0.4420925510954505,0.9737631184407796,0.628463998449546,0.0,0.0,-0.02484472049689452,0.2636140720790847,-0.2265475307187214,0.24107466120034435,-0.012840175482398358,0.308919460732868,-0.14961636828644503,0.3980459578753993,0.8328063241106722,0.6778020105868671,0.27826086956521734,1.4053248810909804,0.40081521739130427,0.8690140650035625,-0.18416670362769091,0.03069112717808673,0.8233695652173914,1.5621584144846283,0.8896321070234113,0.3255786563891846,0.7731521189329462,0.7016144248161856,0.6625258799171844,1.1129318896358866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.690909090909091,2.272727272727273,-0.037544793355020215,1.1486580915971523,-0.06943492192041562,-0.00031679082064420955,0.1204430299123013,0.18630280864853674

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed across the road leading up to the hospital, preventing vehicles from being able to turn into the car park. The move was part of a 12m project to modernise the hospital's AE department and allow ambulances to access it more easily. It was hoped that the changes would reduce the amount of time it took for emergency crews to get to the department, which is one of the busiest in Wales. It was announced at the time that the measures would take around six months to complete, but one year on, the changes are still not fully in place. Concerns have been raised that the lack of progress could be putting lives at risk. Welsh Conservative AM, Darren Millar, said he had been contacted by an ambulance driver who said he had struggled to get through the barriers when taking a critically ill patient to hospital. He said that ""every minute counts"" when responding to an emergency. A spokesman from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said that changes to the hospital's AE department were ""complex."" ""The changes will be implemented in phases, with each phase requiring a number of sequential steps to be taken to ensure the safety of all,"" she said. The first step of the project has been completed, with barriers installed across the road leading to the hospital and a new ambulance bay.

The Windows zero-day exploit tool was stolen from the NSA's Equation Group by Chinese threat actors, who used the tool for years before the flaw was patched.",flan_t5_xxl,0.045454545454545456,0.0,-0.046153846153846156,-0.09375,0.10526315789473684,-0.19315564879423885,-0.9265084404019215,-0.4858994762803913,-0.7063409025900818,0.05442176870748279,-0.05908705069499712,-0.2590412111017662,-0.10780674695376545,-0.4450617283950617,-0.43575672808371746,-0.7,-0.779956864811853,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,0.4857142857142855,0.16065353455645665,0.4502981783421501,-0.05561883370888117,0.059064807219031776,-0.9732367714927875,-0.22941176470588226,-0.6292871554085167,0.11454545454545452,-0.5489313778978989,-1.2,-1.5876283221327456,1.2812500000000002,-0.06360446328962716,0.222016136511175,-0.010714843619247419,0.2625,-0.26496927621332894,-0.7076923076923076,-0.5057640218984862,0.1046029337379869,0.02642468594543666,0.15238095238095262,-0.40199694117381796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.7636363636363637,0.18181818181818182,2.3186698213975383,-1.0629729774348227,1.797819584853742,0.4474627516956226,-0.27875806408142706,-0.5849136094755926

You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, starting with John F Kennedy's 1961 request that Congress legislate ""a program designed to provide high school graduates throughout America... an equal opportunity for employment in our country's expanding economy."" The federal government was first to jump into action. In 1964 it launched TVE (Teacher Vocational Education), which brought grants and contracts to schools offering teachers courses ranging from dental hygiene (you know how many dentists there are now?) to electronics repair. It created the National Advisory Committee on Teacher Quality, whose mission became widely known by its acronym: READY - Reach Every Available classroom Youth Deserving underfunded teacher training options. Finally, after years spent debating whether or not students should be able to advance beyond their eighth-grade reading level before graduating from public high schools, President Carter signed legislation creating TOPS (Trained Opportunity Partnership Schools) - the nation's first federally funded, state-run demonstration project specifically aimed at raising student achievement. The idea was simple enough: grant funds would go directly toward hiring more effective educators who had completed college but hadn't yet earned advanced degrees; these ""next generation"" teachers were placed within struggling middle and low income communities across the county where they worked closely alongside seasoned professionals until each one had mastered her craft and proven herself capable of inspiring young minds.

There is already some debate about how self-driving systems should behave when confronted with emergency situations on public roads as of December 2019. The Society of Automotive Engineers has begun develop standards that include recommendations about what kind of data collected by sensors during testing can influence decisions made by automated vehicle control software such as whether to brake hard enough so that occupants are protected from injury but not so much as to cause damage to all other parties involved. However, at this point there isn't anything legally binding outlining acceptable rules around driver protection versus pedestriancyclist preservation among automated vehicles-not yet anyway.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Researchers from the University of Central Florida have engineered a nanomaterial that repels water and can stay dry when submerged underwater. The design was inspired by the structure of a lotus plant's leaves. Water-repellent coatings have been around for years. It's a big business, and many manufacturers try to outdo each other with claims of being the world's most waterproof material. There are waterproof jackets, waterproof gloves, waterproof mascara, and even waterproof socks. But not all of these products work as advertised. For instance, waterproof gloves get soaked through once you touch something wet. While a nanomaterial coating may work great on a smooth surface like glass, it's a lot more challenging to keep water off a textured surface such as a fabric or paper. The Florida team, led by Aliasger Salem, set out to create a coating that can repel water from even rough surfaces. They knew they had to do something different, so they turned to nature for inspiration. Researchers have long been interested in the lotus plant's unique ability to repel water. The plant's leaves have a bumpy texture, similar to an egg carton. Water droplets don't stick to these bumps, but roll off the leaf's surface. This is called the lotus effect. When water rolls off the leaf, it takes any dust or dirt with it. The lotus leaf is self-cleaning. For their nanomaterial, the UCF researchers designed tiny particles similar to the bumps on a lotus leaf. The particles are made of two types of plastic: fluorocarbon and poly (dimethylsiloxane). They can be added to a coating or paint and applied to any surface. The particles are only a few nanometers in size, which means there are thousands of them in a drop of water. In fact, there are so many particles in the coating that the surface appears flat and smooth. But the particles are close enough together that they touch, forming a network. Water that touches the coating gets caught up in this network. But because the particles are hydrophobic - they repel water - the water droplets roll right off. Droplets of water roll off the surface of a lotus leaf. The plant's surface is covered with tiny bumps that cause the water to roll. In the lab, the researchers sprayed the coating onto a variety of materials. They tested it by spraying water, oil, and milk onto the coated surfaces. On nonporous surfaces such as glass and metal, the water droplets beaded up and rolled off. When they tested the coating on a textured surface, the results were even more impressive. On paper and fabric, the water beaded up and rolled off, leaving the surface dry. And even after the paper was bent and crumpled, it still stayed dry! The coating is cheap and easy to make, and the team thinks it could be used in a number of ways. It could be applied to clothing, cars, boats, and even airplanes. This story was updated 10182018 to correct the name of the lead researcher. Take a look at the lotus leaf. How do the bumps on its surface help it repel water? Now think about your skin. Your skin is mostly smooth, but it also has tiny bumps. Do you think your skin would repel water if it were covered in the nanoparticle coating? Why or why not? The nanoparticle coating is a hydrophobic material. Hydro means ""water"" and phobic means ""fear."" What do you think a hydrophobic material is? What other materials can you think of that repel water? What other materials can you think of that attract water? Do you think the coating would work in saltwater? Why or why not? Would you want a waterproof coating on your clothes? Explain your answer.",llama_65B,3.962121212121212,7.5,4.476923076923077,4.34375,4.473684210526316,-0.5583954210597104,-0.16335285983635822,-0.4747036358131009,-0.33451528990726087,-1.1346938775510202,-0.2662968103893334,-0.8341126997476871,-0.1885920243935533,-0.8858024691358022,-0.25265837891941045,-0.5,0.3236815785092824,-0.3227586206896551,0.048153456703243065,0.0,0.0,-0.5514285714285716,-0.3108005624372444,-0.8611416591533689,-0.6580243337365852,-0.7678424938474159,-0.3072004796216295,-0.8564705882352943,-0.20122066688805954,-0.5854545454545454,0.0024370645148565164,-0.11999999999999988,0.538608502169134,-0.31249999999999994,0.2664975542259513,-0.448706296948901,-0.3224839889816453,-0.39749999999999996,0.3307345818696538,-0.1353846153846154,0.06297198184146957,-0.0836823469903894,0.08466827037812623,-0.5587301587301585,-0.22726715227980435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5454545454545454,1.8181818181818181,0.6224355140258716,0.9629366505112102,-0.029582642797605842,0.9354616890257987,-1.2090115005576214,-1.2274859831866265

However, we also noted how companies such as New Relic use Kafka to connect different data streams from their customers (e.g., log files) and apply machine learning algorithms on them without having any shards for each data stream. As long as it is possible to create one or more shards per topic within your cluster then you are happy with using Kafka for this scenario too!

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, since the carrier would use nuclear energy to power its propulsion system and electrical generators. The ship, to be named the PA 2 (Porte-avions 2 or ""aircraft carrier 2 will be used to launch jets and drones, according to The National Interest. France also plans to equip it with F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically on the carrier. The French government is reportedly eyeing the design of the US Navy's Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. The new ship will reportedly feature a nuclear reactor capable of producing 200 megawatts of electricity. The Charles de Gaulle, by comparison, is powered by two 150-megawatt reactors. The decision to use nuclear propulsion is a controversial one, as it runs counter to Macron's goal of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. Nuclear power plants produce fewer greenhouse gases than traditional fossil fuel power plants, but France still has a history of nuclear disasters. The country has been the site of three nuclear accidents, including one in 1999, when an explosion at the Marcoule nuclear site killed one person and injured four. The Charles de Gaulle carrier is only capable of carrying 18 Rafale fighter jets, which is a small amount compared to the US Navy's aircraft carriers, which can carry around 60 planes. The French carrier also has a short flight deck, making it more difficult to launch and land planes. The PA 2's design will address this problem, as it will be able to launch more planes and will be equipped with a catapult, which will allow it to launch heavier aircraft like the F-35. France's Defense Minister, Florence Parly, told reporters last month that she wants to ""make the most of our investment"" in the F-35.

The Commission calls on party leaders to act swiftly and decisively to ensure that such attacks are dealt with robustly and effectively. The Commission also reminds party leaders of their responsibility to speak out against any language or behaviour which could be interpreted as hate speech or inciting violence. The letter states that political leaders have a duty to set an example by condemning any incidents of hate and making it clear that this type of behaviour is not acceptable in our society. The Commission calls on party leaders to take action to ensure that the police and other relevant bodies are equipped and supported to deal with hate crime, and that appropriate measures are taken to prevent further incidents from occurring. It also urges them to work together to build a culture of respect for diversity and to promote a positive message about the value of immigration to the UK. The Commission concludes by stressing the need for party leaders to collaborate and make clear to everyone that hatred and discrimination will not be tolerated.",text-davinci-003,0.803030303030303,0.3333333333333333,0.8769230769230769,0.84375,-0.2631578947368421,0.13421861106377833,0.5543435918610843,0.6954126617413054,0.7996473970897956,1.1739552964042754,-0.2621317836309236,1.295206055508831,-0.2811428964627477,1.1697530864197532,-0.4084303331752696,-0.0714285714285714,0.5195922159516354,0.5172413793103448,1.364023920333395,0.0,0.0,0.8775510204081631,0.03564262653567979,-0.22361746271412894,0.13778126338802957,1.575061525840853,0.5089956818366798,0.6008403361344538,-0.3266761907145283,-0.04545454545454524,-0.2092150071335486,2.2285714285714286,0.6345884152479561,1.09375,0.7822641850454745,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,2.276785714285714,1.29766932662614,-0.0219780219780221,-0.09876011632224538,1.270178481104126,0.5166627573692447,-1.0158730158730156,-0.7842949324155315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45454545454545453,1.1818181818181819,0.35421295912669104,0.23110488200634163,0.8011372028156384,-1.044903475460747,1.302886465985319,1.3381683751825928

Users will be able to purchase Paxos Dollar (USDP) using Novi, with Novi depositing the coins into the user's bank account. Facebook's Novi coin is set to debut in the United States and Guatemala in a pilot program. Users in both countries will be able to purchase Paxos Dollar (USDP) using Novi, with Novi depositing the coins into the user's bank account. Facebook is rolling out its Novi wallet in the United States and Guatemala in a pilot program. The social media giant is a founding member of the Libra Association. The Libra Association has 28 members in total, including Visa, PayPal, Uber, and Coinbase. Novi is a Facebook subsidiary that makes it easier for people to pay for goods and services using Facebook's messaging app. The app is also used to send messages and make video and voice calls. The Libra Association is a nonprofit that will oversee the Libra blockchain, which is a digital currency that will be backed by a reserve of real assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities. The Facebook subsidiary Novi announced that it is ""working with regulators in the United States to secure appropriate approvals and licenses"" in order to conduct the pilot program in the two countries. Paxos Standard is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and is the first regulated stablecoin to be listed on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Last year, Paxos issued 100 million USDP coins, with each token backed by one dollar of US dollar reserves held by the company in FDIC-insured banks. Paxos says that it ""meets the strictest regulatory requirements and is the only stablecoin in the world that has been granted approval by the New York Department of Financial Services."" Earlier this year, Paxos introduced a solution that allows traders to leverage their Paxos Standard tokens. The solution is called Paxos Standard Levered Ether (PAXETH). Following the launch of PAXETH, Paxos also launched a new stablecoin, called Paxos Standard Gold (PAXG), which is pegged to gold. Novi will be partnering with Paxos to make the transactions possible. US regulators have been skeptical of Libra's potential. The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters, sent a letter to the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, saying that she is ""disappointed"" with the lack of ""meaningful consultation with Congress"" and is requesting a moratorium on the project. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee also plans to hold a hearing regarding the project in July.",llama_65B,2.477272727272727,2.6666666666666665,2.276923076923077,2.203125,2.6315789473684212,0.08072184179253598,0.33467658720584326,0.28087352343646954,0.09049771542585551,-0.06349206349206374,0.4067845162443988,-0.17269414073451064,0.2799913565429638,-0.24999999999999978,0.34823994131709457,-0.5952380952380952,0.02481838584586238,-0.6256157635467979,-0.20257905841134793,0.0,0.0,-0.1428571428571431,0.23820278543363915,1.0343584005909252,0.3338295890343524,-0.16406890894175555,-0.031678207167353895,-0.23669467787114834,0.4007918355824178,0.1545454545454547,0.5644899593058383,-0.05714285714285716,0.2642189590178392,0.6026785714285716,0.9100147789466001,-0.21144393953445237,0.19459074018810493,0.20535714285714277,0.8238508473793795,-0.46153846153846156,-0.03010149727405678,-0.2241491437242575,-0.11249170636778118,0.29629629629629645,0.9388629341584035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9636363636363636,2.3636363636363638,0.5782247189094798,0.6144800420856161,0.8252004788236157,-0.16771086122584428,0.08242933138318383,-0.12139394001975483

He responded: ""We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated."" Mr Trump said: ""We will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself. ""This was a purely political decision. ""We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed."" He had previously threatened not to build a hotel at the resort if it went ahead. Ministers said they were committed to a ""successful and sustainable"" offshore wind sector. The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project is a joint venture by utility company Vattenfall, engineering firm Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg). The project is aimed at providing enough energy for more than 49,000 homes. The Scottish government said the centre would allow offshore wind developers and supply chain companies to test ""cutting edge"" wind technology before its commercial deployment. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: ""Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland; an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets. ""The proposed European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will give the industry the ability to test and demonstrate new technologies in order to accelerate its growth. ""It secures Aberdeen's place as the energy capital of Europe."" He added: ""The EOWDC is the first offshore wind farm to pass through the new approvals process for offshore wind development and as such is a test case for the industry. The diligence and expertise of officials in Marine Scotland, among the statutory consultees and other interests should give confidence to the offshore wind industry and its supply chain that planning matters should not be a barrier to investment in Scotland."" EOWDC project spokesman Iain Todd said: ""The Scottish government's most welcome approval for the EOWDC is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK's offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector. ""The project partners will assess the consent and associated conditions as part of the planning and programming for the next phase of the scheme."" Alex Salmond, the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: ""I welcome this decision. ""The north east of Scotland is a world energy capital and in order to continue to prosper we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research - marine renewables, as well as oil and gas."" Dr Sam Gardner, senior climate change policy officer at WWF Scotland, said: ""Giving the go-ahead to this offshore wind test centre is the right decision, demonstrating that no amount of bluster from US billionaires such as Donald Trump will hold Scotland back from becoming a cleaner, greener, job-creating nation."" Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""The north east is already established as a global hub for the oil and gas industry. ""The development of the EOWDC will enable the region to extend its reach with regard to offshore wind, further enhancing our renewable energy expertise and drawing upon our strong engineering and technology skills base. ""This is an important development for the region.""",human,3.553030303030303,3.1666666666666665,3.230769230769231,3.328125,3.8947368421052633,0.3337525595437556,0.49824801688936704,0.49758445611640106,0.4427338527674718,0.39569160997732394,1.0409235720730725,0.19428090832632464,0.7693238060797732,0.2376543209876546,0.7150287496056851,0.5833333333333335,1.0709315406383797,-0.17025862068965517,0.21481238218690554,0.0,0.0,0.714285714285714,1.5979900069700697,0.3913305597497257,1.120048352170462,-0.2337981952420017,0.3472768236837172,0.03186274509803911,0.42644418872880413,0.021212121212121196,0.32076898657355046,0.6333333333333333,1.29886839639863,0.7421875000000001,0.926218628624047,-0.39680515626449037,-0.23717910090094632,0.18749999999999997,1.0015074100397166,-0.038461538461538526,0.012786954465890383,0.0653768335862418,0.13181559344867436,0.9523809523809526,1.0485237904661406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.5090909090909093,3.272727272727273,0.11293924027955925,1.1145281555678395,0.43062106285172624,-0.5477144219158123,0.572550336873601,0.8504690702440175

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Tardigrades are microscopic extremophiles that can survive exposure to intense temperatures, pressures, and even the vacuum of space. A group of scientists recently recorded high-speed videos of the animals traversing the surface of an axe blade. The videos, filmed at 20,000 frames per second and slowed down to reveal their movements, show the tardigrades slowly climbing up the edge of the blade, using their four stubby legs to grip the metal surface and pull themselves up. The footage also shows the animals rotating their bodies in order to move from one part of the blade to another. The tardigrades' movements are surprisingly graceful for such tiny creatures. The footage reveals some interesting details about the tardigrades' physiology. For example, the scientists noticed that the animals were able to adhere to the metal surface with just the suction cups on their feet, which suggests that they may use a combination of suction and surface tension to move around. The videos also showed that the tardigrades can change direction quickly and easily by simply shifting their body weight. The researchers hope that further study of these videos will help us better understand how tardigrades survive in extreme environments and even in outer space.",text-davinci-003,0.7651515151515151,0.6666666666666666,0.8153846153846154,0.796875,0.3157894736842105,0.5461044921474948,0.4669561610765933,0.0171442625058713,0.015900124709398986,0.20861678004535117,0.7056809539371937,0.31660592467993626,1.0301740412703264,0.2520576131687245,0.8463531953377837,-0.16666666666666674,0.07031643058551812,1.1839080459770113,0.74941892826016,0.0,0.0,0.9047619047619045,0.49438407503543974,-0.9649246678760359,-1.0838349230554571,0.19688269073010653,1.220173735878532,0.2973856209150327,0.42315172471129603,-0.7565656565656566,-0.07035534786430657,0.1333333333333333,0.5292094407109151,0.9895833333333334,0.6818746991770253,-0.0973754984698136,0.17677669529663684,0.22916666666666666,0.7569488635615362,0.0512820512820513,0.257266326535172,0.34867644579328955,0.5144998661191729,-0.47971781305114625,-0.07272416408653007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5636363636363636,0.7272727272727273,0.2206246472287906,0.3117318083833997,0.20371478136029184,-0.05303966200042829,0.14063642385209216,-0.0027609360801607533

The new technique involves recreating the environment in which human hair usually grows by using a 3D printed model implanted with keratin-producing cells. 3D printers are now being used to create many different materials, for example, food, wood, and advanced medicines.",human,0.05303030303030303,0.0,-0.046153846153846156,-0.046875,-0.15789473684210525,0.7143223214179291,0.48495029755943025,0.6193822620967397,0.20761262555961885,0.08163265306122418,-0.7131399600050752,-0.2590412111017662,-0.8838934193471311,-0.2895061728395058,-0.8117295238702686,1.9,-0.6630959946297685,-0.38275862068965505,-0.2661988675512693,0.0,0.0,0.914285714285714,-0.8854244182115591,-0.7762282883802778,-0.5528664176765495,0.47251845775225576,0.697866427183001,0.535294117647059,0.2851927218041983,0.11454545454545452,0.3084744667770337,0.40000000000000013,0.7885161734510571,-0.03124999999999989,0.23272425390639476,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.3374999999999999,-0.026767332592180663,-0.8923076923076922,-0.6124073628011353,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.20317460317460284,0.33318042268854586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05454545454545454,-0.36363636363636365,0.10419326920364945,-0.01544639059102572,-0.7532235980671703,-0.5218221538901731,0.3972384257158753,0.3484722068642101

This week, at the annual Shopify Unite conference, the company announced even more new features for merchants. ""This year at Unite, we're unveiling the biggest product lineup in our history, giving entrepreneurs everything they need to build and manage a business,"" Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke said in a statement. The biggest news, perhaps, is that Shopify is building a new platform for B2B sales. The platform will include business features like bulk pricing, centralized billing, and a personalized buyer experience. The new platform is expected to roll out later this year. Shopify Pay, a new way for customers to pay for purchases with a credit card, without having to re-enter information at checkout.

Cornwall Council leader Adam Paynter welcomed the new deal but said it must be about ""more than just cash."" ""We are determined to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it,"" he said. The British government said Tuesday it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, saying that that would help the country to uphold the 2015 Paris global climate agreement. The government also announced that it plans to invest more in charging infrastructure for electric cars. The UK's move to ban new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 has been labelled ""a step in the right direction"" by the country's biggest motoring organisation. ""We can't carry on with diesel and petrol cars,"" he said. ""If electric cars are to be more accessible to households without off-street parking, it's important that the Government now work with local authorities to ensure that the necessary charging infrastructure is put in place."" The UK already has the largest market for ultra-low emission vehicles in the European Union, worth an estimated 2 billion, and the fourth largest in the world, the department for transport says. But critics said the ban should come earlier - and should target hybrid vehicles too. The National Infrastructure Commission has predicted that by 2050 the United Kingdom would need between 23,000 and 30,000 new rapid charge points - compared with just over 12,000 now. ""It's fantastic that the government has finally recognised the importance of clean air, but 2040 is too late - air pollution will continue to prematurely kill thousands of people across the United Kingdom, and leave many more choking on dirty fumes,"" he said. The government is also set to roll out a new Clean Air Fund worth around 220 million to support local authorities' work to reduce emissions. Jesse Norman, the junior Transport Minister, told the BBC that hybrids would still be allowed under the proposals. The Volkswagen scandal could also help convince consumers to move to electric cars. The Conservatives originally announced their intention to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2015, but the party's manifesto for the 2017 General Election did not include a specific date for the ban to come into force. The UK will also establish an worldwide ""Centre of Excellence"" to help developing countries reduce their emissions. Asked if the Government's plans were ambitious enough, he said: ""We are on the right path."" ""The High Court must force the government to deliver on their commitment to reduce illegal air pollution."" The government's move follows a similar announcement in July by France, which said it would also end the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 as part of a plan to become carbon neutral by 2050. But environmental groups have said the plans do not go far enough. A ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040 will be announced in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday, according to reports. ""It is not just the public that needs to take action to prevent air pollution, it is a collective responsibility of government, industry and individuals. We want nearly every auto and van on United Kingdom roads to be zero emission by 2050, which is why we've committed to investing more than 600m in greener transport.""

British food and drink exports as a whole rose 6 to PS20.1bn in the first quarter of 2018, with non-EU countries accounting for much of the growth. The UK Seafood industry group said that the strong performance of the fish industry was driven by increased demand from both domestic and export markets. The group reported a 22 increase in exports to the EU and a 29 increase to non-EU countries. It noted that sales to China had risen by 55, with exports to the USA, Japan and Hong Kong also up significantly. The group attributed the rise to a range of factors, such as new product launches, promotional campaigns, improved supply chain management and better access to retail markets. It noted that recent investment in technology and innovation had been particularly beneficial to the industry. Overall, the UK Seafood industry group said that the positive outlook for the sector was due to a combination of factors, including increased global demand, greater market access and a well-organised supply chain.",text-davinci-003,0.6287878787878788,0.5,0.5230769230769231,0.609375,0.5263157894736842,-0.19149477016305044,0.32937052171490583,0.0756585940503565,0.27674048114718025,0.2823129251700679,-0.1789758934305174,0.06476030277544155,-0.5788091946308233,0.2160493827160495,-0.6205863018622237,1.375,1.1697214839978631,0.14224137931034483,0.7917204003588728,0.0,0.0,0.8928571428571427,0.8430640397663325,-0.3752484819517917,0.004225493307887146,-0.14766201804758006,-0.14840048395519806,0.9558823529411766,-0.14542663084992333,-0.9704545454545455,-0.21549891213021075,1.05,-0.5375108934412486,0.8593750000000001,0.443924693134674,0.7011035889826579,0.6555240366732317,-0.7499999999999999,-0.4485428686500814,-0.8461538461538461,-0.5732453476658121,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,0.06349206349206366,0.2722752065450611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272727272727272,0.9090909090909091,0.6687125380825242,-0.06236833578008002,0.9204119687575781,-0.13459665515048966,0.23335304411483865,0.20527084152393443

And further talks are expected in the coming weeks with the club and the Portuguese keen on a long-term option. In his first spell at the club between 2004 and 2007, Mourinho won consecutive Premier League titles and succeeded this season with three games to spare. Media playback is not supported on this device The 2005 title was Chelsea's first top-flight success in 50 years and he also delivered two League Cups and an FA Cup. But he left the club to eventually join Inter Milan after falling out with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Since his return after a six-and-a-half-year absence, which included three seasons at Real Madrid, Mourinho has spoken of his desire to stay as long as the Russian billionaire wishes to keep him. The Blues boss repeated that after Sunday's 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace, which secured Chelsea's first title since 2010 and the eighth of his prolific career. ""As I was saying since the beginning of the season, I stay here until Mr Abramovich wants me to stay. The day he tells me to go, I go,"" said Mourinho.

In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on A former employee at the ride-sharing company Uber is suing the company, claiming sexual harassment and assault. Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a ""very, very strange year at Uber."" In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on the job. Fowler also says she was the victim of unprovoked sexual harassment and that her manager and other managers took credit for her work. Fowler, who worked at Uber from December 2013 until August, says she was fired after complaining about the harassment to the company's general counsel. Uber's lawyers say Fowler's claims are not covered by the company's sexual harassment policy, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Fowler was the victim of retaliation after writing about the harassment, Uber lawyer Jennifer Mayer said in a statement.

There has been no official statement as to why the website was blocked. In 2006 Google Maps and YouTube were also banned by China due to perceived security risks posed by their content (e.g., maps of military installations). In June 2008, a Chinese court convicted three people for viewing pornography online after they had viewed pornographic images through what is claimed are ""image-searching"" websites that allow users to search the Internet for digital pictures or video clips on specific topics.[37] The case highlights growing government pressure against unauthorized viewings of sexual material. Two other men caught watching porn online received five years in prison with one year suspended jail terms while another man got six months in detention.[3839]",opt_30b,0.22727272727272727,0.16666666666666666,0.1076923076923077,0.109375,0.3157894736842105,0.8515204765903532,0.2964770139837558,0.3677938853543378,0.32094839683793386,0.11791383219954653,0.6381325625245005,-0.21586767591813863,0.21555754972089783,-0.23765432098765413,0.28955577265820465,0.0,0.33577889086422846,0.017241379310344803,0.18435451309030776,0.0,0.0,0.6428571428571428,0.9461393611946162,-0.2573132447669429,-0.08826897547000563,0.6562756357670219,0.8326172692959544,0.6372549019607845,0.28370075321634564,-0.21212121212121196,0.8325649341201583,-0.5333333333333333,-0.09079798535423238,-0.6249999999999999,-0.5287964955771306,0.9007233608457759,1.0208791198589464,-0.4375,-0.07576923428973634,-0.15384615384615388,0.09935531442256486,0.26150733434496715,0.04085919425719688,-0.08465608465608436,0.47470272039839156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5818181818181818,0.36363636363636365,-0.5864346658712433,0.35130764206612997,-0.048691204988120254,-0.31896771777649857,0.2768309060257302,0.4171039235382795

Blocks are often limited to specific platforms or tools, making it difficult to use them effectively across different applications. However, there is a growing movement towards adopting a standardized and open source approach to blocks, which would allow for greater interoperability and flexibility. One example of this is the Gutenberg editor used in WordPress, which is designed around a block-based approach to content creation. The blocks in Gutenberg can be easily customized and extended, making it possible to create highly customized and dynamic content. Another initiative is the Universal Content Blocks project, which aims to create a set of standardized block components that can be used across different web platforms and content management systems. This would make it easier for developers to create block-based content that can be used in different contexts and applications. Overall, the adoption of a standardized and open approach to blocks would enable more flexible and efficient content creation, editing, and sharing across different platforms and tools.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.6818181818181818,0.5,0.6153846153846154,0.59375,0.5789473684210527,1.0817018794563358,0.9006930994602553,0.9531549319089365,0.7969426620202511,0.4013605442176869,-0.5720121713852893,0.2590412111017662,-0.6889209226323658,0.1836419753086421,-0.8343922378537583,1.25,0.5094952404986067,0.7047413793103448,0.5047652506735223,0.0,0.0,0.6785714285714284,0.34483298679955104,-0.6111189563214894,-0.3605730301962414,0.3691550451189498,-0.6729119809463698,-0.19117647058823534,-0.39315390538393746,0.7795454545454548,-0.07852553204592409,2.3,2.219370655161405,-0.5468749999999999,0.11115967914527367,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,-0.18749999999999997,0.0,0.6538461538461537,0.012786954465890383,-0.32688416793120884,-0.20102130479565686,0.5079365079365081,0.17200616270346147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14545454545454545,0.45454545454545453,0.5944570785831326,-0.00941864551638906,0.15786325297601242,-0.9449087084791571,0.8468096088789611,0.9722536090635074

Researchers have determined that the egg came from a massive aquatic reptile, which lived around 75 million years ago. The discovery is just one example of how geology can help us understand prehistoric life forms better today. A team lead by Dr Paul Barrett at Natural History Museum London uncovered this giant embryo while they were doing research on Antarctic rock. The creature may be related to Komodo dragons or crocodiles but not birds like ducks or ostriches as it has no wings suggesting its legs had enough strength for swimming underwater instead. What makes it even more remarkable than other ancient fossils are these embryos have soft tissue intact including blood vessels so we will get an idea about what colour it would've been when it hatched before becoming extinct along with dinosaurs some 65million year ago due to meteor impact over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.",opt_30b,0.44696969696969696,0.3333333333333333,0.46153846153846156,0.546875,-0.21052631578947367,0.11078514071338959,-0.27350470870848925,0.15132353263690396,-0.07283162382561775,0.26044703595724,1.5155196147268737,0.29604709840201837,1.9196162461016086,0.4660493827160493,1.7544889890740711,0.3571428571428572,1.0490625295892841,0.9458128078817735,1.3125903615267307,0.0,0.0,0.32653061224489793,0.8176198091463271,0.04594879370838265,0.8407157146479777,0.09844134536505326,0.8173755939336761,-0.05462184873949595,0.8526953156338091,0.7545454545454549,0.8512568343258717,-0.05714285714285716,1.7456967839383073,-0.24553571428571425,-0.18488661304023157,0.5300009273856997,0.3531925481710166,-0.5089285714285714,-0.1278372056375093,0.5054945054945053,1.0833245903979065,0.8218801936556107,0.23929561512071332,-1.1428571428571428,-0.8960785365386118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0909090909090908,0.36363636363636365,-0.7763297849256667,0.730268997502233,-0.38348812540326677,-0.1910199870604805,0.2609347248692513,0.4915694664516168

Mr Smith, who lived in Bishop Auckland with his wife Kezi and son Ewan, was diagnosed last year after he suffered a number of unexplained headaches, followed by weeks of vomiting blood while at work as an officer for Durham Constabulary. The father-of-one had only been married to his childhood sweetheart since the summer when they tied the knot. The couple met back in 2000 but split up just before their wedding day due to ""fear"" that she would not be able to cope if something happened between them during the ceremony - which is said to have haunted her ever since. Ms Brocklebank told how it wasn't until November 2015, two years into their relationship, where both realised there were strong feelings still lingering towards one another. She revealed: ""When we got together again I did actually think about getting engaged because my mum passed away 10 days prior so I thought what better way than him popping the question?"" But despite wanting to get down on bended knee, Mr Smith managed to convince her otherwise - saying instead that marriage should simply come naturally.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Uber and Lyft must classify their drivers as employees unless their emergency appeal to block the ruling is successful. The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers, and the appeals court ruling means they now must do so - at least for California drivers. The ruling could have ramifications for other states where drivers are classified as independent contractors. The lawsuit was initially filed in 2013 by Uber drivers, alleging that the company has misclassified drivers as independent contractors to avoid reimbursing them for gas and vehicle maintenance. A California court ruled in favor of the drivers in June, but Uber appealed. The appeals court rejected Uber's appeal and upheld the ruling in favor of the drivers. Uber has argued that drivers have ""complete autonomy"" as to whether, when, and where they work. But the court found that drivers are ""presumed to be employees."" ""The trial court determined that defendants' drivers are employees as a matter of law under California's right-to-control test,"" the appeals court wrote in its opinion. In the court's ""suffer or permit"" analysis, it found that Uber is ""involved in every aspect of the operation."" Drivers must accept at least 90 of trip requests to remain in ""good standing,"" and they can be temporarily banned from the platform for refusing rides. ""Uber controls the tools drivers use, monitors their approval ratings and terminates their access to the system if the average rating falls below 4.6 stars,"" the court said in the opinion. ""Uber also controls the subject matter of the work performed. ""Although drivers may choose the territories in which they wish to drive, they may not select the passengers they transport or the trips they perform. Uber controls those matters."" ""This is a big win for California drivers and for workers everywhere,"" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, partner at Lichten Liss-Riordan, P.C., which represents the drivers in the case. ""We look forward to fighting for workers' rights alongside our clients now and in the future."" A spokesperson for Uber said the company plans to appeal the decision with the California Supreme Court. ""The California Labor Commissioner already reviewed this issue and found that drivers are independent contractors, not employees,"" Uber said. ""The majority of states have also come to the same conclusion. We are currently reviewing the decision and will be closely evaluating our next steps."" Lyft said in a statement that it is reviewing the opinion and will consider all of its options. ""Lyft drivers are independent contractors and are uniquely empowered to decide where, when, and for how long they drive,"" the company said. The Uber and Lyft cases are the most prominent of their kind, but other ""gig economy"" companies have faced similar battles. In 2015, a federal judge in North Carolina granted class action status to FedEx Ground drivers who alleged they were misclassified as independent contractors. A Florida judge also found that a pizza delivery driver in Florida was an employee, not an independent contractor. The plaintiff's law firm, Lichten Liss-Riordan, said it has ""active cases"" on behalf of more than 10,000 workers in the gig economy. ""It's possible that the court could order Uber and Lyft to reclassify their drivers as employees,"" Liss-Riordan said. ""It's also possible that the companies could make changes to their business models to reduce the amount of control they exert over drivers.""",llama_65B,3.4696969696969697,4.0,3.4923076923076923,3.578125,5.0,0.2504197560069011,0.130685362684722,0.4037312516587791,0.37289490239046025,-0.2120572366877784,-0.09233409450916553,-0.13398683332849984,-0.13219408755657172,-0.10355470412941652,-0.1644916613638902,-0.6379310344827587,-0.35115941944514,0.0,0.35450899379345174,0.0,0.0,0.18719211822660103,0.3607072383736318,-0.28171363866725646,0.1558486069128463,0.006789058301037998,0.072515184166796,-0.22413793103448282,0.1467698606944277,-0.05924764890282109,0.24240433386296706,0.24827586206896557,0.25755706082273006,0.15625000000000008,0.1500258245052134,-0.29011182992385837,-0.12967663628224688,0.04525862068965513,0.2734533808766986,0.037135278514588754,0.3194383422883378,0.5590846458409643,0.6318829063720534,0.8144499178981938,0.9015915903547375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.690909090909091,2.272727272727273,0.492471845769091,0.9715477754507994,0.2686711132380211,-0.21200425243070584,0.0381348136416387,0.16372829641246553
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday. It aims to create a single hospital site, with the Royal Liverpool University Hospital as the main hub. The Aintree University Hospital site would be developed to provide additional services such as diagnostics and outpatients. The plan also suggests that a new model of care will be developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, focusing on a ""one-stop shop"" approach for patients. This could include bringing together specialist teams from different disciplines, such as cardiology, vascular surgery and neurology, who can work together to diagnose and treat complex conditions. The proposal is part of a wider plan to improve healthcare across Merseyside and Cheshire, which includes closing some hospitals and creating larger health hubs. The Royal Liverpool and Aintree University Hospitals are two of the largest hospitals in the region and the merger would enable them to provide more efficient and effective care.",text-davinci-003,0.5378787878787878,0.3333333333333333,0.4461538461538462,0.421875,0.10526315789473684,1.0850267219421783,1.058681276416401,1.2958473627832816,1.0577252517582787,0.4936831875607382,-0.4038724298907377,0.2590412111017662,-0.335603914441695,0.16975308641975315,-0.32872356251012896,0.6428571428571428,0.5938886888546678,-0.12561576354679801,0.1545044027408707,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571427,-0.28043451783581386,0.8546475629759176,0.8077344365076886,0.09844134536505326,-0.14056114345642753,-0.05462184873949595,-0.3056051051317712,0.3545454545454546,-0.16297621221108546,1.9428571428571428,2.1529198300817978,0.6919642857142859,0.6039697015709617,-0.154409719002133,-0.05117266213995574,0.13392857142857142,-0.12783720563750917,-0.4175824175824176,-0.256698968019151,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456333,-0.12698412698412692,0.3495605622726029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21818181818181817,0.8181818181818182,0.378415659119435,0.019669764794187496,0.6879132237138688,-1.2805456145386462,1.122494479402735,1.4184727327083069
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Media playback is not supported on this device Malan targeted South Africa's seamers, striking 12 fours and two sixes in a 44-ball knock as England posted 181-8. Chris Jordan took 3-31 and Tom Curran - in only his second game - 2-22 to restrict the Proteas in their chase. AB de Villiers made 39 and Mangaliso Mosehle 36 off 22 balls but South Africa could manage only 162-7. England, returning to the venue of their Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, put in a professional performance to wrap up the series. Middlesex left-hander Malan, 29, made the highest score by an England player on T20 debut, beating Paul Collingwood's 46 in England's maiden match in this format in 2005. England, whose next white-ball series is not until September against West Indies, begin a four-Test series against South Africa on 6 July. It was a polished performance from England's bowlers, using the short ball to discomfort South Africa, and they were backed up by some strong fielding. Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who played in the opening T20 at Southampton, was put under pressure as de Villiers struck him for consecutive sixes. However, the 20-year-old showed admirable confidence as he continued to toss the ball up and was rewarded when he drew an error out of the tourists' skipper, who slapped the ball to Alex Hales on the deep square leg boundary. Crane rounded off his spell with a superb over, conceding only two runs as England turned the screw. The Proteas were lacklustre. Of the top six, only De Villiers and opener JJ Smuts (29) reached double figures and it took some big hitting from wicketkeeper Mosehle to push their total up. England's seamers were excellent, with Curran in particular showing a maturity at the end of the innings as he bowled full and straight. The result means the visitors have won only two of their six limited-overs matches on this tour. England captain Eoin Morgan chose to rest himself for the match, a decision that initially drew criticism given this was a must-win game for England, but big-hitting Malan adapted quickly to international cricket. Arriving at the crease after Jason Roy fell for eight, Malan left his first delivery but pulled the second ferociously into the stands for six. On a pitch tinged with green, he took on the short ball against the seamers. He did not let up against a change of pace, nonchalantly flicking leg-spinner Imran Tahir over his shoulder to bring up his half-century from 31 deliveries. Malan and Hales, who was struggling to run after edging the ball on to his knee, put on 105 in 10.3 overs. When Malan finally fell, caught at long-on off Tahir, stand-in captain Jos Buttler struck two flat sixes to push England above 180. Media playback is not supported on this device The manner in which England went about such a calm and assured victory will be more heartening giving the changes they made to their side. As well as Morgan being rested, England gave Crane another opportunity, as well as Curran. For South Africa, it was a disappointing return, given how strong they were in the closing stages at Taunton. They were sloppy in the field to begin with. Andile Phehlukwayo's drop to reprieve Hales on 13 was so surprising the batsman had turned to walk back to the pavilion. South Africa will take some comfort in the performance of right-armer Paterson, who was twice on a hat-trick in the final overs thanks to his mixture of yorkers and slower balls. However, it was England who controlled the majority of the game. England stand-in captain Jos Buttler: ""Dawid Malan was fantastic on debut. It is not easy to come in and show that much composure under pressure. On debut it was a fantastic effort. ""Mason Crane, for a 20-year-old, has got great character. He was bowling at one of the best players that have ever played the game on a ground with a short boundary. ""It was very tough on him but all credit for having the bravery and guts to keep going and get the wicket. I am sure he will remember it for a long time. ""We have found some really great players. You find out a lot about players - international cricket is different and those guys have stepped up. Tom Curran was brilliant for his two games. ""Taunton is not an easy place to make your debut and he took three wickets and two today. He looks a real find."" South Africa captain AB de Villiers: ""We were outplayed in both of these series. Well done to England and Eoin Morgan in the majority of the games, and Jos Buttler today, for leading them. ""England put in an all-round better performance today. We were not far off but it was disappointing. ""England do have some really good youngsters. They have good depth and all round are a really good team. ""They seem to be going through a good patch and have a lot of talent. They have a bright five to 10 years ahead of them."" On Mason Crane: ""I was always going to go after him. Well done to him for sticking to his guns."" Dawid Malan, who was named man of the match: ""It is a fantastic experience to play for your country and to contribute in a win like that on debut is fantastic. ""I thought this day might never come. I had a chat with Adam Voges, who played later for Australia. ""I asked what he did and how he kept motivated when you keep getting overlooked for younger and younger players. He gave me some advice and fortunately I had a good Lions series and got picked when players were rested.""",human,6.4772727272727275,8.166666666666666,6.923076923076923,6.9375,7.2105263157894735,-0.8197772789519143,-0.5706220295613438,-0.7176152946355157,-0.5802767504616534,-0.4237843285462331,0.4611777749799524,-0.20147649752359612,0.2797056460513045,-0.21364883401920398,0.2218891049997604,-0.09259259259259256,0.19102805285586213,0.017241379310344803,0.3492867798624547,0.037037037037037035,0.18885257457751053,-0.642857142857143,0.2677707031267381,0.030972890573798727,0.4840185864299788,-0.33907574514629474,0.30333167537367,-0.099128540305011,0.5089394499977017,-0.47138047138047134,-0.11602238555517076,-0.051851851851851816,0.8260813250976716,-0.12152777777777769,0.4679695025307884,0.39058394386225226,0.7954587545302811,0.006944444444444474,0.7959071342564606,0.2564102564102563,0.2377372186523609,-0.11622548193109648,0.0635299622702752,0.09641387419165229,0.1481904745711343,0.07407407407407407,0.324998681014523,0.05555555555555555,0.22906142364542553,3.2,3.727272727272727,0.29391483874279384,1.3696324528934731,0.08500329006400668,0.8484321384806983,-0.7927525336316624,-0.8178358941374406

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was to last until February 11th at least - enough time for preparations for an elaborate peace conference planned for Geneva on that day. In fact there were further talks between Russian diplomats led by Mr Lavrov and American officials over subsequent days before another agreement which included a fresh accord about withdrawing Ukrainian troops from rebel-held areas (see article). The first phase of this process started badly: Ukraine's government swiftly dismissed it as ineffective; Russia announced its own withdrawal within hours when fighters continued firing across part of the front line; four soldiers died after artillery fire hit their vehicle near Debaltseve. Yet partly because both sides are now used to dealing with one-another face to face, matters improved quickly thereafter. Last week NATO said more than 60 of all violations had ceased since January 15th. On Friday America offered preliminary sanctions relief - including easing restrictions against Gazprom, Russia's state gas giant - on condition that Moscow plays ""constructive"" roles at future international forums. A Western diplomat says the new truce is likely to stick better precisely because Kiev will be less eager to scupper any chance of progress. It may also help that some rebels themselves want out of a conflict they fear has little hope of success without foreign backing. With Vladimir Putin reportedly worried about domestic unrest if his proxies suffer heavy losses, he might well feel obliged to keep them supplied with arms long enough for negotiations to start properly. Fierce fighting continues around Mariupol but appears unlikely ever again to threaten either Donetsk or Luhansk, with populations too large and determinedly pro-Russian. If so, then these two cities could become safe bases not only for negotiating a settlement but also organising local elections under UN supervision later this year, perhaps even taking place inside government territory. One crucial test remains whether Moscow keeps up supplies not just for individual units but also entire brigades. But given how high the stakes still appear to be for each side, we should prepare ourselves for setbacks along the way rather than assume total victory next month. After all, hopes rose during previous ceasefires similarly to those today yet fell apart almost immediately afterwards.",opt_30b,2.2196969696969697,1.8333333333333333,2.169230769230769,2.203125,1.368421052631579,0.8614247196500585,0.11184606597733221,0.5115445032235316,0.4225937925064729,0.5119047619047618,0.3758041249961975,0.4695121951219512,0.09171956099459772,0.47530864197530875,-0.002415569124279238,1.125,0.8982095793960999,2.7672413793103448,3.1447099598699384,0.0,0.0,0.3839285714285713,0.7507050182892276,-0.2573132447669429,-0.17501171142786104,0.5414273995077932,0.5979755017111047,0.6213235294117648,0.45462540050563277,-0.7079545454545455,0.08497073315739512,0.050000000000000044,1.5627239639417454,-0.19531249999999994,0.3156461513853615,-0.1223279699527033,-0.0387009383101521,0.09374999999999999,0.48169958982997924,-0.15384615384615388,0.3659636666791874,0.8498988366211432,0.4418352045438582,-0.103174603174603,0.20881778265965037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.4363636363636365,2.8181818181818183,-0.7428039788447408,1.2302944534131648,0.06202942788454561,-0.6084537098204401,0.6723799370242529,0.4901365636449114

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-112 to Burns, 115-113 to Beltran and 114-114, which did not seem to reflect Beltran flooring Burns or his dislocating the champion's jaw. Brave Burns was constantly pushed back and landed heavily on occasion. And his courage was rewarded, controversially, when he retained his belt. Burns's preparations were unlike any of his 38 previous fights. His wife had given birth to their first child, his son Leon's safe arrival coming only nine days ago after a four-day labour. The question troubling his fans was what state of mind would he be in to face a challenger known for being a regular sparring partner of the legendary Manny Pacquiao? The opening blows were fairly evenly shared, both fighters lively and aggressive, while in the second round Beltran had the champion pinned on the ropes for a spell, though Burns managed to take most of the Mexican's artillery on his arms. Burns promised he had learned from, principally in the way he had over-stretched to land blows on his reclining opponent, only to be caught on the counter. His exertions in the third round, though, suggested he was still trying to blow the challenger away and he was caught several times with Beltran's left hook before using his jab to good effect. Beltran stepped up the pace in the fourth and had Burns reeling from two crunching lefts, the second wobbling the 30-year-old from Coatbridge. The challenger, two years Burns's senior, was controlling the ring and he had the best of the exchanges in round five, though Burns, often on the back foot, had cleared his head and was occasionally getting through the Arizona-based fighter's guard. Burns continued to use the counter-attack, more out of necessity than choice, to inflict pain on Beltran. His reward was to land two excellent shots to Beltran's head in the closing stages of the sixth. The home fighter's recovery continued into the seventh as he made good use of a quick left jab, right-cross combination. But in the eighth round the champion was floored for the first time in three years with a sickening left hook to the head. Burns took the count of eight to gather his senses and to his credit had the guts to hang in there and land a peach of a left hook on Beltran's chin. Worryingly for Burns's camp, the challenger did not flinch. The Scot's refusal to panic paid dividends in his bout against Gonzalez, when his opponent retired injured after nine rounds. Similarly, he kept calm in this bout despite that knockdown and the pain in his jaw and gave his all in rounds nine and 10, without truly disrupting the forward momentum of Beltran. The crowd feared that Burns might need a knockout in the final two rounds to retain his belt but the technical and tactical nous of Beltran made this seem a forlorn wish. Again and again, the fans witnessed the wonderfully composed Mexican break Burns's increasingly erratic defences without risking a knockout blow himself. The final round signalled more of the same, sporadic bursts by Burns merely interrupting the hail of leather-clad fists. But when the MC announced a draw, Beltran sharply exited the ring while the home fans, though proud of their brave champion, squirmed at the result. On the undercard, Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons lifted the WBC international cruiserweight silver championship title with a deserved unanimous points win over Germany's David Graf, though the Scot suffered a nasty cut under his left eye in the fifth round. Scott Cardle, from Lytham St Annes, with plenty of home support from the Glaswegian side of his family, beat Fishburn's Gary Fox, taking a 79-73 points decision in their lightweight contest. Liverpool's 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medal winner Callum Smith dispatched Lithuanian super-middleweight Kirill Psonko in the first round. Glasgow's Jonathan Slowey, 22, made it 15 straight wins by outpointing his rangy Spanish opponent Angel Lorente. The unanimous decision of the three judges landed him the WBC international featherweight silver championship. Garnant's 25-year-old Prizefighter winner Chris Jenkins beat the French light-welterweight Laurent Ferra on points. It was also at that weight that Lochend Boxing Club's Paul Appleby made a winning return to the ring 15 months after his defeat by John Simpson. The South Queensferry fighter emerged from a bruising six-rounder against Chesterfield's Lee Connolly with a 59-56 triumph, a touch harsh on the Englishman.",human,4.818181818181818,4.333333333333333,4.8,4.796875,5.052631578947368,-0.08607676451118018,-0.0644104625458198,-0.527317099877028,-0.32298086809593324,0.40026333113890705,0.42747396250325626,0.41780840500284877,0.6887959125356262,0.38958582238152156,0.8564685847442001,0.725806451612903,1.1198734800759016,0.42046718576195763,0.9195209681146657,0.0,0.0,0.23963133640552972,0.008074097403908898,0.34377602862680284,0.5393778832244895,0.04128185450792563,0.28629117048359276,0.3330170777988616,0.2907146148140094,-0.8067448680351906,0.30066324906790726,0.02580645161290329,1.0477692065793165,0.9122983870967745,1.4651296542823662,0.7783757587361229,1.0846685529757634,0.7560483870967742,0.9813671464904925,0.292803970223325,0.3852377832606224,0.08435720462740876,0.3320453796143795,0.19252432155657967,0.31057482832512445,0.16129032258064516,0.5734318978913285,0.0,0.0,3.890909090909091,2.909090909090909,-0.029032159965185624,1.4773754127801195,-0.19375051590008216,0.33860620671317143,-0.030803339779605626,0.03026052147139377

The company also said regular customers who spend 49 would get unlimited two-day delivery without having to pay extra while others could receive their purchases next day at no additional cost - although only if they live near one of 100 US cities where Amazon ships products via warehouses directly rather than using third party couriers like UPS or FedEx.",opt_30b,0.24242424242424243,-0.16666666666666666,0.2153846153846154,0.25,0.10526315789473684,0.11024335677487257,-0.7022183051765564,-0.0937020223890342,-0.08559316415564182,1.659863945578231,1.6399609455274875,1.424726661059714,1.6632229718414173,1.5123456790123457,2.169714654253615,1.75,0.8311215555681835,1.6422413793103448,1.478323453353074,0.0,0.0,1.4285714285714284,0.6476033737912719,0.4502981783421501,-0.6145206346180679,1.058244462674323,2.14269891009716,1.720588235294118,0.15529027479425836,0.6045454545454547,-0.640973640459346,0.8,0.6576171830350245,-0.07812499999999993,-0.9328767787091092,1.2999629045720116,1.2285758240438753,0.18749999999999997,-0.17749575895105157,0.5384615384615383,-0.10331175589616348,1.0460293373798686,1.8012984200983522,0.9523809523809526,-0.052865183461613494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8363636363636363,0.45454545454545453,-0.9221697098535112,0.5662744148430643,-0.10422142520891241,-0.5643908273830233,1.2184048999047252,1.1360888860579892

The potatoes grew 50 percent larger and with more of the carbohydrates that make up the staple's starch, they report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The starch itself has a different molecular structure than normal potatoes, which might be useful for making glue or other products. The potatoes, which were developed in a collaboration between Wageningen University, in the Netherlands, and BASF Plant Science, in Germany, also have less amylopectin, a molecule that can lead to blood sugar spikes in people who are susceptible.

The US Department of Transportation issued a statement saying that it ""intends to reconsider the occupant protection criteria for new vehicles."" The agency pointed out some glaring omissions from current safety standards: no standard requirement or testing for rear facing baby seats; no requirements on car seat anchors designed specifically for use with convertible top-down child restraints; no minimum strength requirement for vehicle tethers used by booster seats when they're installed forward-facing on their own (some boosters can be set up so kids sit behind them). And while each state has its version of a child passenger restraint law - which typically states children under 8 years old must ride in an approved child restraint system whenever possible, including during travel in private vehicles - there's not yet any federal law requiring manufacturers to install specific equipment on all models sold here. There is one more thing we'd like to see change about our nation's laws around carseats and other infantchild safety issues: We think states should automatically issue parent licenses if you want to drive your kid (s) anywhere outside your home without using those special harnesses people wear at amusement parks called carseat belts.

Inspectors found that the number of people held in overcrowded conditions had increased from 11 per cent to 16 per cent since the previous inspection. The inspectors also raised concerns about the mental health of many of those held and said some prisoners were subject to ""unacceptable delays"" when requesting medical attention from staff. They highlighted a lack of appropriate case management and recommended that more work should be done to ensure prisoners were released on time.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"With all the walking, running, cycling and gym activity you intend to do, obviously you need an activity tracker -a small, trusty device that you can wear 247 to monitor every footstep, every mile clocked up, every calorie burned, and even the quality of every moment's shuteye. You'll believe what it says. I mean, why wouldn't you? Millions of these things have been sold, and you're not exactly going to buy multiple devices to check they come up with the same results. And that's why I felt compelled to carry out this experiment for you. I've spent a full week wearing four of the latest and best-known trackers to see if they all came up with the same results. My findings? They don't. This isn't about which device presents your text messages to you, or comes in three shades of pink, but about cold, hard data. The Garmin Vivosmart, Fitbit Charge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone Up Move are all in the dock. At their worst, one day saw a variation between them of 23 in distance covered, and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of 2,649 calories burned - that's more than an entire day's calorie intake for someone of my build. Both companies are united in saying that it's not the figures that matter, but the pattern. Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend. ""Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern,"" he says, ""Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week? Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day, week to week? Because it's that trend that's going to make you healthier."" It's a sentiment echoed by Jawbone's head of international partner and product development, Jorgen Nordin. ""What's important really is that our system is all about getting better, becoming a better version of yourself,"" he says. And maybe there is something in that. Goodwill, good intention, motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being. Yet rely too much on the tech, inviting in third-party apps, inputting what you've eaten, and taking the figures as gospel, and you may just find it all going the wrong way. But, surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you? Well, Misfit's medical director Matthew Diamond explains it's not an exact science. ""Variations in algorithms, the sensors used, the characteristics of the individual wearing the device, like height and gait, as well as wearing position, can result in observed differences,"" he says. That's not dissimilar to Mr Jones's view - he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm. Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heart-rate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy, which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to. ""Garmin's activity trackers are all about motivation, nudging the user to make healthier choices,"" says Chrissy Winchcombe, Garmin's marketing executive of wellness. ""You can also use it with a heart-rate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising."" Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly, some with looks to replicate mere watches. Others, like the Swarovski crystal, solar-powered Misfit - tracking abilities aside - would put J-Lo's bling to shame. But providing stats and prompting ""do more exercise"" notifications are just the start of their makers' ambitions. ""With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band, you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you,"" says Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin. ""For example, you've been out running, you come home. Your house knows you've been running, not just because of the temperature of your skin, but it also knows you've been sweating based on sensors. ""Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down. Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler. ""If you're in a house with a boiler connected to your shower, that could be turned on as you walk into your house."" Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes. For most of us though, the simple question now is more likely to be: ""Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then?"" Sensors are still improving, and as we've seen, we can't expect military precision, but this is a personal choice. Will I be laying mine to rest? No chance. It makes me think more about my activity. It makes me walk instead of getting the bus. It makes me feel smug at the end of the day (usually). My husband I can compete over footsteps - don't worry, we have the same device. And now, maybe I'll work that extra bit harder just in case it's going easy on me.",human,5.7727272727272725,7.0,7.015384615384615,6.671875,8.578947368421053,-0.7069553784027418,-0.4316076012816513,-0.42668053232758363,-0.11721399687391029,-0.33463598205239564,0.774090942879534,0.18739151441404373,0.9559225039187986,0.04366955608090389,0.8916979335173966,-0.3085106382978724,0.366913744185896,0.4534115920763023,0.98988330635014,0.02127659574468085,0.14430489325798443,-0.3495440729483284,0.9015913508290764,-0.5634430093744229,0.011287391669192905,-0.008377986839579236,0.4911577775385074,-0.28473091364205266,0.9693666123140756,0.15029013539651842,0.28483271174441416,-0.008510638297872353,0.8331971890706797,-0.22273936170212763,1.0158017253243803,-0.3437147914072781,-0.011774443040806644,0.3071808510638297,0.8144891665088317,1.1816693944353516,0.605093061303975,0.11127971674253917,0.14218168648504562,0.5079365079365081,0.9501009961742639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.036363636363636,4.636363636363637,0.22542971049449492,1.2764485941742694,0.5003602756040393,0.558979771698686,-0.5502199804304766,-0.5671419893871246

""I told the manager that he's got a good team and they're more dangerous,"" Crouch admitted afterwards. ""It was great pressure but we did really well in those last 15 minutes to get back into it."" Crouch says Liverpool were miles from where he thinks their form requires them to be in order to challenge for honours again next season - though he insists his goalscoring record proves otherwise. He has now scored four times since being substituted early against Sunderland following an injury sustained during Saturday's win over Chelsea. And while he admits he'd like a few more before the end of the campaign, all four have been vital contributions towards ensuring Liverpool remain as highly rated by pundits and neutrals alike as any other side around Europe this term. The Blackpool striker added: ""We've been consistent very much throughout this run which shows what I bring here.

Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over an inventory of its chemical weapons programme. Al-Mekdad said Syria was in the process of handing over a detailed inventory of its chemical weapons to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). He added that the country was ""trying to meet the deadline"" set by the OPCW, but that this had been complicated by the security situation in the country. He also said that Syria was committed to the destruction of its chemical weapons and that it was working with the OPCW to ensure this was done as quickly as possible.

North America is the world's largest region for private wealth, with US34.3tn. It was followed by Western Europe with US22tn. The Asia-Pacific region is also set to post the biggest growth in the next five years, with a projected 12 compounded annual growth rate, while the US will see its wealth grow at 7 CAGR, according to a report from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The BCG report found that while China had the largest growth in the number of millionaires with 480,000 new millionaires, India was not far behind with 340,000 new millionaires. Indonesia and Thailand also showed strong growth in their number of millionaires. India and Indonesia are also poised to see their number of millionaires grow by 7.2 and 7.3 respectively in the next five years, the report found. The global private wealth market stood at US106tn in 2008, but fell to US93tn in 2009 following the global economic crisis, the BCG report said. The market is now expected to grow by a CAGR of 7.2 to US145tn in 2014, according to the report. ""In our view, the increase in private wealth will continue to be fuelled by a number of trends,"" the BCG report said. ""These include the recovery of global financial markets, the rapid growth of emerging markets, an improving outlook for developed economies, and the creation of wealth from new sources of entrepreneurship.""

They stretch on the Siberian coast of the Arctic Ocean. The balls are up to 15cm in diameter and look like snowballs but they are made of ice. The natural phenomenon has been known since the 19th century, but scientists have still not explained why they form. Some have suggested that ice on the beach is pushed around by powerful waves, while others believe that snow becomes water-logged and then freezes into a ball shape. Whatever the explanation, the balls are now a tourist attraction in Siberia, with people coming from all over the world to see them. They are also a reminder of the importance of looking after our environment, as climate change affects the Arctic region faster than anywhere else in the world.",text-davinci-003,0.3560606060606061,0.3333333333333333,0.5538461538461539,0.546875,0.0,-0.5326109283123637,-0.6754000914813959,-0.583960821833577,-0.1558663440168574,0.027210884353741395,-0.13711085450551314,0.5180824222035324,0.0,0.4660493827160493,-0.07533805974639676,-0.9285714285714286,-0.35301970958254353,1.1600985221674875,1.151343469695104,0.0,0.0,0.20408163265306126,0.1637619442519598,-0.5605752832422685,-0.5309685279586148,0.09844134536505326,0.34991466538529836,0.4915966386554622,0.329542515428815,0.3545454545454546,0.12030358632345362,0.5142857142857142,1.0573386416529675,0.4241071428571428,0.22380000585019183,0.18779560419178334,0.583131147547225,-0.5089285714285714,-0.12783720563750917,-0.0219780219780221,-0.3290349904172045,1.0460293373798686,0.8539499175973831,-0.5079365079365077,-0.36577770322774245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41818181818181815,0.09090909090909091,-0.016251166081023984,0.2658481560352362,-0.3356315473661295,0.5438369793071771,-0.3582698362876938,-0.1578202382642197

Finally, China has used diplomatic channels to pressure other nations, such as the U.S., to remain neutral on the issue.",text-davinci-003,0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.26153846153846155,0.21875,0.631578947368421,1.0961095302283184,0.4046908018153445,1.2097739134398418,0.6770642698836943,0.43537414965986376,0.29822954203508206,0.21586767591813863,-0.09691595795666456,0.06481481481481481,0.005689957766245856,1.0,-0.05534169926723232,0.017241379310344803,-0.2988158729538991,0.0,0.0,0.9285714285714283,0.6442306913140566,-0.4145602276800746,-0.3755313176168787,0.771123872026251,0.707821755353982,0.0,-0.40477052560349525,0.48787878787878813,0.4472009698937941,0.1333333333333333,0.7790682453957568,0.31249999999999994,1.1953450957703187,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,1.5625,0.6501179974730944,-0.15384615384615388,0.28287209669717117,-0.2615073343449671,-0.14106727203565178,0.8042328042328045,-0.06657909744241419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.36363636363636365,0.10387408601491883,0.08289916281345691,0.1385923207565326,-1.1815446677500474,1.0255803451978176,0.9091475587638868

The accounts also showed that the club's wage bill had risen to PS43.1m - up from PS40.8m in the previous year - representing 47 of the club's turnover. The club had made a pre-tax loss of just under PS30m for the year ending May 2014. The club's financial position has been a source of controversy since Tan took over in 2010.

The company claimed it was short-changed when Neymar transferred this summer from Barcelona for 222 million (262m), a world record fee that included performance bonuses and other add ons clauses of up to another 40m. DISS argued in court earlier this month that those bonus payments were not met - but now has won its battle with PSG after an appeal court ruled against them. ""DIS welcomes today's decision,"" said Flavio Cardoso de Abreu, vice president of DIS' legal department last night (Tuesday).

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"It has emerged that an original crash barrier was removed, even though the Roads Service could not find out why it had been put there in the first place. It seems that the barrier was removed in 2003. The Roads Service confirmed that the barrier was removed during the resurfacing of the road in 2003 but that it could not find out why the barrier was there in the first place. ""Given the undulations in the road, it was a safe decision to remove the barrier,"" a Roads Service spokeswoman said. Nevertheless, it is hard to understand how a barrier was removed on a bend in a road without anyone knowing why it was there in the first place. It is known that the barrier was removed because of the damage it caused to cars which impacted on it. It was also removed because it was thought that it might have been a distraction to drivers. The issue is still being investigated by the Road Service. Speeding is a serious road safety issue and one that continues to cost lives on Northern Ireland's roads. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of people convicted of speeding. Latest statistics from the Department of the Environment show that 105,963 speeding tickets were issued in Northern Ireland in 2004, a rise of 10 on the previous year. Following recent research by the Department of the Environment and the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy, it is clear that speeding is a major cause of concern for the public. Drivers of all ages continue to speed and this is a particular problem among young drivers. It is a common misconception that younger drivers are more likely to be involved in a collision than older drivers. However, young drivers are at a higher risk of being killed or seriously injured. The Department of the Environment has set up a website at which is full of information on road safety. The speed limit in Northern Ireland is 70mph on motorways and dual carriageways and 60mph on single carriageways. On rural roads the speed limit is 50mph. In towns the speed limit is 30mph, unless otherwise stated. The road safety authorities have made it clear that if you are convicted of speeding, you will lose your licence. Speeding does not only endanger the lives of other road users. It also endangers the life of the person speeding. The Department of the Environment has revealed that of all the people who were killed on our roads in 2004, 38 were killed in speed-related collisions. I welcome any move to address the speeding issue and reduce the number of deaths on our roads. I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Seamus McElvogue in a road accident. I know this is a very difficult time for the McElvogue family and they are in the thoughts and prayers of many people. I wish to express my deepest sympathy to Seamus' family and friends at this time of great loss and sadness.",llama_65B,3.022727272727273,3.6666666666666665,3.6307692307692307,3.625,1.5263157894736843,-0.6690775522517245,0.03904994264133644,-0.28202814910309243,-0.14939662908018106,-0.31544469639707745,0.0060709025108611255,0.13431766501573075,0.40962416174958266,0.10802469135802499,0.4365467113699387,-0.3148148148148149,0.07200704756239333,-0.14942528735632174,0.07778933344201693,0.0,0.0,-0.3015873015873018,-0.3518394082160042,-0.42329617117524865,-0.035136284179364964,-0.4156412359857807,-0.1310757686740612,-0.01416122004357305,0.1776948806249413,0.6434343434343435,0.7395190410897169,-0.3111111111111111,0.5872157357484186,0.5034722222222222,0.6743357191661695,-0.008655599863983433,0.2992912765027605,-0.2152777777777778,0.346362574391374,0.11965811965811955,0.3502672320206135,0.6392401506210307,0.7064374755590067,-0.8418577307466195,-0.3180646860075443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2363636363636363,1.6363636363636365,0.6863476492359332,0.849293011715058,0.15786325297601242,0.4255838628883153,-0.44943509212292665,-0.34473123049222676

Mohammed Ali Ege, originally from Iraq but living in Cardiff when he committed the offence, has been given a minimum term of 22 years and will not be considered for parole until 2041. The murderer's brother-in-law, Nasser Miah, was also found guilty after being linked to an arson attack on Mr Siddiqui's family home just months before the murder while armed with knives and petrol bombs. He is serving 32 years behind bars. After failing to attend court several times since 2016, Ege appeared by videolink yesterday (Monday) having previously told police that ""if I'm caught it won't do any good."" Judge Paul Thomas QC said: ""You have let down your own family because if you are lucky enough to get out one day they'll be back here defending themselves against what happened."" Tariq Ullah Ishaaq, who went missing during jury deliberations, had refused to act as a defence witness due to fears over deportation - despite giving evidence through a translator at trial. His lawyer Rachael Bowen urged him to give evidence but she received no response other than 'No' or silence throughout four days of cross examination. This morning, Ms Bowen apologised to the judge saying her client could offer little explanation why he did not appear. The prosecution offered no closing speech - meaning there would potentially have been insufficient time left even if both sides agreed this afternoon.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Police initially said that business rivalry was a more likely motive for the attack on the Movida bar restaurant outside Kuala Lumpur on 28 June. They added that two men had been arrested, and were under investigation for 'encouraging or committing criminal acts' - but they did not name them publicly until six days later, at which point one of these suspects had already slipped out of Malaysia. The second remains in detention. According to Gamzah Abu Bakar Al-Muadhamamat (60), a former leader of PAS who is now an opposition politician himself, there is another reason why the authorities have failed to provide answers about what motivated this brutal assassination: it would reveal too much about Islamism. Adnan al-Othmani ReutersThe coffin containing Zaki Buhari at his funeral in Putrajaya December 26. A man associated with Malaysia's Islamist party has reportedly confessed to being involved in the murder of Mazlan Mohd Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin told reporters yesterday [1 January]. ""I'm certain he will be charged,"" head of Malaysian police Khalid Shaikh Mohammed told AFP. As well as having links to extremist groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah, Mr Othmani also holds positions within PAS itself.[2] And indeed, some elements within PAS seem to believe Mr Jaya's death may prove inexorable. In a statement issued following her father's burial earlier this week,[3] the President of PAS declared his intention to hold a ""special meeting"" regarding the Deputy PM shortly after Ramadan begins on 5 July. The timing suggests the purpose of this extraordinary gathering is to find a solution to the controversy surrounding Ms Jaya's killing. But should Mr Abdul Hadi bin Jaafar proceed with his plans, a resolution to the case could instil fresh ammunition into the hands of those seeking to use violence against Islamists inside their own organisations - particularly when coupled with recent events in Sri Lanka. Bereft of any actual connection between Ms Jaya's alleged killers and Islamic extremism, many observers are convinced that political motives lie behind her slaying. On social media, many accuse Malaysians from both sides of politics of being complicit in a cover-up, while discussing the incident using emotive terms like ""murder,"" expressing fear[4], then demanding justice. At times, speculation appears to verge onto racism; Malays are commonly referred to as the most murderous people in Southeast Asia, even by Indians themselves. One writer described the reaction to Ms Jaya's killing as ""the kind of thing you get in South Africa during apartheid... where all kinds of injustices occur and no one says anything because they are afraid someone might call them racist, so nothing happens. It takes real courage to stand up to injustice!"" [5] But despite the frequent emotional rhetoric used on Twitter and Facebook, analysts say that excessive legal recourse is unlikely to bring clarity to the case. Rather than allowing a trial, authorities appear to be intent on providing a public spectacle. Yesterday saw the first major official announcement since the shooting took place, along with a hastily organised press conference addressing the mystery over Ms Jaya's murder. Officials spent hours denying allegations made in TV news reports that the government had known about impending trouble before she was shot dead.[67] This is far from an isolated occurrence. Last month, PM Najib Razak accused the BBC of airing lies in its coverage of the abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria, suggesting that the station had fabricated details designed to undermine international support for troops fighting Boko Haram.[8] And just last week, in Burma, dissident Aung San Suu Kyi held a press conference accusing foreign journalists of bias in reporting the oppressive treatment of Burmese Muslims by Buddhist nationalists. Her speech prompted a backlash amongst Western journalists, prompting her to issue retractions. She is currently facing a possible treason charge stemming from her actions.[9] Even if new evidence emerges related to Ms Jaya's murder, given the extent to which law enforcement agencies can control information flow, analysis alone won't change minds among disaffected members of society. Pengiran Anwar Ibrahim speaks to a large crowd protesting outside Parliament House August 11 2012. Photo credit: THE STARSok Sze Lee It seems clear that domestic pressures aside, the fact that the perpetrators remain unidentified makes police hesitant to make arrests. According to Zahid Hamidi, a commentator on regional affairs, this approach has created fertile ground for opponents of Islamic ideology to exploit. He writes:[10] ""with police unwilling to act, politicians are fearful that turning state institutions against Muslim leadership - even though legitimate issues exist - will give local radicals room to take action.""

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"South Korea will soon see a drop in their military personnel due to a decline in birth rate and recent laws that make it easier to avoid mandatory national service. The Wall Street Journal has the story: South Korea has traditionally relied on conscription to fill its military ranks, with men serving two years and women, who can choose to enlist, doing about a year and a half. Now the military is getting smaller as the pool of potential recruits is shrinking - and as the country increasingly turns to the private sector to help fill the gaps. Conscription is an emotive issue in South Korea, which is still technically at war with North Korea. Avoiding military service is difficult, and has long been considered a stain on a man's reputation. But changes in the law in recent years have made it easier for some to get an exemption, such as top sportsmen and classical musicians. The number of male recruits will fall to 210,000 next year, the lowest since 1957, when South Korea's population stood at 21 million. It is now around 50 million. The story goes on to note that Korea has begun to rely more on civilian contractors to meet its military needs. This comes at a time when the country's defense spending is set to rise, despite the diminishing pool of soldiers. For more on South Korea's conscription policies, see this 2011 story by Tim Hwang from our archives.

This temperature difference can be used to generate electricity using a heat engine, such as an absorption refrigeratorheat pump or thermoelectric generator (TEG). TEGs are solid-state devices that use Seebeck effects for power generation and so have no moving parts compared with internal combustion engines.[3] In order of increasing efficiency they work by converting thermal energy directly in electric current: Thermophotovoltaic systems convert light from their environment through photonic emission; Stirling cycle machines transform reciprocating motion via working fluid expansion - it is not bound on its path like waterwheel does but only restricted within piston cylinder volume limits[4]; Parabolic troughs focus sunlight onto parabolic mirrors which flash evaporate liquid mercury collected inside,[56]. All these approaches operate between 3080. Firstly because this combination loses too much radiant flux harvesting system cannot harvest all available photon spectrum without adding some kind reflector netting etc., secondly due inefficient optical design third most common reason being low operating frequency 60 Hz [7], fourth efficient cooling process requires expensive refrigerants nowadays.",gpt_neox,0.6212121212121212,0.5,0.2153846153846154,0.265625,0.6842105263157895,2.076085539837381,1.0385128643210433,2.1973639096505275,1.182199627098786,0.26530612244897944,2.431361139907514,-0.5828427249789739,0.9484037316410905,-0.49691358024691334,1.0850621881550497,1.625,2.569269200073597,0.5172413793103448,1.2029305287431005,0.0,0.0,1.4285714285714284,3.2908505330340785,-0.6111189563214894,-0.44119986721384713,0.6275635767022147,2.544035951333761,0.0,2.12842020499071,-0.6204545454545455,0.15835474274815856,-0.44999999999999996,-0.05041380923590859,-0.31249999999999994,0.4818214725859153,-0.047470555504034104,-0.016840188228817395,-0.37499999999999994,-0.04206938852807463,-0.38461538461538464,0.8578091856276568,-0.32688416793120884,-0.20102130479565686,-0.15873015873015855,0.601280351013985,0.0,0.0,0.625,0.8569568250501305,1.709090909090909,0.2727272727272727,-1.064280987753927,1.1409481925910803,-0.701407516172325,-1.9662609873009051,1.4764461046216533,1.2799660968395472
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close with a volley and the hosts should have been out of sight by half-time. The visitors had a few chances of their own, with Olivier Giroud bringing a save from Alisson, while Bukayo Saka forced the Brazilian into action early in the second period. But Liverpool were never seriously threatened and sealed the points late on when substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fired home from the edge of the box. It was an impressive display from Jurgen Klopp's side, who moved to within three points of the top four, and here are five things we learned from the game... 1. Liverpool show attacking intent The Reds showed plenty of attacking intent from the outset, as Origi and Firmino combined to open the scoring inside 15 minutes. The hosts had an array of chances to extend their lead throughout the first half, with Origi going close with a volley and Sadio Mane narrowly missing the target with a header. Klopp's side continued to push forward after the break, but it wasn't until the introduction of Oxlade-Chamberlain that they finally found the third goal to seal the win. It was a performance full of attacking intent and one that will give the team confidence heading into the festive period.",text-davinci-003,1.0151515151515151,0.6666666666666666,1.1846153846153846,1.09375,0.7368421052631579,-0.4264978235444398,-0.7949312812700379,-0.5777514415297315,-0.6544301002200563,0.7074829931972787,-0.49103419356305944,1.0073824876179798,-0.002938022985549087,0.7993827160493827,-0.1445394152615325,0.05555555555555558,-0.21906463965371273,0.6839080459770115,0.6225512739862592,0.0,0.0,0.238095238095238,-0.37205068898706956,0.6075451612552819,0.31538994595513714,0.35001367240907844,-0.1310757686740612,1.062091503267974,-0.3657065190770403,-0.44545454545454544,0.3639546689909263,0.5777777777777777,0.21133785450890813,1.510416666666667,0.3772179420387054,0.30186404525642213,0.5877039028599843,0.3958333333333332,1.8460496661242907,-0.0512820512820513,0.09200991173079419,0.34867644579328955,0.3051069275546079,-0.18342151675484983,-0.5902232200339166,0.1111111111111111,0.31426968052735443,0.2222222222222222,0.6285393610547089,0.7454545454545455,1.4545454545454546,0.13236007868604063,0.35359454707896404,0.6831745905144241,0.2537291433950428,0.18138207604490983,0.1708720104364812

""It's like taking the bar exam at Coachella,"" he said. ""I really need to concentrate on this!"" Some have labelled his portrayal of female characters, including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, as sexist. The criticism came as a surprise - as the writer-turned-director had previously been praised for creating strong female leads in his TV shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse. He said, ""I saw a lot of people say,'Well, the social justice warriors destroyed one of their own!' It's like, nope. That didn't happen."" Whedon also denied the accusation that he quit Twitter because of specific criticism from campaigning group Feminist Frequency. ""Literally the second person to write me to ask if I was okay when I dropped out was [Feminist Frequency founder] Anita [Sarkeesian],""he said. Immediately prior to deleting his account, Whedon tweeted: ""Thank you to all the people who've been so kind and funny and inspiring up in here."" Soon after, a search for an account under the josswhedon handle returned a ""page not found"" error. One critic had created a widely shared montage image showing many of the messages sent to Whedon. Some called him misogynistic and said he had done a ""hatchet job"" on Black Widow, whose big storyline in the latest Avengers film is a doomed romance. One critic asked why the words ""strong female character"" were not in his vocabulary. But many of Whedon's fans have now turned on the naysayers, subjecting some to harassment and abuse. Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt accused them of having ""chased Joss Whedon off Twitter."" Whedon had previously been a high-profile user of Twitter, calling it ""enormous work - very fun."" But he told Buzzfeed he had started to become uncomfortable with his habit. ""Twitter is an addictive little thing, and if it's there, I gotta check it. When you keep doing something after it stops giving you pleasure, that's kind of rock bottom for an addict. ""I just had a little moment of clarity where I'm like,'You know what? If I want to get stuff done, I need to not constantly hit this thing for a news item or a joke or some praise, and then be suddenly sad when there's hate and then hate and then hate.",human,2.2803030303030303,3.3333333333333335,2.5538461538461537,2.546875,4.157894736842105,-0.7481139892668031,-0.2970508562884487,-0.3448145140715,-0.3258442566196354,-0.6476190476190478,0.498640624523637,-0.3730193439865432,0.6590746175307818,-0.3932098765432096,0.5680812286290092,-0.3799999999999999,0.04196042105511562,0.5772413793103448,1.2870094499953852,0.04,0.19595917942265428,-0.8514285714285714,-0.003966975189296416,-0.2667480637417308,-0.01990864359676826,-0.05118949958982772,0.5670024799037532,-0.7494117647058824,-0.4200618320238297,-0.33345454545454534,-0.053664116387255385,-0.07999999999999985,1.8999542415905952,-0.4812499999999999,0.5220564539088864,-0.35288880645460446,-0.1856563270976289,-0.037500000000000026,0.7949078286399871,0.6584615384615382,0.49825493333184007,0.2928882144663632,0.4048185533859619,0.43682539682539695,0.4463335848050601,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.2712931993250107,1.8181818181818181,2.090909090909091,0.016883064697876742,0.8330513656580539,0.2150544066596299,0.6190287353729008,-0.7483321689571113,-0.7661084353656902

After finishing second to Martin at the 2012 world championships, Cavendish said he had been ""fortunate"" and that his victory was down to luck. But since then he has struggled for form and distance while racing in Germany and Italy with Team Sky - where he also won stages of last year's Tour de France but often failed to finish. He also lost out on overall victories during the latter part of 2011 when third place finishes behind Mark Renshaw helped him secure fourth spot in the final standings rather than first as expected because of time bonuses. The 31-year-old German rider finished fifth today after losing contact early in the race as Cavendish attacked solo through a group containing several riders including eventual winner Peter Sagan (Cannondale) and Vincenzo Nibali (Astana). Cavendish applied maximum force throughout much of the stage but unlike yesterday, it resulted in success without any apparent trouble. It could be argued that there were no other real contenders left between him and Martin: none of them made significant moves forward over the subsequent 80 kilometres along winding roads and tracks before reaching the foot of the Conche d'Osma climb just outside Olbia. In fact the only sprinter who looked like being able to make an impact was Australian Michael Matthews, whose Cervelo team took their best chance of forcing action from an earlier breakaway which contained six riders. At one point they briefly broke clear before being reeled back into the peloton but Matthews did have some company later in the day from Britain's Simon Yates who joined Miguel Angel Lopez (Omega Pharma Quick Step), Danilo Di Luca (Lampre Merida) and Eduard Prades Serrasolmete (Saxo Bank Tinkoff Bank) among others.

In less than a year two crashes of the same plane type. I have no idea why this keeps happening, but I hope there is a definitive reason that can be found so that it can be rectified. I had a bad feeling about this one and I do not think it is a good thing to be so correct. I will not be travelling by air any time soon. Sadly, the likelihood of your getting into a plane crash is very low, so I wouldn't let this incident change your travel plans. I'm not sure about that. Some of the videos on the internet of that crash look pretty scary. And there are 2 crashes now. I wonder if the Boeing 737 Max is safe? It is, the problem lies in the pilots. Really? I would have thought that if the pilots are trained, and the plane is safe, there should be no problem. I just don't get it. Surely planes are safer now than they have ever been? There is a training issue, if you pay attention to the news, it is one of the things being investigated at the moment. I am not sure I follow, if there is a training issue, then how can the plane be safe? I assume that they are trained for all eventualities, and the training works, otherwise there would be more crashes. Yes, there are a lot of pilot trainees that never get to graduate, because they fail their training. There are also a lot of trainees that do not even get accepted for training. The training is very rigorous, and if you do not pass, you do not fly. I think that the crash was probably caused by pilot error. But that's just my opinion. That is a scary thought. I wonder if the plane manufacturers have anything to do with the training of the pilots? I just find it really strange, that in this day and age of better technology, planes are still crashing. I know that, and my point is that there should be nothing wrong with the plane. The pilots, on the other hand, need to be trained. Surely the manufacturers should have a say in the training, since they are the ones who have designed and built the plane? Surely they know what is best for the plane, and who better to train the pilots. I am sure they have a say, but the pilots are trained by the airlines that employ them. That's not good, because the airlines will only train them according to their needs. The manufacturers should have the final say, since they are the ones who know the plane the best. I am not sure how that would work, but it sounds like a plan. It would work in the best interests of the passengers. That is the whole idea, to protect the passengers. I wonder if the manufacturers will do that? I don't think they do at the moment, but they should. Maybe they should be forced to? That could be an option, but I do not think it will happen. It should, because the safety of the passengers is of paramount importance. There is a lot of testing that goes on before a plane takes to the skies, including computer simulations and real life testing. But there is no guarantee that the real life testing will be exactly the same as the testing of the plane during flight. What other things do the plane manufacturers test for? They test for all sorts of things, and not just from the manufacturer, but the airlines as well. I wonder if they test for the worst case scenario? Yes, they do, and then some. Do they ever test for the worst case scenario and the worst pilot scenario? I would imagine they do, but you never know. I wonder if they have trained pilots for all scenarios, or if the pilots are trained by the airlines? I am not sure, but I think the airlines train the pilots. Wouldn't it be better if the manufacturers trained the pilots? I would imagine that the airlines would want to train their own pilots. That's not good, because the manufacturers will have a better understanding of the plane, and know better how to train the pilots. I think you are right, but I am not sure that will happen. I think it would be a good idea if they do. I am not sure if that will happen, because it has not happened before.

The company has been working on this technology since 2017 and it is expected to be released sometime in 2020. The system will work by scanning a customer's palm with an infrared camera, which will then connect their credit card information through the Amazon app. Customers will then be able to pay for items simply by pressing their palm against the scanner. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the way customers make payments for goods and services, as it eliminates the need for them to physically carry cards or cash. It also provides an extra layer of security, as it is not possible to replicate someone's unique handprint. Additionally, the technology could potentially be used to authenticate customers' identities when logging into accounts or verifying payments. Amazon's palm payment technology is just one example of the company's efforts to innovate and stay ahead of its competitors. Amazon has long been known for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology and this new development only further cements its position as a leader in the field.",text-davinci-003,0.7575757575757576,0.6666666666666666,0.9384615384615385,0.890625,0.3157894736842105,0.43385632109002786,0.6959039750378407,0.7427353738860893,0.9305601103525307,0.1934996220710504,-0.36933861739794505,0.5468647789926174,-0.38419369962933203,0.4248971193415638,-0.38099585261274527,-0.7222222222222222,0.039520485907660385,1.1839080459770113,0.3362510847958642,0.0,0.0,0.5714285714285713,0.3179669271819417,-0.7552620239918602,-0.7540344586280405,0.2734481815695925,-0.1691813618158117,-0.21241830065359474,-0.11503469630070332,0.7989898989898991,0.43814367686252376,0.1333333333333333,0.5292094407109151,0.2604166666666668,0.5565324190561041,-0.0973754984698136,0.17677669529663684,1.5625,1.1733079124871724,0.6666666666666664,0.5381211539639777,0.34867644579328955,0.3051069275546079,-0.7760141093474425,-0.734730060036883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38181818181818183,0.6363636363636364,0.3660243902272894,0.15781177797393542,0.19009826687041498,-0.6755481949548305,0.5584272720641481,0.43391156265785613

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Embeddinghub is a database built for machine learning embeddings. Embeddings are dense numerical representations of real-world objects and relationships. They are used to quantify how similar vectors are to each other in a way that supports learning and reasoning. Embeddings are particularly useful for unstructured and non-tabular data like text or images. Machine learning models like neural networks can use embeddings to understand the similarity between two words or the relation between two objects. In the past few years, researchers have created embeddings for all sorts of domains. They've created embeddings for words and phrases, countries and cities, movies and actors, and even genes and proteins. However, these embeddings are siloed away in academic papers and software repositories. It's very hard to find embeddings for a particular domain, even when they've been published. Embeddinghub aims to solve this problem by creating a database for embeddings, where people can easily search, browse and compare them. Anyone who wants to use embeddings for their research can use the search and compare features to find the embeddings most appropriate for their domain. Researchers who've created embeddings can add them to the database, which will increase the visibility of their work and help others discover it.

On this episode I talk with Rob about what it takes to be successful in both entrepreneurship and venture capital investing; why we need more VCs like Tim Draper; how there are many different ways that entrepreneurs can run their company without being focused on revenue or profitability right away; building something people love vs doing things others think they should do; when founders should spend money versus bootstrapping every dollar possible out of each engineering expense; whether startups have become too complex over time creating massive risk at scale and the importance of getting back into disrupt mode as soon as possible after raising funds from investors so important entrepreneurs still retain full control of their businesses while growing them globally through new markets channels... oh yeah, then we get into Bitcoin!

It 's not clear how long it might be before we can buy from Verizon or Sprint in the US too. A contract version with carriers could follow at some point later this year. It would seem that Apple has another one to add to their watchlist of cases which have been found to contain ""dangerous new materials"" designed to prevent a screen shattering drop during an accident. The latest example comes courtesy of iFixit who were able to remove the described case (pictured above) and get under its innards: Apple Watch - Update 911 We just removed the second layer of metal around the display area using heat guns, carefully drilling out holes like those shown below. We know you want more details but as always these images are pretty rough until we can use our 3D printers and test them. This process was extremely difficult because our tools were limited by size. But don't worry hopefully we'll be ready soon! In the past they've discovered dangerous plastic casings inside smartwatches and other wearables and even had to recall some accessories altogether. They're apparently working on ways to fix whatever issues there may be associated with the material. Read More "" According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Samsung Electronics plans on releasing two Galaxy Note models next month - a big improvement over last year when only three variants were announced. Apparently he states ""the company expects strong demand early next quarter,"" so if true then everyone should start buying up all of their favorite phones right away...or at least pick your favorites. Back in 2015 we reported back about the original 'Essential Phone' concept that eventually became the Android One series launched today. Today Google made the announcement that the first Essential branded smartphone dubbed 'Pixel C' will officially hit store shelves starting October 18th priced at 499 off contract. According to Essential Founder Andy Rubin himself the Pixel C features 360 degrees speakers, HDR10 support, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, USB Type-C port, multi-account security architecture, 32GB storage capacity plus wireless charging feature. Besides creating a hardware platform targeted towards developers, the official launch time frame coincides nicely into what appears to be a planned software update schedule across various devices including the Nexus 6P. Though no word yet as to whether or not users will receive any updates automatically once connected to WiFi via cellular data connection, expect further information on that front shortly following release day. In addition, while Google hasn't confirmed pricing for the handset, do note that HTC recently dropped the price of its own large flagship offering, the U Ultra, down to only 600 off contract. We mentioned earlier in the week about the possibility of LG bringing G6 compatible fast charging technology to us here in North America via Qi Wireless Quick Charge 2.0 for smartphones; however following recent news regarding Huawei releasing similar technology unfortunately comes reports stating that such solution won't work without being paired with either the same proprietary cables or alternatively some sort of special adapter. Well good luck finding most of that stuff considering the former Huawei executive basically stated the same exact thing as well, probably indicating that his statement wasn't going anywhere...in fact I'm fairly certain I heard him say something along those lines myself. On top of that, according to GSMArena who published a report further detailing the matter if you happen to visit an unnamed carrier stores tromping through Canada, UK, France, Germany and Australia, none of the aforementioned solutions actually work. Instead they must purchase an extra accessory kit costing roughly RMB 30 (4). Not exactly cheap especially since this means consumers end up having to spend double the money due to said wired arrangement. No word yet on just why exactly they'd charge additional fees to cover assorted components required, though perhaps some reason behind the decision exists regarding profits. Just my thoughts anyways. As someone living in markets where many individuals already invested heavily in external chargers prior to this development anything else wouldn't make much sense. We'll keep you updated accordingly once more info becomes available. LG has revealed that it's going to offer AI-powered voice assistant built in its upcoming 2019 flagships - the V30S ThinQ V35G Life View Edition, both scheduled for release within Q1 2017 timeframe alongside CEO Kwon Oh Hyun personally demonstrating the functionally onboard. Naturally several months ago Korean publication ETNews held a panel titled How Smartphones Will Transform Society, featuring the trio of executives involved tripping hard on the topic such as adding on that as per usual in CES -LG showcased plenty of gadgets including numerous 5K TVs aimed squarely at content creators as well as future better equipped mobile platforms. Well it looks like you'll finally be getting your hands on Nokia 3310 classic model after years of being quoted as discontinued...at least everywhere outside Japan.

I think I have always said that this inquest will be my last. This has been a hard time for me but also for us as a whole. My husband and I are separated, our children live with their father in London so they don't really know what's going on or how we feel about each other really - it must sound strange! We had originally intended to come down from Spain when we heard he was ill, but now that he has passed away there hasn't seemed much point. However at least we can say everything's out in the open now, which may well prove cathartic after all these years. It would seem daft if we didn't use this forum because someone else might not get an opportunity later. Also there seems little purpose in having an inquest without knowing why his life came to such a tragic end. If asked today do you want an inquest? Most people instinctively answer no because nobody wants to relive those final moments again. That doesn't mean perhaps you wouldn't like to discover what happened. At least three quarters of those who attended our wedding were told afterwards that he died suddenly, although in truth none knew exactly what had killed him. The coroner found it ""impossible"" to establish whether Gilchrist died during sex but there wasn't sufficient evidence either way. So everyone assumed he'd died unexpectedly. Of course we felt differently then, even though it was perfectly obvious to both myself and my parents-in-law that his heart attack was entirely preventable. Nowadays we should at least try to see things clearly instead of being fooled into believing something that isn't true. Nobody is ever to blame except ourselves. The first thing I wanted to address before coming here was why did my husband go ahead with plans to travel around Europe alone at weekends long before any of this started happening? He used to spend most weekdays working late hours away from home but he soon grew bored of doing that and began saying he just couldn't bear spending evenings sitting indoors watching television every weekend. A couple of weeks ago I persuaded him to stop work early one Friday evening and head off to a local music festival - 'Roses' held near where we lived in England. On the day itself he wore some new clothes, including fancy trainers bought especially for the occasion (he also liked dressing up). His credit card bills confirmed he spent 750 between 3pm and 5am. When he returned later on that same night I could tell he was more subdued than usual and I remember thinking to myself that maybe he was stressed. In retrospect I realise it shouldn't surprise anyone that he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest in the hotel room of Rome two days later, but sadly neither did I suspect anything until afterwards. After my own brush with death several months earlier he decided I needed looking after properly and insisted on taking over the financial side of caring for me once he retired. Not that I minded, it was reassuring to have someone take responsibility for paying the bills and ensuring I received proper medical attention whenever necessary. But while he loved acting as manager of our affairs and he brought great pleasure and satisfaction to us both it was hardly surprising that sometimes I resented his staying behind in Canada when I went backpacking across Western Europe. Before we met he never took holidays abroad, preferring to stay within the UK. Yet since discovering the joys of travelling together he became enraptured with foreign culture and wanted to explore places far beyond Britain. We made many trips overseas together in the past few years to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Ireland and Northern Ireland. There is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying yourself and relaxing by holidaying somewhere different. But I'm sure many others will agree that too often people can become consumed with trying to fit in all possible activities, leaving very little time left over for friends and relationships. For example recently he flew to Montreal via Toronto and Detroit, claiming it only cost him forty dollars to fly rather than 500 not mentioning another quick trip half way round the world. While I totally agreed that airfares are absurdly expensive nowadays, we agreed to stick to flights through major European destinations from Heathrow Airport because it saves money. Sometimes he'd push himself so hard that he ended up feeling exhausted and tired, yet he still felt compelled to carry on regardless with second helpings etc. Even when he suffered chest pains a month ago whilst driving back from a concert in Scotland he declined calling the emergency services, opting to pull over and wait until he reached the hospital. Needless to say he collapsed minutes later and the following morning he called an ambulance but unfortunately it arrived after he'd expired. You probably won't believe this but actually I've done better lately at keeping track of his whereabouts. So apart from telling me details of concerts and festivals in advance I haven't checked to see if he's taken a flight anywhere since September 2015. And having recently discovered that he drove east to west coast pavement real estate agents frantically endeavouring to seed track the roleperform John does best serve.

The incident happened as the first half came to an end at 2-0 and did not affect any of today's games."" ""We've been very lucky but it could have ended up much worse,"" said Wenger with characteristic understatement after a 1-1 draw that leaves Arsenal just two points off fourth place ahead on goal difference alone - something they had all too little evidence for last season when their title challenge fizzled out so dramatically midway through March. ""I'm absolutely delighted because we were looking like going home frustrated tonight without beating anyone important."" Arsenal shrugged aside some early nerves by grabbing what proved only one chance during Peter Crouch's debut performance between Premier League goals (and nearly giving away another).

His mother, Romy Zunde, had mistakenly believed she dropped Noah at childcare, the Coroners Court of Victoria heard. Ms Zunde was sleep-deprived, stressed and dealing with a change in routine before the tragedy, the court was told. Police did not lay charges. A coronial lawyer recommended that Ms Zunde should not be held criminally responsible. The inquest into the death in the Victorian town of Kyneton in 2015 is investigating ways to prevent similar incidents. A psychologist told the inquest he believed Ms Zunde suffered a memory lapse called ""forgotten baby syndrome."" ""If you are capable of forgetting to post a letter, you are capable of forgetting to take your baby out of the car,"" said Matthew Mundy, an associate professor at Monash University. ""Your memory is limited, it's limited in the number of things you can remember at any given time, and it's limited in the amount of time you can remember a thing for. ""Your brain at the neural level doesn't discriminate between [posting] a letter, a baby or remembering to pick up your mobile phone."" In his opinion the lapse could happen to anyone, he said. Noah is one of five children within 10 years who have died in Victoria after being left inside a vehicle. The court was told sensors installed in some cars in the United States alerted parents to the presence of children. Coroner Sara Hinchey will hand down her findings at a later date.",human,1.196969696969697,1.5,1.2,1.234375,1.4210526315789473,-0.42197746524526314,-0.015226281088743425,-0.1178240864658135,0.09585457032676692,-0.32264334305150655,0.08516041293122316,-0.2590412111017662,0.5110175391280934,-0.23765432098765413,0.32115900067390074,-0.6428571428571429,-0.01333294843284107,-0.7684729064039408,-0.5130665538502054,0.0,0.0,-0.3775510204081634,-0.12755962047245625,-0.05513855245005916,0.022913699038454208,0.14766201804757975,0.1604481748271873,0.21848739495798314,0.5627744940631597,0.4545454545454546,0.5539492727700889,-0.7714285714285714,-0.28473827128851464,0.22321428571428598,0.4132575089024028,0.016692942594825184,0.42798476160999926,-0.08035714285714289,0.6052729188109567,0.17582417582417578,0.6267162471666654,-0.29886552496567664,-0.17357531405456325,0.25396825396825423,0.6848008890057137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8909090909090909,1.5454545454545454,0.13085515180099513,0.44249410895223673,0.5950230304480468,0.28628888100375866,-0.3578637009915933,-0.30876831303020286

The European Union (EU) on Wednesday announced that it will ban single-use plastics like straws, plates, cutlery, and cotton buds by 2021. The commission aims to reduce the use of the products by 50 percent by 2030. ""We have in Europe some of the best ideas and innovation, but unfortunately they often stay on paper, and we don't see them on the market."" The EU's executive branch has proposed banning plastic straws, plates, and cutlery, among other items, in order to reduce the 25 million tonnes of plastic waste produced in the EU each year. Environment ministers will get a first look at the plans at a meeting in Brussels on December 5. The European Commission has unveiled a new strategy for plastics, aiming to have all plastic packaging in Europe recyclable by 2030. The commission will also put a new 90 recycling target for plastic bottles by 2025, and a target to recycle 60 of other plastic packaging by 2025. The Commission plans to launch a voluntary pledging campaign, which will be supplemented by EU-wide rules on packaging and labelling that are to be proposed by the Commission later this year. The plan will also ""explore the feasibility of using the funds generated from extended producer responsibility schemes for investment in the circular economy,"" the commission said. The EU wants to cut plastic in half by 2030. ""This is an opportunity for Europe to lead the way, creating products that the world will demand for decades to come, and extracting more economic value from our precious and limited resources."" ""Every year Europeans generate 25m tonnes of plastic waste, but less than 30 is collected for recycling."" ""And in order to protect the health of European citizens, it will propose new rules on single-use plastics."" ""Tackling the plastics problem is a must and it can bring new opportunities for innovation, competitiveness and job creation,"" said Jyrki Katainen, vice-president responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness. The UK already has a number of restrictions on plastics including the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags which was introduced in 2015. The publication of the report coincides with a new EU-wide ban on single-use plastic straws, plates, cutlery and cotton buds.",llama_65B,2.4242424242424243,2.1666666666666665,2.4153846153846152,2.53125,2.6842105263157894,-0.06655622190408761,0.5363772514982683,0.18724421190405532,0.5014416287113432,0.34467120181405864,0.03831777740137879,0.35977945986356424,0.24291060957851643,0.4393004115226337,0.2334088804592581,0.5,0.32136709452930834,-0.39942528735632177,-0.0886539595042031,0.0,0.0,0.7619047619047619,0.7491944761979156,-0.2573132447669429,-0.24868402598172426,0.04375170905113465,-0.1310757686740612,0.6797385620915033,-0.4765011685494275,-0.056565656565656625,0.2588568761395511,0.8,1.406032351424281,0.9375000000000002,0.5149431793068849,0.7011035889826579,0.6944147855016783,0.1458333333333333,0.6113351176780826,-0.3076923076923077,0.3524482149600193,-0.2615073343449671,0.04085919425719681,0.9029982363315701,1.069195889153517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3818181818181818,2.1818181818181817,0.3438609237174965,0.7542662293638768,0.4851726248268692,-0.25740260226122175,0.34856603280889537,0.40269737572149955

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested and charged with manslaughter. The stricken vessel, the Nautilus, has been raised but no body was found and the search for Ms Wall goes on. Mr Madsen initially said that he dropped Ms Wall off before it sank but police say he has now changed his statement - although they have not said what to. Police gave no other information on why they thought the Nautilus was deliberately sunk, but it contradicts Mr Madsen's explanation that there was a technical fault. Mr Madsen has denied involvement in Ms Wall's death, and will be held in custody for 24 days while investigations continue. Ms Wall's boyfriend first reported her missing after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the submarine. She had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Police are still appealing for witnesses who may have seen Ms Wall on Thursday evening. ""We're still hoping that we'll find Kim Wall alive, but we are preparing ourselves for the fact that she may not be,"" Copenhagen police homicide chief Jens Moller said.",human,0.9166666666666666,0.8333333333333334,1.0615384615384615,1.0625,0.8947368421052632,-0.5008178320514971,-0.26937352427300126,-0.6755000120142519,-0.3170648802404311,0.17687074829931979,-0.38353698317966656,0.44037005887300235,0.0431449273533697,0.41049382716049393,0.07370447905986122,-0.8,-0.4675679904816031,0.36724137931034484,-0.1804499763167204,0.0,0.0,-0.5000000000000001,-0.6899261096371512,0.5446463680900293,-0.4335339692221828,0.5414273995077932,0.290380174929209,-0.3823529411764707,-0.6010848809168959,1.7945454545454549,0.46016348640049265,0.6000000000000001,0.6350513288530985,-0.40625,0.4146514167772252,-0.017527589724566396,0.1732322780836039,0.11249999999999992,0.7446298226037289,0.9538461538461538,1.5012222323083073,0.8891249367728881,0.8182077354089524,0.15238095238095262,0.5034614865513315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4909090909090909,1.1818181818181819,0.3141364545337609,0.21066634519753177,0.6413884613920506,0.5605298818580766,-0.2945657186970382,-0.20765085280619713
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Researchers from Columbia University have established a method for growing human hair in a dish using 3D printing without the need for implantation into human skin. The method uses a biodegradable polymer that can be tailored to produce any material, including synthetic or natural fibres like silk and keratin. The technique could allow us to grow our own full-body prosthetics by printing new body parts directly onto existing tissue - without having to wait around for it to heal first. And since you'll only need two halves of an ear instead of four ears once they're grown, this might also mean we won't notice your missing ears as much when wearing customised implants either.",gpt_j,0.09848484848484848,-0.16666666666666666,0.16923076923076924,0.140625,-0.15789473684210525,0.002246160181253408,0.10660529482263172,0.00653475998169464,-0.24950216506304268,1.0136054421768705,-0.4221391614776488,1.2304457527333894,0.6159728931567847,1.058641975308642,0.3240913545954138,1.0,-0.1741573433812054,2.3922413793103448,3.256932339931599,0.0,0.0,0.5714285714285713,-0.5484118269291972,-0.6111189563214894,-0.533515139356195,1.575061525840853,0.3835878119357881,0.3823529411764707,0.5759952860518031,0.9545454545454548,0.6400759197773267,0.30000000000000004,1.0451554033951607,0.15625000000000008,-0.03148411385163844,0.1022442733933043,0.3882285676537811,0.9374999999999999,1.562589364325897,0.9999999999999998,1.1910645447365649,1.0460293373798686,1.0764246859454363,-0.38095238095238076,-0.5039733773760188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.09090909090909091,-0.5567637315293833,0.16738285447068696,-0.23612025017779636,-0.3807712114236218,0.7685900683737148,0.5088635931697469

It claims that the short-form video app is a cybersecurity threat, but declined to describe in detail what dangers the Navy believes are present. According to a memo obtained by the Associated Press, the Navy claims TikTok is a ""cybersecurity threat"" and cites the potential for data leaks as the primary reason for the ban. It also mentions the potential for third-party data collection. In the memo, the Navy's cybersecurity officials warn that using government-issued phones to use TikTok or any other social media platform could pose a threat. They ask that Navy personnel delete TikTok from any government-issued phone and even to uninstall it from any personal phones that are used for Navy work. As we've reported previously, TikTok has a history of vulnerabilities that have led to unauthorized data collection. For example, in May 2019, researchers from the University of California, San Diego found that the TikTok app could be exploited to extract personal information. TikTok's parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, has faced accusations that it is too closely tied to the Chinese government. Last month, the US Army barred the use of TikTok in order to avoid a potential security breach. ""These concerns were raised to the Army by soldiers who use TikTok,"" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Ochoa told Military.com. ""We do not allow it on government phones."" The US Navy has not responded to The Verge's request for comment.

One of the substances said to have been injected is Fluimucil, at the heart of the controversy over a mystery package delivered to Bradley Wiggins in 2011. Team Sky had been renowned for their robust no-needle stance. In March, British cyclist Josh Edmondson told the BBC he broke the sport's rules by secretly injecting himself with a cocktail of vitamins when riding for Team Sky. The substances are not illegal under World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules but there are concerns about the ethics of administering them intravenously. Ukad and the UCU are investigating claims by Edmondson that Team Sky covered up his use of banned injections. Team Sky deny doing so, insisting that Edmondson did not confess at the time, and that they did not report the case because of concerns about his mental wellbeing. PA's source, who sent the information to the House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and Ukad, is understood to have worked for Team Sky. The source said some Team Sky doctors were using intravenous recovery methods towards the end of the team's difficult first season in 2010 and continued to do so despite the UCI ban, which Team Sky publicly supported. The source has claimed Team Sky hired Dr Fabio Bartalucci in late 2010 as he was believed to have expertise in IV recovery. The Italian, who was picked up by police in an anti-doping raid at the 2001 Giro d'Italia but not charged, left in 2011. Ukad said it ""does not discuss or disclose information in relation to its investigations."" Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee chairman Damian Collins said: ""This raises further concerns about how Team Sky policed the use of medication for riders outside of competition, and how hard they were prepared to press up against the line of what was allowed or acceptable."" BBC Sport attempted to contact Team Sky. However, a spokesperson earlier told PA: ""It is right that any concerns are reported to and dealt with by the appropriate authorities, and we will continue to co-operate with them.""",human,2.015151515151515,1.6666666666666667,1.9538461538461538,2.046875,1.8421052631578947,-0.23809707057935944,0.30623923057897556,-0.11886805776356252,0.1706700138010162,0.48979591836734654,0.5450619583696419,0.4317353518362768,0.5279329671342765,0.5055555555555558,0.6304337071147902,-0.3666666666666667,0.33520485785869913,-0.28275862068965507,0.13614528811022136,0.0,0.0,-0.34285714285714297,0.08841285252400366,1.1736342997425562,0.7113220520469984,0.7022149302707136,0.36981225366895587,0.5862745098039216,0.6590927275715907,0.20787878787878786,0.08944019397875885,0.6666666666666667,1.1232467150627288,0.3437500000000002,0.6419689579935629,0.062320319020680734,0.23124722469648024,0.9624999999999998,0.7199810360639356,0.2153846153846152,0.042640234049975925,0.41841173495194733,0.5829631409434874,0.27089947089947114,0.3950688373583027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3818181818181818,1.4545454545454546,0.2108637822140626,0.723527647722845,0.05301280455604717,-0.05285109835696233,0.281624933395343,0.43580999927316544

I can't do full justice here, but hopefully this will give some sense for how things work and what the options are at each stage along the way. If you have an idea in your head about something that would make life better, then step one is to generate some ideas on paper and figure out which ones seem like they could actually be accomplished: Write down all the possible roads ahead that depend upon it Ask yourself questions from previous steps - What happens if we don't take X? What else does my plan need to support? How many different ways could I get there? If I had more resources, could I accomplish those plans with fewer gobs of cash or human labour? One minor point before moving further into this section... the second bullet is where most people fail: you'll often hear highly successful companies talking up the importance of ""failing fast"" and ""continuous improvement,"" without ever bothering to explain exactly why such methods produce success. As far as I know, nobody has identified the reasons behind this basic guideline yet. Maybe someday someone will come up with a theoryexplanation. But in any case, it should be obvious that it makes no sense to say "" 1 failure means 1 lesson learned."" You're not really learning anything by failing; you're just wasting time, money, risk capital etc., based only on what was wrong with your last attempt. So while ""failure shouldn't matter"" may sound good, it sounds sort of stupid because once you've built something, it doesn't become less valuable because it failed! It's inherently valuable per se regardless of whether anybody tried. Anyway, let's move away from philosophy on failure and onto describing the specific practicalities involved in deciding which projects deserve our attention. Phase One: Anecdotes Empathy Most businesses start off as small groups working together at home over coffee, discussing their problems and brainstorming solutions. While there certainly exist smaller scale alternatives, most startups usually involve 4 or 5 people who spend 40 hours working every weekdays between 10am and 6pm attempting to solve real world problems using software. The goal is to find a scalable solution that other humans can use instead of relying solely on machines. At first, the founders simply organize around problem areas that they care about individually, creating ad hoc teams dealing with whatever issues happen to pop up during that iteration. They try to keep their processes simple so that new hires don't need much training, although sometimes mentorships or apprenticeship programs help to demystify unfamiliar concepts. Eventually, once they feel comfortable with the technology stack, they begin scaling operations through hirer expeditions across cities and countries, acquiring customers directly and introducing larger numbers of employees to the product. Across all stages, the primary concern is finding a viable business model that keeps the lights running on past the next day. Anything short of this constitutes either poor planning or lackadaisical execution. In reality, almost everything worthwhile takes two phases - prototypes followed by productionmarket testing. And as long as your early adopters find value in the thing you made, even a couple dozen random users isn't going to kill you. Of course, if you did manage to skip Phase Zero entirely, there's always freelance design agencies to fill in gaps until you get serious enough to invite folks to join forces: This is essentially the standard path laid forth by venture capitalists. Sometimes entrepreneurs get lucky and identify profitable niches immediately, but (almost) invariably many iterations and pivots later, the company finds itself somewhere resembling this: But consider the costs associated with failing at Phase Two. There are several sources of wasted effort; let me walk through some of the common realistic scenarios that lead to startup collapse. Many of these are very difficult to detect unless you already have traction, but when you reach that point, it becomes painfully clear which paths will bring you to profitability versus chaos. Regardless, let's look at some of them now. We'll see another example of ""breaking"" below. Problem 1: Unsuccessful Products Too Complicated To Understand By Consumers There aren't enough programmers willing to do unpaid overtime When a major customer complains (as many do), you think 'Oh well, at least he read our documentation' and work feverishly to add features to your app. Unfortunately, he's reading Google Translate. You push code 11pm Friday night. Tons of bugs creep in. He comes back Monday morning expecting an updated feature set, and gets none. Your server crashes. He calls his ISP complaining that your site is being slow. Everyone blames everyone else with increasing levels of frustration. All kinds of broken interactions ensue.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must be made safer in order for it to continue. ""It's a fantastic game that we all enjoy,"" said Prof Pollock, who led the research with Dr Kristina Skierka from Wolfson College. ""But if you're going to play, why are there so many injuries? Why aren't people keeping their brains alive while they keep on playing?"" Play Video 1:44 'We have no choice': players fall silent during first minute of Super League games - video report The researchers looked specifically at four types of tackle - head-high (above shoulder height), low or high-to-low, high-mid-off (hits above midriff) and side hits below waist level. Each was associated with more severe injury than others. The data were collected between 2014 and 2017 by monitoring medical records from professional rugby league matches played across England. In total the study included 722 career concussions among 2,364 men aged 18-35 years old. There was a progressive increase over time in concussion frequency so that 8 of players sustained one per season within six seasons; 15 in seven seasons and 27 in eight seasons. Of these numbers 60 occurred when tackling highhead-high and 32 involved multiple blows to the head as part of this tackle alone. 23 took place after tackles involving players being tackled near to the ground. Skierka says other sports such as Australian Rules football which has rules aimed preventing skull fractures also show higher rates of brain trauma compared with rugby union where helmets prevent more serious impacts happening. Comparing both codes she found less risk from head-high tackles in women because they tend to use lower levels of force whereas, for example, male backs often engage in fierce clashes around rucks due to positions and tactics used in lineouts leading to greater risks overall. She recommends reducing most forms of mandatory body checking before lowering legal limits on how hard tacklers should hit each other. Currently World Rugby only bans neck roll techniques designed to choke opponents' airways. Players caught performing them can face three weeks out plus possible further punishment depending upon match review panel decisions. It does not ban taking off rival team members legs just like NFL rule changes mean fewer defensive players are allowed to land full weight on quarterbacks. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A player receives treatment following a collision Photograph: Richard SellersPA Images via Getty Images Pollack argues the same kind of change would reduce head impact injury in rugby league though admits it may make some collisions look even uglier and harder hitting. But he calls current law enforcement ineffective anyway as challenges remain difficult to assess objectively since hairline damage suffered in training often goes unreported meaning incidents deemed innocuous become red card offences once put under scrutiny by officials. He adds that simply banning certain styles could lead to unintended consequences given different shape heads experience coming into contact differently. Overall though his findings suggest repeated heavy traumas occurring regularly enough causes long term harm similar to those experienced by boxers affected by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known colloquially as CTE. This is described as neurodegenerative disease believed caused by repetitive knocks inflicted mainly through boxing punches yet increasingly seen in American Football players although its exact causes remain unclear. Current evidence suggests any number of factors including genetics and age might contribute towards susceptibility alongside lifestyle choices affecting diet alcohol intake etc.. Risks rise rapidly late teens early 20s mostly linked closely to physical activity but younger athletes may also be vulnerable especially if already prone to psychological problems. CTE first came to prominence with former USA footballer Junior Seau having shot himself dead aged 43 in 2012 leaving behind a note saying he wanted to leave behind clues about what had happened to him physically throughout life. His case spurred a flurry of ongoing studies now revealing the condition afflicts thousands of retired pros particularly at higher risk include ex-rugby union international Alix Popham diagnosed posthumously aged 40 last year.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks. It's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens. ""There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,"" he said. ""There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty."" Small wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling. Thankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. ""Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,"" he told the BBC. Sadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around. Studies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people. ""We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,"" he said. ""You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US."" Touchscreens can be ""reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens,"" said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets. It is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low. ""For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,"" he said. ""It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time."" The study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour. Thankfully, other fixes are at hand. To begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale. ""They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,"" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen. Also, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought. There are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50 more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp. The fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years. Then there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet. By mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use. ""Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,"" said Mr Block.",human,5.363636363636363,5.833333333333333,5.984615384615385,6.03125,5.684210526315789,-0.4990878965907215,-0.0026364186835853834,-0.5589234938262387,-0.1559418407734698,-0.08163265306122466,0.3748248664765781,0.2396131202691339,0.6337358976613937,0.23549382716049377,0.557822761822959,0.3500000000000001,0.3584357837414161,0.2922413793103448,0.5683349345910299,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714233,0.4244371743121009,-0.49318371913664055,-0.0449634601090948,-0.009844134536505296,0.2359112825306603,-0.1338235294117646,0.3701258424708328,0.11454545454545452,0.3084744667770337,0.0,0.6350513288530985,0.4140625,1.1775604273174543,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1068954687410526,-0.11249999999999992,0.7233164202962429,0.44615384615384596,0.6229202652546518,0.22228123419322202,0.2842732952430296,0.307936507936508,0.4811526148431614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.1272727272727274,3.3636363636363638,0.2123754144165029,1.3205511244671275,0.07393777301425444,0.5676945344739681,-0.42919845795842027,-0.3149569586215956

Whether it's five-a-side football, basketball, or yoga, there's a sport out there for everyone.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.5378787878787878,0.6666666666666666,0.8461538461538461,0.8125,1.2105263157894737,-0.8877131529907246,0.10021938516271775,-0.593765106523859,-0.3265421718235533,-0.24489795918367352,-0.08301355876270672,0.37417063825810676,0.04699742475497244,0.28086419753086433,-0.07095420326516247,-0.38888888888888884,-0.34184504385573017,0.6839080459770115,0.4128142540958932,0.0,0.0,-0.047619047619047825,0.222646116896408,-0.9125090069049919,-0.8752507948610619,0.12031719989062059,0.3173512746330884,-0.04248366013071881,0.008766992357005505,-0.9121212121212122,-0.26291358384811964,1.2444444444444447,1.3216869073674549,0.3645833333333335,0.8390846816534374,-0.0973754984698136,0.17677669529663695,0.06249999999999994,0.44161546035554855,0.769230769230769,0.163523748786478,-0.17433822289664472,-0.0795377239676952,1.001763668430335,0.6637507653953713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38181818181818183,0.7272727272727273,0.15955613799399987,0.13663444574625236,0.4135736997344942,0.6662244759320107,-0.5784658845738061,-0.32278604275719075

The lab-grown brains are simplified versions of the organ that is grown in a dish or jar, and they could be used as models for understanding how fetuses develop early on in life. The study was led by Dr. Laura Bierman from Stanford University School of Medicine's Department of Molecular Cellular Physiology (MCP) at its Medical Center campus. Her team aimed to better understand how neural stem cells - which can grow into any type of neuron in the nervous system - develop before birth and throughout childhood. In their work published online this week in Nature Neuron journal, the researchers developed an array containing more than 10,000 electrodes called iCell GeNeuro, which provides data about how these cells behave when stimulated with different signals. ""One thing we found out through our research is there were very rich interactions among individual neurons within these complex networks,"" says co-author Ryan Meehan, PhD, who joined the faculty at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health after working with Bierman previously. ""We're trying to capture what makes those connections happen so we can learn even more."" During fetal development, the first roughly 60 days, the human embryo is not yet capable of independent thought; it relies almost exclusively on external stimuli such as hormones and other environmental factors. But between 40 weeks gestation and delivery the fetus starts developing its own internally generated electric fields. These static currents help direct movement patterns and create small muscle contractions, but the nature of those waves remains poorly understood. ""In previous studies researchers had tried to record nerve cell spikes using electrode arrays, but these efforts proved challenging because each spike travels down one strand of axon, making them hard to detect unless simultaneous recordings are made across multiple strands,"" explains senior author Bierman, Ph.D., director of the Brain Initiative Lab at Stanford.",gpt_j,1.6515151515151516,1.0,1.353846153846154,1.34375,1.6842105263157894,0.9570516526758083,0.178564287727037,0.8229910285227005,0.5943042181672228,1.103277674706246,0.9457144488585635,0.6122792262405382,0.5774181993907278,0.5636924803591473,0.6547970781262962,1.4090909090909092,2.000527917440292,0.7899686520376176,0.8334844623258104,0.0,0.0,1.1168831168831166,1.2677364267757607,0.3645270967531692,1.841125677453388,1.0112610932955475,1.330254746072298,1.077540106951872,1.0520309050266767,-0.06363636363636359,0.361133231858608,0.4363636363636365,1.0579814820959963,0.24147727272727273,-0.03806713757698639,0.04780251743063577,-0.0021959932252629292,0.017045454545454527,0.37844063726550303,0.3496503496503495,0.28569931933558923,0.4754678806272129,0.4286388362165402,0.9119769119769122,0.7795916950457548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2181818181818183,1.7272727272727273,-0.5035523098636172,0.9234207235169981,-0.0497767013888328,-1.1258876932169206,1.3227538102774736,1.0697520462395564

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the cofounders of Instagram, have resigned and plan to leave the company. No reason is given in the article, but it is noted that Jan Koum, the cofounder of WhatsApp, left Facebook in May amid reports of disagreements with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over privacy issues. Instagram and WhatsApp are both Facebook subsidiaries, acquired in 2012 and 2014, respectively, and both Krieger and Systrom were active in Zuckerberg's inner circle at Facebook. The departure of these two founders is important because they were the last of the original founders of Instagram. The other two, Robert S. ""Boz"" Bosworth and Josh Riedel, left in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram for 1 billion. It is important to realize that when Facebook acquired Instagram, it didn't buy a company, it bought a team. The acquisition was made just a few weeks after the launch of the Instagram app. It had not yet reached a million users, but Facebook, which had been pursuing a competitive app, saw the potential and the talent and made the offer. Now, it seems, those who remain of that team are gone. It will be interesting to see who takes the reins and how well the brand does under new leadership.

In fact, about 15 of Americans do not have a smartphone. The Pew Research Center reports that the breakdown is along familiar lines, with younger and more affluent Americans being more likely to have a smartphone. However, as smartphones become less expensive, even low-income Americans will have them. Google and others have been addressing this issue for some time. One of the features of Google's Go app is that it can use offline AI to help translate what you want to say into a foreign language. There is also a version of Google Maps for the web, so you can get directions even if you don't have a map app on your phone. How do you reach people who don't have smartphones? If you have an online business, you need to reach people who are online, and that means using the Web and mobile apps. If you have a brick-and-mortar business, you need to reach people who are online, because they are looking for you there, even if they don't have a smartphone. And you also need to reach people who are not online, because they don't know you are there. The good news is that your customers are moving online, and if you aren't there, they may find your competitors and do business with them.

Most businesses are not aware of how much fraud is taking place online, and most aren't aware of how easy it is to be hacked. You need to be aware of what is going on and take steps to prevent your website from being hacked. I've been a business owner for over 25 years. I've had employees steal from me. I've been sued for a million dollars. I've had a client go bankrupt and owe me tens of thousands of dollars. And I've had my website hacked. When my website was hacked, it was not fun, but it was not nearly as devastating as any of those other things. I had to change my passwords, and we had to clean up some of the mess, but it didn't cost us any money. However, not all hacking is that innocuous. Some hacking can cost you a lot of money. If your website has an e-commerce function, someone can intercept a credit card number and use it. Both WordPress and SquareSpace have built-in features that will help prevent hacking. One of the things you can do is change the password on your website on a regular basis. Use a password generator that will create a complex password that includes numbers, symbols, and upper and lowercase letters. I use and recommend the WordPress plugin WordFence.

Sakshi Yadav works on a farm near Roorkee in northern Indian state Uttar Pradesh [Uday VermaAl Jazeera] In Gujarat, Delhi and Punjab states you can find an array of milk producers - dairy co-operatives whose members are mostly subsistence farmers producing for local markets or directly to dairies. Not many have electricity connections so they rely solely on their solar panels usually powered through wind mills. Most don't even own refrigerators but instead store their produce at ambient temperature not exceeding 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). They use traditional methods like hand washing that also often results in products with higher levels of bacteria than those produced in modern factories. So when we say there's more going into our food supply than just what goes onto serving plates these days we're talking about unhygienic conditions where cows come first. And now its getting worse. Digital revolution The digital revolution has brought rapid changes in the way people buy goods online which could be good news if only smaller businesses were able to adapt fast enough. Shoppers today get the best deals and widest choice online because so many stores do business electronically rather than via paper bills and snail mail. This means computers handle payments instead of cashiers while retailers receive instant delivery updates as customers make purchases. Yet despite this convenience and flexibility some companies still struggle to survive. A recent study showed nearly half a million firms started doing business over the last five years yet three quarters failed within 12 months. ""The problem is no matter how sophisticated your technology is,"" said Mark Simon, chief executive officer of Fintech Advisors based in San Francisco, who was part of one team advising early stage tech startup entrepreneurs. ""It will never replace the value of face to face human interaction."" With few jobs available for computer science graduates most young professionals opt out of careers that seem stagnating at best. In addition to that, data privacy breaches, high costs and slow speeds among other security problems plague internet services in developing countries such as China South Africa and Pakistan. Apart from technological challenges pervasive poverty limits access to affordable basic financial information including banking services mobile phones across low income groups lack the infrastructure needed to facilitate transactions and money transfers. It's not all bad though. While India's GDP per capita stands third worldwide after Japan and France, government investment in agriculture is lagging far behind private sector investments. These trends mean huge potential gains for new strong players making progress against big banks and IT giants. The marketplace Where vendors selling e-commerce web sites or apps compete with each other to attract users offering better prices. Amazon, eBay and Alibaba dominate global trade trading billions worth daily. Local buyers pay upfront fees assessed by the site then send payment details they received instantly to sellers who confirm shipping details before completing sales. Some may offer discounts or zero percent exchange rates to help break the bank barrier. Online marketplaces provide a platform where suppliers sell items directly to shoppers without having to go through wholesalers middlemen. Today firms like Flipkart group start ups backed by investors such as Tencent Alibaba Walmart Google are involved in direct retailing. Walmarts website is used to book movies tickets hotels and even rent cars. Its prices range between 50 cents and 10 depending on type of product sold. Almost 80 percent of Indians shop online which accounts for six percent of total consumer spending according to McKinsey Company. But much of that activity takes place outside brick-and-mortar shops which account for only 18 percent of overall shopping revenue globally. Because online commerce growth occurs alongside stagnant offline revenues compounded by declining incomes savers don't always feel inclined to spend extra on nonessential items. This makes them reluctant to buy clothes shoes diapers toys etc online unless bargains are too tempting to ignore. Lowest price rule Many traditional merchants work around this challenge by offering deep discount promotions targeting younger generations. Prices drop by up to 40 percent during festive periods such as Diwali lanterns and firecrackers for sale through December 31 and New Year celebrations. Additionally even if you've paid full price once you might decide to impulse shop later. Goodwill effect Another factor in play here is called the goodwill effect. When someone buys something she wants to add it to her collection leaving the seller nothing else to show. Sellers try hard to entice repeat visits by offering merchandise attractive offers on repeated purchases. For example, 10 percent off coupon codes can sweeten the deal for shoppers. Despite occasional efforts to curb fraud internet crooks are becoming increasingly creative using tools such as identity theft scams preying on unsuspecting consumers. Fraudsters target elderly parents particularly mothers on social media platforms pretending to be sons wanting to claim inheritances or widows needing emergency funds. Global brands are occasionally targeted by fake websites posing as official portals allowing scammers gain entry credentials that give access to sensitive customer data and finally malicious code susceptible to viruses Once inside the scammer hijacks user names passwords credit card numbers birth o!taggers barters makes swaps.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate the behavior of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. They have been fabricated with various designs that give them interesting properties, such as the ability to be invisible to microwave radiation, or to focus terahertz radiation. In a paper published in Nano Letters, scientists have developed a design for a metasurface that is capable of a much more sophisticated manipulation of light than previously reported metasurfaces. The new design, developed by scientists at the University of California, San Diego and at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is a sheet of silicon that contains an array of tiny pillars, each of which is a different height. When light hits the metasurface, it encounters the pillars. Depending on the height of the pillars, the light can be reflected or transmitted through. ""This is the first metasurface capable of manipulating the phase, amplitude, polarization and direction of light at the same time and in a reversible way,"" said Boubacar Kante, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. The ability to manipulate light's direction is particularly important. The researchers have calculated that the metasurface could be used to create so-called vector beams, which have controllable shapes. These beams can be used to manipulate particles as small as atoms. ""You can imagine a flat lens made of this metasurface that can be programmed to create vector beams that have different shapes, like a vortex or spherical beam,"" said Alexandra Boltasseva, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. ""This type of flat lens will be extremely useful for applications where a regular lens cannot be used, like in the human body. It will also be useful in optoelectronic devices that use polarized light, such as solar cells and sensors."" The researchers still have to figure out how to fabricate the new metasurface. Kante says that the pillars need to be about 100 nanometers in diameter and spaced about 100 nanometers apart in order to work.",llama_65B,1.9393939393939394,1.8333333333333333,2.0615384615384613,2.109375,1.6842105263157894,0.5945190608286389,1.6570863020363291,1.0307222462793715,1.5174390574818466,0.1972789115646257,0.6666291815286894,0.3561816652649285,0.38597504781081504,0.37808641975308654,0.5718163389157647,0.625,0.6967948947595521,0.3297413793103448,0.5047652506735223,0.0,0.0,0.22321428571428556,0.06944944621198083,-0.3162808633593673,0.5397992164788484,0.02461033634126324,0.16624829402568755,0.1433823529411765,0.9597154752512591,0.7795454545454548,0.3626216812306879,-0.07499999999999996,0.34665752184500287,0.6250000000000001,1.2447632973211304,-0.3469002132987109,-0.016840188228817395,0.37499999999999994,1.1314845506585092,-0.038461538461538526,0.23106023866499983,0.0653768335862418,0.018172924107269613,0.34126984126984145,1.119213453610903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8727272727272727,1.5454545454545454,0.5217147570673736,0.5405244913642583,0.4016405455524318,-0.926714724939715,0.7319532513042568,1.1989353355448014

I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I'll be spending my Sunday off playing with the kids on the grass courts. It's my favourite thing to do on my day off at Wimbledon and I'm going to try to bring a few of the players with me. That's a nice sentiment from Nadal but I doubt he'll be able to get many of his fellow pros to join him in the fun. The Spaniard is among the few who are actually still in the tournament at this stage. The second week is now set and there are some intriguing match-ups on the cards. Nadal will take on Juan Martin Del Potro in the round of sixteen. Their head-to-head record is 10-5 in Rafa's favour and he is yet to lose to the Argentine in the majors. Del Potro beat Nadal at the 2009 US Open, the only time the two have met at a Grand Slam. ""Juan Martin is a player that can be dangerous on this surface,"" said Nadal after his victory on Saturday. ""He has a big serve, he's very good on the baseline with a big forehand. He's a very smart player. I know I need to be at 100 per cent if I want to keep having chances to win. I hope to be ready to play my best."" In the quarterfinals, Nadal could face either Marin Cilic or Novak Djokovic. Djokovic made quick work of Horacio Zeballos on Saturday and is looking sharp. ""I'm just glad I'm able to win in straight sets and play as well as I did today, and I hope I can continue playing as well as this in the next one."" If Nadal and Djokovic get to the semis, they will be joined by a member of the Federer-Murray generation. Roger Federer takes on Adrian Mannarino and Andy Murray plays Benoit Paire. I'm expecting to see Federer and Murray advance in straight sets, both have been in great form. The final quarter features the big serving Kevin Anderson, John Isner, Philipp Kohlschreiber and Gilles Muller. Isner and Muller will face off in the round of sixteen. In the women's draw, there are still a few big names left in the tournament. Jelena Ostapenko is still in the draw and the French Open champion will face Elina Svitolina. The winner will likely take on Petra Kvitova in the quarterfinals. In the second quarter, Venus Williams will face Jelena Jankovic and the winner will likely face Johanna Konta in the quarterfinals. The winner of the quarter will face either Karolina Pliskova or Caroline Garcia. The bottom half features Garbine Muguruza, Angelique Kerber, Simona Halep and Victoria Azarenka.

Caf say that countries wishing to host the tournament have until 30 September to express their interest. So far, Nigeria and Morocco remain part of a rival bid for 2030. However, in January 2017, it was revealed that they were no longer involved in the bidding process and Uganda has since been added as an alternative venue. Read more Rumours about the FAI's decision not to take forward a proposed switch from Dublin to Abu Dhabi resurfaced last year. The Irish Federation initially said that it had ""no plans whatsoever at this stage to consider moving 2018 or 2022."" But having identified an opportunity with FIFA to discuss potential options on the future tournaments, there is now renewed speculation. Sources suggest that both of these nations - along with Nigeria - could be ready next month to put up bids for the 2026 edition. A representative from one of the three confirmed interested parties told The42: ""We'll make our final choice before end-September."" There remains strong support within government circles towards hosting the event and it is believed that when a formal invitation arrives in October or November, all three candidates will be given serious consideration. This week, the United States won the right to host the World Cup finals after beating out decades-old rivals Mexico in controversial circumstances. Ireland's two biggest competitors, England and Scotland, did not even get a vote because the 2016 European Championship qualifying format meant none of them - not even Northern Ireland - qualified automatically. A source close to Fifa president Gianni Infantino claims he feels Ireland would benefit from being chosen ahead of Spain, Portugal and Italy. It is understood that Infantino met senior members of the FAI hierarchy shortly after taking over his role and that officials privately expressed keenness on a return to South America or Africa. But Ireland's chances of landing the showpiece event suffered another blow this afternoon when Italian giants Juventus issued a statement denying any involvement in a possible move back home. They said: ""Juventus FC does not participate [in] any kind of international competitions inside Europe. We don't think so. ""If we do I wouldn't know why. You can ask someone else but isn't it true? If you want something we pay attention and if anything happens you tell us exactly what happened."" In response to questions regarding reports linking Dublin to France 2024, an official later reiterated that no such planning exists. Yesterday evening, the FAI released guidance to clubs clarifying its stance regarding transfers during Euro 2020 qualifiers, which begins against Denmark in Copenhagen tomorrow night. While approving commercial deals between players and clubs outside of the domestic league, the governing body stipulated that no player may leave an EU member state without prior permission. Clubs who receive a transfer request must respond within seven days while those who wish to terminate a deal must also provide reasons by then.

He claimed: ""Africa has always held firm belief in sporting events uniting people and bringing positive changes in the lives of many individuals. After 17 years away from being able to enjoy a major continental championship - which only four other continents have ever hosted Africans deserve to celebrate the arrival of a global showcase on their continent which rewards fair play and sportsmanship above all.

The data collected from these images can be used by scientists to study the sun's behavior and better understand phenomena like solar storms and coronal mass ejections that can impact Earth's technology and infrastructure.",gpt-3.5-trubo,0.007575757575757576,-0.16666666666666666,0.015384615384615385,-0.03125,-0.05263157894736842,1.0606664898676932,1.1213360300343822,1.0881453712752809,0.8003034910492866,0.6054421768707481,0.32606611385683715,0.5828427249789739,0.40311457819832075,0.3456790123456791,0.4309311763080452,2.0,-0.1741573433812054,0.14224137931034483,0.33215360024550217,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999999998,0.1669933755259723,-0.846989430691187,-0.7964397891382146,0.5414273995077932,0.9354598572711881,0.19117647058823534,-0.5425015360388699,0.2545454545454547,0.46741408469356466,1.8,1.9624165291600077,0.6250000000000001,-0.8263808142413196,0.4016739311879811,0.34912286907698237,0.9374999999999999,1.562589364325897,-0.15384615384615388,0.3659636666791874,-0.5230146686899342,-0.6735753140545633,-0.38095238095238076,0.06428002535760498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.026952678661577346,-0.19645588861746022,-0.0194293234432016,-1.147316528677374,1.0875445255185714,1.0090677252377553

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Microsoft's Edge browser will be upgraded to the Chromium-based version on January 15. Windows 10 users will be automatically transitioned to the new version. The launch date was announced last month, but the exact date was unknown. On the Microsoft blog, the company announced that the new Edge browser will be available on January 15 for Windows 10, 7, and 8.1. The new Chromium version is significantly improved. It is 40 percent faster than the previous version, has better compatibility with existing Chrome extensions, and has a new Collections feature that lets you collect and share websites, images, and files from across the web. The update is not automatic, but users can manually download it from the Microsoft Edge Insider site. For Windows 7 and 8.1, users will need to download the Chrome installation package from the Microsoft Edge Insider website. The reason for the transition to Chromium is that Microsoft is trying to give users a better browsing experience, especially for those who use Google services. Edge's previous engine is no longer competitive with Chrome or Firefox. This is why Microsoft has switched to the Chromium engine that most browsers use today. This will also make it easier for developers to create websites and extensions that work with Edge. Edge 79 is currently available on the Canary channel, and will be available on the Dev and Beta channels later this month. It will be available to all Windows 10 users on January 15th.",llama_65B,1.0075757575757576,1.5,0.9692307692307692,1.03125,0.8947368421052632,0.2944847746647307,0.33888804567339254,0.3950958889075487,0.6882219779282643,-0.5655976676384841,0.08888274524768017,-0.5365853658536585,-0.06106861936332021,-0.4783950617283949,0.11117781040448875,-0.0714285714285714,-0.02680552031457499,0.0886699507389163,0.10410266189713502,0.0,0.0,-0.5918367346938777,0.10777866292222568,0.1807319219196384,-0.18934441208029487,-0.7383100902379,0.22668636609600598,-0.6554621848739497,-0.24215898439808428,0.5545454545454546,-0.3885564751877722,0.37142857142857144,1.143454048857366,-0.17857142857142858,0.03602754389548067,0.4444495965872206,0.6161485512011269,-0.29464285714285715,-0.01358852722025258,-0.3516483516483517,0.19533701564713052,0.03735819062070963,0.19844341663111784,-0.44444444444444425,-0.003751644726300589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21818181818181817,0.45454545454545453,0.82510678085305,0.15608565979902983,0.039668202029869856,-0.05654678636848493,-0.2455275322688997,-0.19696667543383584

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time. Around 4,000 of Fresh Easy's 5,000 employees face redundancy and the firm is likely to close all its stores in California, Arizona and Nevada. The company has been trying to find a buyer for the business but so far has failed to do so. In order to try and make the sale more attractive to potential buyers, Tesco is offering incentives such as cash payments, rent reductions and lease extensions. It is also offering to cover some of the costs associated with the closure of the stores. In addition, Tesco is offering to pay suppliers in advance for any goods or services they supply in the period up to the completion of the sale. The supermarket giant hopes to complete the sale by the end of the year, but it is unclear who may be interested in buying the chain. Some observers have speculated that private equity firms may be interested in taking over the business, while others suggest that US retailers could take advantage of the opportunity to acquire an established presence in the market. Regardless of who eventually purchases the chain, it is clear that Tesco's decision to offload Fresh Easy marks the end of an era for the British retailer, which had ambitious plans for the US market when it first bought the chain in 2013.",text-davinci-003,1.0606060606060606,0.6666666666666666,1.2769230769230768,1.296875,0.5789473684210527,-0.5358339899057828,0.015117210632356132,-0.10614900745265175,0.40158378766622477,0.7981859410430838,0.14941748383115275,1.1800766283524904,0.1286627394264353,1.1738683127572016,0.11889300395218579,-0.05555555555555558,0.2149342271760268,0.6839080459770115,0.8097439892376301,0.0,0.0,0.8571428571428571,0.4116962052064427,-0.28352107525246484,0.0490668762065832,0.5797101449275359,-0.2084724317992164,0.6372549019607845,0.3922168831235305,0.7989898989898991,0.43814367686252376,0.3555555555555556,0.9070889058314433,1.6145833333333333,0.7617764353326161,-0.0973754984698136,0.17677669529663695,1.2291666666666665,-0.008203462040152211,0.0512820512820513,0.36895006136371217,0.34867644579328955,0.8492280354138645,-0.18342151675484983,-0.2743845943447427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6181818181818182,1.1818181818181819,0.3570741065181751,0.3446298765101433,0.5347844784341839,-0.19295009670008179,0.5321324467140296,0.788972939058914

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies used a technique called fetal hippocampal-enriched culture to grow brain cells from infant mice and then observed what happened when these young adult brains reached adulthood; it was thought the growth of these neural stem cells would eventually shut down at some point after birth as part of normal maturation (around two years old). In this method, however, researchers could not actually observe whether or not new neurons formed because they weren't labeled with fluorescent proteins - so one might expect there simply wasn't any cell division taking place once the mouse grew up. As a result, most of those previous research papers haven't been able to be reproduced by other groups. In order for scientists to test if such processes continued into late puphood without interfering with existing development pathways via genetic manipulation, the team from Washington University School of Medicine developed a different way of growing nerve cells: embryos that didn't have a fully functional hippocampus (an area where much learning occurs) but did contain neural progenitor cells similar to ones found in adults' brains using CRISPR gene editing technologies. The embryo's developing nervous system is therefore closer resembling an adult human than ever before. ""We now know how the mammalian central nervous system evolves over time,"" says senior author Dr David Glanzman.""It doesn't happen all at once...and we can see why many earlier experiments failed to reproduce key features of later stages."" Although further work will need to take place before anyone considers attempting to reprogram our own aging bodies back towards peak mental health through technology alone, hopefully techniques like these help us better understand just exactly what goes on inside the minds of our furry friends.",opt_30b,1.606060606060606,0.5,1.5692307692307692,1.546875,1.263157894736842,0.7033092288560905,-0.025390961484133865,0.32917631631080546,0.25542605903911947,2.476190476190476,2.131249628051952,2.266610597140454,0.853215938389244,2.1604938271604937,0.8534657744227071,3.0,1.884232458930178,3.1422413793103448,1.892607344913384,0.0,0.0,2.2321428571428568,3.375658518538692,-0.49318371913664055,0.11268643431962272,2.264150943396226,2.2896178715696216,1.5294117647058827,1.7433893326372465,1.6545454545454548,0.7988548638596689,0.050000000000000044,-0.05041380923590859,0.5078125000000001,0.618230202827251,-0.3469002132987109,-0.1795497058798536,1.8749999999999998,1.764489714763742,0.769230769230769,1.051664876292711,2.2228123419322205,1.1825799865601236,1.0634920634920637,1.1083984878584057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2545454545454544,1.7272727272727273,-0.5681155828654487,0.9147755872866746,-0.06375246754800493,-1.2725514000941915,2.1120067428105447,1.9323125901681169

Now it is opening with Debenhams as its anchor store and retailers such as Marks and Spencer moving back. Newport Council lent the developers PS90m in a commercial deal to ensure the centre opened on time. Council leader Bob Bright said there had been a renaissance over the last decade and people ""underestimated Newport."" As well as 30 new shops, there will be about a dozen restaurants and an eight-screen Cineworld multiplex cinema. Welsh fashion designer Julien Macdonald opened the Debenhams store. Newport Council borrowed PS90m at a lower rate of interest and then lent it on to the developers in a ""calculated risk"" to ensure the project was built. ""Everything in life is risky but we were at an impasse when the developer was unable to raise the funds in the money markets because of the interest rates,"" said Mr Bright. ""We took the innovative step of using public money to develop Friars Walk."" ""We didn't do it blindly, we will make a profit on the financial deal of several million pounds and we have a negotiated agreement where we will participate in the profit when the centre, as I believe it will be, is sold eventually. ""It's a commercial deal with is good for Newport and it will make a profit."" The complex is estimated to create 1,200 jobs within its shops and restaurants. Queensberry Real Estate started building the development in April last year. Bob Evans, who runs the Waterloo pub and restaurant near the dock gates, said he hoped it would benefit the whole city. ""It's been really hard but Newport is up and coming now. This is good for Newport, it will bring in lots of people who currently go to Cwmbran or Cardiff to shop and bypass us.""

We will continue to consult with those affected by the change to ensure that any disruption to their schedules is kept to a minimum.""",text-davinci-003,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.328125,0.0,-0.6500295414387394,-0.9502076457330146,-0.643284285967241,-0.6250154194823172,0.7074829931972787,-0.32448764759209997,0.9325483599663582,0.025487673545689406,0.9549382716049382,0.3460966517745254,0.5,0.124071787775109,0.5172413793103448,0.8018094784462557,0.0,0.0,0.657142857142857,-0.04310022060601965,-0.3988355293887615,-0.4335339692221828,0.6103363412633305,-0.2612415760985518,0.22941176470588226,-0.18061076679007265,0.9545454545454548,1.1650445671289777,-0.3999999999999999,-0.03207660596625444,1.09375,-0.19932306890171228,-0.4966150421960493,-0.5303300858899106,-0.3374999999999999,0.7949078286399871,1.3230769230769228,0.688532238292434,0.732220536165908,0.39569234810179926,0.33015873015873015,-0.4587176778486071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545454545454545,0.0,-0.03482715202044134,0.07692218516284091,-0.34580883912402705,0.31052338631852355,0.14257295295155145,0.2381025669147881

He also suggested Labour could take inspiration from what was happening on social media and use new technologies such as chatbots to better communicate with voters.

The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would exercise congressional functions. The charge stems from alleged electoral irregularities by three opposition lawmakers in elections in 2015. The head of the OAS Luis Almagro accused President Nicolas Maduro's government of carrying out what he described as a coup against itself. Brazil's foreign ministry said the court's decision violated the country's separation of powers. Several other Latin American countries expressed concern too. Peru recalled its ambassador to Caracas, saying there had been a rupture of democracy. The United States also condemned Venezuela's government. ""This rupture of democratic and constitutional norms greatly damages Venezuela's democratic institutions,"" said a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner. Venezuela's opposition had earlier said President Maduro was becoming a dictator. Venezuela's foreign ministry accused critics of the government of forming a right-wing regional pact against President Maduro.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites now sell fake exam papers, for example from the Edexcel International Exams board or Pearson Education Ltd, which include questions replicated from last year's paper. Some of these sites have been selling them already this summer term, when students will be sitting the new GCSE music exam, called Exam Board (Edex) AMEB Music Exam A2, as well as other subjects such as English language, science, maths, geography and religious studies (RSP). A spokeswoman said: ""If you think it is easy to find perfect questions that can be copied without being noticed then guess again because we know they exist on our site. We work closely with the teachers who run the schools where our materials are used. They give us feedback about what types of questions they need. If any concerns arise relating to use of our material online then all users must take responsibility themselves - so if someone buys one question but fails to follow instructions we cannot provide support free of charge. It could put their grades at risk. Schools also remind us that plagiarism of another student's mark sheet is a criminal offence and not acceptable. In addition many universities require copying of full sets of past papers before allowing entry so there is real concern. This issue needs urgent attention. Educators should turn over every stone within their schoolrooms to prevent anything like this occurring."" The government has warned schools against including plagiarised content in its syllabuses following claims that some pupils had paid an internet company 5 per set of answers to copy and paste onto their own sheets. Tim Oakes, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: ""It would obviously undermine key stages of assessment across the curriculum. There is a huge amount of pressure placed on children today through homework, coursework etc - they don't necessarily have time to do things properly. So yes I think it [the practice] is really worrying."" However, he added: Exam boards] want to make sure they're dealing with genuine cases of individual misbehaviour. But really this group needs to do better than engaging in irresponsible behaviour. It undermines the integrity of their assessments.""

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A Hong Kong tycoon is suing the salesman that convinced him to use a supercomputer to handle his trading, a decision which cost him more than 20 million. It is alleged that he used too much memory and ended up with an unusable machine The computer was given access to every share on Mr He's three-thousand strong portfolio of ""hedge funds, private equity... and others"" as well as all of the clients' cash positions in various currencies - over 50 billion. The data was stored using custom software by ICL, a company which claims it can do exactly what its name suggests: computers but without the cables or wires. Nevertheless, they were unable to produce records for any trades done after November 2015, when their system crashed. Mr He took the very expensive step of hiring half a dozen extra staff to process manually each trade individually because he suspected something had gone wrong with the automated system. But nothing came out until late last year, at which point he realised that he might have lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks due to inadequate backup procedures. He filed suit against financier Nicholas Tang (right), who sold him the S2X Supercomputer in 2012 according to Bloomberg (left). This enabled him to execute multiple order types simultaneously and monitor them continuously throughout the day It has emerged that this isn't just a one off problem; people are losing money left right and centre due to poor management processes and lack of back ups. Over 60 of brokerage firms lose client assets on average per month as if they fail to observe even basic safety precautions such as backups. You may be thinking why would anyone want such a thing? After all, there's already so many brokers available for you to choose from! Well, think again: not only does having your own personal arsenal make you feel safer, it also makes life easier for yourself through automation and therefore reduces costs overall. To put things into perspective, Amazon charges roughly 0.10 per transaction while Coinbase takes around 7, which means paying both services around 77month to execute 100 transactions. Then add another 12 months to pay someone else to manage those shares, plus two accounts minimum fees, the total comes out costing 132 - almost twice as much per month compared to doing it all yourself. In other words, removing manual processes will save you time, avoid mistakes, reduce costs and ultimately make your investment activities less stressful. There are four different ways to automate your investments, meaning you don't need to give up control entirely: 1) Automate everything 2) Isolate certain functions 3) Use artificial intelligence 4) Outsource completely. We cover these in detail below beginning with first option number 1: automate absolutely (and then go onto subsequent options). Automation Step One: Data Backup Storage Managing your personal finances is often portrayed as a difficult task... actually taking some responsibility away from you is hard work, yet virtually everyone still manages somehow anyway. Whether it be spending hours poring over spreadsheets, talking to advisers about complex strategies, or attempting to educate themselves on a variety of financial matters - it seems we never stop learning new stuff. Even while reading this article you must be going 'but how come none of my friendsfamily know anything about finance??' So let's explore financial literacy in terms of how humans store information. As far as most people understand the concept, storing info somewhere safe is incredibly important. If you forget where or am unsure whether the content was backed up correctly, it could mean serious trouble should unforeseen circumstances arise later on down the line. Luckily, modern technology allows us to create perfect copies known as snapshots or images. Snapshots aren't quite identical to the original file, however, they are extremely close thanks to utilising state-of-the-art algorithms that compress files within milliseconds. These days, simply downloading an image file to our desktop is enough to ensure no harm befalls our documents during a power cut. Conversely, older methods involved uploading thousands upon thousands of individual bits called bytes and keeping track of byte shifts and changes to ensure the integrity of said document. Unfortunately, this method became obsolete along with floppy disks, microchips and paper folders. Nowadays, flash drives and SSD require little maintenance despite holding large amounts of data. Of course, depending on your budget, a good quality laptop can still perform amazing feats like video editing, though admittedly that kind of operation requires high bandwidth and highly efficient processing capabilities. How to Back Up Your Portfolio Using Images Today Snapshotting enables us to write small chunks of binary code to external storage devices instead of pushing thousands and thousands of bytes of random numbers and letters towards USB ports. Alternatively, if you prefer the old school way, leave it to professionals and ask a friend or family member to restore your data via FTP, emailing, copying or whatever method works best for them. However, before you get started long term investing, remember that the easiest solution involves portable imaging tests show bunch test paroxyssee realtime datalighted to test switches are set to an ""true lookie provide",gpt_j,5.681818181818182,5.0,5.461538461538462,5.5,5.315789473684211,0.5615009357008962,0.27648787833548866,0.584878316255735,0.5386733444458357,0.47424684159378006,0.6479357779693581,0.3922624053826745,0.7860848534011902,0.3845679012345681,0.7828930523412885,0.7857142857142856,0.8879142562769154,2.0600985221674875,1.8054836446742382,0.05714285714285714,0.2321153829895989,0.546938775510204,0.9941718387907184,-0.6818800986323986,-0.3196407135667484,0.8859721082854797,0.8316924474112338,0.07647058823529419,0.671304749062926,-0.44545454545454544,0.43086451921537217,0.34285714285714297,1.1581060850134117,-0.37946428571428564,0.6679528818819337,0.18779560419178334,0.6394422624491906,0.1767857142857143,0.7121804910472745,0.9010989010989009,0.6178949425199535,0.5977310499313534,0.3831491848885938,0.4571428571428575,0.611074942901907,0.0,0.0,0.08571428571428572,0.4997958767010258,6.381818181818182,4.909090909090909,-0.5055057527258902,1.710821900164525,-0.11148508427625485,-0.6562470432092158,0.6861388358924203,0.6657228038763875

Police found evidence, including CCTV footage, that'suggested Mr Wright was assaulted and potentially tortured' in his cell between 10pm on 26 December and 4am 27th', prosecutor Andrew Jackson said today Mr Johnson told jurors: 'The prosecution say this is an egregious case.' He added: 'Mr Wright died whilst he was being unlawfully detained by G4S staff who showed deliberate indifference to him as they left him lying unresponsive in their care over almost two hours before even attempting to seek assistance or summoning medical help. We will prove beyond reasonable doubt what happened during those crucial 45 minutes when there remained every opportunity to save Mr Wright's life after he was first observed by correctional officers slumped forward against some bars inside his cell. As I have already stated we are alleging these events led directly to Mr Wright's death without any intervention whatsoever until it became clear he was no longer breathing.' The inquest heard police launched Operation Sceptre into how he died following concerns raised about the adequacy of procedures in place across prisons run by private firms such as Serco (file photo) A jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing against prison officer Lee Deighton, 46, of Orpington, Kent; suspended custody manager Stephen Cribbins, 47, also of Orpington; healthcare assistant Joanne Hayes, 44, of Dartford, Kent; and support service worker Matthew Hanratty, 25, of Beckenham, south east London. They all denied manslaughter but were convicted yesterday. Lindon Coombes, 23, of Bromley Common, Greenwich, south east London, admitted assisting prisoners to escape. He has yet to be sentenced. All five defendants appeared in court via video link from HMP Bronzefield where they remain remanded ahead of sentencing next month. Sentencing would normally take place within six weeks of conviction - meaning the men could face years behind bars under current guidelines. However, Judge Jeremy Donne QC indicated proceedings may not conclude then because victim statements must still be read out by lawyers representing each family member.
