"When animations in CSS conflict, only one of them will occur. The Web Animations API allows developers to mix up animation behavior using the composite option. This article discusses how to use the composite property to create complex animations with the Web Animations API. The composite property in the Web Animations API allows you to control how multiple animations should interact with each other. By default, only the animation with the highest z-index will play. But with the composite property, you can create complex animations that blend together and produce unique visual effects. There are several values for the composite property: - replace (default): This value replaces any animations currently playing with the new animation. - add: This value adds the new animation to any animations currently playing, creating a cumulative effect. - accumulate: This value accumulates values from all animations currently playing and applies them to the new animation. This creates a more complex animation, as each animation affects the others. To use the composite property, you need to create multiple animations and specify their composite value. Here's an example: "" 'javascript const element document.querySelector .box; const animation1 element.animate transform: 'rotate (0deg) ' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'add' ; const animation2 element.animate transform: 'translateX (100px) ' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'add' ; const animation3 element.animate transform: 'scale (2) ' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'add' ; "" ' In this example, we create three different animations for the same element. The composite property is set to 'add' for each animation, which means they will blend together to create a cumulative effect. You can also use the composite property to create complex animations that react to user input or events. Here's an example of an animation that changes color based on a user's click: "" 'javascript const element document.querySelector .box; Initial animation element.animate backgroundColor: 'red' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'replace' ; Click animation element.addEventListener click', { element.animate backgroundColor: 'blue' }, { duration: 1000, composite: 'accumulate' ; ; "" ' In this example, we create an initial animation that sets the element's background color to red. When the user clicks on the element, a new animation is created that changes the background color to blue. The composite value is set to 'accumulate', which means the animation blends with the existing animation to create a more complex effect. Overall, the Web Animations API's composite property allows developers to create complex and dynamic animations that react to user input and events. Using this property, you can create unique visual effects that would be difficult to achieve with CSS alone.",0,19

"Scientists were able to use light and bio-ink to print a human ear-like structure under the skin of mice without a single surgical cut. Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that allows for the precise and controlled placement of biological materials layer by layer. Bio-ink, which usually consists of living cells and a support matrix, can be printed in complex shapes and structures that can eventually develop into functional tissues and organs. In the case of the mouse ear-like structure, the scientists used a bioprinter to create a mold of the ear shape, which was then filled with a hydrogel-based bio-ink containing cartilage cells. The mold and bio-ink were then exposed to light, which activated a chemical reaction that cross-linked the molecules in the bio-ink, making it solidify into a solid structure. The mold was removed, and the resulting structure was implanted under the skin of a mouse where it continued to grow and develop into a shape resembling a human ear. This technique has significant potential to revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine, allowing for the creation of replacement tissues and organs that can be tailored to the specific needs of individual patients. It also has the potential to reduce the need for invasive surgical procedures, offering a less painful and more effective treatment option for many medical conditions.",0,103

"CSS linear gradients get washed out and muddy in the middle unless steps are taken to avoid the effect. This article teaches developers how to avoid the gray dead zone that can occur in linear gradients. One approach to avoid the gray dead zone in linear gradients is to use color stops. Color stops allow developers to define specific colors at specific points along the gradient, ensuring that the gradient maintains its vibrancy and depth throughout. For example, instead of defining a gradient with just two colors: "" ' background: linear-gradient (red, blue); "" ' You can add color stops in between to ensure a smoother transition: "" ' background: linear-gradient (red, yellow, blue); "" ' Another approach is to use radial gradients instead of linear gradients, which tend to avoid the gray dead zone issue altogether. When using linear gradients, it's also important to pay attention to the direction and angle of the gradient. By default, linear gradients go from top to bottom, but you can adjust the direction by changing the angle or using keywords like ""to left"" or ""to right."" Lastly, experimenting with different color combinations and opacities can also help to avoid the gray dead zone in linear gradients. By incorporating more contrasting colors, or using a more subtle gradient, you can create a more visually appealing effect.",0,140

"Physicists predict that information can be transmitted across two black holes paired via quantum entanglement. If the theory is correct, it might offer clues on how to unite quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two pillars of modern physics, into a single framework known as quantum gravity. This would represent a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe, as it could help us explain phenomena at both the largest and smallest scales. The idea behind transmitting information through entangled black holes is that, by manipulating one of the black holes, we could affect the other one instantaneously, regardless of the distance that separates them. This violates the laws of classical physics, but is allowed by quantum mechanics, which allows for particles to be linked in a way that goes beyond our everyday experience of the world. If scientists can demonstrate that information can indeed be transmitted in this way, it would provide strong evidence for the existence of quantum gravity, which remains a theoretical concept that has yet to be proven experimentally.

"Uber and Lyft must classify their drivers as employees unless their emergency appeal to block the ruling is successful. The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers as employees as opposed to independent contractors. This would mean that drivers would be entitled to employment benefits such as minimum wage, overtime pay, sick leave, and unemployment insurance. It is a major change for the ride-hailing industry, which has long relied on the independent contractor model. Many drivers and labor advocates have argued that the current classification leaves drivers without basic protections and benefits, while the companies have argued that it would fundamentally change their business model and lead to higher prices for riders. The companies have launched an appeal, but if they are unsuccessful, they will have to reclassify their drivers in California, where the ruling was made, and could potentially face similar legal challenges in other states.",0,358
"Singapore currently produces about 10 percent of its food. Due to climate change and population growth, it aims to produce 30 percent of its food by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, the Singaporean government has implemented several initiatives to boost local food production. Some of these initiatives include: 1. Vertical farming: Singapore is promoting the use of vertical farming to maximise the use of limited land resources. Vertical farms take up less space while yielding more crops per unit of land compared to traditional farming methods. 2. Rooftop farming: Rooftop farming is a new trend that is gaining popularity in cities around the world, and Singapore is no exception. Rooftop farms are built on top of buildings, using previously unused space to grow crops. 3. Indoor farming: With the use of hydroponics and LED lighting, indoor farming can grow crops year-round, regardless of weather conditions, and with significantly less water than traditional farming methods. 4. Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture (the farming of fish) and hydroponics (growing plants in water). The waste produced by fish is used to fertilise plants, while the plants help to clean the water for the fish. This method requires less water than traditional farming methods. 5. Education and support: The government is also putting in efforts to educate and support individuals and organisations who want to participate in local food production.

"CSS was never designed to be a server-side language, but that doesn't mean that it can't be used as one. This article walks through how to use CSS as a server-side language using tools like Sass and Node.js. Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS to include variables, functions, and nested rules. It can be used to write more organized and efficient CSS code, and it can also be compiled server-side using tools like Node.js. Here's how to use Sass and Node.js to compile CSS server-side: 1. Install Sass: You can install Sass globally using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal: "" ' npm install -g sass "" ' 2. Create a Sass file: Create a .scss file with your Sass code. For this example, let's create a file called ""styles.scss"" with the following code: "" ' primary-color: 3498db; body { background-color: primary-color; } "" ' This file defines a variable called ""primary-color"" and sets the background color of the body element to that variable. 3. Compile Sass to CSS: Run the following command in your terminal to compile the ""styles.scss"" file to a regular CSS file called ""styles.css"": "" ' sass styles.scss styles.css "" ' This command will create a new file called ""styles.css"" with the compiled CSS code. 4. Use the compiled CSS: You can link to the compiled CSS file in your HTML just like any other CSS file: "" ' link rel""stylesheet"" href""styles.css"" "" ' By running the Sass compiler server-side using Node.js, you can automate the process of compiling Sass to CSS and serve the compiled CSS to your clients. This can be helpful for large-scale web projects where managing CSS files can become difficult.",0,419

"Everyone is talking about Kubernetes! Apps running in these workloads probably have the concept of users. And where you have users, you have auth. We'll cover topics like service-to-service communication, authentication and authorization in Kubernetes, commonly known as Kubernetes auth. In Kubernetes, service-to-service communication happens quite frequently. When a microservice calls another microservice, it's important that the calling microservice is authorized to access the other microservice's resources. This is where Kubernetes auth comes into play. Kubernetes auth is implemented using the Kubernetes API server, which is the main control plane of the system. There are several ways to authenticate in Kubernetes, including: - Certificates: Service accounts can be used to grant access to Kubernetes resources using X.509 certificates. Kubernetes uses client certificates to authenticate service accounts. - Tokens: Tokens can be used to authenticate users or service accounts. Tokens are generally self-contained and can encode information such as user ID, group memberships, and expiration time. - OpenID Connect (OIDC): This is an open standard that defines how authentication information is exchanged. Kubernetes can be configured to use OIDC for authentication. Once a user or service account is authenticated, Kubernetes uses authorization policies to determine which resources the user or service account has access to. Kubernetes authorization can be controlled using several mechanisms: - Role-based access control (RBAC): RBAC defines roles and their permissions. You can create and assign roles to users or groups of users. - Attribute-based access control (ABAC): ABAC defines policies based on attributes like user, group, and IP address. - Node authorization: Kubernetes can be configured to authorize nodes based on properties like node name or labels. In summary, Kubernetes auth is a critical part of securing your Kubernetes cluster. By using Kubernetes auth, you can ensure that only authorized users and services can access your resources.",0,539

"Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling sequential data such as text. RNNs work by passing information along a chain of neurons, where each neuron receives input from the previous neuron and outputs to the next neuron. This allows the network to maintain a ""memory"" of the previous inputs and the order in which they were presented. One significant advantage of RNNs is their ability to handle varying length input sequences, making them suitable for tasks such as text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and many others. However, a common issue with RNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur when the gradients become too small, making it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies. To overcome this issue, various modifications to the basic RNN architecture have been developed, such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which have proven to be effective in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem while maintaining the benefits of RNNs.",0,578

"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with PredPol for a number of years. The software analyzes data such as crime reports, weather, and local events to produce a ""heat map"" of the areas in a city where crime is most likely to occur. Police officers can then use this information to target their patrols and increase their presence in high-risk areas. While some police departments have reported success with PredPol in reducing crime rates, others have raised concerns about the potential for the software to perpetuate bias and lead to over-policing of certain communities. Critics argue that the algorithm reinforces the targeting of certain neighborhoods based on past crime data, which may not accurately reflect current conditions or individual behavior.

"Learn how OAuth is actually used in the real world. We cover topics like the eight common OAuth modes, how to use the Authorization Code grant, and why you should consider using OAuth for your application's authentication and authorization needs. OAuth (Open Authorization) is a widely used protocol that allows applications to authenticate and authorize users to access their resources on third-party services (e.g. social media platforms, SaaS applications, etc.) without the need for the users to reveal their username and password to the application. OAuth works through a series of steps and modes, with different modes suited for different use cases. Here are the eight common OAuth modes and scenarios for their usage: 1. Authorization Code Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a user's resources on a third-party service. The user is redirected to the third-party service and asked to authorize access to their data. Once authorized, the third-party service redirects the user back to your application with an authorization code that your application can exchange for an access token. 2. Client Credentials Grant: This mode is used when your application is acting on its own behalf and requires access to a user's resources on a third-party service. Your application authenticates with the third-party service using its own credentials and receives an access token in return. 3. Implicit Grant: This mode is used for public clients (applications that run on the user's device) when your application needs to access a user's resources on a third-party service. Unlike the Authorization Code grant, the access token is obtained directly from the third-party service, bypassing the need for an authorization code. 4. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a user's resources on a third-party service and the user is willing to share their username and password with your application. The user's credentials are exchanged for an access token. 5. Device Authorization Grant: This mode is used for devices with limited input capabilities (e.g., smart TVs) that require user interaction to authorize access to third-party services. The user is provided with a device code that they enter on a web page or another device, and the access token is obtained once the user grants authorization. 6. Refresh Token Grant: This mode is used when an access token expires or becomes invalid, and your application needs to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthorize your application. 7. JWT Bearer Token Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a protected resource using a JSON Web Token instead of an access token. 8. SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Grant: This mode is used when your application needs to access a protected resource using a SAML 2.0 assertion instead of an access token. The Authorization Code grant, also known as the three-legged OAuth or web flow, is the most commonly used mode of OAuth in the industry. It is preferred over other modes because it offers better security and user experience. With the Authorization Code grant, your application never sees the user's credentials and instead receives an access token that it can use to access the user's resources on the third-party service. OAuth is a popular choice for authentication and authorization because it offers several benefits over traditional approaches, such as: - Increased security: OAuth enables secure, centralized authorization for multiple applications and services, reducing the risk of breaches or unauthorized access. - Improved user experience: Users can authorize access to their data without disclosing their credentials to third-party applications, enhancing privacy and trust. - Easier integration: OAuth provides a standard way to authenticate and authorize access to third-party services, reducing the need for custom integrations and making it simpler to add new services to your application. Overall, OAuth is a powerful tool for implementing robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication and authorization models in your applications.",0,631

"Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond is a highly valuable material that has many applications in various industries, such as electronics, jewelry, medicine, and more. This new discovery could potentially offer a sustainable way to create diamonds without the need for mining or environmentally harmful practices. The substance that the researchers used to create diamonds is called ""buckyballs,"" which are small, spherical carbon molecules that are found in petroleum. They placed the buckyballs in a diamond anvil cell, which is a device that can apply immense pressure to materials. They then heated the buckyballs with a laser to a temperature of 2,200 to 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. Under these extreme conditions, the buckyballs transformed into a type of diamond called ""lonsdaleite,"" which is only found naturally in meteorites. The lonsdaleite diamonds created in the experiment had a hardness that approached that of natural diamonds. While this discovery is still in the experimental phase, it has the potential to provide a more sustainable and ethical way to create diamonds.

"This article tells the story of how a startup was almost acquired by Facebook. It details how the company was founded, how it raised its initial investments, its growth, its dealings with Facebook, and ultimately how the acquisition fell through. The startup in question is a social networking platform called ""Social Loop."" Founded in 2015, the platform allowed users to create and join interest-based groups, connect with likeminded people, and share content. Initially, the founders funded the company themselves and built the platform from scratch. However, they soon realized that they needed outside investment to take the company to the next level. In 2016, the founders managed to secure a seed investment of 500,000 from a group of angel investors. This funding allowed them to hire a team of developers and marketers and begin scaling the platform. Over the next two years, Social Loop grew rapidly, with thousands of users joining every month. The company also raised a further 3 million in venture capital funding in 2018, which helped accelerate its growth. Around this time, Social Loop caught the attention of Facebook. The social media giant was interested in the platform's unique approach to social networking, and saw potential in integrating some of its features into Facebook's own products. After a few months of discussions, Facebook made an offer to acquire Social Loop for 50 million. Initially, the founders were thrilled at the prospect of joining forces with Facebook. They saw the acquisition as a validation of their hard work, and a chance to take the platform to new heights. However, as the negotiations went on, they began to have second thoughts. For one thing, they were concerned about the impact of the acquisition on Social Loop's existing user base. Many of these users had joined the platform precisely because it wasn't owned by Facebook, and they were wary of the social media giant's privacy practices. The founders worried that if Social Loop became part of Facebook, these users would abandon the platform in droves. Another issue was the founders' vision for the future of the platform. They had big plans for Social Loop, including expanding into new markets and developing new features. However, they were unsure whether these plans would be given the priority they deserved within Facebook's vast organization. Ultimately, the founders decided to turn down Facebook's offer. Although it was a difficult decision, they felt that it was the best one for the long-term health of the company. They continued to develop Social Loop, and eventually sold it to another buyer for 70 million, more than Facebook's offer. The story of Social Loop is a cautionary tale for any startup that is approached by a larger company for acquisition. While it can be tempting to take the money and run, it's important to carefully consider the long-term impact of such a deal on the company's vision, values, and user base.",0,743
