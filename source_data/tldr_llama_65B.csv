"Open source code has been essential for China's rapidly growing tech sector. GitHub has been a large part of this growth, but its future in China is uncertain. Many fear that Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub may have repercussions for GitHub's open-source projects in China. Software developers in China fear that the acquisition of GitHub, the world's biggest open-source platform, by Microsoft could affect their access to the software development platform. GitHub is an online platform where software developers can collaborate on a project. It is home to about 28 million users and more than 85 million repositories of code. While GitHub is not the only online repository for open-source code, it is the largest and has been particularly popular in China. The uncertainty surrounding GitHub's future in China stems from Microsoft's past. In 2013, Microsoft was one of a number of companies that signed an agreement with China's Cyberspace Administration of China, which prohibited Microsoft from including any software or code in its Windows operating system that threatened national security. The Chinese government is also concerned about the use of GitHub to share open-source code that violates China's cybersecurity laws. In January, for example, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ordered all Windows users to delete any potentially illegal code on GitHub. GitHub's position in China is also complicated by the fact that the country is increasingly turning to open-source software to fuel its growing tech sector, which is reliant on the free software. China has been using open-source code and contributing to the open-source community, and that will only grow. Open-source software has been a key part of China's tech sector. For example, Huawei uses open-source software for its smartphones. China has also been working to develop its own open-source software through its own home-grown operating system, which is still in development.",0,2

"Many dog breeds are about appearance, but plenty of others are devoted to specific tasks. A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog behaviors and personalities and found that these traits are genetically linked to the size and shape of their bodies. Dogs are known to have distinct personalities. Some are reserved and fearful, while others are outgoing and curious. These personality traits can be measured by trained observers, with the help of various tests. The study found a link between physical and behavioral traits in dogs. The team found that personality and appearance traits in dogs are linked to each other. For example, breeds like Siberian Huskies and Shetland Sheepdogs, which are known to be highly energetic and aggressive, are also usually highly motivated, independent, and persistent in their actions. The dogs were also divided into three personality groups. The researchers also divided the 18,000 dogs into three personality groups: fearful, aggressive, and socially bold. These groups were further linked to certain body shapes and sizes. For example, breeds like the Whippet and the Greyhound, which are known for their speed, are also less likely to be fearful than other dog breeds. They are also more likely to be aggressive or socially bold. The study found that brachycephalic breeds like Pugs are more aggressive and less fearful than most. Brachycephalic dogs are those with shortened skulls and muzzles, like Pugs, Bulldogs, and Pekingese. The results of the study give us a better understanding of the physical and behavioral traits of dogs. The researchers hope that the findings can also help dog breeders in creating new breeds that are well-suited to certain jobs and tasks. This study can also help us understand more about how physical and behavioral traits have evolved in dogs. Dogs that are aggressive or fearful are also more likely to be responsive to training. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Bristol, and the University of Oxford. Do you agree with the results of this study?

"SpaceX has posted a job for a'Resort Development Manager' to be based out of Brownsville, a town near its Boca Chica test and development site. The company is looking to build a hotel for its team, and also potentially a luxury retreat for guests. Elon Musk has said that he's hoping to start launching test flights of its Starship prototype in the next two to three months. Those launches will be conducted at SpaceX's Boca Chica test and development site, which is located near the town of Brownsville, Texas. But before that happens, SpaceX is apparently going to need somewhere to house its team. To that end, it's posted a job opening for a Resort Development Manager to be based out of Brownsville. The job ad says the manager will be responsible for managing the development of a SpaceX ""luxury resort"" for the company's guests. It'll also entail managing a hotel for SpaceX's own employees. The company's goal, according to the ad, is ""to develop and run a world class resort, hotel, and retreat for SpaceX employees and their families on the Texas coast."" SpaceX's Boca Chica facility is located on the Gulf of Mexico, and its proximity to the SpaceX team's headquarters in Hawthorne, California has also raised speculation that the company could be planning to build a ""launch-and-land"" facility there. Such a facility would enable SpaceX to launch its Starship rocket and land it on the Gulf of Mexico, similar to how it's currently landing Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets on both coasts. We'll see how the job posting for a resort manager plays out, but it's a little peculiar, to say the least. The 75-acre SpaceX Boca Chica test and development facility is a separate site from SpaceX's Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center launch sites. While SpaceX currently launches Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from both coasts, it'll be launching Starship and Super Heavy from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX has said that it's going to begin conducting test launches of its Starship prototype in the next few months. The company is developing the Starship to carry cargo and passengers to orbit, and eventually, to Mars. The first test launch will be conducted at SpaceX's Boca Chica test and development site. The company is reportedly building a dedicated launch pad there, and has already been testing its Raptor engines there, too. SpaceX has said that it's going to begin conducting test launches of its Starship prototype in the next few months. Elon Musk has said that he wants to conduct the first Starship test launches in the next two to three months, and then build a launch-and-land facility at Boca Chica. He's said that the Starship prototype will first fly to an altitude of 65,000 feet, and then work up to orbit. SpaceX's goal is to begin launching satellites with Starship and Super Heavy in 2021, and then send the first passengers on a lunar flyby mission in 2023. Musk has said that the company could launch its first crewed mission to Mars as soon as 2024, and if everything goes well, that would be followed by a cargo flight to Mars in 2022. SpaceX's Boca Chica test and development site will be home to the company's test launches of Starship, but it's unclear whether or not it'll become a full-fledged launch site. The company is reportedly building a launch pad at the site, but it's unclear whether or not SpaceX will be able to launch Starship into orbit from there. SpaceX's permit for the site only allows launches up to an altitude of 16,400 feet, and it's unclear if the company will need to extend that.",0,7
"A Bay Area-based startup called Perfect Day has created a lab-grown ice cream that uses whey protein from genetically modified yeast. While there are plenty of dairy-free ice cream alternatives on the market, this is the first one that contains the same protein as real dairy ice cream. A spokesperson for the company said in an email to Quartz that they are ""trying to create a product that tastes better than dairy, not just a good dairy alternative."" The company claims that because its ice cream is made with yeast, it's more sustainable than traditional dairy ice cream. Perfect Day's lab-grown ice cream won't be available to the public until 2019, but the company has a partnership with San Francisco-based ice cream brand Salt Straw, which plans to release a limited-edition version of the lab-grown ice cream in early 2018. This isn't the first time the startup has made headlines. In 2014, the company successfully raised more than 200,000 on Indiegogo for its dairy-free milk product.

"Uniqlo cut 90 of the workforce in one of its Tokyo warehouses, and replaced them with robots. Now the warehouse operates 24 hours a day. Robots are able to unload trucks, package, and perform other warehouse operations. A robot is capable of handling 200 garments at a time. Robotics have always been considered an important part of automation, and replacing workers with robots is not new in the world of automation. More importantly, the robot can perform its tasks more effectively. For example, one of the robots at the Uniqlo warehouse is able to sort 20,000 items per day. The technological progress makes us wonder how it will affect the future of labor. The newest trend is not only automation, but a shift to using robots to perform jobs that were once the exclusive domain of humans. For now, human workers are able to work in collaboration with robots in many workplaces. However, the trend is that the number of jobs robots can do is increasing. However, some economists are still optimistic about the future of the labor force. They say that the new technologies and automation will create more jobs, rather than destroy them. Even though robots are capable of performing human tasks better and faster, the cost of the robots and the installation is not the same as paying workers to perform the same tasks.",0,13
"Democratic candidate Andrew Yang plans to use a 3D hologram in his campaign for the presidency. The use of technology will highlight his message that times have changed and that we need new ways of thinking. Hologram USA Networks Inc. will work with the Yang campaign to create the hologram. It will appear at select campaign stops around the country. Yang's campaign says he will be the first presidential candidate to campaign via a hologram. In a recent interview, Yang discussed why he is using a hologram. ""We need to modernize our democracy. And it's only fitting that the campaign that is talking about the future more than any other is the one that is also bringing the future to politics."" Yang believes the hologram will help him reach voters that he could not otherwise reach. He added, ""This is the first time a presidential candidate has campaigned using a hologram. It is my hope that it will make our campaign more human, and enable me to appear in multiple places simultaneously."" Television and film actor Jeff Bridges has been using hologram technology for the past five years. He has used it to play a version of himself on talk shows. Bridges is also the subject of a hologram game. In it, a digital version of the actor gives players music lessons. The Yang campaign also announced plans to use virtual reality technology. It will provide voters with a look at what Yang calls a ""Freedom Dividend."" It is Yang's proposal to pay every American over the age of 18 a monthly 1,000 to deal with job loss caused by artificial intelligence. The Yang campaign said, ""Voters can literally see what it looks like to spend their Freedom Dividend, as well as see the effect it would have on their neighborhoods."" Yang's ideas about the economy have brought new interest to his campaign. He has appeared on late night comedy shows, including The Joe Rogan Experience. He has also appeared on the popular television show The Daily Show. But not everyone is happy with Yang's use of technology. The Yang campaign is already facing criticism that the use of a hologram is a sign that Yang is not a serious candidate. Howard Wolfson is a political adviser. He said Yang is looking for new ways to get people interested in his campaign. ""It is one more way to be creative and try and get a little attention."" Wolfson added, ""It's a big, complicated country, and you've got to find different ways to break through, and this is just one way to do it."" Yang is not the first to use hologram technology in politics. Former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the first. He appeared as a hologram at political meetings in 2004. In 2012, Indian politician Narendra Modi used the technology to appear before more than 50 political meetings across the country. Yang has been able to raise money to help his campaign.

"The Mission Extension Vehicle-2 (MEV-2) recently latched onto an old communications satellite while in orbit. The mission is Northrop Grumman's second successful docking of an object in space. MEV-2 launched in October and has a mission to extend the life of satellites in geosynchronous orbit, where they can take decades to deorbit naturally. The spacecraft uses a combination of fuel and electric propulsion to change orbits and move satellites around. The vehicle can also push decommissioned spacecraft into a graveyard orbit, where they can no longer be a threat to other objects. The company sees the MEV-2 as a way to save money for satellite operators. ""This demonstration validates our ability to perform the first of two primary missions for the MEV system: extending satellite life,"" said Northrop Grumman CEO Tom Vice in a statement. ""It also showcases our ability to rapidly innovate and develop new products, and to reduce costs for customers in ways that would have been impossible through traditional approaches."" The MEV-2 docked with a 17-year-old satellite that launched in 2001. The satellite is owned by an undisclosed company. Northrop Grumman has not provided any details about the mission. The company's first MEV, named MEV-1, docked with a different satellite in 2018. The first MEV will leave the satellite in March and continue its mission. Northrop Grumman is already planning its next MEV, which will be used to extend the life of a satellite owned by Intelsat.

"When animations in CSS conflict, only one of them will occur. The Web Animations API allows developers to mix up animation behavior using the composite option. This article discusses how and when to use the composite option, and it explains what the different composite options mean. How Do You Use the Web Animations API? The easiest way to use the Web Animations API is to use the web-animations-js polyfill. This means you can use the Web Animations API in most browsers. The keyframes rule is where we define our keyframe animations. We'll see in a moment how the keyframes rule is referenced from within the animation rule. The animation rule is what triggers the animation on the element and dictates how the animation behaves. In the example above, the animation starts immediately, which is specified by animation-delay: 0s. The animation will play once, then loop forever, which is specified by animation-iteration-count: infinite. Now, the animation-name property is used to reference a keyframe animation. It is specified as a list of keyframe animations, each separated by a comma. The animation in the example above uses the keyframe animation defined by the ""bounce"" keyframes rule. The animation-duration property is how long the animation lasts. The animation in the example above lasts one second, which is specified by animation-duration: 1s. The animation-fill-mode property dictates how the animation fills the time between the end of the animation and when the next instance of the animation starts. The example above fills this time with a hold, which is specified by animation-fill-mode: forwards. The animation-timing-function property specifies how the animation behaves over time. It is used to add easing effects, which makes the animation appear to accelerate and decelerate. The example above uses a cubic bezier curve, which is specified by animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier (.32, .65, .24, .95). The animation-play-state property dictates whether the animation is running. The example above starts the animation running immediately, which is specified by animation-play-state: running. The animation-delay property specifies when the animation will start. The example above starts the animation immediately, which is specified by animation-delay: 0s. The animation-direction property dictates whether the animation plays forward, backward, or in reverse. The example above plays the animation forward, which is specified by animation-direction: normal. The animation-iteration-count property dictates how many times the animation should play. The example above specifies that the animation should play once, then loop forever, which is specified by animation-iteration-count: infinite. In the example above, we have two animations that each use the ""bounce"" keyframes rule. The first animation starts at 0s and lasts for 1s, while the second animation starts at 0.5s and lasts for 0.5s. When these animations are placed together in the same animation sequence, only one of them will be performed. The animation-delay property specifies when the animation will start. The example above starts the animation immediately, which is specified by animation-delay: 0s. This is the default value for the animation-delay property, so it isn't necessary to include this value. The animation-fill-mode property dictates how the animation fills the time between the end of the animation and when the next instance of the animation starts. The example above fills this time with a hold, which is specified by animation-fill-mode: forwards. This is the default value for the animation-fill-mode property, so it isn't necessary to include this value. The animation-timing-function property specifies how the animation behaves over time. It is used to add easing effects, which makes the animation appear to accelerate and decelerate. The example above uses a cubic bezier curve, which is specified by animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier (.32, .65, .24, .95).

"A bug in Tesla's Autopilot driving program would sometimes pull cars towards lane dividers in specific spots on a Reddit user's commute. Despite reporting the issue to Tesla many times, he says the bug persisted for over a year. The bug would tell the car to make a left turn when it was already in the leftmost lane, but sometimes the car would go to the right when it was supposed to go left. Tesla says the problem was caused by a faulty camera and was fixed in June 2017. In the case of the Reddit user's car, the bug remained even after Tesla updated the software. Tesla says it ""not aware of any instance"" of the bug in its cars. The problem was a faulty camera that was replaced by Tesla in June 2017, but it had no effect on the Reddit user's car. A Tesla representative told Business Insider that the company wasn't aware of any other instances of the problem. The Reddit user, who goes by the handle ""ugarsh,"" said he's spoken to many Tesla employees over the last year, and none of them had seen the issue before. Tesla says that its cameras don't identify lane markings as one or two lines, but rather, as three lines. ""A lane with a dotted line on one side and a solid line on the other is recognized as a single left-bound lane, and a lane with a solid line on both sides is seen as a single right-bound lane,"" the representative said. If there's a bug in the software that makes the car think it's in the rightmost lane instead of the leftmost lane, the car will try to get to the left, even though it's already in the leftmost lane. The bug persisted for many months, and Tesla was unable to fix it. ""For reasons unknown to me, Tesla's Autopilot (AP) software has a bug that causes the car to behave very strangely in a very specific location on my daily commute. AP will detect a lane divider which is actually the exit lane on a highway off ramp. After the car departs the highway, it will try to veer to the left, even though the car is already in the left lane."" The Reddit user said that he initially believed the bug was a problem with the car's GPS, but found out it was an issue with the software. ""I've brought this to Tesla's attention many times over the last year, but they've never been able to fix it. They've inspected the car several times. They've had me demo the issue to service personnel, engineers, and managers. They've tried changing the firmware. They've tried upgrading the AP hardware. They've tried disabling AP in the location. They've tried changing the lane detection sensors, and they've replaced the AP computer twice,"" the Reddit user wrote. ""I even insisted on trying to demo the problem on one of the loaner cars. I finally gave up after they swapped my car for a loaner while my car was in for service and the same issue persisted in the loaner car."" It's not clear why the car has this problem, and the Reddit user doesn't know of any other Tesla drivers who have experienced the issue. Tesla says that all of its Autopilot-equipped cars have the same hardware, but it's not clear if the software is updated at different times. The bug persisted even after Tesla updated the software. It's not clear why Tesla didn't find the bug sooner. Tesla's Autopilot system has been in use since 2015, and the software has been updated multiple times over the years. Tesla has collected more than 1.3 billion miles worth of data from Autopilot since its launch, so it's surprising the company didn't come across the problem sooner. Tesla has been pushing for full self-driving features to roll out to its cars before the end of the year. The company has even said that some cars it built since October 2016 have the hardware necessary for full autonomy, but Tesla says it's waiting for regulatory approval before rolling out those features. Tesla did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on this story. SEE ALSO: Tesla says it's going to try",0,20

"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised. But, the results of a new study might influence the government to reconsider this limit, especially if it means it could help women conceive. The study was conducted by scientists from the Francis Crick Institute in London and was published in the journal Nature. The researchers were able to keep human embryos alive in the lab for up to 13 days, by using a new technique that involved feeding them. They took embryos that were a few days old and placed them in a specialized dish filled with a nutritious liquid that helped them develop. Using this technique, they were able to keep the embryos alive for up to 13 days, which is a huge jump from the previous record of nine days. This study provides a ton of new information about how embryos grow and how different parts develop. The researchers were able to discover that the cells that make up the placenta and the embryo itself are distinct before the two-week mark, which is something that was not previously known. This discovery could help scientists better understand what goes wrong in the development of embryos when women suffer from infertility or pregnancy loss. The researchers are hopeful that their findings could help scientists develop new fertility treatments that could help women who are struggling to conceive. The study might also have implications for stem cell research. Scientists can use stem cells to make other types of cells and tissues, which could help to treat a variety of medical conditions. However, at the moment stem cells can only be derived from embryos that are less than 14 days old, which limits their availability. But, the researchers from the Francis Crick Institute believe that by using their new technique, they can grow embryos in the lab for longer than 14 days without it having an impact on the embryos or the people that they could potentially become. This could be a great way for scientists to create more stem cells for use in the lab.",0,22

"Amazon has recently come under fire as it was discovered that it previously allowed vendors the ability to bid for an Amazon's Choice badge by lowering prices and spending more money on advertising. The company said, ""We are always improving the Amazon's Choice program, including adding or removing products to ensure customers have a great shopping experience."" Amazon's Choice badges are added to products based on the site's algorithm and take into consideration customer reviews, price, availability and more. On the other hand, it was also found out that Amazon's Choice badges are sometimes awarded to unproven products that have only just been launched and that haven't undergone any reviews or ratings yet. When CNET asked about the criteria to be an Amazon Choice product, Amazon responded with a vague statement saying that it was ""surprised and disappointed to learn of CNET's experience."" The latest revelations by CNET are not the first time Amazon has been accused of allowing vendors to buy their way into the Amazon Choice program. However, the algorithm used to determine which products get the badge isn't clear. Amazon has been accused of allowing merchants to pay their way to get the badge, in return for lower prices and advertising, but Amazon denied those claims. The issue first came to light when CNET discovered that the Amazon's Choice designation on a product page doesn't necessarily mean that the item is recommended by the e-commerce giant. ""The investigation found that Amazon placed its Choice label on some items that lacked positive reviews or low prices,"" the report said. ""I have contacted Amazon and asked them to review the program and make changes,"" said Markey. In an email, Amazon said that the badge is created to help customers ""easily select highly-rated, well-priced products available to ship immediately."" The company said its Choice badge algorithm considers several factors, including customer reviews, price and whether the product is in stock. Amazon added that the products are ""priced low andor are a great value."" ""Amazon should immediately suspend its Choice program until an independent audit is complete and consumers are assured that the information provided is not compromised,"" he added.",0,25

"Apple announced new developer tools at WWDC this week, including Object Capture, Xcode Cloud, in-app events and custom pages, and updates to Swift. Object Capture allows developers to create 3D models from real-world objects using only the iPhone's camera, and Apple's new ARKit 3.0 will allow the export of these models to be used in augmented reality. This will also allow for creations in augmented reality to be shared on a wider scale. Xcode Cloud can be used to write code on a Mac, but can then be accessed from any other Mac or iOS device. It will work with both Objective-C and Swift, and will even work offline. In-app events allow developers to track user actions and reactions in their apps, and custom pages give them the opportunity to create a homepage for their app on the App Store. SwiftUI is a new programming language for the Swift 5 release, which allows for faster development of user interfaces. Apple's goal with SwiftUI is to allow for customization of UI without having to rebuild the entire app. It will also be easier to translate apps into different languages with new localization tools, and will allow for automatic translation to be done on the user's device.

This is a search engine that crawls the web and surfaces results in a similar way to Google, but with a focus on visual content. And it's not just a search engine, it's also a browser. So, the next time you perform a search, you'll be able to click through to a page, but also browse other results without leaving the Yep interface. According to Ahrefs, Yep is ""unlike anything"" on the web. The search engine is built for content consumption, rather than information finding. And that's where the focus on visual content comes in. Yep is unique in the sense that it provides ""endless browsing"" from within its own search engine. As you browse through content, you can use the left-hand sidebar to navigate between different sources (e.g., Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) or refine your search. Ahrefs says it's still early days and that it expects to add more features over time, including suggestions, smart search history, and personalized content. Of course, it's too early to tell if Yep is going to take off, but Ahrefs is certainly putting its money where its mouth is.

"Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has resigned from the company as of August 22. Shares rose 17 percent after the news was released, finishing up at 8.3 percent at the end of the day. Byrne recently revealed that he was a government informant. Byrne has been with the company since he founded it in 1999. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has resigned. Byrne stepped down ""in the interests of the company and shareholders,"" according to a company statement. Byrne, who has been with the company since he founded it in 1999, told The Wall Street Journal that he was asked to leave by the board. Shares rose 17 percent after the news was released, finishing up 8.3 percent at the end of the day. In a statement, Byrne said that he'd ""helped to carry out important work for the good of the country, and I did what I believed was necessary for the greater good."" Byrne made headlines in August when he told The Wall Street Journal that he was a government informant during the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He said that he had been in a relationship with a Russian national, Maria Butina, who was convicted in April of attempting to influence U.S. politics. Byrne alleged that the FBI had directed him to act as a liaison between the agency and Butina. Byrne also said that he had been in contact with law enforcement since 2015 and met with the FBI and Department of Justice about his investigation into alleged corruption. Byrne has long claimed that the Clintons were involved in ""a racketeering scheme."" In an interview with Fox News, Byrne said that he was ""not proud"" of his relationship with Butina. Byrne said that his relationship with Butina began as an ""affair"" but later became ""something less."" ""I think I made some mistakes with her,"" Byrne said. On August 12, Byrne announced that he would be taking a leave of absence in order to focus on his ongoing legal issues. The executive said that his resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company's operations, policies or practices. ""In closing, while I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock, both as CEO and board member, effective Thursday, August 22,"" Byrne said in a statement. Byrne has long been a controversial figure in the cryptocurrency space. In 2014, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Byrne has long been a proponent of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. In 2014, he founded Medici Ventures, a subsidiary of Overstock that invests in blockchain startups. The company has invested in a number of companies including Ripio, a blockchain-powered remittance service, and Chainstone Labs, which provides risk management solutions to crypto traders. Byrne will be replaced by Jonathan Johnson, who will be acting CEO while the board searches for a replacement. Johnson had been serving as the company's president of retail.

"Facebook and Snopes had been in talks to work together to create a fact-checking program for the Facebook platform, but Snopes has decided to cancel the partnership. The team decided that it was more trouble than it was worth. Facebook is under pressure to keep the news feed free of misinformation and fake news stories. The social network has been working with third-party fact-checkers, such as Snopes, to help determine what is and is not a fake news story. Facebook has said that it wants to create a ""healthier news ecosystem,"" which means that it will be working with third-party fact-checkers in order to flag false news. The plan is that Facebook will be able to label articles that it deems to be false news. The articles that are deemed fake will be flagged as such on the site and will appear less in the news feed. Snopes was one of the fact-checking partners that Facebook had been working with, but the site has decided that it is not worth the trouble. The issue is that Snopes will not be able to flag an article as false on Facebook, even if it is, because it would violate the terms of service. Snopes announced that it is ""evaluating the ramifications and costs of providing third-party fact-checking services to large platforms like Facebook."" The company went on to say that ""fact-checking should be fully transparent, and the platforms should be transparent about that, too.""

"Amazon revealed its latest delivery drone design at the re:MARS conference. The drone is about the size of a go-cart, can fly up to 15 miles, and deliver packages up to five pounds. This delivery drone is Amazon's latest prototype for deliveries of five pounds or less. It's also one of the first to show Amazon's latest thinking on the design of its drones, including better obstacle avoidance, new sensors, and a new ""sense-and-avoid"" module. The new drone is about the size of a go-cart, and can fly up to 15 miles, according to Scout, the company's new delivery drone initiative. It's part of a larger effort to build a new drone-based delivery service, similar to the one Amazon revealed in 2013, but which has run into regulatory hurdles along the way. Now Amazon wants to show the world it is still working on that dream. On Wednesday, the company unveiled the latest iteration of its delivery drones at the re:MARS conference in Las Vegas. The drone is one of several new prototypes the company has developed in the last few years, and the newest version of the company's drone is sleeker and faster than previous designs. It also has a number of new sensors, including cameras on the front and the bottom, as well as a new module that combines data from the sensors to detect obstacles and avoid them. But perhaps most importantly, the new drone is part of a larger effort to build a new drone-based delivery service, similar to the one Amazon revealed in 2013, but which has run into regulatory hurdles along the way. Now Amazon wants to show the world it is still working on that dream. ""The new design includes advances in efficiency, stability, and, most importantly, in safety,"" said Scout VP Sean Cassidy in a statement. ""Safety is our top priority and it drives our thinking when it comes to the airspace integration of our vehicles."" The company showed off several new drones at the conference, including a new version of the company's Prime Air vehicle. But the focus of the event was on the company's new Scout drone and the new delivery service it is building to use the drones. Amazon's Scout drones can fly up to 15 miles at a time, and have a capacity to carry packages weighing up to five pounds. The company has been developing drones for a number of years, and recently revealed its latest drone design. Amazon unveiled the new drones at the re:MARS conference, which is the company's first machine learning, automation, robotics, and space conference. The drones were unveiled by Scout VP Sean Cassidy. The new drone is sleeker and faster than previous designs. It also has a number of new sensors, including cameras on the front and the bottom, as well as a new module that combines data from the sensors to detect obstacles and avoid them. Here's the new sense-and-avoid module. The drone is able to detect both moving and stationary objects. The new drones are able to operate autonomously, but they still have to be ""launched"" by human operators. Amazon said it has been working with the FAA to ensure that its drones meet the latest safety requirements. Here's an example of a delivery from the drone, carrying a package to a waiting car. The company said it has been developing the drone in several locations, including in its indoor research and development lab in Seattle. Here's a close-up of the drone. Here's a look at the drone from the side, showing off its different sensors. Here's the company's latest design for its Prime Air delivery drone. The company has said it wants to use the drones to deliver packages that weigh five pounds or less to customers' homes in less than 30 minutes. The new drone is part of a larger effort to build a new drone-based delivery service, similar to the one Amazon revealed in 2013, but which has run into regulatory hurdles along the way.

"Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the cofounders of Instagram, have resigned and plan to leave the company. No reason is given in the article, but it is noted that Jan Koum, the cofounder of WhatsApp, left Facebook in May amid reports of disagreements with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over privacy issues. Instagram and WhatsApp are both Facebook subsidiaries, acquired in 2012 and 2014, respectively, and both Krieger and Systrom were active in Zuckerberg's inner circle at Facebook. The departure of these two founders is important because they were the last of the original founders of Instagram. The other two, Robert S. ""Boz"" Bosworth and Josh Riedel, left in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram for 1 billion. It is important to realize that when Facebook acquired Instagram, it didn't buy a company, it bought a team. The acquisition was made just a few weeks after the launch of the Instagram app. It had not yet reached a million users, but Facebook, which had been pursuing a competitive app, saw the potential and the talent and made the offer. Now, it seems, those who remain of that team are gone. It will be interesting to see who takes the reins and how well the brand does under new leadership.

In fact, about 15 of Americans do not have a smartphone. The Pew Research Center reports that the breakdown is along familiar lines, with younger and more affluent Americans being more likely to have a smartphone. However, as smartphones become less expensive, even low-income Americans will have them. Google and others have been addressing this issue for some time. One of the features of Google's Go app is that it can use offline AI to help translate what you want to say into a foreign language. There is also a version of Google Maps for the web, so you can get directions even if you don't have a map app on your phone. How do you reach people who don't have smartphones? If you have an online business, you need to reach people who are online, and that means using the Web and mobile apps. If you have a brick-and-mortar business, you need to reach people who are online, because they are looking for you there, even if they don't have a smartphone. And you also need to reach people who are not online, because they don't know you are there. The good news is that your customers are moving online, and if you aren't there, they may find your competitors and do business with them.

Most businesses are not aware of how much fraud is taking place online, and most aren't aware of how easy it is to be hacked. You need to be aware of what is going on and take steps to prevent your website from being hacked. I've been a business owner for over 25 years. I've had employees steal from me. I've been sued for a million dollars. I've had a client go bankrupt and owe me tens of thousands of dollars. And I've had my website hacked. When my website was hacked, it was not fun, but it was not nearly as devastating as any of those other things. I had to change my passwords, and we had to clean up some of the mess, but it didn't cost us any money. However, not all hacking is that innocuous. Some hacking can cost you a lot of money. If your website has an e-commerce function, someone can intercept a credit card number and use it. Both WordPress and SquareSpace have built-in features that will help prevent hacking. One of the things you can do is change the password on your website on a regular basis. Use a password generator that will create a complex password that includes numbers, symbols, and upper and lowercase letters. I use and recommend the WordPress plugin WordFence.

"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate the behavior of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. They have been fabricated with various designs that give them interesting properties, such as the ability to be invisible to microwave radiation, or to focus terahertz radiation. In a paper published in Nano Letters, scientists have developed a design for a metasurface that is capable of a much more sophisticated manipulation of light than previously reported metasurfaces. The new design, developed by scientists at the University of California, San Diego and at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is a sheet of silicon that contains an array of tiny pillars, each of which is a different height. When light hits the metasurface, it encounters the pillars. Depending on the height of the pillars, the light can be reflected or transmitted through. ""This is the first metasurface capable of manipulating the phase, amplitude, polarization and direction of light at the same time and in a reversible way,"" said Boubacar Kante, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. The ability to manipulate light's direction is particularly important. The researchers have calculated that the metasurface could be used to create so-called vector beams, which have controllable shapes. These beams can be used to manipulate particles as small as atoms. ""You can imagine a flat lens made of this metasurface that can be programmed to create vector beams that have different shapes, like a vortex or spherical beam,"" said Alexandra Boltasseva, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. ""This type of flat lens will be extremely useful for applications where a regular lens cannot be used, like in the human body. It will also be useful in optoelectronic devices that use polarized light, such as solar cells and sensors."" The researchers still have to figure out how to fabricate the new metasurface. Kante says that the pillars need to be about 100 nanometers in diameter and spaced about 100 nanometers apart in order to work.",0,42
"Software developers have discovered references to a new Apple operating system, realityOS, in App Store upload logs and GitHub repositories. Apple has been known to be working on a mixed reality system, with the ARKit already available in iOS 11 and iOS 12. Apple's augmented reality system is called ARKit, and it's been available on iOS devices since the launch of iOS 11 last year. ARKit is the software development kit that allows developers to create augmented reality experiences. iOS 12, released earlier this month, brought with it the second generation of ARKit, and Apple has been continuously refining the ARKit with additional features. This is done by using motion tracking data from the gyroscope and camera, and is able to place digital objects in real-world environments. These objects are then able to react to the changing environment. The iPad has the largest screen of any iOS device, which makes it the perfect platform for augmented reality experiences. A larger screen means more room for virtual objects, and Apple has been pushing for AR experiences on the iPad ever since the launch of iOS 11. Though Apple is yet to announce a dedicated headset, many are expecting the launch of a new Apple headset, running a special version of iOS for virtual and augmented reality experiences. The ARKit has already been used to develop a range of AR experiences. For example, ARKit has been used to create a Harry Potter game, and many other experiences. However, in order to deliver a truly immersive AR experience, a headset is needed, and that's where the Apple headset comes in. Details about the headset are not yet known, but if Apple is to launch an AR headset, it will likely be running some variant of iOS, which is why developers are now speculating that Apple is preparing a special version of iOS, called realityOS, for the new headset. As mentioned, references to realityOS have been found in App Store upload logs, and in code for Apple's Xcode. This code has revealed that Apple is using Xcode to work on realityOS, and is integrating it with the existing iOS. Another interesting aspect is that Apple has already been hiring developers for its AR and virtual reality teams, with Apple hiring some developers from Lytro, and also engineers from Leap Motion. Apple is not new to the virtual and augmented reality space, and has filed various patents and has made acquisitions to boost its presence in the AR market. Apple's interest in AR and VR extends beyond the iPad, and the company has also been rumored to be working on an AR headset, possibly called Apple Glasses. Apple is yet to make any announcements regarding its AR headset, but it could be announced next month at the Apple event. Apple is set to unveil a new line of iPhones, along with a new MacBook, and a new Apple Watch. The headset might not be ready yet, but some rumors have indicated that it could be unveiled next month. There are not many details about the headset available, but the iPhone maker has been hiring new employees with expertise in the augmented and virtual reality market. This has included some big names, such as the founder of HoloLens, Avi Bar-Zeev, who left Microsoft in January to join Apple. Apple has also filed a number of patents for VR and AR devices. One of the more interesting patents was filed last year, and it detailed a new headset with displays for each eye, and a number of outward facing cameras, that would capture the world around you. The images captured by the outward facing cameras would be displayed on the headset's displays, with virtual objects being overlaid on top of these images. A similar patent was filed by Apple earlier this year, in which the company detailed a number of different ways in which the headset could be used, including for gaming, as well as watching movies. Apple is yet to announce any AR headset, but it's not the only company looking to release a virtual reality or augmented reality headset. Facebook has been working on its own virtual reality headset, called Oculus Go, while Samsung and Google are also working on virtual and augmented reality headsets. It's been rumored that Apple's headset could be released as early as 2020, but it's likely that the headset will require a new version of iOS, which is where realityOS will come in. A realityOS could be Apple's way of competing with Android in the VR and AR market.",0,43

"StyleGAN2 is a style-based GAN architecture for data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. It improves on image quality, and it also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is real or generated. StyleGAN2 is a powerful, large-scale generative model of images. To make it possible to produce high quality samples, it has a large latent space that contains the relevant image variation information. Unlike StyleGAN1, which produced images of a single style, StyleGAN2 generates samples from a normal distribution over the latent space, which lets it produce images with multiple styles. The StyleGAN2 architecture can be divided into three parts: the generator, the discriminator, and the style encoder. The generator is a mapping network that maps the latent code Z to a generated image. The style encoder is a mapping network that maps the generated image to a style code. The discriminator maps the real and generated images to the probability that they are real. Each component has a few different architectural modifications to improve the quality of the generated samples. The generator uses a single mapping network to generate the image. The mapping network uses a multi-scale architecture to handle the image variation across different spatial scales. The generator and discriminator both use a windowed discrimination mechanism to reduce the computational cost. Each image is processed in non-overlapping windows, and the discriminator is only allowed to use information from the current window. The discriminator has a novel multi-scale architecture that uses a set of progressively smaller networks. The smaller networks make it possible to compute deeper architectures, which improves the discriminator's performance. The discriminator uses a novel sub-pixel discrimination mechanism that can use information from sub-pixel regions of the image. The sub-pixel discrimination mechanism lets the discriminator use information from small objects and thin structures in the image. The generator uses a style encoder to extract style information from the generated image. The style encoder is then used to compute an objective function that can be used to train the generator using the style encoder loss. The style encoder loss allows the StyleGAN2 architecture to produce high quality samples with a relatively small dataset. The style encoder loss also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is real or generated. StyleGAN2 uses a set of small networks to perform the sub-pixel discrimination. Each small network uses a set of kernels that are repeated in a grid pattern to allow it to extract information from sub-pixel regions of the image. The style encoder loss is a style-based loss that is used to train the generator. It is based on the latent code, Z, and the style code, C. The style code is the output of the style encoder that maps the image to a style code. The style code is used as an input to the generator. This means that the generator can produce images of different styles. The style encoder loss is used to compute an objective function that can be minimized using gradient descent. The generator architecture is a mapping network that maps a latent code Z to a generated image. The mapping network uses a multi-scale architecture to handle image variation across different spatial scales. Each network in the multi-scale architecture uses a progressive upsampling mechanism. This mechanism is used to upsample the input image to the desired size. The image is upsampled by a factor of two with a set of upsampled convolutions. Each upsampled convolution is followed by a regular convolution. The windowed discrimination mechanism divides the image into non-overlapping windows, and only allows the discriminator to use information from the current window. This reduces the computational cost, and it makes it possible to use a deeper architecture. The discriminator architecture is a multi-scale architecture that uses a set of progressively smaller networks to extract image variation information across different spatial scales. Each network in the multi-scale architecture uses a progressive downsampling mechanism to downsample the input image. The image is downsampled by a factor of two with a set of downsampled convolutions. Each downsampled convolution is followed by a regular convolution. The sub-pixel discrimination mechanism uses a set of small networks to extract information from sub-pixel regions of the image. Each small network is constructed using a set of kernels that are repeated in a grid pattern. The kernels are repeated in a grid pattern because the image is downsampled by a factor of two between each network in the multi-scale architecture. The number of times the kernels are repeated is equal to the number of times the image is downsampled. The size of",0,45
"Virgin appears to have changed its mind on how it plans to build its Hyperloop since its tests at the end of last year. The company recently released new designs, which it claims will be able to transport people and cargo at speeds of 620mph (1,000kmh) by 2020. The original design for the Hyperloop involved a test track which would see the pods travel through low-pressure tubes on a track, using electromagnetic force and air expulsion to move them forward. The new design seems to have ditched that for a more realistic concept which involves a fully enclosed, elevated, vacuum-sealed tube, which is supported by columns. The pods will be able to carry passengers or cargo, and will travel at a top speed of 620mph (1,000kmh) - as previously mentioned. The pods will be able to switch lanes thanks to a 'switch' system that allows the pods to travel at high speeds in both directions. The pods will be able to travel between LA and SF in just 30 minutes, which is a pretty impressive achievement. Virgin is hoping to build the world's first Hyperloop between LA and SF, with work on the test track set to begin later this year in Nevada. The original Hyperloop design was produced by Elon Musk and SpaceX, but since the company has its own mission to Mars, it hasn't been able to build a working prototype for the Hyperloop. That's where Virgin comes in, and it's hoping to have a working Hyperloop by 2020. The US isn't the only place we'll be seeing Hyperloops though. Dubai has revealed its plans to build a Hyperloop between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

"An egg fossil was discovered in Antarctica in 2011. It was 11 inches long and 7 inches wide. Researchers have determined that the egg came from a massive aquatic reptile, similar to a Plesiosaur, that lived 65-70 million years ago. The Plesiosaur was a large, carnivorous marine reptile. It was about 30-40 feet long and had a long neck and 4 flippers. It was not a dinosaur. The fact that the fossil was found in Antarctica is interesting. The region, which is now a polar desert, was much warmer 65-70 million years ago. Back then, it was located over the South Pole in an area called Gondwana. The warmer weather allowed dinosaurs to live in the area. The fossilized egg was found in the snow, which is ironic because it is now a polar desert. It is amazing that it was able to survive the 70 million years and be found. The egg was discovered by a Chinese scientist named Liu Yi, who was a graduate student at the time. He was looking for fossils in a river valley in the Transantarctic Mountains. The egg was the first intact dinosaur egg ever found in the Antarctic. Mr. Yi found the egg at the site of a 10,000-year-old penguin rookery. It is believed that the penguins were able to survive in the area because the climate has cooled over the years. How long have scientists been studying dinosaur eggs? How many eggs were found in the 1923 discovery? How many eggs have been found in the 1980s? What was special about the 1986 discovery? What is the difference between an egg and a fossil? Why did the 2009 discovery have scientists excited? Why is it surprising that the fossil was found in Antarctica? How did the egg survive 70 million years? Why do you think the climate of Antarctica has changed over the years?",0,47
"Uber has launched a new option that allows passengers to communicate their preferences to drivers before they are picked up. Uber Comfort costs around 20 to 40 percent more than Uber X, but it comes with a few extra amenities. Instead of hailing a car in the normal way through the Uber app, Comfort will give riders the option to choose between a newer mid-size car, like a Toyota Prius, a newer full-size car, like a Toyota Camry, or an extra-large car, like a Chevrolet Suburban. Passengers are guaranteed at least six inches of legroom in the backseat, and they can request a preferred temperature for the car, as well as whether or not they prefer talking to the driver or not. Comfort users will also be guaranteed that their driver will not use the phone while driving, will not make more than two stops along the way, and will not ask riders to sit in the front.

This is a guide to using Fleet for the first time, without getting into details of the configuration. For a more complete guide, see the configuration guide. Note that the option given to target is the build target you would give to rustc. For instance, to build for aarch64 on Ubuntu 18.04, you would use targetarm-linux-androideabi. Fleet has no configuration file. It instead relies on the environment to set options. There is a set of default settings that Fleet will use if you do not provide the information in the environment. These settings are located in the README in this repository. The values of these environment variables are used to populate the configuration file that fleet will use. If you need to set an option that isn't covered by an environment variable, you can set it in your configuration file. Note that you do not need to set any of these environment variables if you are happy with the defaults. Fleet caches builds internally using the cache directory, as well as caching dependencies in Cargo.lock. The default cache directory is .fleet. If you would like to use a custom directory, set the CACHEDIR environment variable. Fleet provides an environment variable, CACHEPACKAGEID, that can be used to make sure the latest version of a package is used. When a package is first downloaded, fleet will calculate a fingerprint of the package. This fingerprint is used to determine if a package has changed. If a package has changed, fleet will rebuild it. If you have a package that you want to make sure is always rebuilt, you can set the CACHEPACKAGEID environment variable to be a random value. This will cause fleet to rebuild the package, no matter what. By default, fleet uses no parallelization. If you would like to enable parallelization, you can set the number of parallel jobs with the CONCURRENCY environment variable. The values of the environment variables listed here are used to populate the configuration file that fleet will use. If you need to set an option that isn't covered by an environment variable, you can set it in your configuration file. Fleet can be used with cargo.toml as well. To use fleet with cargo.toml, simply point fleet at the cargo.toml. On macOS, there is an option to use the clang LTO compiler. This can provide performance improvements and a reduction in build time. To enable this feature, set the CC environment variable to be clang.",0,57
"The boom in food delivery apps in China has flooded the country with takeout containers, utensils, and bags. Most of the plastic is thrown away rather than recycled. While the government has banned the import of plastic waste and tightened rules on the use of plastic bags, critics say it has not done enough to improve recycling. Some restaurants are taking steps to reduce the amount of packaging they use. For example, hotpot chain Haidilao says it uses 100 percent biodegradable packaging. Delivery companies are also offering incentives to customers who use fewer takeout boxes.",0,58
"Gene Levoff, the previous senior director of law and corporate security at Apple until September last year, has been charged with securities fraud and is set to appear in court on August 29. The charge was filed in Manhattan federal court on August 13, according to a report by Bloomberg. The former Apple executive is accused of insider trading, specifically of passing on material, nonpublic information to a friend. He was in charge of Apple's insider trading program. According to the Bloomberg report, Levoff passed on information about the company's earnings ahead of the release of the information. The report also states that Levoff and his friend made more than 382,000 on the illegal stock transactions. Levoff has been an Apple employee for over 10 years and was responsible for Apple's corporate law and securities compliance programs. He left Apple in September 2018 for personal reasons, according to a statement from Apple at the time.",0,59
"A Chinese court has granted Qualcomm an injunction against Apple in a patent infringement case. The patents affect all devices sold with iOS 11 or earlier, so all iPhones from the iPhone 6S onwards. The news of the injunction was reported by CNBC, which says that the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court had ruled that Apple infringed on two patents held by Qualcomm. Qualcomm confirmed the news. According to Qualcomm, the court granted two injunctions against four subsidiaries of Apple, as well as ordering Apple to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of all infringing iPhones in China. It says that Apple violated the two patents by ""using these technologies in the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X."" Apple has confirmed to CNBC that all iPhones remain available for sale in China. This is because Qualcomm's case targets older devices with iOS 11 or earlier, not iOS 12, which is on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR. This is the latest legal dispute between the two companies. Apple and Qualcomm have been embroiled in a patent dispute since January 2017 when Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm claiming the company charged unfair royalties for its technology. Qualcomm countersued and the battle has been raging ever since. In July, Qualcomm asked for a Chinese ban on the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Qualcomm said in its suit that these models infringe on two patents, one for resizing photos and one for managing apps using a touchscreen. The dispute between the companies has been heating up of late, with Qualcomm filing patent suits against Apple in China and Germany. Apple claims that Qualcomm has been unfair in its licensing practices, whereas Qualcomm has said that it is asking only for a ""fair and reasonable"" amount of money. It's unclear how the injunction in China will affect Apple. While it will be interesting to see if Apple sales will be affected in the country, Qualcomm will be eager to get a similar ban on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR, which were released after the injunction was granted. However, it might not be that easy, as Apple has confirmed that all iPhones remain available for sale in China. Via CNBC, TechCrunch",0,60

"Facebook's Deepfake Detection Challenge is an open competition to find algorithms that can spot AI-manipulated videos. This year's winning algorithm could spot real-world examples of deep fakes with an average 99 accuracy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a great tool, but it can be used for more than just good. AI can be used to generate convincing fake images and videos, often called deep fakes, to mislead and manipulate. And with the upcoming US presidential election, the possibility of fake videos being used to influence voters is a real threat. Thankfully, Facebook is investing heavily in tools to detect such fakes. The social media company has partnered with Amazon, Microsoft, and academics from Cornell Tech, MIT, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, University of Maryland, College Park, and University at Albany-SUNY to launch a Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC). It's an open competition to find algorithms that can spot AI-manipulated videos. The competition is split into three tracks: the Pre-Processing track, the Detection track, and the Detection and Localization track. The Pre-Processing track is an optional track and it's all about improving the quality of deep fakes to make them easier to analyze. The top three algorithms from this track were awarded 5,000 each. The Detection track is the main event, and it's all about identifying the fakes. Submissions to this track were evaluated against a benchmarked dataset containing 19,000 videos. The winning algorithm achieved a 99.3 accuracy rate. Finally, the Detection and Localization track required an algorithm that not only spots a fake, but also identifies where within the video it was edited. The winning algorithm achieved an average 98.9 accuracy. The winning algorithm for each track wins 50,000, with second and third place algorithms winning 25,000 and 15,000 respectively. The winning teams are: Pre-Processing Track: Yi Xu, Wei-Lun Chao, and Kaiyuan Yang from University of Central Florida Detection Track: Michael Zollhofer, Marc Stamminger, Mario Fritz, Max Nordhoff, Matthias Niener, and Christian Theobalt from Technische Universitat Berlin Detection and Localization Track: David Bernhard, Matthias Baur, and Dangxiao Xie from Technische Universitat Munchen All the code for the winning algorithms is now open source and freely available for anyone to study. Facebook will also make the data used in the challenge available for research purposes, so more algorithms can be trained on it.",0,63
"Physicists from the US have found that when graphene is assembled into a double-layer stack, the proximity produces quantum states that have never been observed before. These states are an example of topological physics, a new field that studies exotic phenomena in which quantum states are protected from external perturbations. Placing graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is known to induce a band gap, creating a band-insulator system. However, this band gap can be controlled by applying a small electric field, which allows the system to behave as a semiconductor, as well as providing a way to tune the properties of the quantum states. ""The fact that you can tune the band gap and the interlayer coupling strength provides a level of control that's very unusual,"" says Pablo Jarillo-Herrero of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""It allows us to design the system to have the properties that we want."" In the latest work, the team has found that when the layers are rotated by a 'magic' angle of 1.1 degrees, the graphene's electrons move in a way that has never been seen before in other materials. For instance, when an electron is added to the structure, it does not settle in a distinct quantum state, but is evenly distributed in a set of closely spaced levels. The energy levels are so close that they are said to be 'conical', and the behaviour is called a conical dispersion. The conical dispersion is a consequence of the unusual symmetries of the crystal lattice. ""There is a hidden order in this material,"" says Jarillo-Herrero. ""You can get it if you look at the electrons in a different way, but it is a very different way of understanding how electrons behave in a material."" The team was surprised to find that the quantum states are robust against small changes in the angle or electric field. ""We found that even if you apply an electric field, which is a very strong perturbation, the states persist,"" says Jarillo-Herrero. ""These are very stable states that are very protected. It's a new kind of order for electrons in a material."" The conical dispersion is expected to have the potential for enhanced electronic properties. For example, if electrons can be made to flow around the material's edge, they would be immune from scattering by defects and other perturbations. ""These are very fundamental discoveries about the nature of low-dimensional systems,"" says Jarillo-Herrero. ""We're uncovering the inner workings of the electrons in these materials to understand what the properties are and how we can manipulate them."" The team's work was published in Nature Physics and will be presented this week at the 2D Materials and Applications (2DMA) conference in Strasbourg, France.",0,64

"A new Tesla Semi truck prototype has been spotted in Truckee, CA. The engineering has been completed on the truck and some production models are scheduled for late 2021. There are no cameras on this prototype, just a plain white truck with the Tesla logo on the side. The image was posted on Twitter by Erich Eisenach. Image from Erich Eisenach on Twitter Elon Musk has said that the Semi is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. It will be equipped with Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot feature. This includes the following capabilities: Enhanced Autopilot is designed as an incremental step towards full self-driving capability. The system leverages the eight surround cameras and forward-facing radar and ultrasonic sensors, enabling the car to steer itself, change lanes, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway when approaching the destination, self-park when near a parking spot and summon the car to and from your garage. The electric Semi is said to be able to travel up to 500 miles on a single charge. It is expected to be quite cost-effective, as it will require much less maintenance and fuel. It can also be charged much faster than diesel trucks. Tesla is facing stiff competition from other electric trucks from other manufacturers. It will also have to complete testing of the Semi, which will require time and money. According to Tesla, the Semi has the following capabilities: 500 miles of range at highway speed, with 80,000 lbs of cargo Fully-charged in 30 minutes Zero to 60 mph in five seconds, compared to 15 seconds in a diesel truck Motor powered by four independent motors No gears and a fraction of the moving parts of a diesel truck Regenerative braking recovers 98 of kinetic energy to the battery Tesla Semi has a lower drag coefficient than a Bugatti Chiron.

The students can interact with the teachers and other students to clear their doubts and queries. E-learning is based on the concept of distance education. The distance education is a new concept that has changed the face of education. The distance education is the provision of education to the learners, which are separated by distance and time. In distance education, a student does not have to be physically present in a classroom or campus to study. This is a new and unique concept of education. The distance education uses the latest means of communication technology like the internet to deliver the learning material to the students. It has removed the barrier of distance and time. It is based on the concept of open and distance learning. The E-learning is a complete system of education. The computer is the base of this system. The various components of this system are the software, hardware, media and the internet. The software is the complete set of computer programs that are used to create, store and retrieve the learning material. It is responsible for the interaction between the learner and the learning material. The hardware includes all the input and output devices like the computer, printer, scanner etc. that are required to create and present the learning material. The media is the collection of material like video, graphics, animations, audio etc. that is required to create the learning material. The internet is the medium that is used to deliver the learning material to the learner. The internet has removed the barrier of distance and time in the learning process. The students can easily download the material from the internet. The students can study the material at his own place and time. This saves the time and money of the students. The students can interact with the teachers and other students to clear their doubts and queries. The e-learning can be used to create the material for the remote areas.

"It is easy to burn out employees as you learn how to manage groups of people. This article contains advice for managers of small teams and startups on how to manage your workforce effectively. Startups are new and exciting. The culture is still taking shape, and it's easy to get caught up in the energy and enthusiasm of the moment. While we're all dreaming of getting to the next level, most of the work and stress is on the backs of the employees. If you're not careful, you can burn out your team or even a single employee. But how do you avoid burnout without taking the fun out of the job? That's what I'm going to show you in this post. Think about a time when you were having fun at work. It could have been that company picnic, or even just a Friday afternoon brainstorming session. Now think about what made that situation so fun. Was it the people you were with? The setting? The opportunity to get some fresh air? All of these things can help to create a more positive work environment, which helps keep employees satisfied. The key to avoiding burnout is to help your employees enjoy the job. When employees like their job, they're more likely to stick around. And when employees stick around, they're more likely to produce good work. This is why some of the best managers focus on building positive work environments. Keeping your employees happy isn't difficult. When you learn how to manage your workforce, you'll want to implement these five strategies. Taking breaks from work is essential to avoiding burnout. It's easy to get caught up in the moment, especially when you have a looming deadline. But constantly working without breaks will only cause employees to lose their motivation. Even the most determined employees can't work nonstop. They need to take breaks and recharge. It's up to you to make sure they do. Start by scheduling regular breaks. You can have everyone take a break at the same time or stagger the breaks throughout the day. Make sure your employees know when they should be taking their breaks. If you have employees who work from home, you can remind them to take breaks by using a video conferencing system. When you schedule regular breaks, you give your employees time to recharge. They'll be able to stay focused and motivated when they return to their desk. If you're too busy to take a break, you can use that time to go for a short walk. You can also encourage your employees to take a break from work with the right technology. Employee monitoring software allows you to monitor your employees' activity. With this software, you can see what they're doing on their computer. You can also limit their Internet access to avoid wasting time. Use this software to make sure your employees are taking breaks from their computer. You should also be taking breaks from your computer. One of the best ways to do this is to meet with your employees face-to-face. Working in an office together means that you have the opportunity to communicate face-to-face. In fact, you should be meeting with your employees in-person on a regular basis. This will help you avoid burnout as a manager. It will also help your employees avoid burnout, as well. You'll be able to discuss tasks and ideas in a more effective manner when you communicate face-to-face. This will also help your employees feel more connected to you and the business. Encourage your employees to meet with each other, as well. This will help to improve their communication skills and work ethic. If you work with employees from home, you should schedule video conferencing meetings instead. This is the most effective way to communicate when your employees work from home. It also allows you to limit the use of email. As a manager, you can use email to send out important information and updates. But emails aren't the best way to communicate. They can get lost in the shuffle, and they don't allow for questions. That's why you should be limiting the use of email in the workplace. It can help to prevent burnout. Instead of sending an email, walk over to your employee's desk and have a conversation. Tell them about the new project you're working on. Ask them if they have any questions. You'll be able to get a better response when you communicate in-person. You can also use video conferencing software to communicate with remote employees. If you have remote employees",0,75
"Apple is facing an antitrust investigation after Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission for Apple's anti-competitive business strategies. Spotify is frustrated with Apple's 30 percent take of subscription revenue and the restrictions that the App Store puts on third-party apps. Announced in an official Spotify blog post, the music streaming service explains how Apple has given itself ""an unfair advantage at every turn."" Apple requires that Spotify and other digital services pay a 30 tax on purchases made through Apple's payment system, including upgrading from our Free to our Premium service. If we pay this tax, it would force us to artificially inflate the price of our Premium membership well above the price of Apple Music. And to keep our price competitive for our customers, that isn't something we can do. As an alternative, if we choose not to use Apple's payment system, forgoing the charge, Apple then applies a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions on Spotify. For example, they limit our communication with our customers - including our outreach beyond the app. In some cases, we aren't even allowed to send emails to our customers who use Apple. Apple also routinely blocks our experience-enhancing upgrades. Over time, this has included locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as Siri, HomePod, and Apple Watch. Spotify also says Apple has blocked Spotify from accessing Siri and HomePod, which is a big deal because Spotify has created Siri commands and AirPlay 2 support that Apple is refusing to implement. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek in a Twitter thread explained that the goal of the complaint is not to ""harm Apple,"" but to address Apple's anti-competitive behavior and allow ""all companies to compete fairly and consumers to win."" In recent years, Apple has introduced rules to the App Store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience - essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers. After trying unsuccessfully to resolve the issues directly with Apple, we're now requesting that the EC take action to ensure fair competition. Ek says Apple has blocked Spotify's efforts to upgrade its app for years, has ""routinely"" blocked its experience-enhancing upgrades, and has ""applied a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions on Spotify."" Apple has responded to Spotify's allegations, calling it ""misleading rhetoric"" and accusing the music streaming company of wanting all of the benefits of the App Store without contributing to the costs of running it. Ek took to Twitter to respond, saying that Apple's statement is ""cute"" but doesn't address the core issues. The Spotify complaint comes after Apple Music overtook Spotify in paid U.S. subscribers in July 2018, and the service is said to be continuing to grow rapidly. This article, ""Spotify Files Antitrust Complaint Against Apple, Claims App Store 'Tax' Leads to Higher Prices"" first appeared on MacRumors.com Spotify Files Antitrust Complaint Against Apple, Claims App Store 'Tax' Leads to Higher Prices Apple is facing an antitrust investigation after Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission for Apple's anti-competitive business strategies.

"A cache of chat logs from the Conti ransomware group was leaked online by an insider. Conti recently stated their support for the Russian invasion and vowed to retaliate against the United States for actions taken in Ukraine. In this interview, we speak with Flashpoint Director of Research, Matt Kodama, who discusses the group's pro-Russian stance and how it will impact the cybersecurity landscape. A cybersecurity research firm says it has discovered evidence of a strong link between Russia and the Conti cybercrime group, a prolific hacking team with ties to Russian-speaking cybercriminals. Flashpoint Director of Research Matt Kodama told The Daily Beast that there is a ""strong connection"" between a Russian state-sponsored hacking group and Conti, which has claimed responsibility for a series of major cyberattacks in the past year, including the attack that downed the network of newspaper giant Tribune Publishing. ""This is the first time we have seen this type of activity from a cybercrime group in the Russian-language underground,"" said Kodama. He said the connection between the two groups is based on linguistic and other evidence. For example, the hackers appear to have used the same ""command and control"" servers to communicate with their malware during their attacks as the state-sponsored hacking group did in some of its operations, Kodama said. The hackers also used some of the same ""command and control"" servers that the Russian state-sponsored hacking group did. He said this is the first time that Flashpoint has seen a state-sponsored group work so closely with a cybercrime group. ""We've seen cybercriminals working with nation-state hackers, but never to this extent,"" he said. The U.S. government has blamed a number of high-profile cyberattacks on Russian state-sponsored hackers, including the breach of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, the 2014 hack of the State Department's unclassified email system, and the 2015 hack of the White House. An executive at Tribune Publishing told The Daily Beast that the hackers behind the company's breach specifically asked for the IP addresses of Tribune's systems, suggesting the hackers had the ability to target Tribune's systems directly, as opposed to simply sending a phishing email to random employees. Kodama said the attacks by Conti could ""raise red flags"" about the relationship between Russian state-sponsored hackers and cybercriminals. Conti has gained notoriety in the past year for a series of high-profile cyberattacks on U.S. targets, including a breach of the Tribune Publishing Company network in December. The group was also responsible for a cyberattack on the Los Angeles Times last year, which knocked the newspaper offline for several days. The group has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks on the Baltimore Sun and other major newspapers. In December, Conti issued a statement in Russian vowing to continue to attack U.S. targets. ""It is our responsibility to take revenge on the United States for its actions against Russia,"" the hackers wrote. Most Russian-speaking cybercriminals have ties to Russian-state sponsored hackers, Kodama said. ""We have seen groups that have ties to each other and members that are swapping in and out of different groups,"" he said. Kodama said the cybercrime group is likely using the Russian state-sponsored hackers to ""get access to systems they otherwise wouldn't be able to get into"" and ""elevate their capabilities,"" he said. The Tribune Publishing Company confirmed to The Daily Beast that the hackers behind the company's breach specifically asked for the IP addresses of Tribune's systems, suggesting the hackers had the ability to target Tribune's systems directly, as opposed to simply sending a phishing email to random employees. A senior FBI official told The Daily Beast that the Bureau is investigating the cyberattacks. ""The FBI takes all potential threats seriously and investigates each threat in order to protect the public and prevent attacks,"" said the official. ""We are working with our partners in the government and other law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident,"" said Marisa Kollias, a spokesperson for Tribune Publishing Company.

"Full Self-Driving on Tesla vehicles works for highway driving, but when it comes to inner-city streets, it still has some ways to go. The most recent update shows that more work is being done to allow the system to drive on more roads. Tesla's autopilot system is not the only self-driving solution in the world, but it is the only one that is being sold to the public on a massive scale. The system is meant to be a semi-autonomous solution, but it is being continually improved to get closer to full autonomy. Tesla releases updates every few months that improve the system's abilities, and the most recent one is no exception. The 2018.40 update, which went out to Tesla owners on Oct. 31, had a few minor improvements, but a few major ones as well. The biggest improvement is that the system has more capability to handle city streets, where other cars, pedestrians, and other obstacles can get in the way. This has always been a struggle for full-self driving systems, and Tesla has been working on it since the beginning. The update also includes better recognition of traffic lights and stop signs, as well as improved handling of highway interchanges, exit lanes, and on and off ramps. This shows that Tesla is focusing on the driving system, which is required to navigate the world around the car, instead of focusing on the technical details of the system itself. The system has also improved in recognizing and handling poorly marked lanes and intersections, such as those on small roads and alleys. This shows that Tesla is attempting to handle most of the driving situations a car could face. This update was the first major update for the system since version 2018.28, which was released back in July. Updates come out every few months, and usually have minor tweaks to the system, but no major improvements. It is not entirely clear why the time between these updates is so long, but one could guess that Tesla is working on major updates and is making sure the system works as intended before releasing it to the public.",0,86

"Facial Recognition technology has developed quickly but the law has not yet caught up with it. Using public camera footage and images of people obtained through their employer's websites combined with powerful software, it is now possible to track a person's movements. Many people are now concerned that their privacy is being compromised. In the UK, there is currently a voluntary code of conduct that police forces are required to follow but there is no law that controls the use of the technology. The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has recently published a report on the subject that calls for the law to be updated. ICO highlights concerns The ICO recognises that there are many benefits to using the technology but it also notes that it is developing so quickly that the law is struggling to keep pace with it. It is also concerned that the use of the technology has the potential to impact on privacy and data protection rights of individuals. It also warns that the use of the technology by law enforcement authorities is often perceived as being intrusive and people feel uncomfortable with it. Police forces have recognised that the use of the technology has the potential to cause public concern and therefore have been careful in the way in which they have used it. They have also recognised the need to be transparent about its use. The ICO says that the use of the technology by private sector companies is of particular concern to it and it highlights the use of the technology by private security companies to monitor crowds at public events, and its use by marketing firms for advertising purposes. The ICO is recommending that the law should be updated to address the concerns that it has raised. It is proposing that there should be a statutory code of practice that deals with the use of the technology. The ICO is also calling for the government to create a national strategy that will address the issues raised by the use of the technology. The Home Office has confirmed that it is working with the ICO on developing a code of practice and that it plans to consult on the code of practice later this year. The ICO has also produced a list of measures that organisations should implement if they wish to use facial recognition software. They include: carrying out a privacy impact assessment to establish whether the benefits outweigh the privacy impacts; ensuring that appropriate policies and procedures are in place; carrying out a data protection impact assessment; considering the use of privacy enhancing techniques such as blurring images of people who are not a match for the database.",0,88

The kit will be made available in 150 countries and regions, and will support 40 languages. Huawei will be making the tool available in 150 countries and regions, and will support 40 languages. Huawei will also be building a ""simplified map"" feature into the kit that will be able to be used offline, making it useful in areas with poor connectivity. The company has announced the tool at its annual developer conference in Dongguan, China, where it also unveiled its Harmony OS operating system, which it has been working on for the past two years. The OS was revealed as the company is trying to lessen its dependence on US companies following the US government's decision to put a ban on US firms selling technology to the Chinese company. Huawei has said that the Harmony OS won't be replacing Android, but will be used instead in devices such as smartwatches, wireless earbuds, smart speakers and in-car entertainment systems. The company has announced the tool at its annual developer conference in Dongguan, China.

"A developer has created a way to scale macOS using docker. Each instance is able to access services like iMessage as Docker-OSX generates unique codes for its macOS hardware. The OS can be used in a browser, but it's not a full-fledged macOS experience. The developer behind the project, Abraham Masri, released a beta of Docker-OSX earlier this year. Today, he's released an updated version with a number of improvements and fixes. Docker-OSX is now based on macOS High Sierra, supports more hardware, and much more. Docker-OSX is based on VirtualBox and has the capability to run an instance of macOS in a web browser. There are limitations, though. The instance of macOS is not a full version and does not have access to Apple's software and services. This means that users are not able to download Apple's apps, but can access other features of macOS. Docker-OSX does have an App Store, but is filled with apps that are optimized to run in the virtualized environment. I am happy to announce that a new update of Docker-OSX is now available for download! The new version now comes with more features, better hardware compatibility, a new installer and more! You can find the download link here. This update was a major update that took a lot of time to test, so I appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Docker-OSX is a macOS guest operating system that can run on top of Linux and Windows, and allows developers to test their applications and websites with Safari. It is built to run using Docker, and is based off of VirtualBox. Docker-OSX can be installed using the Docker-OSX Installer, which downloads the macOS image and makes the changes required to get Docker-OSX up and running. Docker-OSX runs macOS Sierra, and is able to run Xcode, Safari, and more. The current release also includes a new feature that allows Docker-OSX to run in a web browser. Docker-OSX is only available for x86 systems, as Apple does not provide ARM VirtualBox images. For those interested in trying out Docker-OSX, you can find instructions on how to get Docker-OSX up and running here.",0,90

"Spotify has bought The Ringer, a podcast-centric media company owned by Bill Simmons. Simmons and his employees will all be absorbed in the deal. The Ringer has around 30 titles, most of which are sports podcasts, but also includes popular shows like The Bill Simmons Podcast and The Rewatchables. Spotify says that it now has around 500,000 podcast titles in total. Spotify says that it will look to further develop The Ringer's podcasts, and use its own data to help the company pick out content that will resonate with listeners. Spotify also says that it will be able to give The Ringer a wider reach, especially on its ad-free premium tier. Simmons isn't known for being a big fan of Spotify's business practices. He has been critical of the company's approach to paying artists, and the deal with The Ringer will likely require him to change his tune on the matter. Spotify is also still waiting on a decision from the Copyright Royalty Board on how it will pay songwriters and publishers, which is expected to be a big increase for those parties. Spotify's acquisition of Gimlet Media and Anchor, two podcasting companies that it bought last year, signaled a major shift for the company. The move to buy The Ringer is an interesting one, and will certainly give Spotify a bit more clout in the sports world, but it's not clear what Simmons' plans are for his other media properties. Simmons also still has a contract with HBO for a show that he hosts, Any Given Wednesday. Spotify has continued to expand its reach into the podcast world, and it's clear that it is a major focus for the company going forward.

"Neuromorphic computing hardware is special hardware developed to model the behavior of biological neurons. A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that mimics synaptic connections. The researchers used phase-change materials (PCMs) for developing the hardware, which allows the creation of non-volatile, reversible and scalable memories. The materials can be electrically switched between a crystalline state that is conducting and an amorphous state that is insulating. A neuromorphic chip has synaptic devices with two inputs and one output. The output of the device is an analog output that is equivalent to the synaptic weight. The researchers used PCMs to develop synaptic devices that have a non-linear behavior. The devices were then combined to create the hardware that mimics the neurons. The neuromorphic chip was tested by creating a perceptron that classifies different input patterns into different output categories. The chip is a proof-of-concept that can be used for creating neuromorphic chips with high-density connectivity. The PCMs can be made compatible with the CMOS technology and hence can be integrated with the current memory chips and transistors. The researchers hope that the PCM synaptic devices can be scaled up to create the non-volatile analog memories for machine learning.",0,93
"Humans can learn echolocation to navigate mazes and identify the size and orientation of objects in just 10 weeks. It's a good starting point for making your own Batman-like supersenses. Echolocation is the process where an animal uses sound waves to locate objects and sense their surroundings. Bats, dolphins and whales are all known to use echolocation to get around. And now humans can too, at least to some extent. A new study finds that blind echolocators were able to use echolocation to navigate a maze and identify the size and orientation of objects. ""These are abilities that we thought only non-human sensory systems could achieve, but here we had blind people showing that they could do it,"" says Lore Thaler, one of the study's authors. Six people took part in the study. All had experience with echolocation and they all had normal hearing and sight. They were given a series of echolocation tasks in which they listened to the way objects reflected sound waves back to them. They were also given a listening test to see how sensitive they were to sounds. In the first task, the echolocators had to walk through a maze. They were each fitted with a blindfold and headphones. Then they were led into the maze where they had to identify the walls. They were then allowed to move around freely, while the researchers monitored their movements. Each participant was able to navigate the maze without running into the walls or wandering around aimlessly. Next, they had to identify the orientation of objects. They listened to sounds reflected from a pole, a plate and a cube. They were able to identify the objects' shapes, even when the objects were turned upside down or laid flat on the ground. In the third task, they had to identify the size of an object. They were fitted with a blindfold and headphones and then asked to find a pole that was placed at a random spot on the ground. They were then asked to find the pole again. When they found the pole, they placed a small cube next to it and were asked to move back to where they found the pole. They were able to place the cube right next to the pole 90 percent of the time. ""It is a very rare example of true human sensory adaptation and it gives us a unique window into the workings of our perceptual system,"" says Thaler. Not only does this provide a potential mechanism for humans to develop echolocation, it also suggests that echolocation may have aided the evolution of spatial perception in humans. ""Echolocation based on self-generated sounds is a strategy used across the animal kingdom, in bats, cetaceans, birds and some insects, but until now the only demonstration of this ability in a human has been anecdotal,"" says Michael Geuss, a researcher who wasn't part of the study. ""This study uses rigorous scientific methods to prove that echolocation is a viable strategy in humans as well, and adds to our understanding of how echolocation works."" The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. It was published in the journal PLoS One.",0,94
"China's National Health Commission has confirmed the first case of human infection with H10N3, a strain of bird flu. The patient survived and there were no other cases. Widespread transmission of the virus among humans is not expected. Bird flu is an infectious disease caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. Occasionally, bird flu viruses can infect humans. However, human infection with avian influenza viruses does not easily spread from person to person. There are many different types of bird flu viruses, but only some strains of the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses have infected people. The WHO website contains information on the various bird flu viruses that have infected people, including their geographic distribution and symptoms. The WHO publishes weekly updates on the global situation of human infections with the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. The WHO also regularly publishes reports on the situation of the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in animals. Those who come in close contact with live birds. Those who visit live poultry markets. Those who visit or work in environments where live poultry is raised or kept. Avoid touching surfaces contaminated with bird droppings or secretions. Do not touch birds or other animals, whether they are alive or dead. Do not visit live poultry markets or farms. Avoid eating undercooked eggs or poultry meat. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching animals or after coming in contact with surfaces possibly contaminated with animal droppings or secretions. Get vaccinated against seasonal influenza. The risk of human infection is low. Close contacts of an infected person do not need to be tested or treated. To date, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.",0,96
"Thousands of people protested in Belarus on the weekend over the results of the presidential election. Long-time president Alexander Lukashenko won 80 percent of the vote, extending his 26-year long rule. Lukashenko is often called Europe's last dictator. He's known for his brutal crackdowns on protesters and the free press, as well as for what human rights advocates have called ""disappearances"" of political opponents. Today, you'll hear from one of the people who protested in the country's capital, Minsk, this weekend. She's a 25-year-old journalist named Maryna. She spoke with The World's Carol Hills on the line from Minsk. We're not using her last name to protect her identity. ""I was in the very center of Minsk in one of the central squares. And the square was surrounded by the police, so we couldn't go anywhere. But there were some people, they were really brave, who tried to get out of the square and they were attacked by the police and were detained. ""I think the election was not free and fair. The results - people are not really happy with the results of the election. The turnout was quite high, but I think it was because they were forced to vote. The public sector workers were forced to vote. ""Most of them were detained for 15 days. Some of them are still kept in jail. I've heard that some of them are beaten, but I can't say anything for sure because I'm not in prison. I'm just following the news and trying to find information about my friends. ""I'm not afraid because I've been on the streets for five days already, and I'm not afraid. And I know that if I'm detained, I will be released. And if not, I'm ready to stay in jail for 15 days and I'm ready to pay the fine. And I'm ready to do it for my country and for our freedom. ""I don't think that it's a matter of time that Lukashenko will go away because I don't think he wants to go away. He really wants to stay in power. And he doesn't care about the people and what they want. He just wants to stay in power. And he's ready to do anything to stay in power. And he's ready to kill people. He's ready to suppress any protests, any actions. ""Of course, it's not safe to live here, especially if you're a journalist. It's not safe to live here if you're a political activist. And it's not safe to live here if you're just a normal person and you want to live free. You don't want to be afraid of police and you want to be able to say what you think.

"Solana is a proof-of-stake blockchain with a mechanism called proof-of-history. This article is a guide on how to build a full stack dapp using Solana. It introduces the ecosystem and how to get the necessary tools in place. Solana is a proof-of-stake blockchain with a mechanism called proof-of-history. This article is a guide on how to build a full stack dapp using Solana. It introduces the ecosystem and how to get the necessary tools in place. The article then introduces the main concepts of the Solana blockchain, provides an overview of the development process and details of the web-based app. The core concepts are explained and put into practice by building a simple web app. The project is a simple web application that displays a list of users and lets you add new ones. All users are stored on the blockchain. You can verify that the application is running on a live node, but it can also be deployed to a test node. The source code is available on GitHub. The Solana blockchain is a proof-of-stake blockchain. It uses a proof-of-history consensus algorithm which allows for fast block times. This is combined with a set of predefined transaction types which are designed to be fast. The blockchain is written in Rust and offers a set of abstractions that are designed to be easy to use. Solana provides two types of blockchain: one that is designed for general-purpose applications and one that is designed to be used for financial applications. This guide uses the general-purpose blockchain. In order to run a Solana node, you need to download the Solana node software. This is available as a docker image on DockerHub. To run the docker container, first navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the docker file. Then run the following command. You can find out more about the options in the README. You can also deploy to a test node. This is a node that is hosted on a VM on AWS. It can be accessed using any node client. This can be useful when you are developing an application. You can connect to the test node using the Solana CLI. This will open up an interactive shell. This will provide a prompt where you can enter commands. You can also deploy the docker container to a local environment. This can be useful to test performance or debug the system. To write code for Solana you will need to use the Solana SDK. The Solana SDK is written in Rust and is available on the Solana SDK website. The Solana SDK has a set of abstractions that simplify blockchain development. The core abstractions are accounts and transactions. There are different types of accounts. The main one is the signer account. This account can sign transactions to transfer value between accounts. In addition to signer accounts there are other types of accounts. For example, a keyless account is an account which is used for storage and is controlled by a signer account. Accounts and transactions are defined using the Solana SDK. The Solana SDK uses the Solana Runtime as its core dependency. The Solana Runtime is a thin abstraction layer over the Solana network. This makes it easy to switch between the live and test network. The Solana SDK also contains a set of higher-level abstractions, which make it easier to use the blockchain. These are called the program abstractions. They provide a set of useful utility functions for accessing accounts and transactions. The program abstractions allow you to perform a number of actions. You can create accounts, generate keys, transfer funds and perform a number of other useful functions. The Solana SDK provides a set of contracts which you can use to develop your application. These contracts are written in Rust. To build a contract you need to first create a library with your contract code. The Solana SDK provides a number of examples. These are available on the Solana SDK website. You can find out more about writing Solana contracts in the Solana SDK documentation. Once you have developed your contract, you need to deploy it to a node. To do this you need to run the solana-cli deploy command. You can then use this code to deploy to a node. If the code is in a different directory, you will need to specify the path to the directory using the dir flag. Solana supports a range of programming languages. The main language is Rust. This is the language that is used to develop the Solana SDK and the runtime. It is also the language in which you develop contracts. In addition to this, the Solana SDK provides a set of libraries which can be used to access the Solana blockchain from a range of different programming languages.

"Shijian-21, or SJ-21, is a Chinese satellite designed to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies. It was recently observed pulling a dead satellite out of its normal orbit and then pushing it to a graveyard orbit. A 1,200-kilogram (2,646-lb) satellite called Shijian-21, or SJ-21, was launched on August 21, 2019 and entered a 500-kilometer (310-mile) sun-synchronous orbit. In October, it was spotted using a net to capture a 550-kilogram (1,213-lb) decommissioned satellite called CubeSat, or CICADA 4. SJ-21 then used a powerful thruster to nudge the CubeSat into an orbit about 100 kilometers (62 miles) above its original orbit. The maneuver used about 25 of the SJ-21's fuel. The mission is part of China's efforts to address the increasing amount of space debris in low Earth orbit. The effort is similar to efforts by the US Air Force to use electrodynamic tethers to pull decommissioned satellites out of orbit.",0,101
"Apple's custom-designed M2 chips entered production this month. The chips will be introduced with new Macs in the second half of 2021. They are being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple's M2 chips will bring power management to Macs for the first time. The Mac Pro is the first Mac computer with an Apple-designed chip. The T2 chip handles system security and enables the Mac Pro to boot in under 10 seconds. The T2 chip also features a secure enclave co-processor, SSD controller, and IO controller. Bloomberg's report says Apple has created a new chip division that is designing ARM-based chips for Macs. The new division is led by Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji, who joined Apple in 2008. Bloomberg says Srouji has been using ARM chip technology since before he joined Apple. The T2 chip was designed in-house by Srouji's team. Apple is currently working on new Macs that will use a custom-designed ARM chip. The ARM chips will be used to power the Mac's low-power mode, the first time Apple has included a low-power mode in a Mac. The report says the ARM chip will handle some basic tasks, allowing Apple to use less powerful Intel chips in the Mac. The ARM chip will also allow for longer battery life for MacBooks. Apple's custom-designed ARM chips for the Mac won't enter production until 2021. They will be used in at least one Mac model starting in 2021, says the report. Apple has not commented on the report.

"Scientists were able to use light and bio-ink to print a human ear-like structure under the skin of mice without a single surgical cut. Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is a technique that can be used to 3D print human tissue without the need for scaffolds. The technique uses living cells and bio-ink to print 3D structures, such as organs, which can be transplanted into humans. In this new study, the team of researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign tested their DLP technique to 3D print a human-like ear under the skin of a mouse. The technique uses 3D scans of the subject's ear, which are then used as a digital blueprint for the 3D printed ear. The researchers hope to create replacement tissues for patients, such as those who have suffered severe trauma to the body. They also hope to use 3D printed tissue to replace cancerous tissue. A high-resolution digital image of a human ear was used to create a 3D digital model. This model was then divided into a number of layers, which were used to guide a 3D printer in the production of the ear. Using a technique called bioprinting, the researchers were able to 3D print the ear structure using cells and special bio-ink that was made out of collagen, gelatin, and nutrients. The ear-like structure was then implanted under the skin of a mouse. The bioprinted ear structure was able to develop a system of blood vessels that were able to keep the ear alive, and the cells within the ear were also able to divide and grow as the ear continued to develop. While this new technique still has a long way to go, the researchers hope that it will someday be able to print large 3D structures, such as organs, inside of humans. They also hope to eventually use a patient's own cells to create the 3D structure, which would make rejection of the organ almost impossible.",0,103

"A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourbanitech's tree requires no water, soil, or sunlight to do its job. The Smog-Eating Tower is designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and it is currently being tested in Mexico City, one of the world's most polluted cities. The tower was developed with the help of researchers at UNAM, Mexico's National Autonomous University. It uses a photocatalytic pigment called titanium dioxide, which is activated by the sun's rays and oxygen in the air to neutralize pollutants. Mexico City has struggled with air pollution for decades. In 1992, the UN named it the most polluted city in the world. The city has made some progress since then, but it still ranks among the world's most polluted. Biomitech plans to build 1,000 of the artificial trees over the next few years, and it says it hopes to eventually install them in urban areas around the world. The Smog-Eating Tower costs about 25,000 to build, which is much cheaper than trying to plant 368 real trees. It's also cheaper than other technology to fight air pollution. The company says that one of its trees costs about 10 percent of what it would cost to build an air-purification system. Biomitech is not the first company to develop a structure to help purify air in urban areas. In 2017, a company called Green City Solutions installed air-purifying trees in cities around Europe. They use mosses that absorb pollutants. While Biomitech's technology may be effective at cleaning up air pollution, trees do a lot more than just remove pollutants from the air. They can also help fight climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their trunks. Trees can also help prevent flooding by absorbing excess water and releasing it into the atmosphere. They can also help moderate temperatures by reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the pavement. And they look nice, too. Photo credit: Biomitech Mexico City Smog-Eating Tower",0,112
"Artemis is NASA's next manned moon mission, which is planned for 2024. It will be the first time astronauts have set foot on the lunar surface since 1972. Two astronauts will land in the south pole of the moon aboard the Orion spacecraft. They will stay for about a week and a half. Artemis will use the Space Launch System (SLS), the most powerful rocket ever built, and the Orion spacecraft, which has been flight-tested and now awaits its first deep space mission. Why go to the moon? NASA's mission is to continue to explore the moon and beyond, which includes a lunar landing and the eventual landing on Mars. The moon also holds many scientific mysteries. For instance, a 2019 discovery revealed that some parts of the moon are about 1 billion years younger than others. The moon also holds clues to the origins of our solar system, including volatile materials that were trapped in the moon's rocks. What is the Artemis program? In 2017, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon, and the agency is working to meet that goal by 2024. NASA also plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. The Artemis program's goal is to establish a sustainable human presence on the moon by 2028. It will also look into using the moon as a launchpad for missions to Mars. Who was Artemis? Artemis was the Greek goddess of the hunt, wild animals and the wilderness. She was the sister of Apollo and the daughter of Zeus, making her a lunar diety. Artemis is also the name of the Greek goddess of the hunt. (Image credit: R. HanelESO) In Roman mythology, Artemis was known as Diana. She has also been associated with the Egyptian deity Bastet. Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo, the Greek and Roman god of music, poetry, archery, plague, oracles, light, truth and prophecy. Artemis was known for her love of nature, and she was the goddess of the hunt and the wilderness. She was also a protector of young girls and a midwife. It's unclear exactly where the name Artemis originated, but it might have come from the Greek word ""artamos,"" which means ""safe"" or ""uninjured."" Related: Photos: NASA's Space Launch System for the Artemis Moon Missions Where will Artemis land? NASA's 2024 moon landing will take place at the south pole of the moon. The area is known as the South Pole-Aitken basin, which is thought to contain ice deposits. The first landing will be at the southern rim of the basin, near an area called the Shackleton crater. Why the south pole? Scientists are interested in the south pole because it's home to permanently shadowed craters, which are thought to contain ice. That ice could be used by astronauts to make water, oxygen and fuel. It could also be used to protect astronauts from solar radiation. Astronauts will also be able to take advantage of near-constant sunlight at the lunar south pole. Artemis program: 2024 moon landing The Orion spacecraft will carry two astronauts to the moon on the 2024 Artemis mission. The spacecraft has been tested, and it's awaiting its first deep space mission. It will launch on NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which will be the most powerful rocket ever built. Astronauts will also use the Gateway, a small space station that will orbit the moon. It will serve as a launchpad for missions to the lunar surface and as a home for astronauts in lunar orbit. Astronauts will stay on the moon for about a week and a half, conducting experiments and collecting samples. The mission will be a short-stay, though NASA plans to eventually have astronauts staying on the moon for months at a time. NASA's Artemis program will build on the agency's Apollo missions, which sent astronauts to the moon for the first time. The last moon landing was Apollo 17, which took place in 1",0,113
"NASA will test drive a robot underneath Antarctica's sea ice in preparation for a mission in the subsurface oceans of Jupiter's moon, Europa. Buoyant Rover for Under-Ice Exploration, or BRUIE, is equipped with two wheels to roll along underneath sea ice. It will carry a suite of instruments to characterize the environment and search for life. BRUIE is being developed by engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The rover is 12 inches long (30 centimeters) and 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms), not including its tether. It will be deployed in Antarctica during the austral spring and summer of 2018-2019, and will be attached by a 30-foot-long (9-meter-long) tether to a larger, surface-based platform. This platform will serve as a communications link with scientists and will also collect sunlight via solar panels to provide power to the rover. The rover was designed to climb up under the ice shelf and look back down at the ice-water interface. Its cameras will search for signs of sea anemones and other animals that make their homes in ice. NASA's recent discovery of a probable subsurface lake in the area has made this mission even more compelling, as the ice ceiling above this lake will be an important zone to study. The technology could allow scientists to explore an environment on another world that would otherwise be inaccessible. This could be especially useful on a moon like Europa, which is covered in ice but likely has a subsurface ocean. On Earth, life forms have been found dotted across the tree of life, and part of the reason some organisms survive in extreme environments is because they have unique behaviors and traits that have yet to be discovered. While the Antarctic trek will be a test run for the rover, the ultimate goal is to send a similar device to explore Europa. The purpose of this initial expedition is to test the BRUIE technology in a real-world, icy environment, which will allow the team to develop the robotic platform in preparation for a possible Europa mission. The instrument will survey the ice shelf by looking at the ratio between two types of oxygen atoms - oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 - that make up its water molecules. Liquid water tends to contain more oxygen 16. Because this ratio can change depending on the temperature at which the water froze, scientists can use the ratio to determine the temperature of the water before it froze. They can also tell if it was a liquid, a slushy mixture or a gas when it froze.",0,114

"Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), an Australian mining company, has announced a project to create an electric infinity train that will be able to move loads of iron ore without ever needing to be refuelled. The new train will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which will generate electricity to power the train. The new technology would also cut the company's carbon emissions by 200,000 tonnes per year and reduce the amount of time trains are idling by 40 per cent. The first part of the project has been completed, with the world's first heavy haul, long distance locomotive running on pure hydrogen fuel. The technology is the first time that a commercial scale prototype of this type has been completed. ""This is not just about a locomotive. It's about the broader opportunity to deliver lower emissions technology to the heavy haul freight sector that delivers exports critical to our economy,"" said Andrew Harding, Fortescue's chief executive. The project is being delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth Government through the National Hydrogen Roadmap, as well as a number of industry partners. ""Fortescue is proud to be leading this ground-breaking project, bringing together our partners in academia, industry and government to develop a cleaner energy solution for the heavy haulage sector, which will have a global impact,"" said Mr Harding. The project will include the construction of a new 14 km hydrogen pipeline to support the refuelling of the new locomotive, and the building of a brand new hydrogen production and refuelling facility. ""Fortescue's team has delivered another industry-first innovation to Australia, further demonstrating our commitment to developing and adopting the latest technologies, ensuring our operations are globally competitive and create long-term value for our shareholders, customers, the community and the nation,"" said Mr Harding. The new hydrogen powered train will be able to move iron ore from mines in the Pilbara region in Western Australia to Port Hedland, which is 800 km away. ""Our heavy haulage locomotives travel 16,000 km per week hauling iron ore to Port Hedland to be shipped to our customers,"" said Mr Harding. ""This distance is equivalent to approximately 40 per cent of the way around the earth on a single tank of fuel, so the opportunity to introduce a more efficient and environmentally friendly fuel source is very exciting,"" said Mr Harding. The project is expected to be completed by 2020. For more information visit the Fortescue Future Industries website.",0,116

"DeepMind has published a paper on their system AlphaZero, an AI that can crack any game that provides all the relevant decision-making information. This includes games like chess and go, and also Shogi, which is similar to chess, but harder to play. AlphaZero has been trained for 9 hours. Not only was it able to crack these games, but it also beat Stockfish 8, the highest-rated chess engine in the world. We used to assume that we need to build a system that is very specific to a particular game. The system would then try to find all the possible outcomes and pick the one that maximizes the chances of winning. This required human supervision to build the system, and it took quite a bit of time to gather all the necessary data. What is remarkable is that AlphaZero doesn't need this supervision, and it doesn't need to go through all the possible outcomes. It can learn on its own by playing against itself. AlphaZero has been trained on 5,000 games. Compare this to Stockfish, which has been trained on 64,000 games. And yet AlphaZero was able to beat Stockfish with 28 wins, 0 losses and 72 draws. This is extremely important for the field of AI. It means that we can build systems that can solve incredibly complex problems, which require millions of calculations in real time, in just a few hours of training. And because they can learn by playing against themselves, these systems can be trained without human supervision. AlphaZero is the reason why people like Elon Musk are worried about AI. It proves that AI is capable of learning things that we cannot imagine. As more and more data becomes available, we will build increasingly complex AI systems. Eventually, they will be able to do more than just play games.",0,119

"A study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has found that Far-UVC light can safely kill 99.9 of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets. Conventional UV lamps can kill viruses on surfaces, but this is the first time scientists have been able to use this type of light to kill a virus in the air. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The study, published in Scientific Reports, shows that the Far-UVC light can be used to kill airborne SARS and MERS coronaviruses. ""This study shows that Far-UVC light has a major advantage over [the] conventional germicidal UV light in that Far-UVC kills viruses in the air, and also on surfaces,"" says David J. Brenner, PhD, lead author of the study and a professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. Far-UVC light, which has wavelengths between 207 and 222 nanometers, has been used for disinfecting water, food and surfaces. However, because it has high-energy components, it can't be used in the presence of people. The study shows that Far-UVC light could be used in public spaces, such as airports, public transportation, doctors' offices and schools. ""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" says Brenner. ""That means it's not only safe; it's not something that we have to worry about as far as it affecting us."" While UVC light is currently used to disinfect surgical tools and surfaces, it can't be used to disinfect the air because of the hazards to the eyes and skin. The study, which was conducted in a lab, tested Far-UVC lights' ability to kill aerosolized coronaviruses. The coronavirus was released into a test chamber, and then the Far-UVC light was turned on for varying lengths of time. To determine how effective the Far-UVC light was, the scientists measured the viral load in the chamber. The results showed that the Far-UVC light was able to greatly reduce the level of viral particles in the air. Further experiments showed that Far-UVC light could kill coronaviruses in the air, whether the air was circulating or still. ""This study shows that two hours of Far-UVC light can kill 95 percent of the virus in the air, and 45 minutes of Far-UVC light can kill 90 percent of the virus,"" says Brenner. He notes that, even though the Far-UVC light can't penetrate through human skin, it can penetrate clothes, which means it could be used to kill viruses in closed spaces. ""For public health workers that are in the midst of an outbreak, this could help decontaminate an entire space,"" says Brenner. He adds that the light can be mounted on the ceiling, walls or floor. ""The light could be mounted in the ceiling or on the walls or floor. We can take our germicidal technology and make it into a thin coating that could be sprayed or rolled on almost any surface. ""You could use this technology in a subway station or an airport or any enclosed area.""",0,121
"Embeddinghub is a database built for machine learning embeddings. Embeddings are dense numerical representations of real-world objects and relationships. They are used to quantify how similar vectors are to each other in a way that supports learning and reasoning. Embeddings are particularly useful for unstructured and non-tabular data like text or images. Machine learning models like neural networks can use embeddings to understand the similarity between two words or the relation between two objects. In the past few years, researchers have created embeddings for all sorts of domains. They've created embeddings for words and phrases, countries and cities, movies and actors, and even genes and proteins. However, these embeddings are siloed away in academic papers and software repositories. It's very hard to find embeddings for a particular domain, even when they've been published. Embeddinghub aims to solve this problem by creating a database for embeddings, where people can easily search, browse and compare them. Anyone who wants to use embeddings for their research can use the search and compare features to find the embeddings most appropriate for their domain. Researchers who've created embeddings can add them to the database, which will increase the visibility of their work and help others discover it.

"MoviePass is coming back under the ownership of cofounder Stacy Spikes. The company was acquired out of bankruptcy for an undisclosed amount below 250,000. Spikes plans to relaunch the business in early 2020. He said he believes the companies that followed MoviePasss lead will eventually go out of business, and MoviePass will emerge as the leader. The subscription service, which at one point had more than 3 million subscribers, enabled members to see as many movies as they wanted in a month for a flat fee. In the end, MoviePass couldnt make that work. But Spikes believes that with a more thoughtful business plan and focused targeting of customers, MoviePass can succeed. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. MoviePass is coming back. The movie ticket subscription service that helped drive millions of customers to the theaters, but ultimately went bankrupt, has been acquired by cofounder Stacy Spikes, and will relaunch in early 2020. The new MoviePass, now called MoviePass Entertainment, has been acquired out of bankruptcy for an undisclosed amount below 250,000. Spikes said in a statement that MoviePasss future will be about more than just discounted movie tickets. MoviePass was a data-driven marketing company, but its first chapter was the theatrical exhibition business, Spikes said. This chapter of MoviePass is about entertainment and building community. We are about to take a wild ride here, Spikes wrote in the statement. This acquisition is just the beginning. Stacy Spikes, cofounder of MoviePass, believes MoviePass will come out on top. MoviePass Entertainment MoviePass Entertainment is focused on two main areas: movie ticket subscription and media. The media aspect will include an online media destination, a radio show, podcast, and video content. The movie ticket subscription service will launch in early 2020, with Spikes planning to start with a small group of subscribers in select cities. Spikes said in a statement that the price for the subscription service will be between 9.95 and 14.95 a month. MoviePass had a booming success when it launched in 2017. The service, which allowed members to see as many movies as they wanted in a month for a flat fee, attracted more than 3 million subscribers at its peak. But MoviePass couldnt make that business model work. Ultimately, MoviePass ran out of money to pay for movie tickets, and in August it announced that it was temporarily shutting down its service. Spikes has a theory for why the company went under. He believes that many of the companies that followed MoviePasss lead, like AMCs A-List and Sinemas Sinemia, will eventually go out of business, and MoviePass will emerge as the leader. Spikes said in a statement that MoviePass has a unique and experienced team, and a data-driven technology platform. We will have to be flawless in our execution, he said. I believe we will be. In July, MoviePass was sued by shareholders of its parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, for fraud. The shareholders alleged that Helios and Matheson violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions to the investing public.

"Ten eggs were harvested from the last two remaining northern white rhinoceroses, potentially saving the species from extinction. Neither of the white rhinos can carry a baby to term, so they will be used to fertilize eggs harvested from southern white rhino females. Najin, a 28-year-old female, is the last female northern white rhino on the planet. She was born in captivity in Czechoslovakia in 1989. In 2000, she and two other rhinos were transferred to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia County, Kenya. Najin is currently not capable of carrying a baby to term. The northern white rhinos, the second largest land animal in the world, have been driven to extinction due to poaching and habitat loss. ""The only option is to use southern white rhinos as surrogates,"" said Jan Stejskal, director of international projects at Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic. Najin was joined by Fatu, a 17-year-old female white rhino, at Ol Pejeta in 2009. Fatu was born in captivity in Sudan and moved to the Czech Republic at a young age. Fatu is also unable to carry a baby to term. While Fatu and Najin are the last of their kind, there is still hope for the species. ""We have another five years to get it right,"" Richard Vigne, managing director of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, told CNN. ""That's how long we think we have left, realistically, to pull this off. We're up against it. But I don't think we've got much of a choice."" In 2017, Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros, died of natural causes. Sudan's death left only two of the rhinos, Fatu and Najin. Sudan's genetic material was collected and stored at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin. This, and the new harvested eggs, could be used to fertilize eggs harvested from southern white rhino females. The southern white rhinoceros is a subspecies of white rhinoceros. Researchers at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research are looking at the next steps. ""We do know that in order to save the northern white rhino as a species we will have to ultimately transplant a hybrid embryo into a southern white rhino surrogate mother,"" said Vigne. The conservationists have to make sure they get the IVF right, as they only have the two eggs from Najin and 10 from Fatu. ""If you make a mistake with it, you've lost the last egg. You've lost your last chance,"" said Cesare Galli, an Italian animal embryologist and cryobiologist who worked on the project. White rhinos, native to Africa, are the largest rhino species. The northern white rhino and the southern white rhino are separate subspecies. White rhinos are the largest rhino species and the largest land mammal after the elephant. The northern white rhino and the southern white rhino are two separate subspecies. The northern white rhino was classified as a separate subspecies from the southern white rhino in 1947. Another subspecies, the western black rhino, was declared extinct in 2011. The last male northern white rhinoceros, Sudan, died in 2018. The two remaining northern white rhinos, Fatu and Najin, are incapable of carrying a baby to term. Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic, along with the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, have harvested eggs from Fatu and Najin to use in an IVF procedure. Northern white rhinos could be brought back from extinction using IVF",0,126
"Most object detectors enumerate a large list of potential object locations and then classify each item, which is a large waste of resources as well as an inefficient approach. Objects are not randomly distributed in an image and usually there is significant correlation among different locations. Hence, it is more effective to incorporate the correlations into the object detector, and propose a new correlation-aware object detection approach. In this paper, we propose a correlation-aware filter, which can naturally incorporate the correlations among different object locations. Furthermore, we also propose a new strategy for object detector design by combining the correlation-aware filter with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. Unlike most object detectors that enumerate a large number of locations for classifying the objects, the proposed approach only needs to evaluate a small number of object candidates, and hence, it is both efficient and effective. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach can not only improve the detection performance of the traditional SVM-based object detector, but also reduce the time consumption for the object detection. 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,127

"Beta test the new HLS Live Stream Latency metric in Mux Data for free! Understand the live streaming experience, and find opportunities to improve. Learn more. Is HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) Right For Me? HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a widely adopted streaming protocol used by many popular online video platforms like YouTube and Facebook. It's the most popular streaming format today. HLS has many advantages and is an ideal choice for streaming live video. However, it's not without some shortcomings, and not all use cases are ideal for it. In this article, we'll go over what HLS is, the pros and cons of HLS, and some use cases that are ideal for using HLS. When To Use HLS What Is HLS? HLS is a streaming protocol created by Apple that delivers video content over HTTP. It's a protocol for breaking a single video into a sequence of small HTTP-based video files. This makes it easier to deliver video content over the Internet, and allows the video to adapt to changing network conditions without stopping and restarting. When To Use HLS Live Streaming HLS has many advantages and is an ideal choice for streaming live video to most audiences. There are a few scenarios where you should consider using a different streaming protocol. Do Not Use HLS For Live Streams That Require Low Latency For some use cases, latency matters more than compatibility. Low-latency live streams are essential for use cases where you need to avoid significant delays between the live event and the live stream. The best use case for low-latency live streaming is broadcasting live sports online. The lower the latency, the more enjoyable the viewing experience. With high latency, you'll see viewers complaining in the chat and on social media about the stream being behind. HLS is not ideal for low-latency live streaming because HLS live streams have 30-40 seconds of latency. HLS streams use a technique called segmented streaming. This requires the encoder to wait to receive a segment of video before starting to stream it. HLS Live Streaming Latency In comparison, RTMP has about 3-7 seconds of latency, and RTSP has about 2 seconds of latency. If low latency is essential for your live stream, consider using a different streaming protocol such as RTMP, RTSP, or WebRTC. Do Not Use HLS For Live Streams That Require On-Demand Playback If you need to record your live stream for on-demand viewing, consider using a streaming protocol other than HLS. HLS was not designed with on-demand playback in mind. There are a few reasons for this: HLS supports adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR), but it's up to the client to choose which bitrate to use when playing back the stream. This makes it harder to use adaptive bitrate for on-demand playback. HLS segments are downloaded in a random order, so there is no way to know what bitrate to use to download the segments that come next. HLS segments are downloaded in parallel. This works great for live streams, but it's not ideal for on-demand playback. When you use HLS for on-demand playback, there will be gaps in the playback, and the stream will stop and start while waiting for segments to download. If on-demand playback is important to you, consider using a different streaming protocol. RTMP is best suited for this. Do Not Use HLS For Mobile Live Streams When you use HLS to stream to mobile devices, you must use a different method to play the stream. On iOS and Android devices, you can use HTML5 video tag with the src attribute set to the HLS stream URL. However, the HLS playback experience on mobile is not ideal. HLS playback on mobile devices has high latency and is not reliable. This is caused by mobile network instability. When the mobile network is unstable, HLS segments may not be downloaded properly. This results in playback stalls and interruptions. If you plan to stream to mobile devices, consider using a different streaming protocol like RTMP, RTSP, or WebRTC. When To Use HLS Live Streaming HLS has many advantages and is ideal for streaming live video to most audiences. HLS Is The Most Popular Streaming Format HLS is the most popular streaming format.

In this article, he talks about his experience designing products and companies. One of my favorite quotes from the article is, ""People who are designers need to be able to put themselves into other people's shoes. You have to have empathy. And you have to have a desire to make things better."" That quote embodies a significant part of my beliefs as a designer. You are not designing for yourself. You are designing for a user. In order to be effective, you need to be able to look at your project through their eyes. What are their problems? How can you help them with those problems? What makes them happy? How can you make them happier? This approach can also be applied to the people you work with. What are their problems? How can you help them with those problems? What makes them happy? How can you make them happier? Another key takeaway from this article is the concept of using data to drive decisions. As designers, we can often make assumptions about how to make things better. However, the way to truly validate those assumptions is to use data. The article features this quote: ""I'm a big believer in first principles. Most people tackle a problem by saying, 'Okay, this is how others did it. Let's consider all the issues and complexities of this problem as it's been looked at before.' But then you end up with something not too much different from what already exists. I find that you have to take a step back and say, 'Let's forget everything we know about this problem and imagine that we're the first person to ever look at it. I'm a big fan of first principles thinking, especially when applied to design. When we focus on first principles, we often end up with an innovative design. I highly recommend this article.

"CSS linear gradients get washed out and muddy in the middle unless steps are taken to avoid the effect. This article teaches developers how to avoid the gray dead zone that often appears in the middle of linear gradients. For most developers the gradient washout effect is the single biggest reason to avoid using linear gradients. The problem is most apparent in color combinations such as white to black, which is shown in the example below. In this example, as the background color changes from white to black, the change in the middle of the gradient becomes gray. This is because the two colors are equal distances from the gray in the color wheel. In this instance the two colors have equal intensity. It's impossible to avoid the gray dead zone in linear gradients when using colors that are equal distances from gray on the color wheel. But this can be avoided by using colors that are not equal distances from gray. Using colors that are not equal distances from gray can produce some interesting results. But it may not be appropriate for some designs. In this instance, a radial gradient may be a more appropriate solution, as shown in the example below. While radial gradients can help avoid the gray dead zone, there are times when linear gradients are required. In these instances developers may want to explore some other methods. One option is to use a gradient generator that produces a series of gradients based on the color inputs. In the example below a series of gradients has been used to avoid the gray dead zone. The example below shows another option that developers can use to avoid the gray dead zone. This option uses the pseudo element:before to create a gradient with a slight vertical angle. In the example below a series of gradients has been used to avoid the gray dead zone.

"Zoox recently published a video showing its autonomous system driving for an hour in downtown San Francisco. The video is available in the article. A safety driver was behind the wheel, but Zoox says it was on a regular urban route and the driver didn't have to intervene at any point. The company is one of many in the race to build self-driving cars, and the video shows that it's making solid progress. Zoox is pursuing a different kind of self-driving car, though. Zoox wants to design a full autonomous vehicle from scratch. Instead of retrofitting an existing vehicle with sensors and cameras, the startup is building a new vehicle that's designed for self-driving from the ground up. The company plans to manufacture its own vehicles with a customized powertrain, a full set of sensors, a new body design, etc. In particular, the vehicle features a steering wheel that can come down or retract into the dashboard. For a regular car, this would be useless, but for a fully autonomous vehicle, it's a good way to switch between autonomous driving and manual driving. As you can see in the video, Zoox isn't done yet. The company is still working on its design and a lot of things need to be improved. But this should give you an idea of the startup's vision and know how it will be different from other self-driving cars. Waymo, Cruise, GM and others are working on self-driving cars using existing car designs. Tesla and its Autopilot features also fall in that category, although Tesla is developing its own self-driving software. But there are also other companies working on self-driving vehicles. Nuro, for instance, is a startup working on a self-driving delivery vehicle. With Zoox's approach, you can imagine that the startup will either be a car manufacturer or will partner with existing car manufacturers. The company has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and is now valued at 3.2 billion.",0,143

"While plants might look like peaceful, passive victims of the world, they actually spend a lot of energy fighting to stay alive. When an insect bites a leaf, the leaf releases chemicals to summon insect-eating insects. When an animal chews on a stem, the stem releases hormones that cause the plant to generate defensive compounds. And, according to research published this week in Science, plants can even recognize the vibrations of a specific insect - and respond with chemical defenses. The discovery is the latest in a series of experiments that reveal plants can sense the world in surprisingly complex ways. When scientists first started studying plant senses in the 1970s, they didn't think plants could sense anything at all. Then, researchers began finding evidence of light sensitivity, and they realized that plants use light to guide their growth. Then, they found plants can sense touch, and use it to figure out which way is up and which way is down. After that, they found that plants can sense gravity, and use it to determine up and down, too. After that, researchers discovered that plants can sense moisture and dryness. They found they could even sense animals approaching. And, in recent years, researchers have found that plants can sense and respond to sounds. All of these discoveries have been surprising, but perhaps none so surprising as the one made by Heidi Appel, a chemical ecologist at the University of Missouri, and Rex Cocroft, an entomologist also at the University of Missouri. The pair studies how plants respond to insect attacks, and in the course of that research, they found that plants can even sense vibrations - specifically, the vibrations caused when a caterpillar is chewing on it. The experiment that led to the discovery started with a European species of plant called Arabidopsis. ""It's like the fruit fly of the plant world,"" says Appel. ""Everybody works on it."" Appel and Cocroft planted Arabidopsis in pots and then broadcast the feeding vibrations of caterpillars through the soil of some of the pots and not others. When they later exposed the plants to caterpillars, they found that the plants that had been exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils - a chemical that is toxic to many insects - than the plants that hadn't been exposed to feeding vibrations. Next, they took a closer look at how the plants were responding to the vibrations. They covered some of the plants' leaves in little speakers and others in little earplugs. The plants with earplugs didn't change their mustard oil production at all when they were attacked by caterpillars. The plants with speakers, on the other hand, produced much more mustard oil when they were attacked. These results suggest that the plants were indeed sensing the vibrations of caterpillars chewing on them and producing more mustard oils in response. It's not yet clear exactly how the plants are sensing the vibrations, but Appel and Cocroft believe tiny particles called nanovibrations, which exist throughout the plant's structure, are responsible. Appel and Cocroft don't yet know why plants evolved this ability, but they think that it might help the plants save their chemical defenses for when they're most needed. If a plant produces chemical defenses indiscriminately, it uses up a lot of energy that it could otherwise spend on growing. If the plant waits until it's actually being attacked to start producing those chemicals, it doesn't waste as much energy. ""It's an efficient, smart way to use those chemicals,"" says Appel. This study adds to our growing understanding that plants are not passive green things, but dynamic and complex organisms that interact with their environment in interesting ways. Plants can sense and respond to the world around them, and that means they're more like animals than we ever knew.",0,146
"A new pill has been developed that could replace the need for external injections. The pill was developed to replace the need to inject insulin externally by deploying a spring-loaded mechanism to inject the insulin when it reaches the stomach. The insulin pill, when ingested, is delivered to the stomach by a tiny capsule. The capsule contains a compressed spring, which is held in place by a disk made of sugar. Once the capsule reaches the stomach, water in the stomach dissolves the sugar disk, and the spring is released, injecting the insulin into the wall of the stomach. The research was conducted by MIT, in collaboration with scientists from Novo Nordisk. The researchers hope to see the pill made available on the market within the next six years. ""We are really hopeful that this new type of capsule could someday help diabetic patients and perhaps anyone who requires therapies that can now only be given by injection or infusion,"" said Robert Langer, a chemical engineer at MIT. Because the pill only uses a sugar disk to trigger the injection, it can be adapted to carry any type of drug. This makes the pill not only revolutionary, but incredibly versatile.",0,147

"I was looking around for a good React component library to use for the TLDR website, when I stumbled upon this excellent curated list. It has a fairly comprehensive list of component libraries that you can choose from. I chose Ant design as it is an official library by Alibaba, and also because it is the most popular design system library on Github with over 100,000 stars. I had been using Jest for testing my React components, but since Ant design provides end-to-end tests, I thought I might give Enzyme a try. I haven't really used Enzyme before, so I was pleasantly surprised by how simple the API is. It lets you manipulate a component as if it was real HTML. It is built on top of the React test utilities so that it only interacts with the component, and not the DOM. This is the same basic setup as what I had for testing Jest. The only difference is that the test name is prefixed by test, and we also use mount and shallow instead of create and render. Using Enzyme to manipulate a component is easy, and the API is similar to React's own createElement. As you can see, you simply provide a list of attributes as a JSX object. This is probably because Enzyme internally renders the component that you want to mount, and then attaches the attribute props to it. You can also use the mount method to mount the component to the DOM so that you can query for DOM nodes. You can also use the shallow method to mount a component, but this will not attach the component to the DOM, and the children will not be rendered. Enzyme also provides a few utility methods that let you query for DOM nodes within the component that you mounted. For more information, refer to the Enzyme docs.",0,151
"This library contains tools, methodologies, and resources for integrating security throughout the entire IT lifecycle. In a DevSecOps Model, security is integrated as early as possible in the lifecycle of a project, to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance the security of the system. The basic principle of the DevSecOps approach is to integrate security activities into the everyday work of a team. The objective is to ensure that each team member is responsible for incorporating security into their work, and that no single person is considered to be the expert in security. The DevSecOps approach focuses on building teams with shared responsibility, fostering a mindset in which all team members think about security and ensure that it is an integral part of the software development process. In the DevSecOps approach, the security specialist no longer has the sole responsibility of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities. Instead, the entire team works together to identify and fix vulnerabilities. The DevSecOps approach is supported by a number of tools and methodologies that are described in this library. A number of tools and methodologies are available to support the DevSecOps approach. These tools and methodologies are described below. The security of a system is impacted by the security of the underlying components of the system. The use of components with known vulnerabilities can increase the attack surface of the system, and make it more vulnerable to attack. Organizations should have a process in place to ensure that they are using components with known vulnerabilities in a safe way. The use of a software composition analysis (SCA) tool can provide insight into the components in use, and can identify components with known vulnerabilities. The use of a component vulnerability management tool can provide insight into the vulnerabilities of a component, and how the vulnerabilities can be fixed.

""So finding it on Titan is very interesting and helps give us a better understanding of the chemical processes going on in this very cold atmosphere."" The molecule is an isomer of propene, which is a common molecule that's used in industrial processes. Propene is also known as propylene. The new discovery is exciting because it helps expand our understanding of the chemical reactions that can take place in atmospheres. The molecule is very simple but because of the cold temperatures on Titan, it's not very reactive. The researchers believe that the molecule is the result of two separate reactions. In the first, vinylacetylene reacts with other hydrocarbons to form a three-carbon chain, which is then transformed into the cyclopropenylidene. Titan is about as far from the sun as the orbit of Mars. It's known for having a thick nitrogen atmosphere that may resemble the early Earth's atmosphere. Although this is a small step in understanding Titan, it may help scientists uncover new details about the moon's atmospheric conditions and how it might be possible to detect life. Titan is not the only place where NASA scientists have been looking for cyclopropenylidene. They've also looked for it in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn and found no signs of it. The finding was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",0,154
"Scientists can manipulate dreams using an app combined with a sleep-tracking device called Dormio. In a recent study, the researchers inserted certain topics into a person's dreams using the technique. The dream manipulation method works by detecting the sleep patterns of a person using the Dormio. The sleep-tracking device sends a smartphone app a signal when the person is in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. When the Dormio detects that a person is dreaming, the app plays sounds that match the content of the dream. For example, if a person is dreaming about running on a beach, the app plays the sound of the waves. The app only plays the sounds when the person is in the REM stage of sleep. The Dormio is able to differentiate between sleep stages by using a technique called actigraphy. Actigraphy can detect the changes in the movements of a person as they sleep. It can detect when a person is tossing and turning, or if they are in a deep sleep. The REM stage is when dreaming occurs, but it only lasts 20 minutes or so. This is why the sounds need to be played at the right time. The researchers tested their technique in a lab by playing the sounds from a smartphone app. They also tested it by playing the sounds from a bedside lamp. The dream manipulation method was able to influence the dreams of 96 percent of the participants. In the study, the researchers divided the participants into two groups. One group had the app play sounds related to the content of the dream. The other group had the app play sounds unrelated to the dream. For example, if the person was dreaming about a dog, the researchers had the app play a dog barking sound. If the person was dreaming about a car crash, the app played the sound of a car crash. After the participants woke up, the researchers asked them to write down the content of their dreams. The study found that the dream manipulation technique had more success in influencing the dreams of the group that had the app play sounds related to the content of the dream. The researchers then asked the participants to explain how the sounds they heard during their dreams had affected their dreams. The researchers found that the dream manipulation technique had a better chance of affecting the dreams of people who were familiar with the sounds they heard while they were dreaming. The study was published in the journal Neuron on Dec. 14.",0,155
"The advertising industry is turning to technology that can seamlessly insert computer-generated images, so items can be digitally added to almost any movie or TV show. UK advertising business Mirriad has signed a number of agreements with content producers for its In-Video product, which can subtly add images into video content. Mirriad's In-Video product has been used in the past to add billboards to a car chase in the 2006 movie ""Miami Vice."" Mirriad's In-Video product has been used in the past to add billboards to a car chase in the 2006 movie ""Miami Vice."" The company said it has now signed agreements with many of the world's top television and film studios, including Paramount, Sony, NBC Universal and DreamWorks. ""We can put a brand into a piece of content in a way that is completely seamless and actually looks as though it is part of the content. It doesn't look like an advertisement,"" said Mark Popkiewicz, Mirriad's CEO. The In-Video product is a three-step process. First, a computer-generated image, or CGI, is created of an advertiser's product. The image is then processed to look as though it fits in with the background of a chosen film or television show. ""We process the image to make it look like it's shot under the lighting conditions that exist in the footage,"" said Popkiewicz. ""We make it look like it is in focus under those lighting conditions, and then we make it look like it's shot with the same lens, and therefore it looks like it's there."" Once the image is ready, Mirriad uses a ""smart rendering engine"" to insert the product into the chosen video clip. ""It's a piece of software that knows how to recognize the content, and how to track the background that it is going to render the image onto,"" said Popkiewicz. The software can be used to add images to films or TV shows that have already been broadcast, or to add images to pre-recorded material that will be broadcast in the future. Popkiewicz said that inserting an image usually takes between 10 and 20 hours, and the end result is a digital file that contains the inserted image. ""In the case of a pre-recorded show, the broadcaster would take our digital file and insert it into the version they are going to broadcast,"" he said. ""In the case of a live broadcast, we actually feed the digital file into the broadcast chain at the time of the live broadcast."" Popkiewicz said that the image can be added without disrupting the broadcast signal, and that there is no need to change the advertising slots that are shown around the broadcast. ""We are giving you another opportunity to advertise that doesn't displace anything. That means we are giving you more money and you're not losing anything,"" he said. However, advertisers will have to pay more money to get their products inserted into films or TV shows. ""If you are buying a spot during the Super Bowl, it is very expensive, but the value of that spot is high,"" said Popkiewicz. ""The value of what we do is a lot higher, so it costs a lot more."" Mirriad has already been used by Coca-Cola and Diet Coke, which had its products inserted into the 2006 movie ""Miami Vice."" Mirriad has also worked with BMW and Smirnoff, and Popkiewicz said that the company is negotiating with a number of other brands. Popkiewicz believes that the future of advertising is set to change, as advertisers look to get their products inserted into films and TV shows. ""It's a fundamental shift in the way people think about advertising and the way people think about the way they consume content,"" he said.",0,156
"Nvidia has used a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create a neural network that can generate an unlimited number of high-quality, realistic faces. A GAN works by having one network generate images based on a training set of images and then a second network criticizes those generated images. This process iterates with the first network getting better and better at generating images that the second network has a hard time telling from the real thing. The results of the process are impressive. You can see many of the faces generated by the GAN at This Person Does Not Exist. The team behind the project even held a ""hallucinating faces"" competition on Kaggle to see who could best predict which images were fake and which were real. The winning algorithm managed to correctly identify images only 53 of the time. This entry was posted in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Network, Nvidia.

"Physicists from the University of Iowa have discovered a new type of aurora in a nearly two-decade-old video. Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras that appears to rotate. NASA has just released a series of images of a new type of aurora that's been discovered on the planet Saturn. Saturn's auroras are caused by the planet's magnetic field interacting with the solar wind. As the aurora season comes into full swing, so too will the research of scientists from the University of Iowa, who are studying the effect of solar winds on the aurora borealis. Scientists are beginning to study a new type of aurora discovered in Antarctica last year. Researchers have discovered that the diffuse auroras are caused by a concentration of electrons coming from space. A new study from the University of Colorado at Boulder shows that while the Northern Lights may be beautiful to look at, they also have a major impact on the ionosphere and Earth's magnetic field. Laboratory experiments have revealed the mechanisms behind the formation of the strange ""screaming"" sound that is created by the interaction of two colliding magnetized plasma flows.",0,160
"In Part 1, when comparing the uses of Kafka vs MQTT, we concluded that in a basic publish-and-subscribe model of an IoT device, Kafka might be overkill. However, we also found that there are many use cases where Kafka is the right tool. In this post, I'll discuss the types of message broker that we use in our IoT architecture and also how to design a scalable IoT architecture. In Part 1 of this series, I discussed the use of the publish-subscribe model as a pattern for implementing an IoT application. This approach has the advantage of being simple, easy to understand, and easy to implement. But there are limitations. In this post, I'll discuss using MQTT vs Kafka as an IoT message broker. A few months ago, I introduced Apache Kafka to our IoT architecture. Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system for handling massive amounts of data. It's a great tool for processing real-time data streams, and it has become the de facto standard for building streaming platforms. In this article, I'll describe the architectural role of Kafka, how it fits into the overall IoT architecture, and the benefits that it brings to our IoT stack. In my previous posts, I introduced Apache Kafka and the use of the publish-subscribe model as a pattern for implementing an IoT application. In this article, I'll cover the basics of the Apache Kafka API and its use in our IoT architecture. We're using Kafka as a backbone of our IoT architecture, and the Kafka API is a key component in our IoT platform.

"France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, since the carrier would use nuclear energy to power its propulsion system and electrical generators. The ship, to be named the PA 2 (Porte-avions 2 or ""aircraft carrier 2 will be used to launch jets and drones, according to The National Interest. France also plans to equip it with F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically on the carrier. The French government is reportedly eyeing the design of the US Navy's Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. The new ship will reportedly feature a nuclear reactor capable of producing 200 megawatts of electricity. The Charles de Gaulle, by comparison, is powered by two 150-megawatt reactors. The decision to use nuclear propulsion is a controversial one, as it runs counter to Macron's goal of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. Nuclear power plants produce fewer greenhouse gases than traditional fossil fuel power plants, but France still has a history of nuclear disasters. The country has been the site of three nuclear accidents, including one in 1999, when an explosion at the Marcoule nuclear site killed one person and injured four. The Charles de Gaulle carrier is only capable of carrying 18 Rafale fighter jets, which is a small amount compared to the US Navy's aircraft carriers, which can carry around 60 planes. The French carrier also has a short flight deck, making it more difficult to launch and land planes. The PA 2's design will address this problem, as it will be able to launch more planes and will be equipped with a catapult, which will allow it to launch heavier aircraft like the F-35. France's Defense Minister, Florence Parly, told reporters last month that she wants to ""make the most of our investment"" in the F-35. ""It is not a question of following the United States, but of making sure that we are able to operate the carrier that we have as soon as possible,"" she said. France has already ordered 30 F-35 fighter jets. It is reportedly considering buying another 30 in the future.",0,163

"NASA's Parker Solar Probe has captured images of Venus' surface. Venus' surface is blocked by a thick atmosphere, which makes it hard to take pictures of. However, the surface is visible in infrared light. Parker Solar Probe, NASA's mission to ""touch"" the Sun, launched in August 2018. The probe's first target on its journey to the Sun was Venus. Parker Solar Probe captured images of Venus when it was just 27 million miles away. The probe is expected to come as close as 3.83 million miles to the Sun's surface. The probe will capture images of the Sun's corona in order to help scientists better understand the star. The Sun's corona is the part of the Sun that is visible during a solar eclipse. The Parker Solar Probe is also the only NASA mission to be named after a living person. Dr. Eugene Parker first theorized the solar wind in 1958. The solar wind is a flow of charged particles that escape the Sun's corona. The solar wind is the reason the Sun's corona is visible during a solar eclipse. The Parker Solar Probe will travel closer to the Sun than any other probe before. The probe will also travel faster than any other probe before. The Parker Solar Probe will be able to withstand temperatures of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The probe will also be able to withstand radiation levels thousands of times that of the Earth. The Parker Solar Probe will use seven Venus flybys to gain speed. The probe will eventually travel at a speed of 430,000 miles per hour. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the second brightest planet in the sky. Venus is a terrestrial planet. It has a thick atmosphere, but it does not have a magnetic field. Venus' atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, but it also contains sulfuric acid and traces of water. The atmosphere traps solar radiation, which heats the surface. Venus' surface is covered in volcanic rocks. Its surface also has many craters and has very few impact craters. The surface is very dry. Venus' surface is hot enough to melt lead. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 times that of Earth's. Venus has no natural satellites. However, Venus has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Soviet Union's Venera program. The first probe to land on Venus was the Soviet Union's Venera 7 in 1970. The United States' Mariner 2 spacecraft was the first to visit the planet in 1962. Parker Solar Probe will eventually make its first close approach of the Sun in November 2018.

Facebook is also creating a new tool to let people see all the current ads a Facebook page is running, even if they're not in the intended audience. A new study has found that the ""right to be forgotten"" laws that allow people to request that Google remove links to their personal information are not working as intended. The study, which was published by the University of Michigan's School of Information, analyzed 2.4 million URLs that people tried to get removed from Google searches of their names between 2014 and 2017. The study found that of the 291,000 requests that Google granted, only 43.3 of them were for personal information, and that 22.2 of the granted requests were for pages containing negative information about the requester. The researchers found that Google approved about 54 of the requests they received, while the other 46 were rejected. More than 3 million people have viewed the video, which shows a fake video chat with a purported Apple tech support rep. The scammers attempt to get the victim to download remote desktop software that lets them access the victim's computer. The video is a recreation of a real scam that YouTube star and tech reporter Dave Lee experienced when he was contacted by the scammers and agreed to record a video of the interaction. The scammers tried to trick Lee by saying that they were calling from Apple and could tell that he was having issues with his computer. The scammers told Lee that he needed to download software that would help them fix his computer, but he refused. Lee posted a video of the conversation to YouTube and the video has been viewed more than 1.8 million times. Four months after the story broke, Facebook has finally responded to the outcry over its Messenger Kids app that allows children as young as 6 to have their own social media account. Facebook says it's working on new tools that will give parents better control over who their children can interact with on the app, but it did not give a date for when the tools will be available. The tools will allow parents to specify that their child can only send and receive messages from parent-approved contacts. Parents can also remove a child's account at any time. Facebook has come under fire for not having adequate safeguards to prevent children from being bullied or harassed on the app. The app is aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 12, and the company says that it has designed it to be compliant with federal laws that limit the collection and use of data on children. A US senator is asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Snapchat is violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which limits the data that can be collected on children younger than 13. Snapchat says that its app is not intended for children younger than 13 and that it relies on parents to make sure that children aren't using its app. Snapchat says that it has no interest in collecting data on children and that it automatically deletes the data it collects on children every 30 days. YouTube has announced that it is planning to launch a new app for kids on Feb. 23 that will feature child-appropriate videos and channels.

"This article discusses WebAssembly and its possible future applications. WebAssembly is an intermediate layer between various programming languages and many different execution environments. It can be used to run code written in C, Rust, Ruby, Python or any other language. The WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode that is intended to run at near-native speed and enable the development of large-scale applications on the Web. It is a compact binary format that can be executed at near-native speed by a JavaScript engine, in a WebAssembly-enabled browser, or elsewhere. The WebAssembly aims to deliver a binary format for executable code that is portable, secure, and efficient to parse and execute. For WebAssembly, it is also important to not break the Web. The WebAssembly is designed to be able to run in any modern Web browser or engine. The performance should be near that of native code. This will enable execution on resource-constrained devices, and it will be easy to integrate with existing native code. For developers, the WebAssembly will be easy to use. It should be easy to compile existing code to WebAssembly. It should also be easy to embed WebAssembly modules into existing development workflows. The WebAssembly is designed to fit well with existing build systems, which makes it easy to integrate WebAssembly modules into existing applications. For the Web, it is important that the WebAssembly modules can be integrated with JavaScript and HTML applications. It is also important that WebAssembly modules are easy to distribute over the Web and can be safely downloaded and run. The WebAssembly makes it possible to compile code written in any language into a single format. This means that all programmers can use the WebAssembly to compile their code to the WebAssembly bytecode, and then run it in any WebAssembly-enabled browser or engine. The WebAssembly makes it possible to write large, complex applications in one language and then use WebAssembly as a compilation target. For example, it will be possible to write a large library in C or Rust, and compile it to WebAssembly. This library can then be used from JavaScript or any other language. The WebAssembly will also enable new use cases that are not possible with JavaScript. The WebAssembly will be able to run code that is written in many different languages. The WebAssembly provides a single compilation target for languages such as C, C, SystemC, and Rust. Developers will be able to compile their code to WebAssembly and then run it in a WebAssembly-enabled browser or engine. The WebAssembly will also be able to compile and run JavaScript code. This is useful when the JavaScript engine does not understand some of the JavaScript constructs, and it will be possible to compile such JavaScript to WebAssembly. The WebAssembly is designed to be small and efficient. The goal is for WebAssembly modules to be 20-50 smaller than the equivalent JavaScript code. The WebAssembly also has to be easy to parse, and the goal is that a WebAssembly parser should be a few hundred lines of C code. The WebAssembly is designed to run at near-native speed. In particular, the goal is that a WebAssembly module should execute at the speed of a native executable. This means that most programs should run about as fast as a native executable. This also means that WebAssembly modules should not be significantly faster or slower than native code. The WebAssembly should be easy to compile from existing languages. It should be possible to compile a large program into a single WebAssembly module, so that it is easy to distribute the WebAssembly module. It should also be possible to compile small WebAssembly modules, and it should be easy to link WebAssembly modules together. To achieve these goals, the WebAssembly has to have a small and simple instruction set. This makes the WebAssembly easier to compile to and parse. It is also important to have a small, fast and efficient text format. The WebAssembly text format is designed to be very simple, making it easy to parse and generate. WebAssembly is a new language that has been designed to be small and efficient. It has been developed as a collaboration between Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple. The WebAssembly is designed to be a compilation target for many different languages. WebAssembly code is compiled to a low-level bytecode, which is then executed inside a browser. The WebAssembly is designed to run at near-native speeds. This means that WebAssembly code should run as fast as native code. The WebAssembly is also designed to be easy to parse and generate. This means that a WebAssembly parser should be a few hundred lines of code. The WebAssembly is a bytecode format, which means that it does not have a textual form. The WebAssembly code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree, which is then converted into the WebAssembly bytecode. WebAssembly modules are distributed as text files, which can then be",0,168

The agreement will also see Bakkt use MasterCard's blockchain-based payment platform to make payments on the Bakkt network. Bakkt is a crypto-based venture run by ICE, the firm that owns the New York Stock Exchange. It is aimed at large-scale corporate customers and will not allow margin trading or short selling. The platform has secured the backing of Microsoft, Starbucks, Boston Consulting Group and others and is set to launch later this year. The move comes as fintech firms are increasingly recognising the value of using digital currencies to power payments and transactions. They are finding ways to use the blockchain technology that underpins most cryptocurrencies to power global transactions that are fast, low cost and secure. In another sign of the growing interest in crypto, Visa has announced a partnership with crypto firm Anchorage to make digital assets available to Visa's partner banks. The aim is to make the use of crypto payments easier for large firms and institutional investors. The partnership will see Anchorage handle custodial duties for crypto held by institutional investors and manage on-boarding and interactions with Visa's banking partners. Anchorage will offer its digital asset custody services for crypto investments held at Visa. Bakkt is also making moves to provide crypto custody services for corporate clients. It has acquired Digital Asset Custody Company, a New York-based crypto custodian, to bolster its security capabilities. The deal will allow Bakkt to provide crypto custody services that comply with regulations laid down by the New York Department of Financial Services. The platform will also offer crypto insurance to cover any loss or theft of assets. The move follows the announcement that Fidelity Investments, one of the world's largest asset managers, will offer cryptocurrency custody services to institutional clients, including large corporations. Earlier this year, crypto exchange Coinbase announced a partnership with US insurance company Aon to provide crypto insurance for its hot wallet. Aon is one of the world's largest insurance brokers. Crypto custody is an important part of the crypto ecosystem and is a key step towards wider use of digital assets by large companies and consumers. It offers security and protection and will be critical as crypto payments and transactions grow in scale. The moves by Bakkt and Visa show the growing momentum behind crypto and the increasing interest among large financial institutions. As digital assets grow in scale and use, there will be more demand for secure custodial solutions. Adoption of crypto is still at an early stage and it is unlikely to make a significant impact on the payments market for some time. However, the moves by MasterCard, Visa and others show that the world's financial giants are preparing for an age of crypto.",0,169
"Researchers from Columbia University have established a method for growing human hair in a dish using 3D printing without the need for implantation into human skin. The method uses a bioprinting method that rapidly produces human hair in a dish using stem cells. Currently, researchers use 2D systems to produce hair follicles, which is a slow process. This new method will allow researchers to more quickly and effectively study hair-growth disorders and even test treatments for hair loss. Read more about the study at:",0,170
"Scientists from the University of Southern California were able to visualize memories forming in the brains of genetically modified zebrafish in the lab. The team expected the brains to form a memory by laying down new proteins at the synapses, or connections between neurons. But instead, they found that the fish brains reused proteins from other parts of the brain. When you have a new experience, your brain encodes a memory of it by altering the connections between neurons. This requires turning certain genes on in those neurons. Many of these genes make proteins that alter the junctions between neurons, called synapses. In the study, the team trained zebrafish to fear a particular stimulus. They expected the fish to form a memory of the fear by increasing production of proteins at synapses. But instead, they saw that the fish brains reused proteins from other parts of the brain and transported them to the synapses. The team also found that this process is regulated by the BDNF gene, which has been linked to autism and Alzheimer's. These findings suggest that scientists may be able to identify the brain cells that store memories by looking for cells that carry this BDNF gene.",0,171

"Reddit Talk is a new social audio product that allows subreddit moderators to start Clubhouse-like Talks. While moderators will have control over who can speak in the sessions, anybody on Reddit can listen in on the talks and comment on them. For now, Reddit is choosing moderators to try Reddit Talk. They'll be able to invite members of the subreddit to participate in the test, and both moderators and members will be able to host and join sessions on iOS, Android and the web. However, Reddit plans to eventually launch a mobile app that will allow any Reddit user to host and join Reddit Talk sessions. The launch of Reddit Talk comes at an interesting time for the company, which raised 300 million in a funding round led by Chinese crypto company Tencent last month. Following that round, Reddit became a 3 billion company, and it's likely that the company wants to find new ways to make money. Reddit has tested a number of monetization strategies in the past. A few years ago, Reddit introduced sponsored posts as a new ad product and then tested native video ads. But Reddit also shut down its video efforts last year. The company will have to be careful about how it introduces Reddit Talk to the public. In the past, Reddit users have been very critical of the company when it made changes to Reddit's design, as they are very protective of their own communities. Reddit will have to find a way to monetize without alienating its users. Reddit, which is one of the top 10 most visited websites in the U.S., has been focused on growing its audience and increasing engagement over the last couple years. Last year, Reddit launched a dedicated news site called Upvoted, which was shut down last year.

"England's Chester Zoo and a tissue bank called Nature's SAFE have partnered up to cryogenically freeze genetic material from animals that pass away at the zoo. The preserved material could one day be used to clone endangered species. The Chester Zoo has been freezing animal tissue for two years. The material is stored in a nitrogen-cooled tank and can be preserved for hundreds of years. So far, the zoo has stored material from more than 100 species. The genetic material is collected from animals that have died from natural causes, like old age, as well as those that have been euthanized, usually because of illness. Chester Zoo's Dr. Nick Davis, who is the zoo's director of conservation and science, said it's ""a bit like saving money in the bank."" ""The idea is to try and preserve as many different species as possible,"" he said. ""We're very keen to do our best to preserve the genetics of a species that we can't preserve the animal itself."" Davis believes that cloning may one day be a conservation tool to help repopulate species that have become endangered. ""I think it's a really exciting opportunity to help safeguard the future of endangered species,"" he said. But he added that the zoo doesn't advocate cloning for reasons other than conservation. ""I don't think that cloning is a sensible way of producing a healthy, successful animal,"" he said. ""It's not an exact science by any means, so you have to have very good reasons and you have to be very confident that you're doing it for the right reasons.""",0,181

"The Perturb-seq map is the first comprehensive functional map of genes that are expressed in human cells. The data is available for any scientist to use. It allows scientists to ask a broad range of questions about which genes are turned on in different types of cells, tissues, and organs. The map is based on sequencing of the RNA found in each of 245 different types of cells and tissues, and is generated using a method called Perturb-seq. It provides a reference point for researchers to ask questions such as ""What pathways are turned on in this cancer?"" or ""What genes do these neurons express?."" The Perturb-seq map also allows scientists to see whether certain gene-editing methods are effective. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 is a method to edit genomes that has been a major breakthrough in recent years. However, some researchers have suggested that it could be ineffective in some cases, due to the presence of so-called 'off-target' effects that might disrupt other genes. By comparing the data produced by Perturb-seq to the changes in the genome made by the CRISPR-Cas9 method, the team could check whether off-target effects really do occur. Another use of the map is to examine how genes are turned on and off during the process of cell division. The map shows which genes are expressed in each of the different phases of the cell cycle, and how they change as cells divide. ""The Perturb-seq map is a powerful resource for researchers around the world, and should help us to understand how our genes are regulated, and how mutations can lead to disease,"" says Dr Nicholas Luscombe, Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute and joint corresponding author of the paper.",0,183
"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful testing. Uber's mobile teams used to communicate with each other about what features were being worked on, what had been implemented, and which bugs had been fixed, but this process wasn't ideal. The web team, for example, has to ask the iOS and Android teams for a status update, and they have to rely on the mobile teams' responses to determine their own workloads. Uber Engineering needed a system for the web team to obtain information on iOS and Android feature progress, and this is where JIRA and JIRA Agile came in. JIRA Agile is a tool for managing agile development efforts, and it's a component of JIRA Core. Uber Engineering used JIRA Agile to add web-only features, as well as to modify the existing iOS and Android stories in JIRA Core, which meant that the web team could access the same stories as the mobile teams. JIRA Agile has two-way sync with JIRA Core, so the mobile teams were still able to view the original iOS and Android stories, even if they were modified in JIRA Agile. Uber Engineering chose to use JIRA Agile boards in Confluence, which meant that the web team could easily access stories in JIRA Agile without having to sign into JIRA. They could also view the epics for each feature, and they could see dependencies between stories and epics. Using JIRA and JIRA Agile to coordinate feature development has led to a more efficient and streamlined process. The web team no longer has to ask the mobile teams for status updates, and they have more control over their workloads. The mobile teams also benefit because the web team can modify stories in JIRA Agile without having to ask the mobile teams for changes.",0,184
"Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for an attack that caused fires at a major oil processing facility and nearby oil field in Saudi Arabia. 10 drones were involved in the attack, a Houthi spokesman said. Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for an attack that caused fires at a major oil processing facility and nearby oil field in Saudi Arabia. 10 drones were involved in the attack, a Houthi spokesman said. Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for an attack on a Saudi oil facility that sparked a fire at a major processing plant and oil field in the kingdom's Eastern Province. Saudi officials said the blaze was contained and that no workers were injured. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul Salam wrote on Twitter that the rebels had launched 10 drones against the oil facility, adding that attacks ""resumed"" on Saturday. It was not immediately possible to independently verify the Houthi claims, but the rebels have been known to use drones in the past. The state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted the energy minister as saying that ""at 4:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) the pumping station in Samitah"" in Riyadh region ""was attacked by ... drones which resulted in a fire."" The minister, Khalid al-Falih, said that the fires were quickly contained, no employees were injured and production and export of crude oil and gas were not affected. The fires broke out at two plants in Buqyaq and the Khurais oil field, both owned by the Saudi oil giant Aramco, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. Aramco has not yet issued any comment on the fires. The pre-dawn attacks on Saturday follow reports of sabotage against oil tankers off the United Arab Emirates coast on Sunday. Four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, were targeted in the attacks. The attacks came against a backdrop of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. Washington has warned Iran against attacking U.S. interests or face a ""swift and decisive"" response. Aramco's Abqaiq oil processing plant, located 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Dammam in the kingdom's Eastern Province, is the world's largest crude stabilization facility. It processes sour crude oil into sweet crude that is then transported onto transshipment points on the Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it has the capacity to process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Germany has a refining capacity of just 0.2 million barrels. It is situated close to the Khurais oil field, which has estimated reserves of 20 billion barrels of oil and is considered to be one of the country's biggest. In 2006, an al Qaeda-claimed attack on the oil facility in Abqaiq saw militants attempt to storm the plant. The attack was repelled, but the incident highlighted the vulnerability of the country's oil infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil producer and a close U.S. ally, has been at war against the Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen since March 2015. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of training and arming the Houthi rebels, a charge denied by Tehran. The Yemeni conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who have been at odds with each other for decades. cwrt (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",0,185
"Ice cream develops a crunchy texture if left out of the freezer for too long due to overly large ice crystals. Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a new process that makes it possible to create ice cream that stays creamy and soft for longer. The scientists discovered that exposing ice cream mix to a high pressure environment results in smaller ice crystals. Small ice crystals mean the ice cream remains creamy and soft, even if it has been stored at room temperature for some time. The process involves forcing the mix through a high-pressure nozzle and cooling it very quickly. This stops the ice crystals from forming. The ice cream can then be stored at low temperatures. The results are promising: the new technique makes it possible to store the ice cream for 2 to 3 months at -5 C (23 F) and for one month at -18 C (0 F). The new technique is still being tested and could come to market in the near future.

"Earth Day's 50th anniversary is on April 22. Originally, events were planned for the big day, but the movement has now been forced online. Organizers have planned a three-day live-streamed festival starting on April 19. There are no scheduled events in Spokane. Our most pressing environmental concerns are climate change and the proliferation of single-use plastics, such as bottles and straws. In Spokane, we've made strides in recycling and waste reduction, as well as the promotion of renewable energy. In 2017, the City Council adopted the Greenprint Plan, which details how the city should prioritize sustainability and conservation. In 2018, the city adopted a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And in 2019, the city plans to pass its Climate Action Plan, which will bring the city in line with the goals set in the Paris Climate Agreement. Many businesses and organizations are making their own commitments to sustainability and conservation. There's a local group working to ban single-use plastics, and they're also organizing a cleanup of the Spokane River. The local chapter of the Surfrider Foundation is organizing a beach cleanup. The city and others are also working to make Spokane more sustainable. Earth Day was founded in 1970 by Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord Nelson. In a statement on the first Earth Day, Nelson called on the nation to take action to preserve and protect the environment.

"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two of the most notable features that the company is exploring are an inward fold and a vertically foldable phone. Both designs were found in a patent filed by Samsung back in April of 2017. In the filing, they show a phone with an outward fold and a phone with a vertically foldable phone. The outward fold, as you can imagine, folds outward, much like the current Galaxy Fold. The outward fold seems to be very similar to the current Galaxy Fold, just a bit smaller and more compact. The vertically foldable phone is a bit different. It looks like a normal phone with a regular screen on the front. When it is unfolded, the hinge is in the middle, and the screens are on both sides of the hinge. This design could be good for a phone with two screens, a gaming phone, or a phone with two different views. Both of these concepts are just ideas for now, but we could see these folds on a Samsung phone in the near future. Source: GalaxyClub via 9to5Google",0,194
"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is set to launch on Halloween this year, after decades of careful planning and development. It will travel from Earth to a gravitational eddy point called L2, where it will spend its days orbiting the sun. The JWST will observe the infrared universe, and astronomers are especially excited for its observations of exoplanets and the first galaxies. But it's not only the science that astronomers and engineers are looking forward to. The JWST has faced a long and challenging road to launch, and the anticipation of finally seeing it in orbit is palpable. The JWST has been in the works since 1996, when NASA and the European Space Agency first started talking about a new space telescope. The project kicked off with a ""Phase A"" study in 2000, and Phase B, which included preliminary design, started in 2002. The design was finished and approved in 2004, and Phase C, or development, started in 2007. Since then, it's been a long and challenging journey to the launch pad, but the JWST has been in its final assembly and testing phase (Phase D) since 2015. The JWST passed a key milestone in September of 2017, when the telescope and its instruments completed cryogenic vacuum testing. This test ensures that the telescope and its instruments work in the chilly, vacuum-like conditions of space. The JWST will need to keep cool to properly observe the infrared universe, and the recent test is a key step toward making that happen. But the JWST still needs to pass one more major milestone before it launches. The telescope needs to be folded up and loaded inside its rocket fairing. The JWST is much larger than a rocket fairing, so it needs to be folded up like a giant origami crane. It will take months to unfold it once it reaches orbit. The JWST is so large that it needs to be shipped from California to French Guiana on a huge cargo plane. That trip starts on January 20th. It's set to launch on October 31st, 2018. Once the JWST is in space, it will need to be deployed from the Ariane 5 rocket. It will need to unfurled, and then slowly moved into position at L2. That entire process will take about six months, and the JWST will begin science operations about six months after that. In the meantime, astronomers are busy getting ready for the flood of data that will come once the JWST starts collecting light. Astronomers are working on ""Delivery Plans"" that will describe how the telescope will be used over its first five years. These plans include specific requests for observations by astronomers, and they'll be used to schedule the JWST's work over the next five years. The JWST will be a hugely important telescope for astronomy, and it's an important part of the scientific community. The JWST will tell us more about the history of the universe, and it will help us understand how planets form around other stars.",0,195
"Gridsort sorts data by storing it in a simplified binary cube, which offers excellent cache utilization. It is a simplified implementation of cubesort. Benchmarks and visualizations are available. Sort the array in place. Returns a new, sorted array. Generates the grid for this number of elements. Sets the elements of the grid. Sets the elements of the grid. The size of the grid must be predefined by gridgridsize. Sorts the array in place. It is faster to use sort instead. Returns a new, sorted array. It is faster to use sort instead. Performance on an average PC (Intel i5 3570K 3.40 GHz 4, 8 Gb RAM, Windows 8.1 64-bit). Gridsort sorts data by storing it in a simplified binary cube. As the data is sorted, the cube is built up to represent the data. The binary cube is a simplified cube, that is, the number of bits in the x, y and z axis of the cube are not necessarily the same. The number of bits in each axis are the nearest power of 2 which is less than or equal to the length of the corresponding array. This results in very good cache utilization. The code below implements Gridsort, which is a simplified version of CubeSort. Both implement the same algorithm, but the implementation of Gridsort is faster, simpler, and easier to understand. Gridsort is a simplification of CubeSort and the code below is similar to the implementation of CubeSort. The grid size is a power of two, which is why we use the bitwise operators. The size of the grid is predefined, so we can use a single malloc call to allocate the memory. The size of the grid is the number of elements in the array (size) multiplied by the number of bits in each axis of the cube (gridgridsize). Note that the rows in the cube are stored from the most significant bits to the least significant bits. The grid is represented as a 3-dimensional array. For example, the 1st row of the cube contains the most significant bits of all the elements in the array. The 2nd row contains the 2nd most significant bits, and so on. The elements in the array are stored in the rows of the cube as an array of arrays of arrays. The grid[xy] is an array of z elements. For example, the 1st element of the array is stored as grid[000]. The following code sets the elements of the array in the grid. The element to be sorted is set in the grid. The grid is traversed, looking for the smallest element. The element is moved to the correct place in the grid. The grid is traversed, looking for the smallest element. The element is moved to the correct place in the grid. If we find an empty slot in the grid (grid[xyz] NULL), we fill it with the element we are moving. A full grid (grid[xyz] NULL) means that the corresponding row is full. The row is moved to the correct position in the sorted array. We repeat the process until the grid is empty. A full grid (grid[xyz] NULL) means that the corresponding row is full. The row is moved to the correct position in the sorted array. We repeat the process until the grid is empty.",0,196

"Clocking into work every day can result in a vague sense of dissatisfaction when the work doesn't seem meaningful. This article discusses four different ways to ignite motivation for work. How can you keep your team motivated and productive? Do you feel your work has meaning and purpose? Are you satisfied with your work? Is your job just a job or is it something you love to do? These questions are important to explore. It is difficult to enjoy life if you are not happy with your career. It is very common for many people to be dissatisfied with their job. According to a Gallup survey, 70 percent of people are disengaged at work. The Society for Human Resource Management reported that employee engagement in 2017 was at 32 percent, a significant decrease from 33 percent in 2016. A survey by the SHRM in 2015 found that 68 percent of people are moderately or very satisfied with their jobs. These statistics show that many people are not satisfied with their work. Work can be drudgery if you don't enjoy what you do. In his book, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi asserts that people have four things in common when they are in a state of flow. When you are in a state of flow, you are immersed in your work, you are enjoying it and you are focused and not easily distracted. A state of flow occurs when you are doing work that is important, meaningful and relevant. For example, when you do work that is important and relevant, you feel like you are making a difference and contributing something that is valuable. You will have a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. When you are in a state of flow, you will be highly motivated to get the job done. The main point is that you need to do work that is meaningful and relevant. It is easy to stay motivated when you do work that is significant. The challenge is to do meaningful work when the job is mundane and not exciting. It is difficult to be engaged when you are doing a job that is not stimulating. 1. Have a passion for what you do. It is difficult to be motivated to do work that is not fulfilling. It is easy to have a passion for something that you love to do. Do you feel your work is valuable and makes a difference? If you are not passionate about your work, it is important to find a job that you enjoy. It is important to find meaning and relevance in your work. 2. Do work that is important and relevant. Are you doing work that is important and relevant? How can you contribute something of value to the world? Does your work have meaning and significance? These are important questions to explore. Many people are not satisfied with their jobs because they don't have a sense of purpose in what they do. 3. Work with passionate people. It is important to work with passionate people who are engaged and enjoy what they do. It is easy to get motivated when you work with passionate people who are enthusiastic and excited about their work. It is difficult to be motivated when you work with people who are disengaged and not interested in their work. 4. Work with purpose. Are you working for a purpose? Is your work significant? What is your mission and purpose? If you don't have a purpose, you will not be motivated to do your work. It is important to have a mission statement. This will guide you and give you purpose. Your mission will motivate you and inspire you. It will keep you on track and focused on your purpose. It is important to have a mission statement for your company. A mission statement is a declaration of your purpose. It is your reason for being. Your mission will define your organization and guide your actions. It will be your guide to set goals and make decisions. It will help you focus and inspire you. It is important to have a personal mission statement. Your mission statement will define you and guide your actions. It will give you purpose. You need to be passionate about your work. It is important to have a purpose and meaning for your work. You should find your calling and do work that is important and relevant. You need to be engaged and have a sense of purpose.

"Many things can be done to make animals live longer, even though we don't know exactly why these things work. These can include changing diets, taking certain drugs, or special genetic manipulations. Genetic manipulations can help us learn how to make animals live longer. For instance, if you have a group of animals and give them a particular drug, then they live longer, you don't know whether it was the drug that made them live longer, or if something else about them allowed them to live longer. But if you genetically engineer the animals to make them have a certain gene, and then they live longer, it is very likely that the gene made the animals live longer. There are many genes that have been shown to affect aging. One way to manipulate genes is to mutate them to make them not work. A gene that has been mutated in this way is called a null allele. There are many null alleles of genes that affect longevity. Some null alleles include: Age-1 (daf-2) These mutants live about twice as long as normal, wild-type animals. If-1 (daf-16) These mutants live about twice as long as normal, wild-type animals, and are resistant to stress and disease. Age-1 and If-1 are usually used together because they have stronger effects when they are both mutated than when they are mutated alone. Other mutations: Insulin-like signaling (Insulin-like Growth Factor - IGF-1) mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) Many drugs can be used to make animals live longer. In general, these drugs are not useful for people to take to live longer, but are very useful for figuring out how aging works. These drugs are sometimes called geroprotectors. These drugs include: Rapamycin (and other mTOR inhibitors) Lithium chloride (and other GSK-3 inhibitors) PPAR agonists Sirtuin activators Perhaps the most exciting research being done right now is using gene therapy to make animals live longer. These gene therapies are designed to work differently than drugs. With drugs, you have to keep taking them every day for a long time, or else the effect stops. But with gene therapy, a gene is put into the animal, so it keeps working all the time, without the animal having to keep taking a drug. Gene therapy is already being used for some diseases. You can read more about gene therapy on the Gene Therapy Information Network website. And here is a video about how it works: Different gene therapies have been used to make animals live longer. For example, one study used gene therapy to increase levels of telomerase. Another study used gene therapy to cause the body to produce more of a protein called SIRT1. What do you think is the most promising research for making animals live longer?",0,201

"MIT has released a 7-minute video that shows President Richard Nixon delivering an Apollo 11 contingency speech. It took the team at MIT more than half a year to create the video. The video was created by researchers at the MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality and was delivered using a combination of historical records, 3D imaging, and machine learning. The video was created by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality (CIV), who specialize in the development of digital human performances. It is the latest effort in a series of ""virtual performances"" by historical figures. CIV is directed by Fox Harrell, a professor of digital media and artificial intelligence in the MIT Comparative Media Studies Program and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The effort was led by the CIV's technical director and research scientist, Danielle Olson, who worked with a team of researchers and students that included Youjin Kim, Ryan M. Sands, Adam C. Glover, and Pollyana Oliveira. The CIV team pored through countless hours of audiovisual material, including press conferences and televised addresses, to create an audiovisual base layer for the project. Next, they recorded a contemporary actor delivering the text of the speech in a studio. Then they created a ""digital puppet"" of the actor to drive the performance, placing a virtual version of the actor inside the original audiovisual footage, which is ""warped"" to match the actor's performance. The researchers then used machine learning to recreate the original audio from the archival footage. Finally, they grafted the actor's mouth onto the original footage. The result is a realistic video of Nixon delivering the speech. Such virtual performances can offer a powerful tool for understanding historical figures in a nuanced way, says Harrell. ""While it is a simulation, it is based on historical research, and it lets you see Nixon delivering a speech if the worst had happened,"" Harrell says. For example, the CIV team's next project, now underway, is a virtual performance of the political activist Malcolm X, using a speech he never delivered - the one he would have given had he not been assassinated in 1965. This is a very interesting project. I also wonder why they couldn't use Nixon's real voice. It's true, you can't get everything correct. The video was not made to be realistic. It's a very interesting project, but I wonder why they couldn't use Nixon's real voice.",0,204

"This article follows how a flaw was discovered and exploited in an internal test version of Google Cloud Deployment Manager. The flaw allowed requests to be issued to Google internal resources using the user's permissions and credentials. This bug was later found to be present in the public release of Google Cloud Deployment Manager. Google Cloud Deployment Manager is a service that can deploy GCP resources using declarative YAML files. These files can specify resources to be deployed (like virtual machines), what to do with the resources (like add them to a load balancer) and also how to make the deployment happen. The service can also be used to manage deployments that use Cloud Functions, for example, which is the focus of this article. If a user has permissions to deploy an App Engine service, the user will have the ability to create and deploy Cloud Functions. The user can add the Cloud Function to a service using the CLI, and then deploy the service to a project. The user can also deploy the Cloud Function to an existing App Engine service. This Cloud Function was added to the file as a template, so the final resource would be named something else and could be deployed to any project that the user had access to. A user with permissions to deploy an App Engine service has access to the Cloud Function. This Cloud Function can be deployed to an App Engine service without a name change. This Cloud Function can be deployed to any project the user has access to. A user can only deploy the Cloud Function to an App Engine service in the same project the Cloud Function was created in. A user cannot deploy the Cloud Function to another project. This was implemented by adding a new conditional to the configuration file. The configuration is evaluated by Cloud Deployment Manager before being applied to the resources. This new conditional checks that the project is the same as the project that contains the function. When the configuration is evaluated, the project is obtained from the user's environment and checked against the function's project. The function's project is obtained from the configuration file's name. This is because the name of the function matches the name of the Cloud Deployment Manager configuration file. The configuration file is named according to the function that it came from. This was the simplest approach that could be taken to fix the problem. The main issue with this approach is that it can be very easy to bypass. The function's project is obtained from the configuration file's name. The name of the configuration file does not match the function's project. The user is able to deploy the function to a different project. The user can deploy the function to any project in which the user has access to the function. The user can deploy the function to a different project if the user knows the function's project. The new conditional compares the function's project to the project that the user is deploying to. This prevents the function from being deployed to a different project unless the user knows the function's project. This does not prevent the function from being deployed to a different project if the user has access to the function and knows the function's project. This can also be done using a conditional. The conditional checks whether the user has access to the function. This is done using the serviceAccountEmail field from the Cloud Functions configuration. The function's project is obtained from the configuration file's name, like before. The function's service account email is obtained from the function's configuration. The user is only able to deploy the function if the user has access to the function. A user cannot deploy the function unless the user has access to the function. The user cannot deploy the function to a different project, even if they know the function's project. This solution prevents the function from being deployed to a different project without the user having access to the function. The downside of this approach is that the user still has the permissions to deploy the function. This can be a problem if the user has multiple permissions and cannot use the function. This can be resolved by removing the permissions from the user to deploy the function. The user is not able to deploy the function unless the user has access to the function. The user cannot deploy the function unless the user has access to the function. The user does not have permissions to deploy the function. This solution prevents the function from being deployed to a different project. The downside of this approach is that the user is unable to deploy the function. This can be a problem if the user has multiple permissions and does not have access to the function. This can be resolved by adding a permission to the user to deploy the function. The user is able to deploy the function if the user has access to the function. This solution allows the user to deploy the function if the user has access to the function. The downside",0,210
"Signal is testing a new peer-to-peer payment system in the UK called Signal Payments.

""Moxie's always been passionate about making payments more secure,"" Open Whisper Systems' Head of Communications Liz Steininger told TechCrunch. ""He's always been interested in the crypto space and the potential for privacy and security in that space, and he's a longtime contributor to the bitcoin project and the Open Whisper Systems code base. He's always been interested in payments and the potential of crypto to improve payments and we're exploring a new avenue to do that."" MobileCoin is one of the latest coins in the cryptocurrency craze. The coin is backed by the Zcash Electric Coin Company. Marlinspike has been a part of the Zcash project since the beginning and he's now the technical advisor to the Zcash Foundation. The Zcash Foundation is the non-profit that owns the trademark for Zcash and maintains the Zcash reference code. Zcash is also the currency that powers the Signal messaging platform. ""MobileCoin is an experimental cryptocurrency that the Zcash Foundation is developing as part of an effort to improve on existing cryptocurrencies like Zcash. We want to see what we can learn by building a blockchain from scratch with the benefit of hindsight and years of real world experience. The result is a new cryptocurrency with fast and scalable transactions, improved security, and easier-to-use cryptography,"" the MobileCoin site reads. The new Signal Payments service is currently in closed beta and only available to users in the UK. Users can download the Signal app, generate an account, and send money to their contacts via the Signal app. The system currently only supports GBP, but the team says it hopes to expand to other currencies in the future. Users can generate an account with a phone number or email address. They can connect the Signal app to their bank account. The first transaction with the service is free and users can only send up to 250 a day. Once they verify their identity, the daily limit goes up to 500. ""We're looking to see how the user experience works, how we might be able to improve it, and whether it's a useful feature or not,"" Steininger told TechCrunch. ""We're looking for feedback from our users on whether or not they find this useful."" Signal Payments is separate from the core Signal messaging service and is developed by a separate team, but the company said they share the same values of privacy and security. ""The Signal Payments beta is entirely separate from Signal Messenger, and we're developing it with a separate team,"" Steininger said. ""Signal Messenger is a free and open source, privacy-focused messaging app. We're not building a payments system into Signal Messenger, but we are exploring the potential of a standalone payments app that would enable secure, private payments, which would be a logical extension of Signal's mission."" The new payment system is built into the latest beta of the Signal app, but it can also be used via a standalone Signal Pay app. The company says they're focusing on the UK first as the first part of the beta, but they hope to expand to more countries in the future.

"Amazon has revealed two new robots at the re:MARS conference that are designed to move products around its warehouses. The Xanthus is an upgrade for Amazon's shelf-bots that will let the machines move more efficiently through warehouses. The Pegasus, meanwhile, is a new bot that can move a stack of pods, each of which holds a pallet, around a warehouse. Xanthus is a specialized, upgraded version of the Kiva robots Amazon has been using in its warehouses for years. The Xanthus is 80 percent more efficient than the Kiva, moving 50 percent faster and 30 percent further. It's also more accurate, able to grab shelves with precision that should mean fewer products get damaged. Both robots use machine learning to navigate Amazon's warehouses and track the locations of products. ""With the Xanthus and Pegasus robots, we've been able to take advantage of the design flexibility of wheels, combined with sophisticated vison and navigation capabilities, to deliver a robust goods-to-person picking solution for our operations,"" said Brad Porter, vice president and distinguished engineer for Amazon Robotics. ""We are excited about the benefits these systems will bring to our employees and our customers."" Amazon will also be showing off new Scout robots, designed to deliver packages to customers' homes. Scout is a six-wheeled robot that can make its way up to a customer's front door. It can be accompanied by a human handler, or it can follow a programmed map. The robots were all developed at Amazon's Seattle-based RD labs, and they're all designed to be safer, more efficient alternatives to the existing human labor force. The Pegasus and Xanthus are scheduled to be deployed in Amazon warehouses later this year.

"Mark Zuckerberg has highlighted four areas (data portability, election integrity, harmful content, and privacy) which he believes require regulation, in an op-ed published on March 30. He stated that a data portability requirement would create ""common standards for the transfer of data"" between platforms. In the op-ed, Zuckerberg highlighted that ""the best approach is for lawmakers to update regulations"" on the four areas, to ""establish a principle of data portability."" The aim of this is to ensure that users are free to move between social networks, taking their data with them. The article further states that ""a common global framework"" would be required to establish such a principle, and that this framework should be ""built from the ground up in order to protect privacy and enable innovation."" While Zuckerberg does not provide a detailed explanation of his reasoning behind the proposed data portability requirement, he cites the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a potential framework from which to build upon. The GDPR, which was introduced in May 2018, is the EU's legal framework for data protection. The regulation provides individuals with the right to data portability. Article 20 of the GDPR states that individuals have the right to receive their personal data, which they have previously provided in a ""structured, commonly used and machine-readable format"" and have the right to transmit that data to another controller. Zuckerberg's op-ed comes just weeks after the company has come under heavy scrutiny following the revelation that UK-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica harvested data from up to 87 million Facebook users. Zuckerberg also revealed that the company would be implementing a ""clear history"" feature, which would allow users to view the apps and websites which send Facebook information when users use them, and give them the ability to clear this information from their account.",0,216

"WeWork has closed down around 2,300 phone booths at some of its sites in the US and Canada after it discovered elevated levels of formaldehyde. The discovery was made after one of its members complained of an unpleasant odor in one of the booths. Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas at room temperature and has a pungent, distinctive odor. It is used to make fertilizer, plastics, and dyes, and also as a preservative in mortuaries and medical laboratories. It is also found in some glues, adhesives, and fabrics. The compound is carcinogenic and can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, and higher levels of exposure can cause some types of cancers. WeWork says it is working with an outside firm to conduct indoor air quality testing. The phone booths were provided by California-based manufacturer Orangebox. In a statement on its website, Orangebox said it was not aware of any issues relating to the formaldehyde levels in its products. It said the phone booths were built in the UK and had ""completed rigorous testing for VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions, air quality and ventilation,"" prior to being shipped to North America. A statement from WeWork read: ""We are conducting a thorough ongoing investigation, which includes testing of the phone booths in question, reviewing the manufacturing process and the components of the phone booths, as well as consulting with leading experts.",0,225

We will take the 2,000 images with people from COCO and use them to train a TensorFlow model. Running TensorFlow in the browser The first step to running TensorFlow in the browser is to define the model. The model is defined by creating a graph with TensorFlow. The graph specifies the computation. The next step is to define the inputs to the graph. For this project, we use a single image as input. Next, the weights for the model are loaded into the graph. The weights are stored in a file that can be downloaded from TensorFlow Hub. Next, the model is compiled. The TensorFlow.js compiler transforms the graph into a serialized representation that can be executed in the browser. The final step is to serialize the model to disk.

"Elon Musk tweeted out the video from the camera attached to SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket as it aborted the plan to land on the landing pad and instead stabilized just before hitting the water. The video shows the moment the rocket began spinning out of control and the engines fired up to slow the rocket's descent enough so that it wouldn't break apart on impact with the water. The rocket's legs can be seen deploying just before it hits the water, stabilizing the rocket so that it lands upright in the ocean. The rocket was carrying the Spaceflight SSO-A: SmallSat Express mission to space, which was successful. But the landing did not go as planned and the rocket splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean just off the Florida coast.

In addition to the 135 million in payments, the New York Times said Google agreed to revamp how it investigates misconduct cases by offering ""more transparency"" to employees. Google employees have staged walkouts at offices around the world to protest the company's handling of sexual misconduct cases. More news: Nestle announces a 1.6 billion partnership with Starbucks More news: Ducks even series with Sharks Rubin's denial was included in a confidential report that detailed the misconduct claims. The investigation has reportedly resulted in the firing of 48 employees, including 13 senior managers. Google isn't alone. In the past few weeks, companies like Facebook, Lyft, Uber, and Nike have been accused of either protecting executives accused of sexual misconduct, or of not doing enough to prevent such harassment. ""We've recently made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The employee was a woman, and the misconduct was reported to Google's human resources department. Most of the payments were made since the MeToo movement arrived in late 2017, but the two 10m payments happened before then, in 2014 and 2016. Google says it has fired 48 employees - including 13 senior managers - for sexual harassment in the past two years.",0,235
"Amazon is developing a technology that will allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands, allowing them to purchase items with their palms. The company has been working on the technology for the last few years and believes it could make the ""checkout experience easier for customers."" Amazon has applied for a patent for a non-contact biometric identification system that uses human skin as a ""communication path."" The system can identify individuals by detecting the unique electrical signals that are emitted by human skin. Customers would be required to input their credit card details into the system once, and then they would be able to make purchases with their hands. The information would be stored securely in a database and could be accessed by scanning the hands of the customer. Amazon is also developing systems that would allow people to use their hands to pay for purchases when they are not in the physical vicinity of a cash register. This is particularly useful for situations where customers are not able to access a computer, such as when they are shopping at a store that does not have a checkout counter. Amazon's ""contactless"" payment system could be used in other scenarios such as on public transport, where customers can touch a rail or bus to pay for their tickets. The system could also be used to help verify people's identity in places where identification is required, such as bars or airports. This isn't the first time that Amazon has been involved in developing unusual payment systems. In January, the company filed a patent for a payment system that uses selfies. The company's latest development is part of a growing trend of businesses that are developing innovative payment systems. Retailers in the US and China are now developing payment systems that allow people to pay for goods using only their faces. Last month, Walmart filed a patent for a system that would allow customers to pay for their purchases using their body movements. Amazon's latest patent shows that the company is still at the forefront of innovation in the online payment sector. The technology is likely to be highly sought-after by a number of businesses and could even be integrated into other retail systems such as paying with Bitcoin or Ethereum. This new system could also give Amazon a big advantage over other retailers in the future and could help to further solidify the company's dominance in the online retail sector.

"The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The data could help reveal information about genetic risk for diseases and disorders. An unprecedented international effort to describe the genetic landscape of human populations could lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the genetic risk factors for diseases and disorders. In 2000, the Human Genome Project (HGP) provided the reference genome sequence for the species Homo sapiens. But this sequence, assembled from the DNA of a handful of individuals, is just one version of the human genome. In fact, every person has a unique genome, containing a distinctive set of DNA variants that help to shape their individuality. The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The project aims to collect DNA from 200 or more different populations representing the world's ethnic and geographic groups. The aim is to capture the genetic diversity of the world's populations and enable better estimates of the frequency of variants and haplotypes. This will help researchers understand how often certain types of genetic changes occur, and which are relatively rare. The project will also attempt to identify genetic sequences that may be related to the development of common diseases. Researchers will sequence the genomes of 500 individuals from each of 200 or more different populations representing the world's ethnic and geographic groups. A preliminary list of populations has been prepared, but it is expected to change as the project evolves. The project will also attempt to identify genetic sequences that may be related to the development of common diseases. The Human Pangenome Project will be an open-access project, with its data available to researchers and the public. The Human Pangenome Project is a collaborative project that involves many scientists from around the world.",0,239
"Nintendo has announced Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, a game where players use their Nintendo Switches to pilot a physical kart around their home. Players can set up various gateways and obstacles, and they have to navigate the course while staring at the screen and not the road ahead of them. Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit features a variety of different courses to play on, each with their own obstacles and ramps. Players have to build the courses themselves using the included cardboard ramps and obstacles, which are essentially Lego-style bricks that snap together. Players then control their karts using the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controller. The Joy-Con snaps into a special cradle that rests on top of the kart, and players control the kart by moving the Joy-Con itself. ""What we wanted to do was recreate the feeling of the original Mario Kart,"" says Mario Kart Live producer Hideki Konno. ""It was a very difficult game to play, because you had to hold the controller in one hand and steer the kart with the other. We wanted to go back to the basics, and we thought this was the best way to do it."" Players will be able to race against friends in person or online in Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. They'll also be able to create their own custom courses, using the cardboard pieces to create various jumps and obstacles.

"Navigate on Autopilot is a new feature by Tesla that is moving it closer to its self-driving future. It offers step-by-step navigation overlayed on a map (like you would get in Google Maps). Navigate on Autopilot will also give drivers the option to exit the freeway when they approach their destination, which will happen when the Autopilot feature is active. This feature is different from the earlier announced Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) which the company introduced in October 2018, according to Musk. While NOA can steer the car, it still required the driver to change the lanes on their own to get off the freeway. With the new feature, the car will suggest lane changes, navigate the car off the freeway and bring it to a stop to avoid missing the exit. The latest feature can be used on roads with no lane markings or on local roads that are not on Tesla's navigation maps.

"Toyota has fitted racing cars with hydrogen combustion engines to test the feasibility of the technology for use in commercial vehicles. The technology still suffers from limitations regarding range, and is not competitive with electric vehicles. In 2013, Toyota announced that it would launch a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in 2015. The car will be sold in Japan and the U.S. at a price of around 100,000. The company claims that the car will have a driving range of 300 miles (480 km) and a refueling time of about three minutes. The new vehicle is believed to be based on the FCV-R concept, which Toyota showcased at the 2012 Tokyo Motor Show. The car is expected to use hydrogen from the chemical reformation of natural gas or by electrolysis of water. On August 28, 2012, Toyota unveiled the FCV-R Concept fuel cell vehicle at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R Concept was designed to ""highlight the fuel cell system's compact dimensions and demonstrate its suitability for a saloon-type sedan."" The FCV-R Concept has a driving range of 700 km (435 miles) and a hydrogen storage capacity of 70 MPa (700 bar, 10,150 psi). Toyota presented an FCV prototype at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Toyota planned to sell the car in 2015 at a price of about 100,000. In June 2013, Toyota announced that the FCV would be introduced in Japan before April 2015, and in the U.S. and Europe in the summer of 2015. Toyota plans to sell at least 100 FCVs in 2015, mostly in Japan and the U.S. The company plans to sell 1,000 FCVs by 2017. On November 18, 2014, Toyota revealed the FCV under the name Mirai, meaning ""future"" in Japanese. Toyota plans to release the car in Japan on December 15, 2014, and in the U.S. and Europe in mid-2015. In Japan, it will be priced at 6.7 million yen (US57,000) before taxes. Sales in the U.S. are scheduled to begin in August 2015 at a price of US57,500 before any government incentives. Initially, the Mirai will only be available in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City. The Mirai will be equipped with a 152 hp (113 kW) electric motor, 114 kW fuel cell (FC), two 70 MPa (10,000 psi) hydrogen tanks, a 245-liter fuel tank, and a 28 kWh lithium-ion battery. The FCV is expected to have a range of 435 miles (700 km) and a refueling time of about three minutes. Toyota estimates that the FCV will get 67 miles per gallon-equivalent (3.6 l100 km), and that its well-to-wheel efficiency is 75 percent. In August 2014, Toyota announced that the Mirai would come with three years or 65,000 km of free hydrogen. The company also announced that it will launch a 7.3 million program to encourage the development of hydrogen fueling stations in California. Toyota will partner with FirstElement Fuels to build 19 new hydrogen stations in California over the next three years, and it will provide an additional 3 million to support the California Fuel Cell Partnership's market introduction of zero-emission fuel cell vehicles. The Mirai will be one of the eight vehicles available at the launch of Gran Turismo 6, revealed at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. The Toyota FCV was featured in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre.

"A lab-created microbe with fully redesigned DNA was created by scientists in Cambridge. The modified Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria contained a genetic code that had been trimmed by scientists to remove ""redundancies."" In the process they added two extra letters or ""bases"" to the four already found in the DNA of all life on Earth. The result is a world-first living organism with a partially synthetic genetic code. ""What we have now is the most radically altered genetic code that has ever been created in a living organism,"" said Farren Isaacs, an assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at Yale University, who helped to write the study. The new ""alien"" lifeform is made from existing genetic code, but scientists hope to create organisms with totally synthetic genomes in the future. The hope is that the new organisms will be better able to survive the effects of climate change or help to produce new drugs, for instance. Synthetic genomes could also be used to create new biotechnologies that could help to reduce the effects of climate change. One of the ideas put forward involves using bacteria to turn carbon dioxide into liquid fuels. However, more research is needed before a synthetic genome could be used to engineer such a technology, Isaacs said.",0,247
"SvgPathEditor is an in-browser SVG path editor. Users can use the controls to specify a path or create an image using the graphical interface. Paths can be easily copied to the clipboard for use in other software. Paths can be saved in SVG, JSON, and WKT format. In this post, we'll add a new feature to the editor. We'll add a way to specify the point style using a graphical interface. In addition to improving the editor, we'll use this feature to make the editor itself more useful. SvgPathEditor's point styles are specified as a GeoJSON feature collection. Currently, users have to manually edit the GeoJSON to change the point styles. For example, we could change the default green circle to a purple square. To add a graphical interface to change the point styles, we'll start by creating a point style controller. Next, we'll add a point style menu. This will add a settings menu with a single item for point styles. Selecting the item will open a dialog with a point style editor. The style editor will allow the user to change the point style using controls. The controls for each point style type are implemented in a factory object that we'll create. A function is provided to initialize a point style factory. This function is used by the point style editor to initialize the controls. This returns an object that provides the necessary controls for each point style type. We'll define a new point style type for each new control. The point style editor will use the factory to initialize the controls. The factory provides the controls. We'll just use them to display the options and update the path style. The function gets the selected style type. It then initializes the controls and updates the path. The point style editor will use the controls to change the style of the selected points. The style editor uses the controls to change the style of the selected points. It updates the GeoJSON to represent the new style. The dialog closes when the user clicks outside of it. It is also possible for the user to save the current style as a new style. We can now edit the point styles with the graphical editor. The new point style editor uses a factory to create the controls. We'll use a similar approach to make the editor itself more useful. We'll add a way to export path to several common file formats. To add the ability to export a path, we'll start by adding a menu item to the settings menu. To export the path, we'll create a new dialog. This will add a new option to the settings menu. Selecting the option will open a dialog with options to export the path. For each export format, we'll need to add an export controller. This function will add a new export controller. The export controller will have a controller id and a name for the export format. It will also provide the file extension that the export format uses. An export controller is used to export the path to a particular format. We'll define export controllers for each of the file formats. The export controllers will export a path to a particular file format. For example, we'll add an export controller for SVG. The SVG export controller will export the path as SVG. It exports the path as a string. We'll use an HTML5 file upload control to download the path. We'll also add an export controller for JSON. The JSON export controller will export the path as JSON. The exported path will include the point styles. It exports the path as a string. We'll use an HTML5 file upload control to download the path. We'll also add an export controller for WKT. The WKT export controller will export the path as WKT. The exported path will include the point styles. It exports the path as a string. We'll use an HTML5 file upload control to download the path. The export dialog will use the export controllers to download the path. The export dialog will use the export controllers to download the path. The user can select the export format to use. We can now export paths using the new export dialog. The export dialog uses export controllers to download a path. We'll use a similar approach to make the editor itself more useful. We'll add a way to export the editor. We'll add a menu item to the settings menu. We'll create a new dialog that will export the editor. This will add a new option to the settings menu. Selecting the option will open a dialog that will export the editor. The export dialog will create an export controller to export the editor. The editor is exported as a string of JSON",0,248
"Apple has launched a new tool that gathers anonymous data from Apple Maps to show how well people are following social distancing guidelines. It is designed for health-care professionals and planners and is available in the US and India. Apple Health also has a new feature to allow people to register their COVID-19 status. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Apple has announced a new tool that gathers anonymous data from Apple Maps to show how well people are following social distancing guidelines in public spaces. The tool is available in the US and India, but is designed for health-care professionals and planners, not individuals. Apple Health has a new feature to allow people to register their COVID-19 status. The outbreak of COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, has taken a toll on the world, and Apple has responded in several ways, including Apple Health. Apple Health has a new feature to allow people to register their COVID-19 status. It also shows information about the virus and where to find help. While the new social distancing feature is for planners, the Apple Health feature is available to all. To find the information about the virus in Apple Health, open the Apple Health app and tap on the Health Data tab. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see the new COVID-19 label. Tapping on the label will open a web page that has information about the disease, how to protect yourself, and where to find help. If you want to share your status, tap on Share Status. In the Share Status screen, you'll see two sections. The upper section has options to contact your local emergency services and links to the WHO and CDC websites. The lower section allows you to update your status. Tapping on the Update Status button opens a list of statuses. You can choose Not Being Tested, Being Tested, Positive, or Negative. If you tap on the status button for more than a second, you'll see that there is a name field where you can enter your name. This is the name that will be shared with emergency services and health-care professionals. You can update your status as often as you like. When you update your status, it is shared with the CDC and WHO. Those organizations can then take the anonymous data and put it into maps and charts to understand how well people are following the social distancing guidelines. While the Apple Health feature is useful for anyone, the social distancing tool is designed for health-care professionals and planners. It can be used to see how many people are in a given space and how they are moving through an area. Apple is using the data from Apple Maps, and by using anonymized data, it is possible to get a good view of a location without identifying any individual. While Apple is leading the way in getting people access to important information, it's not the only company that's doing something to help. Google has launched a similar tool, and others are working on apps and devices to help in the fight against COVID-19.

"Signal is a private messaging app that doesn't track or store data on its users. In this thread, the Signal development team answers questions by Redditors. The team plans to pop in from time to time to answer questions about the app. ut3hCrypt Signal Development Team QA with the Signal Development Team Hi, we're the Signal development team. We're here to answer your questions. Are there any plans for a webdesktop client in the future? Yes, we plan to do a webdesktop client eventually, but we haven't started on it yet. Being that the NSA can easily break AES and probably break Elliptic Curve Cryptography, what is the point of using Signal? People have been trying to break AES for 15 years and they've had no success. The same goes for the ECC curves we use. We don't see any reason to believe that the NSA can break them. Regardless, the NSA can always break any system if they can coerce you to give them your keys. That's why we're putting a lot of effort into building features that reduce the need for keys. Is there any concern with Whisper Systems being a corporate entity and the fact that (as I understand it) the keys are held on their servers? Yes, that's a concern. That's why we're building features that reduce the need for keys. Can you comment on how Signal's encryption stack compares to that of RedPhoneTextSecure? Signal uses the TextSecure protocol, which is used by both Signal and TextSecure. The only difference between the two apps is that TextSecure supports SMS messages, while Signal does not. Is it possible to integrate Signal into a non-Google Play store ROM? This is a bit complicated. Signal uses the TextSecure protocol, which is open source. You can integrate the protocol into whatever ROM you want. However, the Signal app is not open source, so you can't just take the app itself and put it on a different store. What are your plans to have Android 4.4 support? We'll probably make a 4.4 branch of the app that will work on older Android versions. That said, we'd really like for all of our users to upgrade to Android 5.0 because the new permissions system makes it much easier to keep your private messages private. I'd just like to say a big thanks for the hard work and dedication you guys are putting into making signal better! It's a great app and I'm really happy to support you guys! Keep up the good work! Why is it that all Signal messages are sent with Signal? That's because all of our users are required to install Signal. If you send a Signal message to someone who doesn't have the app installed, the message will be sent using Signal's fallback transport (the regular phone number). If they install the app later, the fallback messages will automatically be converted into Signal messages. We considered building a non-Signal version of the app that only uses SMS messages, but we decided not to do that because it would have required a lot of complicated fallback logic. Is there any difference between the RedPhone and Signal encryption stacks, besides the obvious SMS support on RedPhone? I see you are moving away from the RedPhone name, so I assume there must be some reason. RedPhone and Signal use the same encryption stack. The only difference is that RedPhone supports SMS messages, while Signal does not. We decided to move away from the RedPhone name because we don't think it accurately describes the app any more. The goal of the app is to replace the regular phone call functionality, and ""RedPhone"" sounds like a VoIP app (which it is not). I'd like to use Signal but my friends are more comfortable with Facebook Messenger. I'm wondering if you guys have considered making it easier to communicate between the two platforms and if that's something you guys are planning to do? I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's possible without a whole lot of complexity. If we're going to make it easy to chat with someone who doesn't use Signal, we'd rather do it through SMS messages than through Facebook. SMS messages are a lot simpler than Facebook, and the fallback logic is much easier to handle. Just wanted to say that I was happy to see the new update to the app that included group messaging.

NASA has plans to use the xEMU for exploring the surface of the Moon. The xEMU is an upgraded version of the Mark III spacesuit worn by astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). The xEMU is designed to be more flexible and easier to wear than the Mark III suit. It has better joints, shoulder and elbow mobility, and more flexibility at the waist and hips. It is also designed to work with two different sizes of spacesuits. Astronauts who are medium-sized or smaller can use a medium-sized suit, and larger astronauts can use a larger suit. The xEMU is made up of a number of different parts. A backpack called a Portable Life Support System (PLSS) provides oxygen and water to the astronaut wearing the suit. Another part, called the Hard Upper Torso (HUT), is a hard plastic shell that fits around the astronaut's upper body, and provides more structure and mobility to the suit. The xEMU also has new helmets and gloves, which are designed to be more flexible and easier to wear. Moving around on the surface of the Moon is easier for astronauts wearing the xEMU. It has special boots which allow astronauts to walk, run, and even hop around on the Moon. The suit also has lights, communications, and computer systems that allow astronauts to communicate with other astronauts and mission control. The xEMU is part of NASA's Constellation Program. The Constellation Program includes a number of new technologies including a new rocket called the Ares V, a new spacecraft called the Orion, and a new lunar lander. If NASA has enough funding for these new technologies, they hope to put astronauts back on the Moon in 2020.",0,252

"Yusaku Maezawa, billionaire Japanese entrepreneur and art collector, will be SpaceX's first passenger in its trip around the Moon. He will bring artists (a film director, a painter, a dancer, a novelist, a musician, a fashion designer, and a photographer) to the Moon and back. So, what is the purpose of this art trip? Well, if you ask me, it is to make us forget that we are already living in a dystopia. So, let us start this journey with a brief overview of the world we are living in. The world is being ruled by a few families that own most of the wealth. They have been using their wealth to influence the political arena and to gather more wealth in the form of corporate power. This has been the case for a long time. We can see the effect of this in the form of income inequality. Most of the countries in the world are becoming more unequal in terms of income distribution. The top 1 are getting more and more wealthy, while the 99 is getting more poor. The main reason for this is the unequal access to education. The people at the top are the ones who can afford the best education, and they are also the ones who can afford to get the best jobs. This is the case for many countries, including the United States. Income inequality is at its highest level since 1928. This situation is the direct consequence of the neoliberalism economic policies that started in the 1980s. These policies were implemented to push the wealth from the bottom 99 to the top 1. The main driver for these policies is debt. In fact, the whole world is driven by debt. All the governments and corporations are surviving on debt. The world owes almost 250 trillion US dollars to a few banks. These banks are owned by a few families. In the meantime, we are living in a world of endless wars. The main reason for these wars is to push more wealth from the bottom 99 to the top 1. These wars are not meant to fight terrorism or defend freedom. They are meant to control the natural resources of the countries that we are attacking. The recent report of the UN shows that more than 20 million people are at risk of dying due to lack of food and water. We have the resources to save these people, but we don't. Most of the countries in the world are becoming more authoritarian. The United States, for example, is a highly authoritarian state. The US is the country with the largest prison population in the world. At the same time, the US is pushing for more authoritarianism all over the world. It is supporting the Saudi war in Yemen that has been killing tens of thousands of people. It is supporting the Israeli war against the Palestinian people. It is supporting the genocide against the Rohingya in Myanmar. It has been supporting the crimes against the people of Syria for years. In the meantime, people are still hoping that the United Nations will do something to end these crimes. This hope is misplaced. The United Nations is not a world government. It is an organization that is controlled by the permanent members of the Security Council. These permanent members are the ones that have been pushing for authoritarianism and wars. So, don't expect the United Nations to do anything about it. I can go on and on about the horrible state of the world we are living in. We are living in a dystopia. We can keep ignoring this fact by buying more iPhones, binge-watching more Netflix shows, or doing whatever we can to distract ourselves. But, that won't change the fact that we are living in a dystopia. The billionaire art collector, Yusaku Maezawa, is going to take us on a journey to the Moon. He will take artists with him to inspire us with art. He will make us forget that we are living in a dystopia. The art trip to the Moon is just another distraction. We need a different kind of trip. We need a trip to a better world. We need a trip to Utopia. A world that is ruled by the people and for the people. A world without authoritarianism, wars, and crimes. A world without endless debt and income inequality. We can have that world. All we need to do is to change the way we think. We need to replace the idea of nationality with humanity. We need to stop thinking",0,254
"Former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong is building a system to transform desert land into fertile ground to grow the trees we need to help stop climate change. Trees can recapture carbon dioxide, and deserts are a great place to plant them: there's lots of land, it's cheap, and trees grow faster in warmer climates. Wong is co-founder and CEO of Kernel, a startup that plans to use software, remote sensors, machine learning, and drones to transform 3,000 acres of desert in Nevada into a forest of fast-growing trees. The company plans to sell the wood to make furniture and other products, as well as leasing or selling the land to customers. The company is starting a pilot project this spring that will last two years, and is raising money from private investors. Wong has already invested 3.5 million into the project, and the company plans to raise 25 million in total. Kernel is launching a project to create a forest in the Nevada desert to help combat climate change. The company is not revealing how much it will cost to transform a 3,000 acre plot, but Wong says it will be cheaper than the 2,000 to 4,000 per acre to create a forest in Oregon or California. Wong, who has a PhD in neuroscience from MIT, says he got the idea for the project after his friends on Reddit suggested he grow trees. He was CEO of Reddit from 2012 to 2014, and before that worked at PayPal, where he founded its anti-fraud efforts. Kernel is one of a number of companies working to help the environment by growing trees. Back in 2006, a team of scientists and architects started the Living Machine system, which uses a series of tanks to convert sewage into water for irrigation, while growing food and trees. Last year, the team created a prototype Living Machine called The Ocean's Harvest, which is on display in the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland. And the original system was installed in a hotel in Arizona that is surrounded by desert. Wong says Kernel's system is different because it is easier to install and maintain, and more scalable. It will also be able to grow trees in places that are too dry for other systems. ""If you're in a hot, dry place, the ocean's harvest won't work very well,"" he says. The company is also working with a group of scientists to identify the fastest growing trees for the climate in Nevada. ""The fastest growing trees are actually really good for the environment, because they sequester carbon faster than the slower growing trees,"" he says. Wong says the goal is to plant at least 500 million trees in the next 10 years, which he says will absorb about 100 million tons of carbon dioxide. Wong is not the only former Reddit CEO working to combat climate change. Alexis Ohanian is a partner at Initialized Capital, which is investing in companies working to develop clean energy. And he is also a partner in Y Combinator, which has invested in clean tech startups. A year ago, Ohanian also called for a carbon tax, saying a 30 per ton tax could raise 2 trillion a year that could be used to help low-income families, fund green energy, and more. Since then, the idea has gained traction. Last month, the Climate Leadership Council proposed a 40 per ton carbon tax that would increase by 2 percent each year, as well as a border adjustment for carbon content, meaning it would apply to imports. The proposal would eliminate regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and refund the revenue back to Americans through ""carbon dividend"" checks of about 2,000 a year.",0,255

"Quantum chess is a version of regular chess that incorporates the quantum concepts of superposition, entanglement, and interference. The game teaches players to develop an intuitive sense of the rules of quantum mechanics. The goal of the game is to capture the other player's King. If that is not possible, the goal is to keep your own King safe. A player wins a game by either capturing the other player's King or by forcing the other player into a position where their King cannot be defended. The game is played on a standard chess board. There are three types of pieces: pawns, pieces, and the King. Pieces may be either white or black. A player's pieces can be in a superposition of positions. Each piece has a ""tag,"" which is a label that identifies it. A pawn always has the tag ""Pawn."" Other pieces (except for the King) have a label ""Piece."" The King has a label ""King."" A piece in superposition can be in multiple positions on the board at the same time. A player's pieces are entangled, which means that their positions are related to each other. The game is played in turns, with each player moving one of their pieces. The player making the next move is indicated by the white or black squares on the board. The white squares indicate whose turn it is to make the next move. On the first move, white goes first. A player can make a move with a piece that is in superposition, or they can make a move with a piece that is in only one position. In either case, the player must specify the piece they are moving, as well as the new position for that piece. To move a piece that is in superposition, the player must specify a position that the piece will move to. If the piece is in a superposition of multiple positions, then the player must specify one of those positions. The player must specify a position for each piece in the superposition. The piece is moved to each of those positions. If a player moves a piece that is in superposition, the player's pieces are no longer entangled. The player's pieces are no longer related to each other. The player's pieces are no longer in superposition and are in only one position. The player's pieces are not entangled. To move a piece that is in only one position, the player must specify a position that the piece will move to. The piece is moved to that position. A piece can only move to a position that is adjacent to its current position. If the piece is in superposition, then it can move to any one of the adjacent positions, or to all of them at the same time. If the piece is in only one position, then it can move to only one adjacent position. A pawn can move forward one space. A pawn can move forward two spaces on the first move. A pawn can capture a piece in the direction it is facing by moving one space into the space that the piece is in. A piece can move in any direction. A piece can move diagonally in any direction. A piece can capture a piece by moving into the space that the piece is in. A King can move in any direction. A King can move diagonally in any direction. A King can capture a piece by moving into the space that the piece is in. A player's pieces are entangled if their positions are related to each other. Each piece has a tag that identifies it. If the pieces have the same tag, then they are entangled. A pawn is entangled with other pawns. A piece is entangled with other pieces. A King is entangled with the other player's King. A pawn is entangled with the other player's pawns. A piece is entangled with the other player's pieces. A King is entangled with the other player's pieces. A piece is entangled with the other player's King. If a player moves a piece that is in superposition, then the player's pieces are no longer entangled. A player's pieces are in superposition if their positions are in a superposition of positions. Each piece has a tag that identifies it. If the pieces have the same tag, then they are in superposition. A pawn is in superposition with other pawns. A piece is in superposition with other pieces.

"Quantum sensors use the fragility of quantum effects to achieve extraordinary sensitivity to the slightest disturbances in the environment. They could be used to study brain conditions, reveal hidden underground structures or identify new planets. In the past, these sensors have been limited by the use of conventional laser technology to provide the necessary optical beams. Now, researchers at the University of Vienna have developed a new quantum sensor that exploits the extraordinary properties of quantum light to achieve a sensitivity that has been impossible to reach so far. Professor Philip Walther and his team from the Faculty of Physics of the University of Vienna used quantum sources, such as quantum dots or color centers in diamonds, to produce light in a very specific quantum state. ""In contrast to a laser, where a single frequency dominates the light emission, our sources emit a broad spectrum of colors, which are, however, correlated in a very special way,"" explains Walther. ""This enables us to measure the phase of the light with an accuracy that was impossible before."" Phase sensing with quantum light In order to measure phase, a light source is directed at a sample and the phase of the reflected light is measured. ""Imagine a beam of light pointing at a mirror and a camera that records the light beam,"" explains first author Patrick Butte. ""If the mirror is tilted, the light beam will hit the camera at a different position."" This way, the tilt of the mirror can be detected. However, this method is not very sensitive. Quantum light sources emit photons that are correlated. If one photon is measured to hit the camera at a certain point, the other photon is guaranteed to hit the camera at exactly the same position. This kind of correlation has a very interesting property: it is preserved under a rotation of the light source by any angle. ""Therefore, you can measure the phase of the reflected light with very high accuracy by monitoring the correlations of the reflected photons,"" explains co-author Vaclav Potocek. This is the key insight of the study. The team from Vienna could show that this approach could be used for detecting the tilt of a mirror with an unprecedented accuracy. The results of the work, which was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and the European Research Council, were published in the journal Science.

"Scientists from the University of Oxford and robotics firm Devanthro grew cells on a robot skeleton in an experiment designed to create more flexible lab-grown cells. The researchers used the soft-robot skeleton as a platform on which to grow skeletal muscle tissue. After it grew, they disconnected the robot from its power source and then electrically stimulated it to see if it would move. The experiment wasn't about building the bionic man, though. It was about the fact that lab-grown tissue is stiff and difficult to grow around anything other than rigid plastic scaffolds. The stiffness of these scaffolds can actually lead to the lab-grown tissue being less functional. The researchers used a robot skeleton in order to create a more natural environment for the muscle tissue to grow around. They were able to remove the rigid scaffold and grow the cells directly on the robot. The hope is that the more natural environment will lead to cells that are more functional and less stiff. The team used a custom-made bioreactor to grow the cells on the robot's skeleton. The robot skeleton was made of artificial tendons and silicone air sacs, or actuators, that were designed to be similar to the ones in the human hand. The robot skeleton was also able to replicate the way the human hand moves when grabbing something. The team used neonatal rat muscle cells to grow the tissue. They attached the cells to the robot skeleton, which was then placed in the bioreactor. They used electricity to stimulate the cells in the same way they would be stimulated in a living body. The cells grew and developed into functioning muscle tissue around the robot skeleton. The researchers then removed the robot skeleton from the bioreactor and connected it to a portable battery. They were able to make the muscles contract by sending an electrical current through the robot skeleton. This experiment demonstrates that it's possible to use the robot skeleton as a scaffold and that the muscle tissue will still function after it's removed from the bioreactor. The team hopes to continue their research using human cells instead of rat cells in order to test how the muscle tissue could be used in the human body. This is just the beginning of the research, but it's an important step towards the use of lab-grown muscle tissue in the human body. The University of Oxford and Devanthro presented their research at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation.",0,268
"Using private backend servers for small projects that need to use a database can become annoying. Hosting a static website is much easier. There are many free and reliable options, such as Firebase, Heroku, AWS, etc. However, databases are a different story. Some services only offer a free tier for a specific period, and some don't offer anything for free. AWS offers a free tier for its RDS service, but it takes a lot of effort to set up and configure. As I mentioned, AWS offers a free tier for its RDS service. However, setting up an RDS instance can be annoying. First, you need to create a VPC, subnets, and security groups. After that, you need to create your database instance, and finally, configure your database. Firebase is a great solution, as it takes care of all the database setup. You just need to create your project, and connect to the database. However, if you want to use a custom domain, you have to sign up for the ""Blaze"" plan. And if you're just starting out, that may be a bit too expensive. Now, what about AWS DynamoDB? AWS DynamoDB is a non-relational database, and it doesn't have all the features of RDS. However, it's more than enough for small projects. You don't have to worry about server instances, security groups, or any other database administration. It's free for up to 25GB of data, and up to 25,000 requests per month. This article will explain how to use AWS DynamoDB with AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify is a set of libraries that help you connect your front-end app to your AWS services, like AWS AppSync, AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, and more. If you want to skip this step, you can create a new project using AWS Amplify CLI. After running this command, you can see your project in AWS Amplify Console. Click on the ""Create a New App"" button. Choose the ""DynamoDB"" option, and select the ""Hosted"" option. Then, create your DynamoDB table using your AWS Amplify CLI. After creating your table, you can choose the ""Start with a sample"" option in AWS Amplify Console. This will create a sample React application that can be connected to your table. The sample application generated by AWS Amplify is a React application using the React-AWS-Amplify library. You can see the full documentation here. Your DynamoDB table can be connected to your React app by using the withDynamoDB hook. The configuration object is optional. You can also use the withGraphqlClient hook to get access to the GraphQL endpoint. After running the application, you'll be able to see the list of items in your DynamoDB table. If you want to add a new item to the table, you can use the GraphQL endpoint. In the sample React application generated by AWS Amplify, you can find a createNewPost mutation. This mutation will add the new item to the table. With this, you can add a new item to your table. With AWS DynamoDB, you can connect your React app to a database without worrying about server instances or any other database administration. It's free for up to 25GB of data, and up to 25,000 requests per month. However, if you want more features, such as relational tables, you can use AWS RDS.

The test will also screen for drug responses, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and VKORC1. These genes impact how well people metabolize drugs such as warfarin, Coumadin, Plavix, and clopidogrel. The test will also screen for the following diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), celiac disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, primary dystonia, factor XI deficiency, Gaucher disease type 1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hereditary thrombophilia. Women who carry genetic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer, and may be at increased risk of other cancers. 23andMe will also report a person's carrier status for the following diseases: Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, Fanconi anemia group C, Fanconi anemia group G, familial dysautonomia, Gaucher disease type 1, glycogen storage disease type 1A, hereditary hemochromatosis, Mucolipidosis type IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Rett syndrome, and Tay-Sachs disease. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can be passed down from either parent, and the child of a parent with one of these mutations has a 50 chance of inheriting the mutation. If a person's test results indicate that they are a carrier of one of these mutations, it does not mean that they have or will develop the disorder, but rather that they can pass the mutation down to their children. According to the FDA, this test will give people information about possible mutations that are linked to increased risk for conditions that could be avoided or effectively treated. For more information about 23andMe's new service, visit their website. The FDA encourages consumers to check out their webpage: Think Before You Spit! Think Before You Spit! Will answer any questions you may have about genetic testing and what results might mean.",0,270
"China blocked Wikipedia in April, using DNS injections to prevent its citizens from accessing the encyclopedia. There has been no official statement as to why the website was blocked. In the past, China has blocked websites to prevent the spread of information it deems damaging to the Communist Party, or to the country's international image. Wikipedia was not the only site affected. China also blocked online encyclopedias such as Baidu Baike and Hudong. VPNs are the best way for Chinese citizens to access Wikipedia. The Great Firewall of China (GFW) relies on IP blocking and DNS injections to censor its citizens. A VPN will circumvent both of these measures, allowing citizens to access Wikipedia, and any other blocked website, anonymously. Social media and messaging platforms are also common targets for Chinese censors. The GFW has blocked many of the world's most popular apps, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. VPNs are the only way to safely access these services, as they encrypt your internet traffic, preventing the Chinese government from seeing what you're doing online. When you connect to a VPN, you're effectively 'hiding' your computer behind the VPN server's IP address. As a result, the GFW cannot see your computer's IP address, or the content you're accessing. The best VPNs for China use advanced obfuscation techniques, which make it almost impossible to detect you're using a VPN. They also have a large network of servers around the world, giving you plenty of options for overcoming the Great Firewall. Using a VPN is not illegal in China, but it is a gray area. As a result, VPN providers usually don't offer customer support in China, which can be a problem if the app stops working. The best VPNs have excellent customer support outside China. Aside from customer support, the best VPNs for China offer the following key features. Large number of servers around the world - The more servers a VPN has, the more options you have for circumventing the Great Firewall. DNS leak protection - Some VPNs leak your DNS requests, which can give away your true location. DNS leak protection prevents this, and is especially important in China. Obfuscation - The Great Firewall actively tries to block VPN traffic, which is why advanced obfuscation is key. A VPN that uses OpenVPN over TCP is the best option, as it's virtually impossible to detect. Excellent customer support - Although VPNs are not illegal in China, they are a gray area. As a result, many VPN providers don't offer customer support in China. The best VPNs for China offer 247 customer support outside China. ExpressVPN is the best all-around VPN for China. It's incredibly fast, with servers in 94 countries around the world, including multiple servers in Hong Kong. It also has great obfuscation techniques, including OpenVPN over TCP, which is almost impossible for the Great Firewall to block. ExpressVPN is based in the British Virgin Islands, and keeps no logs of your online activity. This is important, as it prevents the Chinese government from accessing your data, even if it demands it from ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN also offers excellent customer support, which you can access outside China. The VPN is available for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux, and works with most routers. BEST VPN FOR CHINA:ExpressVPN is our 1 choice. It offers a vast range of features, the best security, and excellent speeds. A risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee means you can try it risk-free. NordVPN is an excellent choice for China. It has more than 5,100 servers in 60 countries, including servers in Hong Kong and mainland China. NordVPN uses advanced obfuscation techniques to get around the Great Firewall, including OpenVPN over TCP, which is virtually impossible to detect. NordVPN is based in Panama, and keeps no logs of users' online activity. It's fast, secure, and reliable, and offers 247 customer support. NordVPN works with Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and select routers. You can try it risk-free, thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee.

"Mercedes Benz's future Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous driving cars will choose to save drivers before pedestrians in the event of an accident. Driverless vehicles may have to make ethical decisions as a part of their programming, and Daimler AG's luxury car manufacturer Mercedes Benz has already decided on a number of tough choices. Mercedes Benz's future Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous driving cars will choose to save drivers before pedestrians in the event of an accident. While a lot of car manufacturers are investing in autonomous cars, no one really thought about what to do in the event of an accident. As such, the choice has been left to the manufacturers of the autonomous vehicles to decide what to do in the event of an accident. In the case of Mercedes Benz, it has decided to put the driver first, choosing to save the driver over pedestrians. Mercedes Benz's future Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous driving cars will choose to save drivers before pedestrians in the event of an accident. Driverless vehicles may have to make ethical decisions as a part of their programming, and Daimler AG's luxury car manufacturer Mercedes Benz has already decided on a number of tough choices. According to a report from Car and Driver, the company's next-generation cars will be programmed to prioritize saving the driver of the car in the event of an accident. ""If you know you can save at least one person, at least save that one. Save the one in the car,"" Johann Jungwirth, chief digital officer of Daimler AG, told Car and Driver. ""If all you know for sure is that one death can be prevented, then that's your first priority."" While this may not sound that bad, it does create a bit of an issue. For example, if there were a bus full of children in the middle of the road and a driverless Mercedes Benz was heading towards the bus, the car would be programmed to swerve out of the way and hit a tree in order to protect the driver. It seems as if Mercedes Benz has already made the decision, and it seems as if it has decided to save the driver over pedestrians. While that is a bit more selfish than other options, it is hard to argue with the logic. There have been a number of accidents where cars have flipped over and caused injuries to other passengers as well as pedestrians. By making the choice to save the driver, Mercedes Benz is making the decision to save the one who is most likely to survive. Autonomous cars are still a few years away from being released, but it will be interesting to see how other manufacturers decide to program their driverless cars.

"Scientists at the University of Tokyo have created an artificial nose using mosquito odor receptors. The team placed the mosquito receptors on a chip and monitored the setup with a special device called a gas chromatograph. A tiny odor-sensing receptor embedded in mosquito antennae can detect the smell of human beings and be used in an artificial ""nose"" to sniff out people, Japanese scientists said Thursday. The receptor, which is an ionotropic receptor (IR), is responsible for mosquitoes' ability to zero in on humans for a blood meal, according to the research team at the University of Tokyo. When a mosquito takes flight, it is attracted to carbon dioxide emitted by warm-blooded animals, a scent that has also been recreated in traps. But after picking up the plume, the insect must use other sensors to find a suitable meal, with studies suggesting that scent is the main cue. The Tokyo researchers isolated the IR gene from a domestic mosquito and then inserted it into an artificial receptor on a chip. By measuring the electrical activity of the receptor, the team found the IR was most responsive to a compound called nonanal, which is present in sweat and breath and gives off a pungent citrus-like odor. ""Human odor depends on various cues such as body size, gender, and age,"" said Naoki Kamo, who led the study. ""Our next goal is to identify the IRs that detect these characteristics,"" he said. The team also plans to develop an artificial nose that combines multiple types of mosquito IRs, which would improve the accuracy of the detector. The paper was published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",0,276
"Apple's new Human Interface Guidelines suggest that developers place the new 'Sign in with Apple' button in iPhone and iPad apps above other sign-in options. Users generally select the default option, and Apple's hope is that by placing the privacy-focused option first, users will be more likely to choose it. That's a fine reason to put Apple's button at the top, but a new report from The Information suggests that the move is also designed to block competing sign-in options. The report says that Apple's guidelines require that if app developers don't want to list Apple's option first, they also have to offer Facebook and Google sign-in buttons. Forcing developers to include Facebook and Google options in addition to the Apple button effectively prohibits developers from listing other buttons first. If developers aren't allowed to offer a Facebook option instead of Apple's, they also can't offer Google's button instead. The Apple requirement means that most users will select Apple's button first, and if they don't, they'll choose Google or Facebook. The move is designed to ensure that the Apple button gets a significant amount of use, and it also pushes other companies out of the picture.

"Google has come under fire again with the revelation that its Nest Secure product had a built-in microphone. The microphone has existed in the product since launch but was never disclosed until now, prompting privacy concerns. Google says it never intended to use the microphone but has now updated its product to enable its use in the future. The Nest Secure home alarm system is the result of Google's acquisition of Nest, which is owned by parent company Alphabet. The product first launched in 2017 and includes a hub, keypad, and multiple sensors. There's also a Nest Guard, which is the all-in-one alarm, keypad, and motion sensor, which acts as the brains of the operation. As TechCrunch reports, Google only just added a microphone to the Guard but has had one installed since launch. The microphone was never disclosed to customers but Google insists it was never intended to be a secret and was included for future use. The revelation has raised concerns over the extent of Google's data collection and its future plans. In a statement to TechCrunch, Google said the microphone ""has never been on and is only activated when users specifically enable the option."" The microphone's existence was revealed in a software update released this month. According to Google, the microphone was intended to enable the Guard to detect glass breaking and send an alert to the user's phone. The company says the feature was originally planned to launch last year but was delayed. The software update allows the microphone to be used with the Google Assistant in the future. ""The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs. That was an error on our part,"" said a Nest spokesperson. That may be the case, but it's hard to imagine Google would include a microphone in a security product without intending to use it. The company has a track record of surreptitiously collecting data from its users without their consent. Google has agreed to a record 57 million fine in Europe for failing to comply with the EU's GDPR regulations. The company was fined for not properly disclosing to users how their data is used and for failing to obtain permission to show personalized ads.",0,284
"Tesla plans to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US in late 2022. Elon Musk has been talking about opening up the network to other companies' vehicles for years, but this is the first time Tesla has set a concrete date. The announcement came during the company's Q4 2019 earnings call, when CEO Elon Musk was asked if the company's Supercharger network will continue to support the number of new Tesla vehicles hitting the market. He replied: ""It is going to be super tight. We're going to make it, but the Supercharger network will be very full. This is the reason why we announced that we would allow other car manufacturers to use the Supercharger network if they are willing to contribute to the capital costs proportional to their vehicles' use of the network."" Musk said he expects a large portion of those capital costs to be covered by ""the appreciation of the Tesla network,"" which, he said, will grow in value over the next two years. Tesla is also currently making plans for a significant expansion of the Supercharger network in order to support the increased number of vehicles on the road. The Tesla CEO said he expects the Supercharger network to be open to non-Tesla electric vehicles by late 2022, adding that he expects other car manufacturers to be interested in the offer. ""I think it will become apparent that it is better to share the network. I think in the long term, Tesla owners will want to be able to use other manufacturers' Superchargers as well. So, I think it will make sense for Tesla to open it up, and I think that is what we will do in the long term.""

"Microsoft's Edge browser will be upgraded to the Chromium-based version on January 15. Windows 10 users will be automatically transitioned to the new version. The launch date was announced last month, but the exact date was unknown. On the Microsoft blog, the company announced that the new Edge browser will be available on January 15 for Windows 10, 7, and 8.1. The new Chromium version is significantly improved. It is 40 percent faster than the previous version, has better compatibility with existing Chrome extensions, and has a new Collections feature that lets you collect and share websites, images, and files from across the web. The update is not automatic, but users can manually download it from the Microsoft Edge Insider site. For Windows 7 and 8.1, users will need to download the Chrome installation package from the Microsoft Edge Insider website. The reason for the transition to Chromium is that Microsoft is trying to give users a better browsing experience, especially for those who use Google services. Edge's previous engine is no longer competitive with Chrome or Firefox. This is why Microsoft has switched to the Chromium engine that most browsers use today. This will also make it easier for developers to create websites and extensions that work with Edge.

"Coronavirus has traveled across the world, with new cases of the virus being found in non-travelers. The World Health Organization recently warned that the window of opportunity to contain the virus is closing, as cases are being confirmed in countries that were previously disease-free. While China has closed its borders to limit the spread of the virus, new cases have been reported in other countries. As of February 17, the CDC reports that there are 15 confirmed cases in the United States. What is a Coronavirus? The novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, these viruses are spread to humans. Human coronaviruses are common in the United States, and can cause mild to moderate illness. Symptoms include: In more severe cases, coronaviruses can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death. The CDC says that the best way to prevent the virus is to avoid being exposed to it. The organization recommends following good hand hygiene, which includes washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. The CDC also recommends staying home when you are sick, and covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. Symptoms of the new coronavirus may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 after exposure. The CDC recommends that anyone who has traveled to Wuhan, China and feels sick with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing to seek medical care right away. Coronavirus has not been detected in New Jersey, but there are a few confirmed cases in the United States. If you are concerned about your health or the health of a loved one, visit your doctor.

"SpaceX has successfully launched a second crew into orbit inside its Crew Dragon spacecraft. Crew-1 was Crew Dragon's first operational mission. The Crew Dragon will automatically dock to the ISS for a 6-month stay. Crew Dragon Crew-1 After a series of delays, SpaceX is finally ready to conduct its first crew launch. Today, 8 February 2020, the company successfully launched its second crewed mission aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft. The rocket lifted off from LC-39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 14:28:12 UTC, or 9:28:12 AM local time. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off with no issues. The only minor snag was a slight delay of about 10 seconds as a result of a change in the launch trajectory. The rocket delivered the Crew Dragon into a 209 km x 367 km x 51.6 degree orbit. The capsule successfully separated from the Falcon 9 second stage and is now on its way to the ISS. Mission Crew-1 is SpaceX's first operational Crew Dragon mission. The Crew Dragon is taking astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS. They are slated to stay at the ISS for a total of 6 months. The crew arrived at the ISS 6 hours after launch. Historical Launch The Crew Dragon Crew-1 mission is the first time SpaceX has conducted a crewed launch since the Apollo program. The company also became the first private company to do so. This is SpaceX's 19th launch this year. The next launch is slated to be a resupply mission to the ISS. The NG-13 mission will be conducted on 25 February 2020.

"A team of engineers in Korea has designed a new Virtual Reality glove that can create the sensation of touch when manipulating digital objects. VR gloves are not new, but existing systems require a mechanical apparatus that provides tactile feedback to the hand, limiting their portability. The new system, created by Yong Tae Kim and a team of engineers at Korea's Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, uses a novel haptic technology called Lagrangian Dynamics. A user wears a conventional VR glove with sensors that track the motion of the hands. Each of the fingers is attached to a small motor. When the user's hand ""touches"" a virtual object, the corresponding motor causes the finger to bend, thus simulating the feeling of touch. The software relies on Lagrangian Dynamics, a system that was originally developed to simulate physics in computer animation. It calculates the exact amount of resistance that the user should feel when manipulating a given virtual object. The researchers tested their system using a 3D model of a cube. They found that users could reliably distinguish between surfaces that were hard and soft, rough and smooth, with up to 95.5 accuracy. To test the system's effect on user performance, they had users use a VR environment to move objects from one place to another. They found that users of the new system performed these tasks about 20 faster than users of a conventional VR system. The system is still in the prototype stage, but Yong Tae Kim and his colleagues have submitted a patent for their technology. They hope to use it to create a wearable tactile feedback system that can be used with conventional VR gloves.",0,291
"Alphabet and SoftBank recently announced that they successfully ran a stable LTE connection from a solar-powered drone 62,000 feet high. The connection was used to make an international video call. The test drone, a PHASA-35, is manufactured by a SoftBank subsidiary and boasts a 35-meter wingspan. The call was placed using Alphabet's Project Loon LTE network. While the 62,000-foot height of the drone is impressive, the real achievement is the call stability. The test was performed in an area where commercial LTE signals are non-existent. The drone used Alphabet's LTE technology to maintain a stable connection, even while moving at over 100 mph. Alphabet's Project Loon was designed to bring internet access to remote locations, particularly third-world countries. Alphabet launched the project in 2011, when it was still known as Google X. The project launched a fleet of high-altitude balloons that floated in the stratosphere to provide LTE access to remote locations. The balloons are powered by solar panels and are designed to last over 100 days in the air. Google X renamed the project to Project Loon in 2015, and Alphabet incorporated it into its X subsidiary in 2017. SoftBank acquired 14 of Alphabet's Loon in February 2018. The company said it plans to continue testing and development of the Loon balloons in the stratosphere. SoftBank plans to use the Loon technology to provide LTE access to remote areas in Japan. The company also plans to utilize Loon to bring LTE access to areas affected by natural disasters. If SoftBank is successful, Loon could become an integral part of the company's OneWeb project. OneWeb is a global satellite constellation that is designed to provide high-speed LTE connections in remote areas. If Loon becomes stable enough to provide reliable internet access in remote areas, it could play a key role in disaster relief. It could also help bring internet access to third-world countries, which could have a profound impact on their economic development. Want to find out more about Loon and other drone-related news?

"A 3.1 billion dollar deal for Uber to purchase its biggest competitor in the Middle East, Careem, is expected to be made public on March 26. Uber is believed to have acquired the company at a 10 discount to its most recent valuation. Uber is one of the most valuable startups in the world, with a valuation of 72 billion. In 2016, Uber had 84 of the market share for ride hailing apps, compared to 15 for Careem. The deal is the largest in Uber's history. Uber purchased Otto, a self-driving trucking company, in 2016 for 680 million. This comes as Uber prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, but it is unclear whether it will be finalized prior to Uber's IPO. Uber and Careem are popular in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Uber has been under pressure to find a rival in the region that it could acquire and continue to expand. Uber is particularly interested in expanding in markets that don't have a strong competitor. Careem has been particularly effective in Morocco and Pakistan, as well as Egypt and Sudan. It has 30 million customers and 1 million drivers. The deal is the largest in Uber's history. With Uber's acquisition of Careem, a potential IPO of Lyft, the number two ride-sharing company in the United States, is expected to be delayed. Lyft is valued at 15 billion and was expected to go public in early 2019. Uber also purchased Jump Bikes, an electric bike startup, for 100 million in April 2018. Careem is Uber's most direct competitor, operating in 120 cities across 15 countries and more than 300,000 drivers. The company has raised over 775 million since its founding in 2012. Uber has long been considered the ride-sharing app of choice in the Middle East, but Careem has made a strong showing in the region and has even surpassed Uber in some markets. Careem is the only app in the Middle East that accepts cash, which has made it a popular choice in countries that have weak credit card penetration.",0,296
"Jeffrey Berns, CEO of Blockchains LLC, wants the Nevada government to allow companies like his to form local governments on land they own, granting them power over everything from schools to law enforcement. The property rights and regulatory advantages would be a boon to companies in the cannabis business. Berns is buying 67,000 acres in the desert outside Las Vegas. Nevada has no county governments or sales taxes. Jeffrey Berns, CEO of Blockchains LLC. Jeffrey Berns, CEO of Blockchains LLC, wants the Nevada government to allow companies like his to form local governments on land they own, granting them power over everything from schools to law enforcement. The property rights and regulatory advantages would be a boon to companies in the cannabis business. ""We want to be able to create a new city,"" Berns said in an interview on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""We want to be able to create our own school district, create our own fire department, our own police department."" ""We don't want to be a county,"" he added. The property rights and regulatory advantages would be a boon to companies in the cannabis business, which has been legalized in Nevada and many other states but is still prohibited at the federal level. ""Because we're a blockchain company, and we're going to be creating a lot of jobs,"" Berns said. ""We'll be creating a lot of tax revenue. And we would like to have a business-friendly environment."" ""We're really not looking for any special treatment,"" Berns said. ""We're just looking to be treated fairly, and we think that we're being treated unfairly now."" The company is spending millions of dollars to purchase 67,000 acres in the desert outside Las Vegas. Berns said he has an arrangement with the county to buy the land at a price of 100 million to 150 million. ""We're buying it at an extremely low price per acre,"" he said. ""So, we're getting a good deal, and the county is getting a good deal. Everybody's happy."" Berns said he expects to complete the deal by the end of the year, but he still has to find financing to develop the land. Nevada has no county governments or sales taxes, and its two gaming regulatory bodies are highly regarded, which makes the state attractive to cannabis businesses, said Matt Karnes, founder of GreenWave Advisors. ""Cannabis is still federally illegal, so you're going to see operators that are looking to establish their operations in states that have the most friendly regulations,"" Karnes said. He said the regulations in other states are ""extremely onerous."" ""In California, for example, you have to pay a 5,000 per-license application fee,"" Karnes said. ""In New York, they're going to want to see your tax returns, your credit history, and then you still have to go through a background check,"" he added. The state of Nevada already allows the creation of so-called incorporated towns, which have their own governments. Cities that incorporate get a cut of the sales taxes, while unincorporated areas in Nevada receive no portion of the sales tax. Karnes said he sees no problem with Berns' proposal, as long as the county government is satisfied with the arrangement. ""If it's good for the residents of the county, why not?"" he said.",0,297
"This short video shows a synthetic President Obama with an artificial voice introducing a course on deep learning taught at MIT. The entire video is fake and was created using a new AI system that can create very convincing artificial videos of people using only an audio clip and a still image. The researchers behind this project call this new technique ""Synthesizing Obama"" and it uses a neural network that is trained on 14 hours of real Obama footage. The neural network learns the style of speech and the mouth movements for the sounds and then generates the video. As you can see from the video above, the result is extremely convincing and also a little terrifying. This means that soon it will be possible to create very convincing fake news footage that shows people saying things that they never said. The technology behind ""Synthesizing Obama"" is currently a research project but it is not hard to imagine a version of it that will be available to the public very soon. It will most likely be used to create novelty videos like this one of Donald Trump singing the classic hit ""Despacito,"" but could also be used to manipulate people. The video above shows a more extensive demonstration of the technology. This video was created by researchers at the University of Washington who created a system called ""Face2Face"" that can change the facial expressions and head movements of a person in a video in real time. This makes it possible to alter the appearance of someone in a video. For example, if a politician makes a speech, you could change their facial expressions in the video in real time and make it look like they are angry or sad. The same can be done with audio by using a system like ""Synthesizing Obama."" The results of this research project will be presented at the SIGGRAPH conference in July. This kind of technology will be very useful to create better virtual reality experiences and more realistic animations but it also raises some concerns about the verifiability of videos in the future. Imagine that an intelligence agency would create a fake video of a political leader that shows them saying something in a certain way. They could use the facial expression technology to manipulate the face of the person and the voice technology to manipulate the voice. This kind of fake news will be very hard to detect because it will look very convincing to most people. There will always be people who will not be convinced by a fake video, but these people are not the problem. The problem is with people who will not be able to detect a fake video and will believe what they see. The only solution to this problem is to improve the media literacy of the general population. People need to learn to always be skeptical about everything they see and hear. Even today there are a lot of fake videos online that are altered in some way. Just take a look at this video that shows an AI system that can add someone's voice to a video of a person speaking. This technology makes it possible to create fake news footage that is very convincing. It is possible that people will get better at detecting fake videos in the future, but that will require a lot of education. It will also require a lot of effort to figure out what makes a video authentic and what makes it fake. It is easy to tell if a video is fake when it is of very bad quality. It is much harder to tell if a video is fake when it is of very good quality. Media literacy is currently not very high, but we need it to be very high if we want to prevent the spread of fake news. People need to learn to be skeptical about everything they see, but also need to be able to verify if something is fake or not. It is important for people to learn how to verify if a video is fake or not, but the general population also needs to learn what makes a video authentic. This will help to decrease the impact of fake news on society.",0,298

"The United Arab Emirates launched its first interplanetary orbiter, Hope, to Mars in July. It took over six years for the UAE Space Agency to launch the Mars-bound spacecraft, which is the first in the Arab world. The Mars probe is in the final stage of its space journey, and is expected to enter orbit around the planet in February. The Mars probe is set to explore the atmosphere of Mars and study the weather patterns on the planet. The UAE was in the news earlier this month for the country's plan to build the first city on Mars by 2117. The country also announced the plan to build a city on Mars, complete with a model of the red planet in the middle of the desert. The UAE Mars probe was built with a total budget of 270 million, and was developed in the UAE, Japan, and France. The spacecraft is considered to be an Arab-Japanese project. It was built in Japan and carries instruments from France, Japan, and the United States. The Mars probe is expected to study the planet's upper atmosphere in an effort to understand why it has changed over the past few years. It will also study the water loss on the planet. The Mars probe will study the effects of the sun's radiation on the planet and its atmosphere. It is also expected to study the effect of the solar wind on the red planet's atmosphere.

"Twitter is appointing Elon Musk to its board of directors. Musk will serve as a Class II director with a term that expires at Twitter's 2024 annual shareholder meeting. He joins the board two months after being removed as Tesla's chairman for three years, following a settlement with the SEC over his ""funding secured"" tweet. ""Musk and Twitter share many of the same values and goals: the insatiable quest for improvement; a long-term focus, paired with the ability to iterate and iterate quickly; and the optimization of a service - and a company - at scale,"" Twitter said in a statement. ""In addition, Musk's experience with technology, new media, and global markets is aligned with the future direction of Twitter."" Elon Musk's newest tunnel company will build transport systems that include ""autonomous vehicles, people movers, and electric bicycles,"" the billionaire entrepreneur announced in a series of tweets Sunday afternoon. Musk's The Boring Company was initially created to dig tunnels for a hyperloop, an ultra-fast underground transportation system that would carry passengers in pods at speeds of around 600 mph. But in May 2018, Musk said the company would pivot away from the hyperloop system and focus instead on ""an all-boring solution"" - more tunnels, but no hyperloop. At a Tesla event Thursday night, Elon Musk unveiled the all-electric company's newest vehicle, the Model Y crossover SUV. The vehicle was highly anticipated by fans and analysts, as the Model 3 - Tesla's first mass-market vehicle - has been a success. However, questions remain about Tesla's ability to deliver on its promises of high production and low prices, and whether the Model Y will be any different. Here's what we know about the vehicle so far. On Thursday evening, Tesla will finally unveil its Model Y crossover SUV. The Model Y is expected to be about 10 larger than Tesla's Model 3 sedan and will likely be priced starting at about 40,000. In the third quarter of 2018, the Model 3 became the best-selling car in America by revenue, passing up the Ford F-150. In a post on the Tesla blog Friday afternoon, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting its workforce by 7. The move comes as Tesla attempts to deliver its first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3, to customers in the hundreds of thousands. Elon Musk has said the Tesla Semi will retail for 150,000 to 180,000 - but customers will have to pay an extra 30,000 to get the version that can drive itself. Tesla unveiled its all-electric, nearly autonomous Semi in November. The base model of the Semi will have a 300-mile range and a 500-mile range will be available for an additional 30,000, Musk said at the unveiling event. But the version of the Semi that can drive itself will cost an additional 30,000 on top of that. Elon Musk, the founder of the Boring Company, has set a goal for the company to beat the fastest bullet trains in China and Japan by 2021. Musk's latest project aims to build a network of tunnels underneath cities to reduce traffic and build a high-speed transportation system. Musk wants the Loop system to beat the 275 mph maximum speed of Japan's bullet trains. Elon Musk is preparing to launch a new company called Neuralink, which will focus on developing technology that connects our brains to our smart devices. Musk has hinted at the existence of Neuralink a few times over the last six months or so.

"Jerdon's jumping worker ants can become reproductive queens when their queens die. The transition comes with changes to the ant's brain, gene expression, hormone levels, and cell composition. Researchers have found that a protein, SfSPH, is involved in those changes. Credit: Tatyana Livshyts Ants are social insects that typically live in nests of a single breed, or ""caste,"" which consists of wingless females who are workers that forage for food and care for the young. But in some species, worker ants can develop wings and take on the role of a reproductive female when their queen dies. The switch from worker to queen is accompanied by a shift in the way the ant's brain is wired, changes in its gene expression, and hormone levels, and a change in the composition of the cells that make up the brain. A team of scientists led by Rockefeller University's Daniel Kronauer is studying these changes. In a new paper published in PLOS Biology, they report that a single protein, SfSPH, is involved in both the dramatic shift in brain function as well as the shift in brain composition. The discovery came when the researchers set out to uncover the function of a protein called SfSPH, which they found was produced in the brains of young workers and queens, but not in the brains of older workers. ""This protein is a member of a family of proteins that are involved in embryonic development,"" Kronauer says. ""In flies and worms, other members of the SPH family of proteins control cell division and morphology during development. But we didn't see any changes in the cell number or shape of the ant brain after the ants transitioned to queens. We wondered what was going on."" To investigate, the researchers turned to a technique that Kronauer's lab has used in the past to study the connections between ants' brains and behavior. In this case, they used a toxin to remove the SfSPH protein from the brains of workers who were in the process of becoming queens. The toxin only affected a single type of cell in the ant's brain. ""We found that the ants treated with the toxin did not go on to become queens,"" says Kronauer. ""They became workers, and only workers."" Ants that received the toxin treatment maintained the brain composition and connections of a worker, suggesting that SfSPH plays an essential role in the dramatic changes that take place in a worker ant's brain when it becomes a queen. The researchers also found that SfSPH is involved in regulating a reproductive hormone. When they treated the transitioning workers with the toxin, the levels of the hormone - called Duf - dropped. Without SfSPH, the workers never made the transition to queen. ""This is an important first step toward understanding how neural plasticity is involved in controlling behavior,"" says Kronauer.

"In recent years, China has created an armada of huge ships that dredge up sand from the ocean floor. The largest of these ships can suck up 8,000 cubic yards of sand and silt in an hour and dump it miles away. That's almost three times the amount of sand that the largest U.S. dredge can move in an hour. More than 300 of China's ships now are engaged in such dredging. China is literally building new islands out of sand and then fortifying them with air bases and missile launchers. A 2016 report from the U.S. Department of Defense, which notes that China is expanding its military presence in the South China Sea, does not mention sand dredging. Nor does the Pentagon's most recent annual report on China's military power. China's use of dredging is not a new strategy, but it's one that's been relatively overlooked in discussions of China's expansion, says Collin Koh, an expert on maritime security at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""It's not so much a novel idea,"" Koh says. ""It's something that they've been doing since the 1950s."" Koh says that in the past 10 years, China has expanded its dredging and land reclamation efforts, which has allowed it to build up military bases on its newly created islands. Sand dredging is not a benign process. It can create a new landmass, but it destroys reefs and fish habitats. ""The sand dredging process is extremely harmful to the environment,"" says Gregory Poling, an expert on Asia's maritime disputes at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""When you think about the impact on fishing and fisheries, it's very significant."" The practice is so controversial that the U.S. and most other industrialized countries have outlawed it. A fishing boat is seen in the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea, on June 27, 2017. China has constructed military facilities on artificial islands in the South China Sea. Linh Pham Getty Images ""China is the largest dredger in the world,"" says Renee Yohannan, a spokesperson for the International Association of Dredging Contractors, based in the Netherlands. ""No other country comes close."" China's dredging is contributing to its military expansion. Last week, the Pentagon accused China of installing anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems on three of its outposts in the South China Sea, which are built on dredged sand. China's Foreign Ministry denied that, but acknowledged that China has ""limited defensive facilities"" on its islands to defend its territory. Koh says that China has made a ""huge strategic investment"" in its artificial islands, including the construction of long runways for its military aircraft. ""The islands give it de facto control over some of the strategic choke points in the South China Sea,"" he says. China's massive dredging fleet also makes it a big player in the global dredging business, with its state-owned China Communications Construction Company, or CCCC, one of the world's largest marine engineering firms. Yohannan says Chinese firms have won bids to dredge ports and build artificial islands in the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa. China's dredging activities have also led to political opposition and environmental lawsuits, including in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. China has also used its dredging equipment to aid other countries. In April, Chinese dredging vessels arrived in Malaysia to help in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. China's dredgers also helped to find the wreckage of a Russian commercial jet that crashed in the Black Sea in December 2016. Poling says that China's use of dredging to expand its territory in the South China Sea is unlikely to be repeated elsewhere, though. ""South China Sea is a really unique situation,"" he says. ""There are a lot of places where China has disputes, but not a place where it has this many disputes with this many different countries that are also U.S. allies."" What is happening in the South China Sea is not a new strategy, but it's one that's been relatively overlooked in discussions",0,304

"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System, which is also known as the ""Pain Ray"" is a type of ""directed energy weapon."" The Pain Ray is a device that uses microwaves to send a beam of energy that causes pain by heating up the skin. It is often seen as a less-than-lethal weapon that the military could use to stop vehicles or crowds of people. The new Pain Ray device was displayed at the China International Exhibition on Police Equipment on October 21st, 2015 in Beijing. The device is reportedly capable of disrupting an individual's ability to concentrate in 3 seconds by sending a beam of energy that causes a burning sensation on the skin. The microwave beam produced by the device can reach a range of 80 meters and has an accuracy of 1 meter. The Pain Ray is designed to be mounted on a vehicle or at a fixed point and be used to stop individuals or crowds of people. The weapon was also designed to be able to function under a wide range of weather conditions. The Pain Ray is said to be non-lethal, but it is possible that the beam could cause permanent damage if it were to be aimed at a person's eyes. The video below from China Central Television, or CCTV, features the Pain Ray being tested.",0,307

"A Florida-based unmanned trucking company, Starsky Robotics, has set a record for the fastest that an unmanned truck has driven on a public road. It hit 55 MPH in a test on a closed section of a Florida highway. The truck drove for a total of seven miles, but was not carrying a load. Starsky Robotics is one of many companies competing to create self-driving commercial vehicles. Grocery delivery startup Postmates announced that it's testing its own autonomous delivery vehicles in Los Angeles. The first one is a specially modified Ford Transit van. It will deliver take-out food, groceries, and other items. The vehicle will be operated by a human driver, but will drive autonomously, at least part of the time. The company says it will have a safety driver inside, just in case. The vehicles will be able to make deliveries from merchants to customers. The delivery service will be free during the testing period, but eventually it will charge a fee. The startup plans to use a variety of vehicles, and some will be custom-built for the company. It plans to have a fleet of about 100 of the vans on the road by the end of 2019. Starship Technologies has introduced a new autonomous delivery robot called the Starship 200. The company makes autonomous robots that carry packages from stores or warehouses to customers in a limited geographic area. The Starship 200 is the second generation of the company's robots. The new version is lighter and faster. The company says it can cross a busy city street in just 25 seconds. The new version also has an improved sensor array, including four cameras and an extra three radar units. This is the first of a new series of blog posts I'll be doing on self-driving cars.

"This is a newsletter about CSS layouts (flexboxes, grids, modals, and all that good stuff). If you often find yourself googling stuff like ""vertical align not working,"" you might want to subscribe. Congratulations! You've created a modal, and it's working great. But then someone asks you to make the modal's background blue. Now what? Modals typically use multiple positioning techniques, so you'll have to override a few things to change its background color. Step 1: Decide where to put the blue background. I'm going to put it inside the modal element, but you could also put it in the dialog element. Step 2: Set the background color. Now the blue background covers everything inside the modal element. But we want to cover the entire modal, so we're not done. Step 3: Make the dialog element's padding go away. The dialog element has some default padding around its content. That padding doesn't show up when the modal is closed, but it does show up when the modal is open. So, let's get rid of it. Step 4: Make the modal element's height go away. The modal element is absolutely positioned, and it has a height of 100. That's what makes the modal cover the entire screen. But it also makes the modal cover the dialog's padding, which is too much. So, we'll set the height to 0. Step 5: Make the modal element cover the whole screen again. Now that the modal element has no height, it doesn't cover the entire screen. We want the blue background to cover the entire screen, so let's set the modal element's top and bottom values to 0. Step 6: Make the dialog element cover the entire modal. Since we removed the modal element's height, the dialog element doesn't stretch to fill the entire modal. We'll fix that by removing the dialog element's height. Congratulations! You've changed the modal's background color. But what if you want the blue background to cover everything except the dialog's content? This is called a ""modal background,"" and it's pretty easy to make. Step 1: Put the blue background inside the modal element. This time, we're going to put the blue background inside the modal element. Step 2: Put the dialog element inside the blue background. Now the dialog element is inside the blue background, but it doesn't cover the whole blue background. It needs a bit of padding around its content, so it doesn't touch the edges of the blue background. Step 3: Make the dialog element's padding cover the whole blue background. In the previous section, we used the padding property to remove the dialog element's padding, which is the amount of space around its content. But now we want to do the opposite, so let's use the padding property to create some space around the dialog element. Step 4: Make the dialog element cover the entire screen. The dialog element's content covers the entire screen, but its blue background doesn't cover the entire screen. So let's give the dialog element a height of 100. Step 5: Make the modal element cover the whole screen again. Now that we've put the dialog element inside the blue background, we can set the modal element's height to 100 again. If you're trying to make a modal, and you get stuck, try to figure out which elements you're missing. All modals have three elements. The outer element is the element that contains the entire modal. It's usually positioned relative. The container element is the element that contains the content inside the modal. It's usually positioned absolute. The content element is the element that contains the dialog's content. It's usually positioned relative. And if you need help with any of those elements, read this article.",0,314
"The Virgin Hyperloop is a transport system that features high-tech pods zooming through tunnels at speeds of up to 760 miles an hour using magnetic levitation. It is supposed to be energy efficient, safe, clean and quieter than a high-speed train. The idea is to create the first hyperloop system connecting the major centers of the UAE, and eventually the Gulf region, with speeds three to four times faster than the airlines and two to three times faster than high-speed rail. It is still in its early stages, but Musk has said he is keen to help build it. ""I believe Virgin Hyperloop One is the only company in the world that can solve the growing transportation crisis in this country,"" said Josh Giegel, the co-founder and chief technology officer at Virgin Hyperloop One. He said the company had been testing the technology for three years, including building a full-scale test track in Nevada. ""We have tested the pod, we've tested the motor, we've tested the vehicle suspension system,"" he said. ""I think we're the farthest along. But I think we're all still early, I think we're all still early,"" Giegel said. He said the next step was to continue testing the system and then create a commercial product. ""We're excited to deploy this first in the United Arab Emirates. But we're also very excited to bring this technology around the world,"" he added. The high-speed hyperloop system was unveiled in Dubai on November 8, 2016 by US start-up Hyperloop One, which has partnered with Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the firm founded by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, and the infrastructure firm AECOM. Virgin Hyperloop One is working on the project with Dubai's Road Transport Authority. The pod lifts above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to low aerodynamic drag. It is supported by magnetic levitation and electromagnetic propulsion. It would have limited autonomous operations, with most safety-critical functions being automated and designed not to fail. The pod would carry between 8 and 10 people and be accelerated via a magnetic linear accelerator affixed at various stations on the low-pressure tube. The linear accelerator would accelerate the pod to high subsonic speeds. The pod would then glide (float on air) for the rest of the journey. The company said each pod would have 28 seats and travel at 1,100 kilometers (683 miles) per hour. The cost for a ticket would be around 30, Giegel said. Each pod would cost about 8 million, Giegel said. The company says it can take a traveler from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in 12 minutes, compared to a two-hour drive by car. Dubai to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia - some 1,100 kilometers (683 miles) - would take 48 minutes. ""Imagine that you can live in Dubai and be in Riyadh in 48 minutes,"" Giegel said. ""We're excited about this project."" The Virgin Hyperloop One company was testing a full-scale test track in Nevada for three years. The test track was 500 meters long and the vehicle traveled at 387 kilometers per hour (240 miles per hour). The team is now working on their next vehicle, which will be tested at 300 meters per second, Giegel said. Monday, November 13, 2017 11:30 AM IST, Dubai Hyperloop One says it plans to start testing in 2020 and have it running in three years. Virgin Hyperloop One unveiled a prototype of a high-speed transportation system that could travel at speeds of up to 1,100 kilometers per hour (683 miles per hour).

Waymo just announced that it hit 10 million miles in real world testing of its self-driving cars. However, the company also uses a simulator to drive 10 million test miles every day, too. That means that Waymo has driven 10 million miles on the road, and 2.5 billion miles in the virtual world. As the company explains in a blog post, the simulation software helps Waymo test out new features, situations, and even parts of the car before it takes them out into the real world. For example, Waymo has been using simulators to test out new sensor configurations to see if they'll work, and recently used them to test the new Waymo One minivans before the vehicles hit the road. Above: Waymo simulator testing out different sensor configurations. Waymo also uses its simulator to test out new features and software, and runs through different scenarios to make sure the self-driving software is performing properly. As the company puts it, ""By going through every step of a drive, from start to finish, this approach helps us test new features and edge cases in a systematic way. It allows us to refine our driving software at the component level - everything from identifying objects on the road to planning a safe route to a destination."" To make these simulations as accurate as possible, Waymo has created a virtual world that resembles Phoenix, Arizona - the location where the company is currently testing its self-driving cars. ""We've painstakingly created a virtual world that models every road, lane, and intersection in our test market of Phoenix, Arizona - a 200 square mile city - and we've equipped our simulated vehicles with the same sensors and software used on our physical vehicles,"" Waymo explains. Waymo says it will continue to use simulations to test out features and self-driving software and plans to double down on its simulation efforts in the future.

"Two centuries ago, it was established that the average human body temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius. Scientists have noticed a drop in average body temperature in the modern age and are trying to determine why. The first attempt to measure a body's internal temperature was in 1768. British physician Dr. Thomas Allbutt determined the average body temperature to be 96 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35.6 degrees Celsius. In 1868, Carl Wunderlich, a German doctor, examined the body temperature of a million patients and determined that the average internal body temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius. In the 20th century, the average body temperature in the United States was found to be 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 36.8 degrees Celsius. In the 21st century, the average body temperature in the United States was found to be 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 36.5 degrees Celsius. Dr. Julie Parsonnet, a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said, ""There's a very small but statistically significant decline of body temperature in the United States."" ""If you were to go to the doctor's office and you have a fever, they would take your temperature. If you had a temperature below 98.6, they would say, 'You don't have a fever.' But if everybody's baseline body temperature is lower than 98.6, then that would lead to millions of people incorrectly diagnosed as feverish."" The drop in body temperature in the modern age could be due to any number of factors. The amount of calories consumed in the modern age could be a factor, as it is known that the metabolic rate of a body drops after eating a large meal. Another factor could be the invention of the thermometer. Before the 19th century, a person's temperature was determined by touching their head or armpit. A third possible factor is air conditioning. The invention of air conditioning brought down the average room temperature to 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or 22.2 degrees Celsius, from 82 degrees Fahrenheit, or 27.8 degrees Celsius. Dr. Parsonnet said, ""We are not adapted to live in the environment we have created. We are a tropical species. We sweat. We are not furry. Our default is to be naked."" Other factors that could have contributed to the drop in body temperature include the fact that people are now spending more time indoors than they did before the advent of modern technology, and because of the availability of clean water, the human body is now better hydrated.

"Elon Musk has laid out how he will fund the 46.5 billion purchase of Twitter. Musk will receive loans from Morgan Stanley worth 25.5 billion and cover the remaining 21 billion through the sale of his portfolio of cryptocurrencies. Musk has a net worth of 22.1 billion and owns 20 of Tesla's shares and 40 of SolarCity's shares. The Morgan Stanley loans will be secured against these shares and the 21 billion of cryptocurrencies. Musk has made some remarkable profits from investing in cryptocurrencies, starting to invest in early 2010, however the profit has been at the expense of other investments, such as gold. Musk is planning to make Tesla a crypto only business, allowing the purchase of vehicles with Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether. Tesla's electric cars have been the best selling electric cars in the world since 2014. Musk plans to use some of the profits from the sale of the cars to fund the development of a flying car. Musk has also been making profits from investments in Bitcoin mining operations. The profits from the investments will be used to fund the research into a faster than light warp drive. Many have commented that these plans are unrealistic, and that Tesla should focus on what they are good at, however Musk is not deterred. Elon Musk has a track record of being a visionary, being the founder of PayPal, the leading online payment system, and SpaceX, the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station. He has also made plans to colonize Mars. Musk is a big believer in Bitcoin and has invested 200 million in the cryptocurrency. He was also an early adopter of Litecoin and Ether. His investment in Litecoin was particularly lucrative as he bought in when it was worth 10 cents.",0,320
"Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving Beta v9 update. It uses Tesla Vision, a computer vision system that relies on optical imagery. The release notes do not reveal many details of the change. There is one clear improvement: Tesla vehicles with the beta update can now match speeds to surrounding traffic. The owner manual says this feature is supposed to allow the vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to ""match the speed of surrounding traffic conditions."" This could be an important first step towards autonomous driving. The update was pushed out to Tesla owners last week. Since Tesla updates are transmitted over the air, owners should have no trouble receiving the update. The update is being pushed out to more vehicles, but it has not been made available for all. Tesla is committed to improving self-driving software. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been public about the company's work to produce a vehicle that can drive itself. Musk has taken to social media to discuss the beta release, saying the update is ""a major improvement."" Musk has not specified what the major improvement is. Tesla's vehicles are already among the most advanced on the road, but Tesla is not satisfied. The company has consistently released updates to their existing fleet of vehicles, which has made them more effective. Tesla's decision to push out these updates has been met with controversy. Some believe that Tesla is not doing enough to ensure the safety of the updates before sending them out. Others believe that Tesla is trying to do the right thing by using the fleet of vehicles as a beta tester for their self-driving software. The update does not seem to have major bugs. According to the release notes, the update is only supposed to fix ""minor reliability issues."" The update is supposed to fix problems with the Autopilot not engaging and the vehicle moving when it is set to park. Tesla Vision uses a combination of cameras and radar to detect other vehicles on the road. Tesla Vision was first announced in October of 2016. It was announced alongside Tesla's Full Self-Driving Hardware package, which was made available for all Tesla vehicles. Tesla's vehicles can be retrofitted with the package for 5,000. The software package is not available yet. The release notes for Full Self-Driving Beta v9 do not include any information about the software. The notes are focused on improvements to the user interface. The notes do say that the system ""uses the same neural net as the primary camera in neural net v3.0."" It is possible that this update will change the way Tesla owners interact with their vehicles. Since Tesla updates can be pushed out over the air, the company can easily test new features. Tesla has been releasing multiple updates since it first began manufacturing vehicles. The company has made it a priority to make their vehicles as advanced as possible. Tesla has been leading the way in autonomous vehicle technology. The company has made a name for itself in the industry and has inspired other automakers to follow suit. Tesla continues to release updates for their vehicles, which are some of the most advanced on the road.",0,321
"The Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) fusion reactor in China reached temperatures of 70 million degrees Celsius, five times hotter than the Sun, for more than 17 minutes during a test on February 24, 2017. The team was able to sustain the plasma for a record 400 seconds, and also achieved a record-high electron temperature of 50 million degrees Celsius in the core of the plasma. According to the team, it is the first time that plasma temperature and performance has been able to be maintained at that level for that long. The breakthrough means that fusion energy could one day be used to power future generations. The EAST reactor is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world and is a key part of China's plans to establish itself as a major player in the field of nuclear fusion. The reactor was built in 2006 and is located at the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science. The project is funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and supported by the ITER international nuclear fusion project. According to the ITER website, the aim of fusion power is to generate large amounts of electricity by fusing light elements in a hot plasma. Unlike nuclear fission reactors, which split heavy atoms into smaller elements, fusion reactors combine light atoms, such as hydrogen, to produce heavier elements, such as helium. The process produces neutrons that can be used to drive turbines and produce electricity or be used for other industrial purposes. It is estimated that just 50 kg of deuterium extracted from water could produce as much energy as 10,000 tonnes of coal. The process also has a minimal impact on the environment, as there are no greenhouse gas emissions. The main by-product of nuclear fusion is helium, which is not harmful to the environment. The team at EAST reactor said the breakthrough will provide the foundation for China's next-generation superconducting tokamak reactor, which is expected to be operational by 2020. ITER is building the world's largest tokamak in the south of France, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2025. The ITER reactor will use hydrogen fusion to generate electricity and is expected to produce 500 MW of power.",0,322
"A group of Instacart employees voted to unionize with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 on Saturday. Managers distributed anti-union literature prior to the vote, claiming that a union could cause Instacart to go out of business. ""We are pleased to announce that a majority of our Instacart shoppers have voted in favor of collective bargaining representation with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW),"" a company representative said in a statement. ""We remain committed to providing shoppers with a valuable earning opportunity and a supportive work environment. Instacart will continue to meet with the UFCW and our shoppers to develop a collective bargaining agreement."" The Instacart employees who voted to unionize on Saturday are among the company's part-time workers. Instacart's contract workers are paid a variable hourly wage plus tips. This hourly wage can drop to less than minimum wage when tips are low. A majority of the shoppers are paid an hourly wage of 10, but this number can fluctuate depending on how busy their area is. The company pays a base rate per order, then tips are distributed among the workers afterward. If the tips come out to less than 10 per hour, Instacart makes up the difference. Workers are required to use their own cars to make deliveries. Customers can order groceries from a variety of local stores through the Instacart app, then the shoppers purchase and deliver the items. Instacart workers can earn up to 25 per hour, but only when they receive high tips from customers. The 10 hourly wage can drop to less than the minimum wage of 7.25 per hour, which is less than what workers earn at many grocery stores. Instacart workers are also worried that the company will cut their hourly wage from 10 to 7.25 per hour. The company said this was not the case, but some workers are worried that Instacart could change its pricing structure. ""While the company has communicated with us that it does not intend to change how shoppers are paid, we are concerned that the company may do so in the future, and we are hopeful that a union contract will provide protections should such a change take place,"" the union said in a statement. A new contract would allow Instacart workers to have a say in their wages. Instacart has 17,000 shoppers in 17 states, and the union vote was only open to the 700 shoppers who work in the Seattle area. Workers voted to unionize after Instacart eliminated a 3 quality bonus. This bonus was given to workers who received high ratings from customers. Many workers also believe that the company undercuts their tips by taking a 10 percent service fee. The union vote is non-binding, which means the company does not have to agree to negotiate a contract. In 2014, the NLRB ruled that companies that use contract workers are responsible for those workers, which means Instacart could be forced to negotiate with the union. Instacart was recently valued at 2 billion after a round of funding last month.

"Solar panels emit infrared radiation at night. The photons going out into the night sky cool down the solar cell. This temperature difference can be used to generate electricity using the thermoelectric effect. The solar cells are made of semiconductor material (such as silicon). The semiconductor material can be doped, adding impurities to the semiconductor, to improve its electrical properties. In the case of silicon the impurity is boron or phosphorus. Doping silicon with boron creates a P-type semiconductor. Doping silicon with phosphorus creates an N-type semiconductor. Doping silicon with a mix of boron and phosphorus creates a P-N junction. The solar cell works by the P-N junction. Solar panels are connected in series. In series, the voltage of each solar cell is added together to give the total voltage. In the case of solar power, the current is not added together. To maximize power output the solar panels should be connected in parallel. In parallel, the current of each solar cell is added together to give the total current. The maximum power point is the point at which the power is at its maximum. The maximum power point changes with temperature. At lower temperature, the maximum power point is at a lower voltage. At higher temperature, the maximum power point is at a higher voltage. Solar panels are covered with glass. The solar cell works by the P-N junction. There is an electric field across the junction. The electric field repels electrons and attracts holes. When sunlight (photons) hit the solar cell, it excites the electrons. The electric field pushes the electrons from the N-type semiconductor to the P-type semiconductor. This creates a current. The inverter converts DC power to AC power. Solar panels are more efficient at higher temperatures. Solar panels are less efficient at higher temperatures.

"Four years ago in San Francisco, more than 700 engineers competed in a competition to build an AI system that could pass an 8th-grade test. 80,000 in prize money was distributed to the winners, and the competition itself marked the beginning of a new, more sophisticated era of AI. In an article by The Economist, the competition was a hallmark moment in the development of AI, and one that is as important today as it was back then. The winning team was made up of a group of engineers from the University of Toronto, who built an algorithm that can answer questions by searching the internet. The team began by feeding the algorithm text from Wikipedia, encyclopaedia entries, and other sources. When tested, the algorithm could not only answer the questions it was asked, but it was able to determine which questions were the most important to answer. AI is an important part of our everyday lives, and it is only getting more so. It is used in everything from recommending a book to buy, to telling us how to get to a destination we have never been before. It is even used to determine which ads we see on our Facebook feed. It is important that we take a step back and look at how AI has developed and how it is influencing the world.

"Uber and Lyft have been awarded a five-year 810 million transportation contract by the US government to provide transportation for federal employees and their families. It is unclear how the contract will be divided between the two companies. Uber and Lyft have been awarded a five-year, 810 million transportation contract by the US government to provide transportation for federal employees and their families. ""We are excited about this opportunity to provide riders a convenient, reliable transportation option when they need to travel on official government business,"" a Lyft spokesperson said. It is unclear how the contract will be divided between the two companies. Lyft did not respond to requests for comment, while Uber did not immediately return a request for comment. The government's move toward providing transportation as a service through the cloud comes after Uber and Lyft earlier this year began to push further into the business travel market. The companies are both now members of the Global Business Travel Association, the trade group for corporate travel managers. The US government's move toward the ride-sharing companies follows a new development in the city of Portland, Oregon, which has paved the way for Uber and Lyft to operate at the city's airport. The Portland City Council voted unanimously to allow the ride-sharing companies to pick up and drop off passengers at Portland International Airport, starting October 1. The vote comes after the companies had been operating in a pilot program at the airport since December. Lyft has already begun operating at the airport, while Uber is expected to start operations shortly. To operate at the airport, both companies had to pay a 3.25 fee for each pickup and drop-off, according to the Portland Bureau of Transportation. The new rules also require that both companies follow insurance requirements set out by the city.",0,328
"Particle3D is a company that is pioneering a novel method for 3D printing lightweight, customized bone implants that fuse with the skeleton before slowly disappearing. While surgeons have been using allogenic bone grafts (bone fragments taken from a deceased donor) and synthetic materials for years, bone implants have the potential to improve the surgical process and patient outcomes. Several years ago, Particle3D was a software development company. Today, it is using software and 3D printers to make a full range of bone implants, from customized dental implants to larger bone replacements. In the dental market, there is a significant need for 3D-printed bone implants. For example, a dental implant manufacturer estimates that 3.7 million Americans need dental implants, while only 500,000 actually get them. There is also a significant market for larger bone replacements. For example, 700,000 knee replacements are performed every year, and 130,000 hip replacements are performed every year. Particle3D was founded in 2015 by Dr. Ray Dunn, who serves as the chief executive officer. A self-described ""serial entrepreneur,"" Dunn was the founder of Dunn Solutions Group, which was purchased by a public company in 2005. He was also the founder of DigiPointe, a software development company that he sold to a private equity firm in 2015. The company's chief technology officer, Dr. Darius Shafaie, earned his Ph.D. in materials science from the University of California, San Diego. Shafaie is also a professor at the University of San Diego, where he teaches courses on chemistry, materials science, and advanced materials. The company has also brought on a number of 3D printing and medical device experts. Its vice president of marketing, Michael Vogel, previously held roles at Biomet and Zimmer-Biomet, two orthopedics companies. Particle3D has also hired its own dentist, Dr. Clifford Stallmann. He is the head of the company's dental division and the president of Stallmann Orthodontics in San Diego, where he has practiced orthodontics for more than 20 years. Particle3D has raised 1.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. The company raised a 500,000 seed round in 2015 and a 1 million seed round in 2016. The company's main investor is MentorTech Ventures, a San Diego-based venture capital firm that focuses on software, medical devices, and life sciences. MentorTech Ventures led the company's 500,000 seed round in 2015. Particle3D's novel method for 3D printing bone implants has the potential to disrupt the industry. While Particle3D is not the first company to produce 3D-printed bone implants, its bone implants are 30 to 40 percent lighter than existing bone implants and are the first to be designed to disintegrate over time. Particle3D's bone implants are made from a proprietary material that is comprised of tricalcium phosphate and resorbable polymers. Tricalcium phosphate is a ceramic commonly used in bone cements and allogenic bone grafts. Resorbable polymers, which are used in sutures, bone pins, and orthopedic implants, disintegrate over time, helping to prevent infection and inflammation. By combining tricalcium phosphate with resorbable polymers, Particle3D was able to create a bone implant that is significantly lighter than existing bone implants and able to be customized for a patient's bone structure. ""The biggest advantage is that ours is the first implant that is designed to disintegrate over time,"" Dunn said. Bone implants made from Particle3D's material are also stronger than existing bone implants, as Particle3D's proprietary material has a compressive strength of 170 MPa. This compares to existing bone implants, which have a compressive strength of 70 to 90 MPa. The company",0,330

"Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans learn to walk by interacting with the world, by falling, and by making mistakes. To better understand how this adaptive learning works, the researchers used an agent to interact with a virtual world, and by observing how the agent adapted to the terrain in that virtual world, the researchers were able to extract the principles that could be applied to real-world walking robots. The new model, Rapid Motor Adaptation, offers a way to enable a robot to learn to navigate a physical environment through trial and error. The system consists of a learning agent and a planner. The planner identifies obstacles and plans a path the robot can follow that will allow it to reach the goal. The learning agent controls the robot, which gathers new data on the environment as it interacts with it. The learning agent then uses the new data to make small changes to the behavior of the robot. This process continues until the robot reaches the goal. The learning agent uses what is known as a hierarchical representation to make adjustments to the robot's behavior. That means that the agent makes changes to the robot's gait and balance first. Only if those changes don't allow the robot to reach the goal will the agent make changes to the robot's walking behavior. The researchers tested the model in simulations and then on a real-world robot, the Cassie bipedal robot. The system was able to successfully navigate unfamiliar terrain and climb stairs. The model is a form of reinforcement learning. The agent learns through trial and error, and it is able to adapt quickly. The system is also efficient because it is only the learning agent that is updating as the robot walks, and the planner is not updating during this time. ""The key to this system is that it learns to adapt the gait and step size to the terrain,"" said Sergey Levine, assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab. ""This system is a first step towards robots that can learn to master their environment through interaction.""

Facebook's Novi coin is set to debut in the United States and Guatemala in a pilot program. Users in both countries will be able to purchase Paxos Dollar (USDP) using Novi, with Novi depositing the coins into the user's bank account. Facebook is rolling out its Novi wallet in the United States and Guatemala in a pilot program. The social media giant is a founding member of the Libra Association. The Libra Association has 28 members in total, including Visa, PayPal, Uber, and Coinbase. Novi is a Facebook subsidiary that makes it easier for people to pay for goods and services using Facebook's messaging app. The app is also used to send messages and make video and voice calls. The Libra Association is a nonprofit that will oversee the Libra blockchain, which is a digital currency that will be backed by a reserve of real assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities. The Facebook subsidiary Novi announced that it is ""working with regulators in the United States to secure appropriate approvals and licenses"" in order to conduct the pilot program in the two countries. Paxos Standard is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and is the first regulated stablecoin to be listed on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Last year, Paxos issued 100 million USDP coins, with each token backed by one dollar of US dollar reserves held by the company in FDIC-insured banks. Paxos says that it ""meets the strictest regulatory requirements and is the only stablecoin in the world that has been granted approval by the New York Department of Financial Services."" Earlier this year, Paxos introduced a solution that allows traders to leverage their Paxos Standard tokens. The solution is called Paxos Standard Levered Ether (PAXETH). Following the launch of PAXETH, Paxos also launched a new stablecoin, called Paxos Standard Gold (PAXG), which is pegged to gold. Novi will be partnering with Paxos to make the transactions possible. US regulators have been skeptical of Libra's potential.

"Our brain perceives what we see in 3D by processing and combining the images from both of our eyes. A new study shows that cuttlefish also perceive the world similarly. Like humans, cuttlefish use information from both of their eyes to form a 3D view of the world around them. This was shown in a new study that revealed that the cuttlefish's visual system functions similar to that of humans. ""Our results suggest that the cuttlefish visual system is similar to that of humans and primates,"" said Vivek Nityananda, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and the first author of the study. Scientists had previously shown that vertebrates use the differences between the images from each eye to perceive depth. It is called stereopsis, and the ability is believed to be absent in invertebrates like cuttlefish. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the cuttlefish's eyes were working together to create a 3D image, similar to the way human eyes do. The team designed a setup with two screens and a cylinder where cuttlefish swam. They showed different images on each screen and created an illusion of depth. They then observed how the cuttlefish responded to the images. By observing the cuttlefish's eye movements, they found that the invertebrates reacted to the illusion of depth. This shows that the cuttlefish's visual system is using the differences between the images from each eye to perceive depth, similar to the way human eyes do.

Here are some things to watch out for and some tips to help you avoid office-based work-at-home scams: If you receive an unsolicited email offering you a job with a company, then the company is probably a scam. Companies should never ask you to pay anything to get a job, and if they do, it's probably a scam. The company doesn't have a physical address on their website or on any other site. The company will not provide a phone number or an address for their office. The company requires a fee for materials or training. The company uses a free email provider for their domain, such as gmail.com or yahoo.com. The company requires you to forward payment to a personal account or individual. The company offers a large payment for your services, but no face-to-face meeting. A company asks you to cash checks for their clients and wire the money to an overseas bank account. The company asks you to use your own bank account to transfer company money. The company offers a large payment for an ""easy"" job. The company asks you to give out your personal information. You can avoid these scams by doing a little research on the company offering you a job. Check the company's website for contact information and a physical address. If there are no business addresses, phone numbers, or the company is using a free email account, then the company is probably a scam. If you're looking for a job, then it's always a good idea to read reviews and research the company first. If you do find a work-at-home job and the company requires a fee for materials or training, then you should ask yourself if you're really going to make money. According to the FTC, if you have to pay to get a job, then it's probably a scam. If a company does require a payment for materials, then you should do some research to make sure that the company isn't a scam. When looking for an office-based job, you should always be careful, and if you feel that something doesn't add up, then it probably isn't.

"Dwarf Fortress is a simulation game where players play in a deeply detailed randomly generated fantasy world. It was programmed by one developer, Tarn Adams, who has been working on it for over 10 years. The game is currently in an alpha stage, but is available for download for free. The game is currently in an alpha stage, but is available for download for free. The game is played in two different modes, the first is the ""Adventure Mode"" where the player takes control of an adventurer and moves in a tile-based world where one tile represents one square meter. The player is free to explore the generated world, interact with objects, enter buildings and fight with enemies. The second mode is the ""Fortress Mode"" where the player is free to build a fortress and then play the game in a similar way as in Adventure mode, but while controlling the dwarves of the fortress. The player can build a fortress in a mountain, underground or above ground. In addition to building the fortress the player has to assign the dwarves to work in a variety of jobs such as miners, masons, woodcutters, etc. The dwarves each have their own personality and can interact with each other. Dwarf Fortress is written in C and uses OpenGL and the SDL library for graphics and input. The game also has support for the Z-machine so that it can be played with the text-based Z-machine interpreter. The game is inspired by the early roguelike games, with the player's actions being described by text. It also has influences from a variety of other games, such as Sim City and Dungeon Keeper.

"CRISPRoff is a new gene-editing technology that can control gene expression while leaving the sequence of the DNA unchanged. Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without editing the genome. CRISPRoff can be used to quickly create new models of diseases and can advance personalized medicine by making it possible to design therapies that target specific gene variants. CRISPRoff can be used to quickly create new models of diseases and can advance personalized medicine by making it possible to design therapies that target specific gene variants. Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without editing the genome. The technology was developed by scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, and the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), South Korea. CRISPRoff takes advantage of the way the CRISPR system evolved in nature as a bacterial defense system against viral infection. Viruses that infect bacteria insert a small bit of DNA (a ""spacer into their genomes to record the event. CRISPR then uses this spacer to find and destroy future viral infections. CRISPRoff works by flipping this natural process around. First, the scientists target the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. The enzyme cuts the DNA, which the cell then repairs using either the ""non-homologous end joining"" (NHEJ) or ""homology-directed repair"" (HDR) process. The CRISPRoff system, including the guide RNA and Cas9 enzyme, along with the CRISPR system's DNA repair machinery, are all included in a single molecule. When Cas9 cuts the DNA, the cell tries to repair it using the molecule's built-in template. In this case, the template carries a transcriptional terminator sequence that halts gene expression. ""We have long known that DNA repair can create problems for CRISPR gene-editing systems,"" says Feng Zhang, core institute member of the Broad Institute, an investigator at the McGovern Institute, and the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT. ""So we figured that if we could use a repair template to block gene expression, we could create a new tool that would be very useful for research."" The CRISPRoff system was first used to repress a gene that regulates eye development in zebrafish. The fish developed with malformed eyes, indicating that the gene repression was successful. The CRISPRoff system was also used to repress genes in human cells, resulting in silencing of a gene that is involved in several types of cancer. Because CRISPRoff leaves the genome unchanged, the repression is reversible. When the CRISPRoff system is removed, the cell naturally repairs the DNA break using its own DNA repair machinery, disabling the terminator sequence and re-enabling gene expression. CRISPRoff can be used to quickly and easily shut off any gene in the genome. The system can be multiplexed to target several genes at once and can be used in cells or animals of any species. ""This is a rapid and powerful way to study gene function and to model diseases,"" says Omar Abudayyeh, a graduate student at MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the paper's first author. ""CRISPRoff can be used to study the malfunctioning of genes, without permanently altering the genome, providing a potential way forward for new types of therapeutics."" ""CRISPRoff enables powerful new genetic tools to be used in model organisms and cell culture, which will enhance studies of gene function and disease mechanisms,"" says McGovern Institute Director Robert Desimone. ""This technology will also enable new approaches to personalized medicine, because it can be designed to target specific gene variants.""

"The success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods has led to other plant-based meat replacements appearing in the market. 18 vegetable-based burgers, seven black bean burgers, and eight meat-analogue burgers were put to the test. ""The veggie burgers are in a really good place right now,"" said Emily Bushaw, Culinary Director at America's Test Kitchen. ""I think the growth of the meatless burgers has been really interesting. It's gone from just your sort of fake meat patties to a whole new world of veggie burgers and beyond meat burgers."" Bushaw said the testers used a 10-point rating system for each burger. They took into account factors such as the ""char factor,"" or how well the burger seared, and texture. ""We looked at the overall flavor profile of the burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We were really surprised by what we found. There was a mix of vegan and vegetarian burgers."" The testers found that one brand of vegan burger was the best tasting. ""The one that really won it for us was the Follow Your Heart [vegan] burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We thought it had a really good flavor profile, which is surprising because vegan burgers can be a little bit bland."" The second place winner was a vegetarian option from MorningStar Farms. ""They are both good options for people who are looking for a meatless burger,"" Bushaw said. Beyond Meat's 'Beyond Burger' came in fourth place, while the Impossible Burger 2.0 came in 10th. ""We thought both of these burgers were good,"" Bushaw said. ""Both of these are made to be meat replacements. They are not trying to be vegetable-based burgers."" Bushaw said she was most surprised by the high ranking of the vegan burgers. ""I think it was a pleasant surprise for us,"" Bushaw said. ""Both of those burgers were on the more affordable side, which is always nice. They were a really good surprise, and we will be using them a lot more in our test kitchen."" Bushaw said the testers looked at how well the burgers could be cooked at home. ""We did them at home,"" Bushaw said. ""We did not grill them, we cooked them on a cast iron pan on the stove, and that's how we judge them because that's how most people at home will be cooking them."" Bushaw said the vegetable-based burgers did not perform as well in the test. ""They were a little bit on the blander side, but I think that is because they are trying to be vegetable-based burgers,"" Bushaw said. ""They are trying to replace vegetables on a burger, not be a meat replacement."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at the black bean burgers. ""They are the most common,"" Bushaw said. ""They are a really good meat replacement for people who are looking for something to throw on a barbecue."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at the nutritional value of the burgers. ""We looked at the protein content of each burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We looked at how much protein each burger contained, how much sodium, and how much fat it contained."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at how much of each ingredient was used in each burger. ""We looked at how much vegetable or vegetable protein was in each burger,"" Bushaw said. ""We wanted to know how much of the patty was actually vegetables and how much was other stuff."" Bushaw said the testers discovered that Beyond Meat's burger uses mostly pea protein. ""They are a huge percentage of what is in the patty,"" Bushaw said. Bushaw said the testers found that some of the vegan burgers contained a lot of coconut oil. ""Coconut oil is not necessarily bad for you,"" Bushaw said. ""It's just that if you are eating this patty thinking it is all vegetables, there is a lot of coconut oil in there. It's a good thing to keep in mind."" Bushaw said the testers also looked at the sodium content of the burgers. ""You would think the plant-based burgers would be lower in sodium,"" Bushaw said. ""They were not. Some of them had as much or more sodium",0,344
"This article is an introduction to learning COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL). COBOL is a domain-specific language for business. It excels in managing and manipulating heterogeneous data in record structures, and for batch-type data processing. COBOL is a programming language. It is a very popular programming language for business applications. It has been around for a very long time, since 1959. It is one of the oldest programming languages. It is still widely used. The acronym COBOL stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language. It was designed to be a language that could be understood by non-computer-experts, such as managers and accountants. COBOL is a compiled language, meaning that source code is compiled into object code before being executed by a computer. COBOL supports structured programming. A structured program is divided into sections and subsections, each of which have a well-defined purpose. COBOL code is typically organized into procedures and data divisions. Procedures contain code (sequential, conditional, and iterative), and data divisions contain variables and tables. COBOL is a very verbose language. It is a procedural language, where everything is specified explicitly. There is no such thing as a default value or default action, everything must be specified. COBOL is very good at processing data in tables. A table is a structured record format. In COBOL, a table is defined by a table definition, which consists of one or more columns (a column can be of different types, such as numeric, string, etc.). An actual table is called a file, and is defined by a file definition. A file is a collection of one or more records (each record has one or more fields). A procedure is a section of code that performs a certain task. Procedures can be defined within procedures, this is called nesting. A procedure can be called from any other procedure. Each procedure consists of three parts: A procedure division (where code is), a working-storage section (which contains variables), and a linkage section (which contains variables and constants which are visible outside the procedure). The procedure division consists of the following sections: 010000 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. 020000 PROCEDURE DIVISION. 021000 MAIN-PROCEDURE. 022000 DATA DIVISION. 023000 PROCEDURE-1. 026000 LINKAGE SECTION. 030000 WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 032000 LINKAGE SECTION. 032100 WS-1 PIC 9 (4). 032110 WS-2 PIC X (4). 032120 WS-3 PIC S9 (2) USAGE COMP. 032130 WS-4 PIC 9. 032140 WS-5 PIC 9 (3) V99. 032150 WS-6 PIC S9 (3) V99. 032160 WS-7 PIC 99. 032170 WS-8 PIC X (10). 032180 WS-9 PIC 999. 032190 WS-10 PIC X (10). 032200 WS-11 PIC 9999. 032210 WS-12 PIC X (10). 032220 WS-13 PIC 99999. 032230 WS-14 PIC X (10). 032240 WS-15 PIC 999999. 032250 WS-16 PIC X (10). 032260 WS-17 PIC . 032270 WS-18 PIC X (10). 032280 WS-19 PIC 99999999. 032290 WS-20 PIC X (10). 032",0,345
"A Hong Kong tycoon is suing the salesman that convinced him to use a supercomputer to handle his trading, a decision which cost him more than 20 million. It is the latest in a long line of complaints, filed against the financial services industry, by a client that lost money in the markets. After losing more than 20 million, a Hong Kong tycoon is suing the supercomputer salesman who convinced him to use the machine to handle his trading. The suit, filed by a Hong Kong tycoon known as ""King of Gamblers"" - and the latest in a long line of complaints, filed against the financial services industry, by a client that lost money in the markets - alleges that a supercomputer broker sold the client a computer that was supposed to make him rich. The Hong Kong tycoon, 63, was introduced to an overseas salesman by his son who, the suit claims, convinced the tycoon that he needed a supercomputer to generate the profits he desired. As part of the deal, the salesman also guaranteed that the supercomputer would generate at least HK100 million for the client during the first 18 months of operation, and that it would be operated by a successful trader. The suit claims that the salesman told the tycoon that he would never lose money while using the machine. After the salesman delivered the computer, it was connected to an offshore brokerage firm, in the British Virgin Islands. When the tycoon complained that the computer was not generating the profits he wanted, the salesman offered to fix the machine in exchange for more money. According to the suit, the salesman demanded the client pay him 2 million to adjust the machine. The suit claims that the client agreed to pay the fee but that the salesman did not perform the promised work. In his suit, the tycoon said that he had already paid the salesman more than 10 million for the machine, and that he was forced to pay more than 20 million to an offshore brokerage firm that handled the trades, after he lost that money. The suit, filed in December 2014, is set to be heard in the High Court in July. The plaintiff is a Chinese tycoon who is known by the nickname ""King of Gamblers."" A court filing shows that the tycoon is the founder of a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that has stakes in real estate, energy, and casinos in Macau and China. The company's annual revenue is in excess of 2 billion. According to the suit, the salesman is an Australian national who had an office in Hong Kong and who sold the supercomputer to the tycoon. The suit claims that the salesman was to provide the client with a successful trader who would use the computer to generate profits for the client. According to the suit, the client asked the salesman to provide him with a successful trader, but that the salesman, instead, provided a less successful trader. The suit alleges that the salesman misrepresented the trader and that the client would not have purchased the supercomputer if he had known that the salesman was going to provide him with a less successful trader. The suit also claims that the salesman knew that the trader he provided would not be able to generate the 100 million in profits he promised the client during the first 18 months of operation. The suit also claims that the salesman provided the client with a machine that was not capable of generating the profits he had promised. According to the suit, the supercomputer did not perform the trades it was supposed to perform, and that it had a faulty component. The suit also claims that the salesman had previously told the client that a different machine was capable of generating at least 100 million in profits in 18 months, but that the salesman, instead, sold the client a different machine. The suit claims that the salesman convinced the client to purchase the supercomputer by telling him that he would be able to earn 100 million during the first 18 months of operation, and that the trader would be able to trade successfully, generating at least 20 million per month. The suit also claims that the salesman told the client that if the machine did not generate at least 100 million in profits during the first 18 months, he would replace the machine with a more successful trader, or that he would replace the machine.",0,346

"Uber and Lyft must classify their drivers as employees unless their emergency appeal to block the ruling is successful. The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers, and the appeals court ruling means they now must do so - at least for California drivers. The ruling could have ramifications for other states where drivers are classified as independent contractors. The lawsuit was initially filed in 2013 by Uber drivers, alleging that the company has misclassified drivers as independent contractors to avoid reimbursing them for gas and vehicle maintenance. A California court ruled in favor of the drivers in June, but Uber appealed. The appeals court rejected Uber's appeal and upheld the ruling in favor of the drivers. Uber has argued that drivers have ""complete autonomy"" as to whether, when, and where they work. But the court found that drivers are ""presumed to be employees."" ""The trial court determined that defendants' drivers are employees as a matter of law under California's right-to-control test,"" the appeals court wrote in its opinion. In the court's ""suffer or permit"" analysis, it found that Uber is ""involved in every aspect of the operation."" Drivers must accept at least 90 of trip requests to remain in ""good standing,"" and they can be temporarily banned from the platform for refusing rides. ""Uber controls the tools drivers use, monitors their approval ratings and terminates their access to the system if the average rating falls below 4.6 stars,"" the court said in the opinion. ""Uber also controls the subject matter of the work performed. ""Although drivers may choose the territories in which they wish to drive, they may not select the passengers they transport or the trips they perform. Uber controls those matters."" ""This is a big win for California drivers and for workers everywhere,"" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, partner at Lichten Liss-Riordan, P.C., which represents the drivers in the case. ""We look forward to fighting for workers' rights alongside our clients now and in the future."" A spokesperson for Uber said the company plans to appeal the decision with the California Supreme Court. ""The California Labor Commissioner already reviewed this issue and found that drivers are independent contractors, not employees,"" Uber said. ""The majority of states have also come to the same conclusion. We are currently reviewing the decision and will be closely evaluating our next steps."" Lyft said in a statement that it is reviewing the opinion and will consider all of its options. ""Lyft drivers are independent contractors and are uniquely empowered to decide where, when, and for how long they drive,"" the company said. The Uber and Lyft cases are the most prominent of their kind, but other ""gig economy"" companies have faced similar battles. In 2015, a federal judge in North Carolina granted class action status to FedEx Ground drivers who alleged they were misclassified as independent contractors. A Florida judge also found that a pizza delivery driver in Florida was an employee, not an independent contractor. The plaintiff's law firm, Lichten Liss-Riordan, said it has ""active cases"" on behalf of more than 10,000 workers in the gig economy. ""It's possible that the court could order Uber and Lyft to reclassify their drivers as employees,"" Liss-Riordan said. ""It's also possible that the companies could make changes to their business models to reduce the amount of control they exert over drivers.""",0,358

"Microsoft has agreed to make it easier for customers to independently repair its devices. As You Sow, an investor advocacy nonprofit, filed a shareholder resolution with the SEC in June, asking Microsoft to change its practices around product repairs. The group says it was concerned that Microsoft's failure to offer consumers ""fair and reasonable"" repair options was forcing customers to choose between ""hiring an unauthorized repair service or incurring substantial costs from the manufacturer."" Microsoft, however, says it already has plenty of options for users who want to repair its devices. ""At Microsoft, we take pride in building products that are durable, reliable, and highly secure. We also recognize that we need to be transparent with our customers about how we build and repair our products. That's why we've published a Repairability Scorecard to help customers and professionals better understand our products' repairability. We've also provided detailed technical guides for professionals who may be interested in repairing our products. And in June we announced new repair options for customers with out-of-warranty Surface devices."" The statement goes on to say that Microsoft will now also provide documentation for devices like Surface Hub, Xbox, and other PCs and tablets.

Milton will remain on as CEO of Nikola, but his absence from the board is a blow to the company's credibility. Investors and analysts alike have questioned Nikola's ability to deliver on the promises made by Milton. He claimed that he had raised 11 billion in investment capital, which he later retracted. Milton also claimed he had received over 3 billion in orders, which he was also later forced to retract. Nikola has not given any indication when its hydrogen-electric semi trucks will be available to the public. The trucks, which Nikola claims are capable of traveling over 1,000 miles on a single tank of hydrogen, have been the center of the company's media attention. However, Nikola has not yet built a production-ready version of the trucks. Nikola has said that it will begin testing the trucks in 2019, but it has yet to reveal which customers will be receiving the first trucks. The first trucks are expected to be delivered in 2021. In the meantime, Nikola has been working on a hybrid truck, called the Nikola Tre. The Tre will feature a turbine range extender, which Nikola claims will allow the truck to travel 1,000 miles on a single tank of fuel.

"A team of scientists used high-energy X-rays to analyze ancient Egyptian papyri fragments and found lead compounds in both the red and black inks used. This is evidence that lead was used in their manufacturing process. The scientists used two different methods, one involving X-ray diffraction and the other X-ray fluorescence, to analyze the ink of two fragments from the papyrus collection of the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection in Berlin. Both methods are non-destructive and can be performed in situ, which is necessary for artifacts such as these. The first fragment, dubbed the ""Gospel of Luke,"" was written on parchment, or animal skin, in the late 1st century A.D. This was one of the oldest surviving copies of the Gospel of Luke, a canonical Christian text that is a biography of Jesus. It was found in 1911 in an Egyptian tomb and was discovered to have a layer of red ink made from lead compounds. The scientists also discovered the black ink used in this text was also made from lead, but in the form of carbon-based black ink. The second fragment, dubbed the ""Acts of Paul,"" is a text that describes the life of the Apostle Paul, and is considered by some to be a non-canonical Christian text. This fragment is not as old, dating to the 3rd century A.D. It was written on papyrus and contained black ink that was found to have been made from carbon-based black ink, but also contained lead in the form of a copper-based pigment. These were the first of these ancient papyri to be analyzed with such high-energy X-rays. The results have shown that the black ink used for these ancient Egyptian texts was not only carbon-based, but also contained lead. The researchers said their findings confirm previous scholarly work that suggested that the ink contained lead salts. They said their analysis of the ink using high-energy X-rays provides a new way to identify the composition of ancient inks. They also said their method can be applied to other ancient artifacts. ""The detection of toxic lead in the ink on the papyrus fragments of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of Paul might be related to intentional ingredients in the ink, perhaps designed to make the ink more brilliant on the parchment or papyrus,"" the researchers said in their study.",0,365
"Many of Apple's employees have been fighting against the company's plans to require employees to work at least three days a week in the office. Employees were originally told to start commuting to the office this summer, but that start date was later moved to June 2017. Employees have been fighting against the policy for the last couple of years, and according to a recent Bloomberg report, the policy is expected to go into effect in June. However, employees have been successful in delaying the policy, and they may have achieved something even more substantial. According to The New York Times, sources familiar with the matter say the company is working on a revised policy to grant employees additional flexibility. It appears that employees have had some success in delaying the policy, which is why it won't be fully implemented until June 2017. But it also appears that employees have managed to force the company to rethink the policy. The new policy will offer employees a number of options for working from home. However, employees must still spend ""a certain amount of time"" working at the office. The new policy will be implemented in June, and it's expected to address some of the concerns expressed by employees. In recent years, more and more companies have started offering employees the option of working from home. In fact, some companies have started offering employees the option to work from home, and they've also started offering employees the option to work from any of the company's offices. However, some companies have started to rethink this policy. Companies like IBM and Yahoo have started requiring employees to work from the office. One of the main reasons companies are starting to demand that employees work from the office is to improve communication between employees. Improving communication may be particularly important for companies that are based in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is home to a large number of major tech companies, and many of these companies are located in close proximity to one another. Silicon Valley is an extremely competitive area, and companies are always trying to outdo one another. Improving communication between employees could make it easier for companies to create new products, as well as improve existing products. While it's understandable why companies would want to improve communication, it's also important for companies to consider the needs of employees. Some employees may have trouble commuting to the office, and some employees may be more productive when working from home. It's also important to note that the way people work has changed dramatically in recent years. A growing number of workers are freelancers and contractors, and many companies use workers that don't work in the office.",0,366
"Scientists at the Fermilab in Illinois have measured the mass of a subatomic particle called the W boson. The ultraprecise measurement found that the particle had a mass seven standard deviations more than what the Standard Model of particle physics predicts. The discovery of the W boson, which carries the weak nuclear force, helped earn the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics. It was found in the 1980s, using particle accelerator experiments. The W boson is similar to the photon, which carries the electromagnetic force, but the W boson is much heavier. The Standard Model is the best description we have of how subatomic particles behave, and it predicted that the W boson would have a mass of 80.399 GeV (where 1 GeV 1 billion electron volts). However, scientists at the Fermilab measured a mass of 80.423 GeV. That 0.024 GeV difference may not seem like much, but it's a big deal because the difference is seven standard deviations above the predicted value. That means the difference is statistically significant, and not some random error in measurement. It's also important to note that the difference is not large enough to be considered an actual violation of the Standard Model, but it's a tantalizing hint that it may be possible to do so. The new measurement was made by analyzing data from a subatomic particle called a top quark. Top quarks are the heaviest subatomic particles discovered, and they were predicted by the Standard Model. They were discovered in 1995, and the measurement of their mass was also used to predict the W boson's mass. If the new measurement of the W boson mass holds up, it could mean there's a new subatomic particle out there that physicists haven't discovered yet. If that's the case, then this particle would be interacting with the W boson, and altering its mass. Unfortunately, the difference between the predicted and actual W boson masses is not great enough to predict the characteristics of this new particle. Any new particle would have to be more massive than the W boson, but would have to interact weakly with it. This would explain why it has never been detected before. Scientists are keen to find such a particle, since it could explain why the universe is made up mostly of matter and not anti-matter. Since the Big Bang should have produced an equal amount of matter and anti-matter, there must be some process that favours matter over anti-matter, and this new particle could be it. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was a triumph for the Standard Model. But this new result may be a hint that there is something beyond the Standard Model waiting to be discovered. Physicists have found a new way to verify the mass of subatomic particles such as the top quark. A more precise measurement could reveal something beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.",0,367
"Barcelona-based startup Kreios Space plans to send satellites on very low Earth orbit (VLEO) missions. VLEO is a zone between 95 to 250 miles of altitude. Most satellites operate at much higher altitude. Kreios plans to operate a constellation of 60 satellites at 120 miles of altitude. Their satellites will use their own solar panels as sails to maintain their orbit and to move around without using propellant. Satellites with solar sails will be able to maintain their orbit for much longer than satellites that use propellant. Kreios satellites will have a lifetime of 10 years instead of 3 to 5 years. They will also be able to move around in the same orbit without using propellant. Kreios plans to offer a variety of services such as imagery and the possibility to send messages. Satellites will be able to send a message to a specific point on Earth. This is very useful to send alerts to people who might be lost, or to send messages to people who are in remote areas and might not have any access to communication infrastructures. Kreios is currently looking for investors in order to launch their first two satellites. For more information about Kreios Space, you can check their website:",0,368
"A new privacy-focused cryptocurrency has become popular recently, and not only because of its Harry Potter theme. Grin promises to create a cryptocurrency that is both 'light' and completely anonymous. Grin, a new privacy-focused cryptocurrency, is taking the industry by storm. Recently, it has been rising in popularity not only because of its Harry Potter theme. Grin promises to create a cryptocurrency that is both 'light' and completely anonymous. Grin, an open-source cryptocurrency, is similar to Bitcoin. Both are 'proof-of-work' cryptocurrencies and follow a 'decentralized' design. However, there is one key difference. Grin allows all users to mine and keep all of the transactions they make. Therefore, the new cryptocurrency does not require an additional trusted entity to be able to validate transactions. There is also a key distinction between the two cryptocurrencies. Grin is designed to be 'light', which means it can process transactions faster than Bitcoin. Grin aims to process transactions in just 15 seconds, in contrast to Bitcoin's 10 minutes. It is an open-source, community-owned cryptocurrency with no founders or leaders. It is fast, light, private, and decentralized. Grin is also a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, like Zcash. It is the first MimbleWimble cryptocurrency and uses a cryptographic protocol to hide transactions. The Grin team is made up of individuals all over the world, including Brazil, the U.K., and the U.S. Grin is not a fork of Bitcoin, but a new cryptocurrency in its own right. What is MimbleWimble and why is it important for Grin? MimbleWimble is a cryptographic protocol that was created by an anonymous person who goes by the name of Tom Elvis Jedusor. It is an upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain, and it is the first version of this cryptographic protocol to be implemented. It is an upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain that allows for the removal of blockchain 'bloat'. It also creates a blockchain that is private and scalable. The MimbleWimble protocol was created to improve Bitcoin's scalability. MimbleWimble, unlike the Bitcoin protocol, allows for both the reduction of blockchain data and the removal of non-essential information. In the white paper, MimbleWimble is described as a protocol that ""improves upon Bitcoin."" MimbleWimble is important for Grin because it allows for faster and private transactions. The MimbleWimble protocol allows for the creation of a blockchain that is light and scalable. How does the Grin network work? Grin uses the MimbleWimble protocol, which is also an upgrade to Bitcoin's blockchain. The MimbleWimble protocol allows for the removal of unnecessary blockchain information. The new cryptocurrency is the first implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. Grin is light, private, and decentralized. Grin's mission is to create a cryptocurrency that is both light and private. Light: Grin's cryptocurrency is fast and efficient. It aims to process transactions in just 15 seconds. Privacy: Grin's transactions are completely private. Grin's blockchain hides transaction amounts and senderreceiver addresses. Decentralized: Grin is an open-source cryptocurrency that belongs to the community. The cryptocurrency has no founders or leaders.

"A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge has increased the amount of energy extractable from photosynthetic bacteria by over an order of magnitude. Scientists have been trying to harness the power of photosynthetic bacteria for quite some time, but they've always run into the same problem: their biological machinery is very efficient, but not very powerful. The bacteria used in this study are called biological photovoltaic cells, or bio-PVs. These bacteria are engineered to produce an enzyme that breaks down water into hydrogen and oxygen. The researchers wanted to find a way to extract as much of that hydrogen as possible, so they could use it as a fuel source. The water-splitting enzyme used by these bacteria is called hydrogenase, but the problem is that hydrogenase breaks down pretty easily. The researchers started by developing a protein that would wrap itself around the hydrogenase to protect it. This hydrogen-harvesting protein was then added to the bacteria, and after a bit of tinkering the researchers found that they could extract as much as 95 of the hydrogen produced by the bacteria. At the moment this technology is still very much in the research phase, but it could eventually be used to provide a reliable fuel source in remote locations. One problem with bio-PVs is that they don't work very well in the dark, so it could be difficult to make them a primary energy source. Still, it's a promising technology, and hopefully it will one day be able to replace some of our fossil fuel power plants. Image credit: NCSU via Flickr",0,370

"Sperm counts in the West have dropped by 50 percent due to pesticides, plastics, and other chemicals. Chemicals used to make plastic soft and flexible, like phthalates, are endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with testosterone production and reduce sperm count.

"In a project called Mission Shakti, India has successfully tested its Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile, which destroyed a low-orbiting satellite on Wednesday. While it is unknown who the satellite belonged to, it is believed to be an Indian satellite. The test was conducted from the Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Island launch complex. In a statement, the government said, ""The test was fully successful and achieved all parameters as per plans."" The test comes a day after India carried out an air strike on terror camps across the border. According to the statement, the anti-satellite weapon, A-SAT, was developed indigenously and all its sub-systems were developed indigenously.

"Mobile Verification Toolkit is a collection of tools that automates the process of gathering forensic traces of potential compromises on Android and iOS devices. It was developed by the Amnesty International Technologies team in collaboration with the Coalition Against Surveillance Exports (CAUSE). Forensic traces collected by MVT can be used as a starting point for further investigation. Investigators can use them as part of their investigative work, or forensic analysis or legal proceedings. MVT collects the following forensic traces from the devices: Call logs, including call history, missed calls, and unanswered calls. SMSs, including the message content and the sender details. Contacts, including the details about a contact as well as the call and SMS history of the contact. Calendars, including event details and meeting participants. Browser history, including the details of the browsed web pages. Media files, including audio and video files, as well as photos. Installed applications, including application details and application-specific data. WhatsApp, including conversations and multimedia files. Facebook, including conversations and multimedia files. Telegram, including conversations and multimedia files. Emails, including email contents and the sender details. MVT tools are written in Python. The toolkit is built as a series of modular scripts to ensure that it can be easily expanded. Currently, MVT supports the collection of forensic traces from Android devices. The scripts use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to interact with the device. The adb tool is part of the Android SDK, which can be downloaded from the Android Developer website. You can find the installation instructions in our GitHub repository. By default, the Android Debug Bridge (adb) tool is configured to use a USB connection to interact with Android devices. This means you will need physical access to the device. If the device supports it, you can also interact with it over the Wi-Fi network. To do so, you must configure adb to connect over Wi-Fi. You will also need to enable USB debugging on the device. The user manual provides detailed instructions about how to use the tools. It is essential that the user consents to the collection of their data. Consent should be obtained before the collection of forensic traces commences. Please note that MVT does not perform any data analysis or interpretation. It is up to the investigator to determine the relevance of the data collected by the toolkit. Please note that MVT is still in development and is not intended to be used in production at this time. The toolkit is currently available in English.

"The 61st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the first IMO that has been held remotely and may also be the last time that artificial intelligence doesn't compete. Researchers view the IMO as a research object to test their latest algorithms in the ""300-year-old question,"" the so-called traveling salesman problem. A special task was that of finding the shortest possible route to visit 61 towns in 61 countries, the home of the 61 teams participating in the Olympiad. The IMO is the World Championship of Mathematics for High School Students, and takes place every year since 1959 in different countries. This year's competition was held on July 10 to 19 in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and was the first to be held online. The traveling salesman problem asks for a shortest route that connects a number of given towns and then returns to the initial point. The problem is easy to describe, but extremely difficult to solve. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, each of which carries a prize of one million dollars. The IMO 2010 traveling salesman problem was to find the shortest route that connects 61 towns in 61 countries, the home of the 61 teams participating in the Olympiad. ""This is an exciting task,"" says Jukka Suomela from Aalto University in Finland, ""as there are no efficient algorithms known to solve it. It is 300 years old and was mentioned already in 1736 by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, but the question is as challenging as ever."" Suomela works in the field of operations research, a branch of mathematics that studies optimization and its applications to decision-making. He has been studying the traveling salesman problem for the past 25 years and written a number of articles on it. ""The traveling salesman problem has received a lot of attention over the years and there are a number of very good heuristics for it,"" Suomela explains. ""But we don't have a good algorithm that can always find the optimal solution."" The traveling salesman problem belongs to the so-called NP-complete class of problems, which are problems that have no known algorithm that can solve them quickly. If a problem belongs to the NP-complete class, then a very fast algorithm to solve it would mean that P NP, which is one of the Millennium Prize Problems. The IMO is the World Championship of Mathematics for High School Students. It takes place every year since 1959 in different countries.

"Voice is a new social media platform that rewards its users for quality content. It is based on the EOS blockchain. Users on the platform are rewarded with Voice tokens for posting quality content. It is similar to Steem, but with added features. Voice tokens are EOS-based tokens that serve as the medium of exchange on the platform. When users post quality content, they earn Voice tokens. This is different from platforms like Steem and Medium where they are rewarded for upvoting and curating quality content. Users on Voice can also invest in content creators. They will be rewarded when the content creators post quality content. There are also partner programmes on Voice. Users will be rewarded for engaging with the content of partners. All Voice users are required to hold Voice tokens before they can participate in the partner programmes. The Voice team will also be launching their own content on the platform. Users will earn Voice tokens for engaging with the Voice team content. Voice users earn Voice tokens when they engage with the content of other users. Engagement includes upvoting, commenting and sharing. Users will also earn Voice tokens when they make a referral. Voice is backed by the Block.one team that created the EOS blockchain. Voice tokens are minted by the Voice team and given to users. The Voice team controls the supply of Voice tokens. They can use this to promote quality content and engagement on the platform. Voice tokens have the potential to increase in value if the platform gains traction and the Voice team does a good job of curating quality content. What are the cons of Voice? Voice is not decentralized. It is controlled by the Voice team that also mints the Voice tokens. Users will not be able to own Voice tokens if they do not participate in the Voice platform. The Voice team has total control over the supply of Voice tokens. The Voice team will also have total control over the content that is posted on Voice. This means that the team will be in charge of deciding which content is rewarded and which content is not. Users will have no say in this process. The Voice team can also decide to shut down the Voice platform. They can also decide to change the rules of the Voice platform and this may lead to a fall in the value of Voice tokens. Voice is designed to be an alternative to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Medium. It rewards its users with Voice tokens for posting and curating quality content. It is backed by the team that created the EOS blockchain. The Voice team controls the supply of Voice tokens and has the potential to manipulate the value of Voice tokens. Should you invest in Voice? Voice tokens may increase in value if the platform gains traction. However, it is important to remember that the Voice team has the power to manipulate the value of Voice tokens. The Voice team also has the power to shut down the platform if it is not profitable. Voice tokens are therefore a high risk, high reward investment. You can buy Voice tokens on Bitfinex and Huobi. You need to first purchase EOS tokens before you can buy Voice tokens. You can store your Voice tokens on Ledger, Trezor, and Exodus.

"The antitrust probe into Google is now moving beyond the company's advertising business and will start to investigate its search and Android businesses. The civil investigative demands into Google might involve asking for information about the company's internal documents, as well as data on competitors and their online search business. The antitrust investigations into Google have accelerated and will focus on the company's search and Android businesses. The news comes after the Justice Department announced that it is launching a broad antitrust probe into major U.S. technology companies, and is now moving beyond Google's advertising business. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are preparing to issue civil investigative demands to Google, which might involve asking for information about the company's internal documents, as well as data on competitors and their online search business. Google declined to comment. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. The new demands are expected to be sent out sometime next week, and could be followed by a civil lawsuit. The DoJ is expected to reach out to Google's rivals and other companies in the tech industry to gather information about Google's business practices and how it might affect them. Google will likely be asked to share details on its search practices, as well as how it bundles its software, including its Android mobile operating system. Antitrust investigations into Google have been ongoing for years, and in 2013, Google agreed to a settlement to stop antitrust claims regarding its search and advertising businesses. The company agreed to let advertisers manage ad campaigns on rival search engines and make it easier for advertisers to export ad campaign data to other ad platforms. But the demands from the Justice Department come as more regulators and governments are looking into Google's businesses. The European Commission fined Google 2.7 billion in 2017 over antitrust claims that it abused its dominance in online search to promote its own shopping comparison service. The company was also recently fined 5 billion for abusing the dominance of its Android operating system. Google is still appealing the decision. Over the last few years, Google has faced a number of antitrust claims from rivals, including Oracle, which claims that Google's use of Java in its Android operating system violates its copyright. In March, the Supreme Court ruled that Google's use of Java in Android did not violate copyright laws. Microsoft has also been in a dispute with Google over its Chromebooks. Microsoft argues that Google's laptop operating system violates patents that it holds. The two companies are currently involved in a royalty dispute, with Microsoft wanting to charge Google 20 for each Chromebook sold, and Google offering only 2.50. Google has also been in a patent war with Cisco over its wireless networking patents, which Cisco argues that Google's Android devices violate. In 2016, Google agreed to pay 40 million to settle the claims. Google has also been in a patent battle with Intellectual Ventures, which owns a number of patents on semiconductor technology and claims that Google's Nexus smartphones violate its patents. In 2014, Google agreed to pay 300 million to settle the dispute. In 2012, Google agreed to pay 22.5 million to settle a patent dispute with Walker Digital, the company that owns patents on the Priceline business model. Walker Digital argued that Google's AdWords product violated its patents. And in 2010, Google agreed to pay 500 million to settle a patent dispute with IBM over its Java software. Google is facing a number of lawsuits from consumers, including a class action lawsuit over its Nest thermostat products, which have been known to overheat and catch on fire. Google also faces a class action lawsuit over its Pixel smartphone. In 2018, some users began reporting issues with the phone's microphone, including problems making phone calls. The company also faces a class action lawsuit over its location tracking feature in its Android mobile operating system. Some Android users claim that the feature violates their privacy, even if they turn off their location services. Last year, Google agreed to pay a 9.5 million settlement over a class action lawsuit involving its Buzz social networking service. The suit claimed that the company violated its users' privacy by sharing their information with other users. In 20",0,381
"Chipotle Mexican Grill will open its first digital-only restaurant on Saturday. The location will only service online orders and will not include a dining room or an area for ordering. The restaurant will be in Columbus, Ohio, and will be the company's 2,500th restaurant. Digital orders have increased for Chipotle and made up 18 of the company's sales during the second quarter. ""I'd be lying if I said we weren't thinking about it,"" said Brian Niccol, CEO of Chipotle, during the company's investors call. ""There are some interesting things going on in the digital world around delivery. It's really up to us to be able to figure out how to crack that code."" The company has been testing delivery and will expand the service to 1,500 locations by the end of the year, said Niccol. Chipotle is working with DoorDash to deliver orders.

"Usually, if a company finds a product on Amazon that breaches copyright they can ask Amazon to take down the product listing. Project Zero is a new program by Amazon that will allow the company to suspend a seller's account while they investigate the authenticity of a product. They will be given the opportunity to remove the allegedly infringing products themselves, though. ""If a seller fails our validation process, we may immediately suspend or remove selling privileges and destroy inventory in our fulfilment centres without reimbursement."" ""Project Zero builds on our long-standing work to ensure that our customers receive authentic goods when shopping on Amazon."" The company will notify sellers of potential infringement and offer the ability to remove the flagged listings. Amazon has announced Project Zero, a program that will enable brands to automatically remove counterfeit items from its online store. While eBay's VeRO program has long allowed brands to have counterfeit goods removed from the platform, the company's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program was criticized for being ineffective in 2016, so Amazon is taking a slightly different approach with Project Zero. Sellers also will be allowed to enroll in a self-service counterfeit removal tool that will let them identify and remove fakes. Project Zero will initially be limited to a group of Amazon's most trusted sellers. The company says it will eventually roll out the program to all brands. Amazon is expanding its anti-counterfeiting efforts with a new program called Project Zero. Amazon will also be partnering with more than 30 brands to launch Project Zero, including big names like Hasbro, Nike, and Herschel.",0,384

"Researchers with NASAJPL-Caltech recently revealed'Mars Dogs' robots that can maneuver in ways that the wheeled rovers on other planets never could. They are a modified version of Boston Dynamics' SpotMini, who has already been able to open a door for a human and pull a truck. ""The workhorses of the Mars rover fleet are all built around the idea of a rover on six wheels. But in the last 10 years or so, a number of research groups around the world, including our own at JPL, have been experimenting with alternative configurations such as multi-legged robots or robots on tracks. The mobility capabilities of the resulting systems are often quite impressive, but the challenge is the cost of developing the hardware. The Mobility and Robotic Systems (MARS) group in the Mobility and Robotic Systems Section at JPL has been developing a new class of robots to address this problem."" It is not yet known how the robots will be used, but the researchers did state that they are well-suited for navigating the Martian landscape. While the planets have similar terrain, Mars has a gravitational pull only 38 that of Earth's. The main goal of the project was to see how the robot would function on the surface of another planet, and it seems like it did rather well. Now it will be interesting to see how they continue to develop the technology, and whether or not it will be used on future missions. What do you think of this new robot?

"Russia plans to temporarily disconnect the entire country from the internet in an exercise designed to test the country's internet infrastructure in case of a cyber-war. The test is expected to take place sometime before April 1. The experiment was first reported by Russian outlet RosBiznesKonsalting (RBK), and the plan was later confirmed by the Russian government. RBK said the country's Information Security Working Group (AIS) would be overseeing the experiment, and that it will involve ISPs across Russia, as well as the national Russian segment of the internet. The RBK report says the test will allow the authorities to gather insight on how the internet would react in the case of a cyber-attack. It will also give authorities the opportunity to observe how the Runet, or the Russian segment of the internet, will react if it's disconnected from the internet. The test will also provide a look into how internet traffic will be routed locally and how it will impact internet speed. The experiment is planned to take place in stages, starting with local disconnections and then escalating to the national level. This will allow ISPs to see if they can effectively respond to an isolated incident, as well as a national one. A statement from AIS says the test will help authorities determine how the Runet will react to attacks, and what measures the authorities can take to ensure its continued operation. The test is expected to be held sometime before April 1. RBK's report was later confirmed by Russian media outlet ZDNet. Roskomnazor, Russia's telecom watchdog, said the experiment would take place before April 1 and involve a temporary shutdown of the internet. Roskomnazor head Alexander Zharov said the test will allow Russia to better prepare for the ""possible negative consequences of the global internet governance."" Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that the purpose of the experiment is to defend Russia's segment of the internet in the event of a cyber-war. ""We need to think through and prepare for a possible disconnection from the global web,"" Patrushev said. ""In the case of a serious military conflict, we should be ready for any kind of outcome."" Patrushev noted that the US was planning to cut the world off from Russia's cyberspace, and that the US' withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was one of the reasons why the test was being conducted. Russia is the latest country to disconnect from the global internet. Earlier this month, the country's Foreign Ministry said Iran had disconnected from the global internet after a row over its nuclear programme. Russian officials have also indicated that the country could have its own network segment by August, according to an RBK report. The report says a senior Russian official has said the country is developing a separate and safe internet for itself in case the West cuts it off. The move comes as several countries are attempting to disconnect from the global internet. Earlier this month, Iran disconnected itself from the global internet. According to the Associated Press (AP), it's the first time the country has intentionally done so. The AP says the disconnection was an apparent attempt by the country to evade US sanctions, adding that the country was already subjected to network attacks that sparked protests.",0,388
"Uber and autonomous vehicle company Motional have partnered up to provide autonomous deliveries through Uber Eats. A pilot program will launch sometime in early 2022 in Santa Monica, California. Only certain restaurants and customers will be a part of the pilot, and customers will be required to opt-in. Uber and Motional are taking advantage of California's new rules for autonomous deliveries. The new regulations allow for the use of unmanned autonomous vehicles for commercial deliveries, without having a safety driver behind the wheel. The new rules also allow for unmanned deliveries to take place outside of daylight hours. Other companies are also testing similar autonomous delivery services, like Postmates and Ford. Uber and Motional's program will use Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ vehicles. Self-driving cars are still a ways off from the mainstream, and many have concerns about their safety.

Instead, executives are looking for skills that are a good fit for artificial intelligence. Of the skills that executives are looking for, all are related to creativity, critical thinking, and complex analysis. ""The ability to work with data, the ability to manage people, and the ability to create complex analysis are the three areas where we found executives were most concerned that there was a skills gap,"" says Saadia Zahidi, head of education, gender and work at the World Economic Forum. ""I think that's the key, when you look at these top ten skills - they're skills that machines are not going to be able to replace anytime soon."" While the report highlights that 75 million jobs may be displaced by automation by 2022, it's also clear that AI and robots will create jobs that require more complex human skills. But there's a problem, says Zahidi. ""People are just not keeping up with the pace of change. And we don't have enough people trained in these new skills."" According to the report, 38 percent of businesses surveyed said they planned to hire more contractors for temporary work. 23 percent said they would hire more permanent staff. ""It is quite interesting to see that employers are opting for contract-based work. They might be using more robots, and they're hiring more contractors,"" says Zahidi. ""That will require a big mindset shift, particularly for younger people. They're going to have to be more entrepreneurial, more resilient, more adaptable to change.""",0,390
"Light from stars tend to pulsate uniformly across the whole surface of a star. Astronomers have discovered a teardrop-shaped object that only pulses from one side. The star is about 1000 light-years away, and a little smaller than our sun. A nebula nearby is also pulsing with light, and it is believed that the nebula is created by the star. It is unknown what is causing the star to behave in this way. However, it is believed that the energy from the nebula is changing the way the star is pulsating. While the star was already known to pulsate in a unique way, the new images from the Hubble Space Telescope show that the star's brightness changes over time, brightening and dimming about every 25 days. The nebula has clouds of dust and gas in the center. Astronomers believe that the energy from the star is causing the nebula to pulse. ""The discovery of this unique object is very exciting,"" said Dr. Henri Boffin, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory, in a statement. ""This is the first time we have observed a star that changes its shape in response to its pulsations."" Astronomers are now working to find out what is causing the star to pulsate this way. They are also working to find out why the nebula is pulsating in time with the star. The discovery of this unique star has led to the researchers having many questions about it. They hope to find answers as they continue to study the star and the nebula. The findings were published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",0,391

"Researchers at MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. Electricity is made up of discrete particles, and it can flow with the viscosity of water or the ease of air. Now, researchers have observed the latter, and it happens in the form of an electron whirlpool. Fundamentally, this research is about understanding how electrons move and how to design better electronics. The researchers from MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. They found that the charges flowed like water in a pipe. Electrons are quantum particles with charge and spin, so they could be considered like a tiny bar magnets with positive and negative poles. In a wire, electrons flow like water in a pipe. Electrons move through the wire, but their spins, like the tiny bar magnets, can stay in one direction or flip back and forth. In this case, the spins flip back and forth, creating a whirlpool-like behavior, where the electrons move in one direction around a center point. The researchers used x-rays to look inside the crystals and discovered that the spins of electrons lined up in a spiral around an axis. The result of the alignment of the spins is that the electrons can form a whirlpool, which is a way to get electrons to flow through a material. The researchers used x-rays to look inside the crystals and discovered that the spins of electrons lined up in a spiral around an axis. This is a way to get electrons to flow through a material.

"OpenAI has released the full version of GPT-2, a text-generating AI system. When it was first announced, there were concerns that it could be misused to spread fake news, spam, and other misinformation online, but the research organization says that's less likely now that the full system has been released to the public. GPT-2 is a neural network, meaning it ""learns"" from the data it's given. The first version of GPT-2 was trained on a dataset of 8 million webpages, and OpenAI says it's capable of generating text that's ""coherent and more sophisticated"" than anything available now. You can see what the system is capable of for yourself - just click the ""Play with GPT-2"" button on OpenAI's GPT-2 website. The first GPT-2 paper was released in February. Last year, OpenAI said it wouldn't release the full system out of fears that it would be used for malicious purposes. While the system is capable of writing coherent sentences and paragraphs, the organization said it could be misused to generate spam or impersonate people online, as well as produce fake news articles. Now, however, OpenAI has released the full GPT-2 system, and says the risk of misuse is much lower. The organization says it didn't release the full system earlier because it was a ""complicated model,"" and needed further research to make sure it was secure.

"Amazon has purchased Facebook's small-satellite division. Facebook was designing and testing ways to advance satellite connectivity as part of an effort to enable the next generation of broadband infrastructure. It was working on ways to beam internet access to areas of the world that are currently underserved, or offline altogether. But the project was slowed down in June 2016 when its manufacturer, Space Systems Loral, filed a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging that the social network ""induced"" the satellite maker to breach its own contract with another customer.

With its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon is making a bold statement that it is serious about brick-and-mortar retail. The acquisition, valued at nearly 14 billion, is a dramatic turnaround for the organic foods pioneer, which had been plagued by falling sales and a series of setbacks. The partnership is expected to further expand Amazon's grocery delivery business. Whole Foods will continue to operate as a separate brand. No price changes are planned, and no job cuts are expected, the companies said. Amazon's arrival may herald a major change for Whole Foods, which has been under intense pressure to sell itself after activist investor Jana Partners LLC announced a 9 stake in the company in April.",0,400

"Harvard has created a Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot the size of a penny that can run at speeds of 13.9 body lengths per second. HAMR-JR was built as a test to see if it could run, jump and climb while carrying cargo. (Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot) The robot is a model of HAMR-JR (Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot). As noted in the video below, the robot was inspired by the amazing jumping ability of the African bush vaulting frog. ""HAMR-Jr is a small-scale robot that can traverse flat and inclined surfaces at a speed of 13.9 body lengths per second,"" says lead author Shuhei Miyashita. ""Its jumping agility allows it to traverse complex terrain and perform tasks such as delivering a payload or transporting small objects in hard-to-reach locations."" ""The robot is capable of climbing fences and vertical walls, and can even jump through obstacles as high as 1.8 meters. These capabilities make HAMR-Jr a promising platform for applications in search-and-rescue operations, infrastructure inspection, and legged robot research."" Though not specifically mentioned, HAMR-JR is quite close to being a 4th Generation Ambient Microbot, described in Robert Heinlein's 1970 novel I Will Fear No Evil: ...""As a result of my work, I've learned to spot them now and again... Now and then I see one in the street, the size of a child's hand. I'm the only one who sees it. If you crushed it, it would look like a splotch of grease. But I know what it is. ""There were a lot of fourth generation robots around - not as big as a hand - and nobody ever saw them. They didn't do anything - they didn't have to; they just sat and listened. But they could pass information to each other by jumping a gap - which looked to human eyes like teleportation. ...""That was the first inkling I had of what had happened. I picked it up on the street. I'd just come from a poker game, I was broke, and I picked it up - it looked like a watch. I got home with it and it was gone. But I had picked up a fourth generation ambulatory microbot. I'm the only one who knows that. I doubt if you can find anybody else who knows what a fourth generation ambulatory microbot is.

"Scientists from Japan have found a species of slug that can self-decapitate and regrow their bodies from their heads. It appears that the slug does this in response to parasites. The slug is able to do this due to specialized cells in the neck that can be regenerated after decapitation. The slug is also able to regenerate a new head with the same shape, color, and behavior as its original head. The scientists report, ""The amazing regeneration of head and neural tissue, which is under a closed-body condition, was caused by the regeneration-dedicated stem cells that are distributed in the ventral part of the slug. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of spontaneous head and brain regeneration in an intact animal with a closed-body condition.""

"El Salvador may become the world's first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The country recently partnered with digital wallet company Strike to build modern financial infrastructure using blockchain. The Central American country of El Salvador is on the verge of becoming the world's first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The country recently partnered with digital wallet company Strike to build modern financial infrastructure using blockchain. The result of the partnership is a virtual currency called Stable. In 2016, the Salvadoran government considered creating a national cryptocurrency to help the country's unbanked residents. The government would have been the first in the world to create a national cryptocurrency. The plan was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles. Government officials want to bring Stable to the country as legal tender as soon as possible. This is no small task as it requires legislation to be passed by the government. Stable is a hybrid cryptocurrency. The digital asset is backed by the US dollar. Every Stable unit is backed by 1.00. As such, it is not considered a security. Stable is not the only stablecoin available. Tether is a stablecoin that is also backed by the dollar. The currency's popularity has been rocked by allegations that Tether doesn't have the dollar reserves to back its coins. Stable's goal is to provide users with the advantages of cryptocurrency without the instability associated with virtual currencies. Stable's protocols help stabilize the digital asset's price. Stable's protocols include a ""stability protocol"" that maintains the digital asset's peg to the dollar. A ""redemption protocol"" allows users to exchange their Stable coins for US dollars. Stable is available to traders and can be used to pay for goods and services. The digital asset can be purchased with a credit card. Stable can also be stored in a digital wallet. Users can store Stable in a hardware wallet or on a digital wallet. The price of Stable has remained stable. A week after the currency was launched, Stable's price fell 0.4. Stable's price is still subject to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.",0,407

"GPT-3 is OpenAI's new language model. It has 175 billion parameters, but it is unclear whether a full version or whether one of seven smaller versions will be released. GPT-3 has been described as the world's most powerful AI text generator, capable of writing news stories and works of fiction. It is so powerful that it is too dangerous to release in full. A small version of GPT-3 has been released. The 125 million parameter version has been made public, in the form of a text generation model. The GPT-3 model is trained on a dataset of 40 GB of Internet text. This is a very small model when compared to the full size version, which has 175 billion parameters. OpenAI, the research firm sponsored by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, has said that its new language model, GPT-3, is too dangerous to release in full. The GPT-3 model has been trained with 40 GB of Internet text, and it is capable of writing convincing fake news articles, impersonating other people, and even taking part in a conversation. The 1.5 billion parameter version is currently the largest model, but OpenAI is now training a 175 billion parameter version. This means that it is now possible to use the GPT-3 text generation model to produce a variety of fake news articles and essays. This is a major development in language modelling. The GPT-2 text generation model was very impressive, and it was trained on 8 million web pages. But it was also limited in what it could do. GPT-3 has been trained on 40 GB of Internet text, and it is capable of being used in a much wider range of ways. OpenAI has decided to only release the small version of the model, and not the full version, for now. It is concerned about the misuse of the model. GPT-3 is a transformer-based language model. This means that it uses the same core architecture as the BERT natural language processing tool, and as the GPT-2 model. GPT-3 is able to create fake news articles and impersonate other people. It can be used in conversations, and it can also be used to summarize longer documents. GPT-3 is capable of synthesizing text in a range of different styles. This is an essential feature of a language model, and it is what enables it to produce such convincing fake news articles. In order to do this, GPT-3 needs to be trained on a large dataset. OpenAI says that it has trained GPT-3 on a dataset of 40 GB of Internet text. This is the same dataset that OpenAI has used to train its other language models, including the GPT-2 model. The dataset has been collected from Reddit, and it contains more than 750 million text files, including comments and posts. The GPT-3 model is capable of writing fake news articles, but this is just the start of what it can do. It is also capable of producing high-quality text in a range of different writing styles. This is the result of training the model on such a large dataset. GPT-3 is able to write text in a number of different styles. This means that it can be used to write text in different styles, and it is also capable of mimicking other people's writing styles. It is able to do this because it has been trained on a large dataset of text. A language model needs to be trained on a lot of data in order to be able to write in different styles, or to be able to mimic other people's writing styles. The GPT-3 model is capable of producing high-quality text in a range of styles, including news articles, and text on a range of other topics. OpenAI has provided some examples of the text that the GPT-3 model is capable of writing. This includes the following examples. The GPT-3 model is capable of writing high-quality text in a range of different styles. This is a result of training the model on a large dataset.

"Scientists have determined that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size by pitching them against each other in a competition over preferred burrows. There were also signs that they avoid fighting for burrows that don't fit their needs. The findings published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, suggest that mantis shrimp could use fighting to determine their own ideal burrow size. In the study, scientists collected wild mantis shrimp and matched them by size. They then introduced them to a variety of burrow sizes. When given a choice, shrimp with longer arms preferred larger burrows, and shrimp with shorter arms, preferred smaller burrows. In another experiment, they introduced pairs of shrimp to burrows of various sizes and recorded how long they fought and whether they changed burrows. The findings suggest that shrimp have a preferred size range that is different for each individual. Next, they tested whether shrimp would change burrows to avoid conflict by allowing pairs to fight over a burrow and then moving them to a new burrow. Sometimes the burrow was the same size as the original one, and sometimes it was slightly larger or smaller. They found that when a pair of shrimp fought over a small burrow, and were then moved to a larger burrow, they were unlikely to change burrows again. When the new burrow was smaller than the original one, however, they quickly moved to a different one. ""This suggests that shrimp avoid conflict over burrows by moving to burrows of different sizes,"" says lead author Dr. Nina Jones, a scientist at the University of Bristol. The researchers say they will now study how the size of the burrow affects the shrimp's movements inside of it.",0,410

"The US military has been building a massive database with millions of images of faces, irises, fingerprints, and DNA data over the last 15 years. There are at least 7.4 million entries, which includes 2.2 million belonging to US citizens. The images are collected from people in Afghanistan and Iraq and are used to identify potential suspects in intelligence investigations. However, there is no public accounting of the exact number of Americans' images that have been collected by the military over the years. In addition to faces and fingerprints, the collection includes biometric information from other body parts such as irises and DNA, as well as data on scars, tattoos and physical markings. The images are used to identify people in intelligence investigations. In the military's most recent fiscal year, the database received more than 100,000 new files, but it is unclear how many of them were of US citizens. The Military Department of Defense collected 2.2 million images of American citizens over a period of five years, according to data obtained by Gizmodo under the Freedom of Information Act. The images come from both civilians and military personnel who have had their biometric data collected over the past five years. The records show that the collection started in 2011, when the Military Department of Defense (MDA) started collecting biometric data on a large scale. In 2011, the MDA collected 9,200 images of American citizens, and in 2016, it collected more than 240,000. The data includes images from US passports and visas, as well as other public records.

The database has grown tremendously over the years, according to the documents obtained by Gizmodo, and the collection of Americans' data has grown with it. In 2016, the database had approximately 2.2 million images of citizens. The Military Department of Defense has not commented on the information. The new data obtained by Gizmodo is part of the military's Automated Biometric Identification System, or ABIS, which contains fingerprints, photos, iris scans, and other biometric data for use by the military and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The collection of data is part of an effort to identify the perpetrators of terrorist attacks. According to the MDA, the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. The system is used to identify people in intelligence investigations and has become an ""essential tool"" in the war on terrorism. The MDA used ABIS to identify a suspect in the terrorist attack in Brussels in 2016, which is an example of how the database can be used to help identify people in a large-scale investigation. Biometric data has been collected by the military in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2004. The first records of the system include a collection of 100,000 images taken from detainees and civilians who were used as witnesses. The collection of data was authorized by the President of the United States to help identify potential suspects in terrorism. In 2008, the military's data was combined with the FBI's database, creating one of the largest biometric databases in the world.

"Green Launch is a company that wants to launch satellites into space using a huge gas cannon. A hydrogen impulse launcher is a long tube filled with hydrogen, helium, and some other gasses, capped at one end, and pressurized to 10,000 psi. When a 2-inch-wide projectile is sent into the tube, it goes supersonic, and blasts through the 5-foot-thick barrier at the other end at over 10,000 mph, into space. The total cost to send up a 300-pound satellite would be about 450,000, versus 50 million using a conventional rocket. The article doesn't mention how many satellites would be sent into space during a typical launch. If they were to launch one at a time, then it would take 215 launches per year just to send up the same number of satellites that are sent up currently. If it only takes about 110th of a second to send up a satellite, then they'd have to launch one about every 20 seconds to equal today's satellite launches.

One such situation is using CSS as a server-side language. CSS was designed to style HTML elements on the front-end, and many developers will try to use CSS to accomplish tasks it wasn't designed to do, often with less than ideal results. I recently read a great article titled ""The Strange World of CSS,"" and it got me thinking about CSS and how it is used. In my experience, there are two kinds of developers when it comes to using CSS. The first group will use CSS as a server-side language. They will try to use CSS to do all sorts of things, even though that was never its intended purpose. They will use CSS selectors and classes as a way of manipulating data and displaying things on the page. The second group will use CSS as a client-side language. They will use it to style their HTML elements and do nothing else. There are many reasons that developers will use CSS in this way, and they often have to do with the tools they are using. For example, if the only way to make your site look the way you want it to is by using CSS classes, then you have no other option. That isn't the developers' fault. The same is true when there is no other way for them to manipulate data. If the tool they are using only allows for styling and class manipulation, then that is what they will do. This article is not intended to be an indictment on using CSS as a server-side language. There are times when there are no other options. Rather, this article is intended to educate developers on the dangers of using CSS as a server-side language. It can be easy to fall into the trap of using CSS to do things it wasn't intended to do. Developers should be aware of when this is happening and make the decision to use a more appropriate tool. What Is the Difference Between Client-Side and Server-Side Code? Before we talk about the dangers of using CSS as a server-side language, we need to understand the difference between client-side and server-side code. In general, client-side code is executed on the user's machine. It can be run directly in the browser or through a framework that does a lot of the heavy lifting. Server-side code is executed on the server. What Is the Difference Between Client-Side and Server-Side Languages? The difference between client-side and server-side languages is that client-side code is executed on the user's machine, and server-side code is executed on the server. This means that there are two different types of code, and they each serve a different purpose. Client-side code is designed to run on the user's machine and do things like handle events, display data, and make AJAX requests. Server-side code is designed to run on the server. It is used to handle requests and serve up data to the client. With this in mind, it is easy to see how using CSS as a server-side language can lead to issues. Many frameworks will allow you to add styles to your HTML elements. This is intended to allow you to easily style elements, but there are some serious pitfalls to using CSS as a server-side language. Many developers have a ""style first"" mentality. They will design their HTML elements and then style them. This is often done through CSS classes. This might seem like a great approach, but it can quickly turn into a nightmare. Adding a CSS class to an HTML element doesn't just style it, it also changes the underlying data. What I mean by this is that if you have a list of items that you are displaying to the user, then adding a CSS class to one of those items will not only change the way that it looks but also how the data is stored. For example, let's say you have a list of users, and you want to highlight the current user. You could do that by adding a CSS class to that user's HTML element",0,419
"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies were based on a technique called carbon dating, which involved detecting the ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12. The ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12 can be used to estimate the age of an organism. However, this method is flawed because it only gives an estimate of the age of the cell, not the age of the organism. Researchers at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute, in conjunction with a team from the University of Basel, decided to re-examine the earlier data using a more recent methodology. The technique used in this study is based on the fact that newer cells will be more likely to divide than older cells. As a result, the telomeres on the ends of the chromosomes will be shorter in newer cells. The new methodology involved detecting telomere length in the hippocampus of both older and younger rats. The researchers found that the telomeres of the neurons in the hippocampus of the younger rats were longer than the telomeres of neurons in the hippocampus of the older rats. This suggests that younger rats have newer hippocampal cells. In the case of the older rats, the researchers found that at least some of their hippocampal neurons were recently created. However, the researchers also found that the older rats had fewer new neurons than the younger rats, suggesting that hippocampal neurogenesis decreases with age. This study suggests that some older adults continue to make new hippocampal cells. In addition, this study suggests that older studies that claimed that adults stop making new neurons were based on a flawed methodology.",0,421
"Urban Air Port will build its first Air-One transport hub for autonomous delivery drones and electric flying cars in Coventry, UK. The facility will launch later this year and support a new generation of sustainable mobility solutions. Air-One is a dedicated mobility hub that will manage fleets of delivery drones and electric flying cars. The hub will be managed by Urban Air Port, a company focused on the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into urban environments. Urban Air Port has already received letters of support from the City of Coventry, the Transport Systems Catapult, and the University of Warwick. Urban Air Port will begin by operating a fleet of unmanned delivery drones, flying up to 30 miles at a time, with a capacity of 10 pounds. The drones will carry items like groceries and online orders, and will be routed to Air-One hubs for refueling and reloading. The hubs will also serve as a base for Urban Air Port's electrical air vehicles. The company has already signed agreements with the engineering group Vertical Aerospace, and has also received significant support from Volocopter. ""The biggest opportunity in the market is the electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that will start to become available in 2020. They will be able to carry one to four passengers, with ranges of 20 to 100 miles, and will eventually be affordable to the mass market. The eVTOLs will be the foundation for the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry, in the same way that the Ford Model T was the foundation for the automotive industry,"" said Jonathan Tremain, Founder and CEO of Urban Air Port. Earlier this month, Urban Air Port announced the construction of its first Air-One transport hub in Pawling, New York. The Pawling hub will enable UAV delivery in the New York area, and will later support eVTOL flights when they become available.",0,422
"Meta released an update on Horizon's user growth during its most recent earnings call. Since Horizon Worlds was rolled out to all Quest users in the US and Canada in mid-October, the app has been downloaded by 200,000 users. The app also has 350,000 monthly active users, which is about one-quarter of Quest's total install base. Horizon Worlds is a social VR app that lets users create and explore a shared virtual world. It's Quest's first big step into the social VR space, and it's a key part of Meta's strategy to turn Quest into a platform for both entertainment and business uses. As Meta continues to build out its platform, the company will be able to better compete with Facebook for users and developers. This will be important if Meta wants to build out a social VR ecosystem for Quest, as Facebook's social VR platform is much more popular than Horizon Worlds right now. Horizon Worlds is a social VR app that's available for Meta's Quest headset. The app was first introduced in July, and it was rolled out to all Quest users in the US and Canada in mid-October. Horizon Worlds is a big part of Meta's strategy to turn Quest into a platform for both entertainment and business uses. Meta's platform strategy has been well-received by investors, and it's led to the company's stock price rising almost 15 over the last month. Here's what investors need to know about Horizon Worlds. Meta released an update on Horizon's user growth during its most recent earnings call. Since Horizon Worlds was rolled out to all Quest users in the US and Canada in mid-October, the app has been downloaded by 200,000 users. The app also has 350,000 monthly active users, which is about one-quarter of Quest's total install base. The company will release an update on Horizon Worlds' user growth in the coming weeks. Horizon Worlds is designed to allow users to create virtual worlds and environments, and to connect with friends in VR. When users create an avatar, they can customize their appearance by changing their hair color, skin color, clothing, and more. Once a user creates their avatar, they can visit and explore other people's worlds. Users can explore virtual environments like the 80s, the moon, and more. They can also play mini games like Ping Pong and paintball, listen to music, watch YouTube videos, or just hang out with friends in a virtual environment. The app also supports voice chat, and users can see what their friends are doing in VR. If a user creates a virtual world, they can invite their friends to explore it, or they can make it public so any Horizon Worlds user can visit. What does this mean for Meta? Horizon Worlds is a key part of Meta's plan to turn Quest into a platform for entertainment and business uses. The company thinks that eventually, Quest will be used for everything from watching movies to conducting business meetings. And Horizon Worlds is a big part of that strategy. Meta wants to build out a social VR ecosystem for Quest, and Horizon Worlds is a key piece of that puzzle. Meta hopes that the app will attract both users and developers to the Quest platform, and it could help Meta build out a community of Quest developers. Meta faces competition from Facebook in the social VR space. Facebook's social VR platform, Horizon, is more popular than Horizon Worlds right now, as it has around 40,000 concurrent users. But Meta thinks that it can eventually beat Facebook in the social VR space by offering developers and users more flexibility than Facebook does. If Meta can build out a successful social VR ecosystem for Quest, then it could help the company become a leader in the VR space. And that could make Quest the go-to VR headset for both entertainment and business use cases.",0,423
"Redis 7.0 is now available. It adds almost 50 new commands and options. The most notable improvements are Redis Functions, AVLv2, command introspection, and Sharded PubSub. A lot of development effort went into security. For example, Redis Functions are executed within an isolated Lua environment. Because it is a major release, we recommend a careful and cautious upgrade, preferably via a fast-forward (redis-6.2 - redis-7.0) on a test setup before upgrading production. Because of the major changes and the huge number of changes, there are some breaking changes, and minor regressions. The most notable regressions are listed in the release notes. So, it's not recommended to update in production without thorough testing. The post 7.0 Is Now Available appeared first on Redis Labs. Published at DZone with permission of Lior Ohayon , DZone MVB.

"Deep Nostalgia is an AI-powered service offered by online genealogy company MyHeritage that creates moving portraits from still photos. It uses pre-recorded driver videos of facial movements and applies them to static images. I'm sure you've seen these before; they're often used to create animated versions of people who have passed away, or to animate characters from old photos and paintings. This isn't the first time these types of animations have been done, but MyHeritage says it's the first time they're being done with artificial intelligence, and they say the results are more realistic than those of other systems. The software was trained on 45,000 images using 800,000 faces to create 3D models for each. It works with photos that have both a frontal and a profile view, and while it's limited to two facial movements at the moment, the company says it will be adding more in the future. I tried it out with an old photo of my father and I was pretty impressed. The resemblance is uncanny. It's only available on MyHeritage's website, but the company says it's planning to make it available on smartphones later this year.",0,429
"'Can AI Kick It' is a team of Dutch academics who used AI techniques to generate music that was then entered into Eurovision. The lyrics were especially novel, but the music itself was not very good. The team leader, Martin de Haan, was interviewed by the BBC. He said that the lyrics were the output of a neural network trained on the lyrics of other Eurovision entries, but that the music was the output of a different AI method. I suspect that the music was the result of a completely different technique, but this is the first time that I have heard of using neural networks to generate lyrics. The lyrics were brilliant, but the music was a bit tedious. I think that this was because the music was the output of a different system than the lyrics. For the next contest, it would be good if the same method was used to generate both the lyrics and the music. I think that in general, this is a good approach to song-writing. Use the neural network to come up with the lyrics, then use the same network to come up with the music.",0,430
"Reddit has acquired Dubsmash, a short-form video social platform. Dubsmash will continue to exist as a separate platform and brand, but its software will be integrated into Reddit. Reddit has also hired all 25 members of Dubsmash's technical team. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Dubsmash has been primarily known as a lip-syncing app, but it also enables users to create short video clips of themselves. The app has 100 million downloads. The Dubsmash app will continue to exist, but it will now be operated by Reddit. Dubsmash has experimented with features that are similar to Reddit's, such as creating communities for specific topics and interests. The company also ran a pilot program in which it gave users the ability to publish their Dubsmash videos directly to Reddit. Dubsmash believes that the acquisition will allow it to accelerate its plans. Dubsmash was founded in 2014 and is based in Berlin. It has raised 46 million in funding to date, including a 14 million Series B round in 2016. This is Reddit's first acquisition since it raised a 300 million Series D round last year. It's also the first acquisition since Reddit named its new CEO, Steve Huffman, and COO, Jen Wong. ""We will be working closely with the Dubsmash team to integrate their offering into our existing communities and will be leveraging their incredible talent to develop more engaging product experiences for Reddit,"" said Reddit's vice president of consumer product Alex Le. Dubsmash says that its community will benefit from Reddit's ""hundreds of millions of passionate users."" ""We are looking forward to pursuing new opportunities with Reddit to grow our reach and bring more joy to users worldwide, while maintaining the Dubsmash brand, culture and products,"" said Dubsmash CEO Roland Grenke. ""Dubsmash will continue to operate as an independent entity."" Reddit's acquisition comes as the company continues to grow. Last week, Reddit said it had 1.4 billion video views in August.

"NASA has given SpaceX approval to launch its first astronauts into space. There are still additional reviews to be completed, but there should be no major issues standing in the way. SpaceX has been preparing for this moment for a few years now, and it's finally about to become a reality. The agency has given SpaceX approval to conduct the Demo-2 mission, the first to include astronauts. NASA's commercial crew program manager Kathy Lueders told reporters in a conference call that SpaceX can now work toward the Demo-2 launch. ""We are aiming for that first quarter of 2019, but there's still a lot of work to be done,"" Lueders said. The Demo-2 mission will be the first time SpaceX launches astronauts into space from the US. There are still reviews that must be completed before the Demo-2 launch, but there should be no issues at this point. NASA is working with SpaceX to ensure Demo-2 will be successful. NASA wants to make sure the Dragon capsule is safe for astronauts. The capsule will be fitted with four seats for the astronauts, and it will include a life-support system. The capsule will also feature 11 windows for the astronauts to view space as they head to the International Space Station. There will be a test flight before the Demo-2 mission. SpaceX will conduct an uncrewed test mission in January, which will also launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The test flight is designed to gather data about how the capsule performs in space and how the astronauts will be able to interact with the capsule's systems. In addition to SpaceX, NASA is working with Boeing to get its astronauts back into space. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will also be used for the commercial crew program, but the company is still behind on development. The company's first test flight is planned for March 2019, but the first crewed flight won't be ready until August.

"Scientists at MIT have published a paper detailing a new type of artificial brain synapse that can potentially produce devices that can handle complex AI computing locally without having to send data to the cloud. According to the researchers, the technology could produce ""event-based"" neuromorphic computing, meaning it could work more efficiently by responding to actual signals instead of having to wait for data to stream through it at a certain rate. The new device is based on the phase-change memory (PCM) already found in many computers, and could be a big step toward bringing AI functions to a wide range of devices. The researchers said that in order for artificial intelligence to work locally on mobile devices, it needs to be able to respond to the unpredictable timing of the signals it receives. The team claims to have accomplished this using PCM - a memory technology that stores data by altering the state of the chalcogenide glass - in a way that allows the glass to undergo sudden changes when electricity is applied to it. By exploiting this sudden change, the PCM can be used to represent the binary states used by conventional computers. But unlike existing technologies, PCMs can be switched back and forth between the two states in less than a trillionth of a second. By combining PCM with a fast-switching transistor, the researchers were able to create a new type of synapse that can be programmed to fire when it receives a specific signal. The researchers were also able to demonstrate that the synapses could be connected together to form a neuromorphic array that was able to perform a simple, unsupervised machine-learning task. The work is currently being patented through the MIT Technology Licensing Office.",0,436
"Scientists in France have developed a method for recycling PET plastics by modifying organisms to produce an enzyme that breaks down the plastic. The broken-down plastic can then be used to produce new bottles. In a new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of scientists from the French National Centre for Scientific Research recycled plastics using a bacterium they genetically modified to produce an enzyme called PETase. The enzyme is able to digest polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used to make plastic bottles. PETase is found in the bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, which was discovered in 2016 in a Japanese recycling plant. The bacteria uses PETase to break down PET plastics, allowing it to use the plastic to build cellular walls. ""Serendipity often plays a significant role in fundamental scientific research and our discovery here is no exception,"" said Professor McGeehan. ""Although the improvement is modest, this unanticipated discovery suggests that there is room to further improve these enzymes, moving us closer to a recycling solution for the ever-growing mountain of discarded plastics."" As it stands, the bacterium can only partially break down PET plastics, but the scientists were able to improve its ability by adjusting the enzyme's structure. This resulted in an enzyme that is even better at breaking down PET plastic. ""Experiments showed that the enzyme can also degrade polyethylene furandicarboxylate, or PEF, a bio-based substitute for PET that is being hailed as a replacement for glass beer bottles,"" said Professor McGeehan. The scientists now hope to continue their research to understand how PETase works and improve its ability even further.",0,437

"RediSQL is a fast, in-memory, SQL engine. Based on Redis, it is easy to use, works with standard SQL, and can reach speeds of up to 130,000 inserts per second. RediSQL can be used as a cache for the data in your MySQL database. The data that is accessed most frequently is placed in RediSQL, and this data is retrieved when the user accesses the database. The other data remains in MySQL, which is much better at storing large quantities of data. You can also use RediSQL as a database by itself. You can use it as a data store for a temporary file that will be deleted within a short time, for example. In this guide, we will show you how to set up RediSQL on your Ubuntu 16.04 server. You can find these packages in the Ubuntu repositories. First, we will make sure that there are no other Redis instances running on your system. Then, we will start the Redis server. After the server is up and running, we will install the RediSQL extension. Next, we will set up the RediSQL database. Now that RediSQL is up and running, we will create a table called products to store the products in our online store. You can insert data into the products table using the SQL INSERT command. You can also read the data from the table using the SELECT statement. You can also delete a row in the table using the DELETE statement. In this guide, we have shown you how to set up RediSQL on an Ubuntu 16.04 server. RediSQL is an in-memory database that is easy to use and install. We have created a table called products, which we can use to store data in the database. Of course, you are not limited to one table. You can add as many tables as you like, and use the same commands to insert, delete, and read data from these tables.",0,439
"Jordan Peterson has announced the development of a new social media platform, Thinkspot. The platform aims to provide users the best features of other social media, but without the censorship. ""Once you're on our platform we won't take you down unless we're ordered to by a US court of law,"" Peterson said in an interview with The Daily Caller. Peterson, who was one of the first to be banned by Patreon, has become known for his no-nonsense, politically incorrect style. ""If you're engaging in conversation, you're not going to be taken down. If you're being harassed, you can block the person harassing you. If they go around and try to harass you on a different platform you can put them in the block chain,"" Peterson said. The idea is that Thinkspot will provide the freedom of speech and dialogue that other social media sites have lost. Peterson has a strong following with his videos, podcasts and lectures. He has 1.6 million subscribers to his YouTube channel. Peterson is not the only one who has been banned. In April, conservative commentator and journalist Lauren Southern was banned from Instagram. In March, conservative commentator Paul Joseph Watson was banned from Facebook, although he was later reinstated. The Facebook-owned photo-sharing site Instagram banned the account of conservative commentator Paul Joseph Watson, along with several other right-leaning personalities, in May. In May, a report came out that Facebook had an ""internal document"" that listed the conservative and libertarian websites it regarded as ""hate agents."" The list included the Daily Caller and the Daily Wire. Facebook banned seven pages of ""Ice Age Now"" in February. In 2016, Facebook banned the pro-Israel page of Israeli conservative Shurat HaDin. Twitter has suspended and banned accounts of conservatives, including actor James Woods. Pinterest has banned pro-life group LiveAction.org.

"While businesses are complaining about the shortage of workers, older job seekers are finding that even with the right qualifications for the job, they are being turned away due to their age. The number of people who are 65 or older, who are still employed, is at a record high, according to a recent report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are 9.2 million people in this age group who have full-time or part-time jobs. However, while many businesses are complaining about the shortage of workers, older job seekers are finding that even with the right qualifications for the job, they are being turned away due to their age. In a new poll, 40 percent of older job applicants reported that they had been turned down for a job in the last two years because of their age. The survey also found that of the 37 percent of older workers who are still employed and who are actively looking for work, 20 percent are struggling to find jobs. While it's been illegal to discriminate against workers based on their age since 1967, older people are still finding that companies are reluctant to hire them. Some businesses are worried that older workers will have health problems. Others are worried that older workers are more expensive than younger ones. AARP, which conducted the survey, found that some older workers were told that they were overqualified for the job. There are also some employers who simply have a bias against older workers, and some who believe that older workers will have difficulty working with younger colleagues. But older workers do have some advantages, including experience and the ability to work with different generations. These qualities are important to employers, according to the survey. There are several things that older job seekers can do to help them when they are applying for jobs. First, they should use a resume that is short and concise. It should also be tailored to fit the job. They should also network with former co-workers and bosses. They can get in touch with people on social media sites such as LinkedIn, which is a business-oriented site. It is also important to stay active on social media sites. Older job seekers should also show their eagerness for the job. They should do their research about the company and the industry before the interview. They should also show that they have the right skills for the job. Older job seekers should also be ready for the inevitable question: What are you doing to keep up with new technology? It is important to know the right answer to that question. If older job seekers do find themselves out of a job, they can turn to an organization like the AARP Foundation, which offers a Senior Community Service Employment Program to help low-income seniors find jobs. Seniors can also turn to the National Older Worker Career Center, which offers a variety of career services and skills training to older workers who are 55 or older.",0,444

"For those of you who don't know him Rob Walling is an OG internet small business entrepreneur, cohost of the Startups for the Rest of Us, and cofounder of Microconf. In 2006 Rob dropped out of a PhD program at the University of Minnesota to start a company with his then-girlfriend Nicole. That company was HitTail. He's been doing startups ever since. Rob's most recent project is Drip, an email marketing automation company that is arguably the best email marketing automation platform available for small businesses. I had a lot of questions for Rob and he was kind enough to oblige. Enjoy! Eli: What does the word ""entrepreneur"" mean to you? Rob: It's a word I shy away from, honestly. I think it's a grossly overused word, especially in the tech startup world, and I don't like how it's used. I don't like how it's used as a blanket term for anyone who starts a business. It's an overused word and I'd prefer to say you're a ""business owner"" or a ""startup founder."" I'm not a huge fan of the word ""entrepreneur"" because it's been overused. Eli: For you, does entrepreneurship ever stop being exciting? Rob: I think it stops being exciting when you're not doing anything new, when you're doing the same thing over and over again and your business gets to a certain size. That's where I am now. It's no longer exciting to get that first paying customer. It's no longer exciting to go to market with a new product. The last few years have been more of an operational, boring management phase, and that's not something I enjoy doing. Eli: So you're not enjoying running Drip as much as you used to enjoy running HitTail and other startups? Rob: I enjoy it much less, yes. The first couple years were exciting as we built a new product, got our first paying customers, and built a team. It was exciting to get those first few employees and get the team growing and working together. It's like raising a child. When they're first born it's super exciting and fun and you get to teach them to walk and talk. Then when they're a teenager it's a pain in the ass. Now I'm in the middle of that teenager phase, where it's a little painful. I'm not having fun doing the day-to-day work, so I'm not enjoying it that much. That's why I'm spending a lot of my time thinking about what my next project will be. Eli: What makes you feel successful as an entrepreneur? Rob: For me, it's having a decent amount of freedom to work on whatever I want to work on. I don't need to make a ton of money. I don't need to be rich. I don't need to be a billionaire. I like having a lot of freedom in my schedule, and the ability to work on whatever I want to work on. Eli: Is that what you're doing now? Rob: Not really. I'm still at the point where I'm working on the business and I'm still very hands on. Eli: When you say you're thinking about your next project are you thinking about starting a new business? Rob: Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a new business, or maybe just an experimental project. I'm not sure I want to do a full-fledged business at this point. I'm at a point in my life where I don't want to be fully engaged in a startup. I'm not going to be raising venture capital. I'm not going to be making it my life's work. I'm just looking for a new project. Eli: You said you want freedom in your schedule. Does that mean you want to be able to work on a new business without taking too much time away from Drip? Rob: Yes, that's exactly it. I want to spend a lot of time with my kids, I want to be able to go to the gym whenever I want, and I want to have the ability to work on whatever I want to work on. That's why I'm not in a hurry to start a new business. I'm",0,446

A massive report by the World Wildlife Foundation involving 59 scientists has found that humanity has wiped out 60 of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970. Other studies have shown that 680 vertebrate species have gone extinct since the 16th Century. These figures are from studies by other researchers. There are many factors involved. Climate change, poaching, and loss of habitat and other man-made factors have all contributed. The WWF report states that wildlife populations will decrease by two-thirds by 2020 if nothing is done to stop the trend. In October 2017, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a separate group of scientists, reported that 27 of the world's coral reefs had died or were dying. The report predicts that 90 of reefs will be destroyed by 2050. Another study in October 2017 by the United Nations Environment Programme shows that 200,000 species are in danger of extinction. Many of us have enjoyed wildlife shows on television. We can see polar bears, penguins, whales, and other creatures. In the future, will there be any wildlife left for our grandchildren and their children to see on television or in the wild? Some people say it is not important. What do you think? Many people believe that the Bible teaches that God's purpose is to fill the earth with people. Genesis 1:28 says that God wants people to subdue and rule over the earth. But the word subdue means to take care of and rule over something like a king takes care of his kingdom. Even though the world will end one day, we must be good stewards of God's creation. We must do everything we can to protect what God has made. This entry was posted in Easy English, Plus and tagged Christianity, creation, English, environment, nature, science, stewardship, world.

"A 33-foot-long 3D printer can build new homes in 24 hours. It is currently building a neighborhood in a rural area on the outskirts of a town in Southern Mexico. The homes can be built in 24 hours at a cost of 4000 each. The printer can build 300 square meters (3,229 square feet) a day. Emergency Shelters Built In 24 Hours For 4,000 Each The project is called the '3D Housing 05 project. It is the brainchild of Yves Behar, founder and principal designer of design firm Fuseproject. Behar is working with New Story, a charity, on the project. New Story has already built 850 homes in Haiti, El Salvador, and Bolivia. New Story is also working with ICON, a construction technologies company that designed the printer. The process uses a technology called ""Contour Crafting"" developed by University of Southern California professor Behrokh Khoshnevis. The giant printer is like a crane that is mounted on a track. It is capable of building a home with a concrete structure, roof, windows, and doors. It can also integrate wiring and plumbing during the construction process. The concrete mixture that is used is similar to what is used in a poured foundation. Contour crafting is a technology developed by Behrokh Khoshnevis from the University of Southern California. A computer-guided, large-scale 3D printer can create walls and other features of a home. The machine can build a home on-site, layer by layer. Khoshnevis first published his ideas in 2004. The idea was to build structures layer-by-layer, in a semi-automated process. The system would be capable of making a single dwelling or a large apartment building. The process would be similar to building with concrete, except it would be done with robotic arms and a computer-controlled nozzle. Contour crafting technology can fabricate both walls and floors of a building in a single run. This is because it can print in a vertical plane. The machines can build a single home or an entire neighborhood at a time. The project can produce stronger and more durable buildings than current construction methods. The technology can reduce energy costs and waste and would not require human laborers. Khoshnevis said, ""It would be a significant departure from traditional home construction. A nozzle squirts out concrete in a continuous flow, like toothpaste from a tube, and a trowel smoothes it into place. A laser-guided leveling system ensures a flat surface. Whereas a human worker would have to stop and start, the robot can run non-stop, completing a home in 24 hours."" The printer is currently in the early stages of testing. The technology has been around since 2004 but this is the first time a project like this has been undertaken. Building Materials From Moon Dust There are other projects around the world that are using 3D printing to build homes. Researchers from the European Space Agency (ESA) are working to build a lunar base on the moon using 3D printing. The first step is to 3D print a lunar base using simulated lunar material. The researchers used a mixture of iron oxide simulant, which is a byproduct of metallurgy and is already used in 3D printing. In 2013, the ESA began a project called the 3D Printing of Lunar Regolith (3DPL) project. The project is working to build a lunar base using materials found on the moon. The ESA is also working to see if 3D printing can produce materials and structures using moon dust. The ESA's 3D Printing of Lunar Regolith project is being run in conjunction with the European Union's Future and Emerging Technologies arm, known as the FET. A spokesman for ESA said, ""As a practice run, a one-third scale version of a lunar habitat is being created using a 3D printer."" They are also testing 3D printing methods in vacuum chambers to make sure it will work in the moon's airless environment. The ESA is planning to create a 3D printed habitat on the moon. The base will be designed to take advantage of the moon's low gravity and be built from the moon's natural material. It will be a large dome that is 2.6 meters high",0,448

We present a method for interpreting the behavior of a deep neural network (DNN) in terms of the training examples that led to the DNN's final state. Using a simple iterative algorithm, we compute an importance vector for each training example, representing the extent to which the example contributed to the DNN's final behavior. We evaluate our algorithm on a variety of neural networks trained on standard benchmark tasks. Our approach provides insights into the learning behavior of the neural network, and can be used to measure the contribution of each training example to the final DNN.",0,449

"Bemisia tabaci is a whitefly that acquired a gene from its plant host millions of years ago, allowing it to neutralize a toxin that some plants produce to defend against insects. This whitefly is a major agricultural pest in the Middle East and Europe. Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Bemisia tabaci is a major agricultural pest worldwide and in particular in the Middle East and Europe. In the Middle East, the whitefly transmits viruses that have devastated populations of tomatoes, cucumbers and other crops. In Europe, the whitefly causes significant crop damage by sucking sap from the underside of leaves. In 2011, this whitefly was found in the United States for the first time. Currently, it has been detected in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Virginia, as well as in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. Because this whitefly is so destructive, researchers are keen to learn more about it. In particular, they want to know how it can feed on so many different plant species. How the whitefly feeds Like other herbivorous insects, B. tabaci feeds by sucking the fluids out of plant leaves, and as a result, plants have evolved to defend themselves against these pests. For example, some plants have developed toxins, such as salicylic acid, that are harmful to insects. Some insects have evolved a way to neutralize these plant toxins. One way they do this is by acquiring the genes responsible for producing these toxins from their plant host. By acquiring this gene, the insects are able to neutralize the toxins by producing the same salicylic acid compounds that the plant does. Scientists have found evidence that this has occurred in aphids, but until now, they had not found it in whiteflies. Now, researchers at the University of Illinois, including UChicago alumnus Hugh Robertson, PhD'91, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, have found that B. tabaci has acquired a gene from its plant host that allows it to neutralize salicylic acid toxins. Robertson and his team sequenced the DNA of B. tabaci and compared it to that of its plant hosts, Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato. They found that the whitefly had acquired a gene that allowed it to produce salicylic acid and neutralize the toxin. Their findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shed light on how this destructive insect is able to feed on so many different plant species.

"In 2017, Astrophysicists at the European Space Agency spotted an iceberg the size of Las Vegas breaking off the Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. The iceberg has since changed shape and split into two. Late last week, when NASA's Operation IceBridge flew its first 2018 Antarctic survey flight, the Pine Island Glacier iceberg had already changed shape and split into two. The massive iceberg's split was first reported by Project MIDAS, a UK-based Antarctic research project that closely watches the Pine Island Glacier. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is a remnant of an iceberg that broke off in 2015 and is now known as B-44. B-44 broke into smaller fragments. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg was initially discovered in October 2017, by a group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine. It was already cracked into four pieces. The iceberg is now located in the Amundsen Sea, which has seen a number of large icebergs breaking off from the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. Since the 1990s, the Pine Island Glacier has lost a significant amount of ice. In total, the glacier has lost 270 square miles of ice, according to NASA. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg has not yet moved far from where it first broke off. But, if it does, it will likely not stay in one piece. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is one of the largest ever seen at 225 square miles, the size of Long Island, NY. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is the second massive iceberg to break off Antarctica in the last six months. The first was the 2,200-square-mile iceberg that broke off from the Larsen C Ice Shelf. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg could also be a sign of the changing climate. Thwaites Glacier is known as the ""weak underbelly"" of the Antarctic ice sheet. According to the Washington Post, if the Thwaites Glacier breaks off, it could raise sea levels by 2 feet. That would be catastrophic for coastal communities. The Thwaites Glacier iceberg is not the only Antarctic iceberg that could raise sea levels. A recently published study in the journal Nature concluded that ""Antarctic ice loss is a major contributor to sea-level rise."" The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Leeds, Imperial College London, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and other institutions. The researchers concluded that the melting of Antarctic ice, including the Pine Island Glacier iceberg, has increased sea levels by 7.6 mm since 1992. The melting of ice in Antarctica has increased by 280 percent since 2009, according to another study published in Nature. As sea levels rise, coastal communities are becoming more vulnerable to flooding and storm surges. The Pine Island Glacier iceberg is not the first to break off Antarctica in the last year. But, there is more to the melting of the Pine Island Glacier iceberg and other icebergs in Antarctica than climate change. In some areas of Antarctica, such as the South Pole, temperatures have actually fallen in the last 50 years. This is due to a changing climate and the ozone hole. The loss of ice from the Pine Island Glacier iceberg could also be due to warmer ocean temperatures. The melting of the Pine Island Glacier iceberg and other icebergs has led to some unusual effects. As the Pine Island Glacier iceberg melts, the glacier behind it has sped up and become more unstable, which could lead to more icebergs. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey believe that the Pine Island Glacier iceberg may be a sign of the Pine Island Glacier becoming more unstable and that it could break off more icebergs in the future.",0,454
"magniX, an Australian engineering firm, in a partnership with Harbour Air, a Canadian air-ferry service, has performed the first fully-electric commercial aircraft test flight. The 15-minute flight took place in Richmond, British Columbia. MagniX CEO Roei Ganzarski said of the flight, ""This proof of concept is the beginning of a trend that will play out in the next few years where we believe all-electric propulsion will be a common form of flight."" MagniX's system uses 750-horsepower (560-kilowatt) electric motors to drive the propellers of a Harbour Air de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver seaplane. The company claims its magni500 system is three times more efficient than a piston-engine aircraft. That efficiency could allow the aircraft to fly 300 miles on a single charge. The first flight was short, but MagniX is already planning to deploy 50 electric planes with the magni500 system by 2022. Ganzarski also said, ""We're focused on the commercial side.

It was disappointing, but I didn't really mind all that much because I'd just gotten an offer from another company that was going to pay me quite a bit more than what I was making at the startup. Then, a few months later, the company went public, and everyone got a nice little bonus. The stock, which was offered at around 30 a share, shot up to over 200 a share in just the first week, and I was left wondering whether I should have waited. However, the stock quickly plummeted back down to under 20 a share, and I was glad I had made the move. We all know the story of the dot-com bubble. The stock eventually went down to just a few pennies a share, and the company was never able to recover. It did get bought out by a larger company, though, and I think the larger company kept the same name. The stock is still listed on NASDAQ, but the company isn't in the same business anymore. I got lucky because I got a good offer from another company. I feel bad for all the employees who were there when the company went public, because I know most of them lost a lot of money. I did my first internship in 2007 at a startup that was acquired about halfway through my internship. My summer turned into a very interesting one. Prior to the acquisition, the environment was awesome. People were excited about the work they were doing and there were plenty of extracurricular activities. For instance, every week the company would order lunch from a local restaurant and everyone would have lunch together. After the acquisition, the culture changed. Almost immediately, the company cancelled all extracurricular activities and started to change the office. It was a lot less fun to work there. The people who were working at the startup at the time of the acquisition didn't really have much to complain about, but I do feel like the company changed quite a bit after the acquisition. I'm working for a startup now that I'm pretty sure will sell to a larger company in the near future, and I've been doing research on similar companies and how their cultures changed after an acquisition. The two stories above aren't the only examples of how the culture changes after an acquisition. I'm not too worried, because I'm looking for a new job anyway, but I am a little concerned about my current company and how it will change after the acquisition.",0,458
"Ekioh is a UK-based company that is developing its own browser from scratch. Flow will be built from a blank slate, with its own rendering engine. The project aims to create a browser that is fast, secure, lightweight and low maintenance. Flow will be a browser that is not bloated with unnecessary features, which will help with its performance and security. The company's CEO, David Ayre, has stated that he wants the browser to be the fastest on the market. This will be achieved by building Flow from the ground up, with all the core components being written in C. This should allow the browser to run much faster than those written in scripting languages. The project has been going for around a year, and the first release of the browser will be available soon. The browser will run on Windows and Mac OS X. There will be both 32-bit and 64-bit versions available. More information on Ekioh can be found here. The project's website can be found here.

"The Senate's new infrastructure bill may shape the future of cryptocurrency in the US. The bill promises public spending on major projects and it proposes taxes on crypto brokers to fund it. The bill is yet to be voted on and will likely be amended before then, but if it becomes law it would affect many industries. Funding infrastructure spending is a tricky business for any government. Recently, President Trump proposed an infrastructure bill with no funding. The Senate's new bill is designed to provide money for the President's project, with the help of crypto taxes. The bipartisan bill proposes an increase in funding of 25 percent for many major infrastructure projects. This funding is to be provided by taxes on crypto brokers and investors. A 1 percent fee would be charged on every transaction, and this could be passed on to investors. The bill is an attempt to balance the interests of investors and the public. As it stands, it would allow crypto investors to avoid a significant proportion of capital gains tax, in return for funding infrastructure. The public would benefit from the infrastructure spending, but it is possible that the bill could lead to a decline in crypto investment in the US. If the bill passes, it will be the first step in crypto regulation in the US. Other countries have already taken steps to regulate crypto, but the US has been slow to do so. The bill could lead to further crypto regulation in the US. The SEC has already investigated many ICOs and it is possible that this could lead to regulation of ICOs in the future. The bill is yet to be voted on. It is likely to be amended before it is voted on, so the final version could be very different from what has been proposed.",0,460
"Uniqlo has managed to automate 90 percent of its flagship Tokyo warehouse. The facility includes a two-armed robot that can fold and box t-shirts. Uniqlo's parent company, Fast Retailing, partnered with Daifuku, the largest materials handling company in Japan, to build the automated facility in a short time. The process begins with plastic tubs full of t-shirts traveling up a spiral conveyer belt to a machine that scans and sorts the shirts into four categories: men's, women's, kids', and babies'. The tubs are then transported to different areas of the warehouse depending on their category. The system can scan up to 600 items per minute. Shoe boxes and other items that need special handling are placed in different colored tubs and sent to specialized sorters. Robots then pull the items from the tubs and send them to workers who place them into boxes. Once packaged, the boxes are sent to the bottom floor of the warehouse, where robots move them to trucks. Humans do the driving. Labels: automation, robots, Uniqlo, warehouse Japanese consumers are buying less. That's bad news for apparel retailers. It's also bad news for the Japanese economy. According to the Wall Street Journal, consumers are spending less because of a hike in sales tax. The Japanese government increased the sales tax from 5 to 8 in April. Consumers have also curbed their spending because of a recent recession. Fast Retailing, the company that owns Uniqlo, expects its sales to drop 16 percent for the fiscal year that ends in August. The company's sales fell 8 percent last year. Labels: Fast Retailing, Japan, retail, sales, Uniqlo Behind the Scenes at the Gap Factory The Wall Street Journal has a great article on the Gap's experiment with making jeans in the United States. The article offers a look into how Gap's factory operates, as well as insights into why it's challenging for the retailer to manufacture domestically. The story focuses on the Gap's decision to make its 1969 jeans in Los Angeles, where it has been able to increase production of the jeans from 5,000 to 12,000 pairs a month since opening the facility. The Gap's CEO, Art Peck, says that domestic manufacturing gives the company more flexibility to respond to consumer demand. The Los Angeles factory also gives Gap the ability to create more unique products.

A catalog, after all, can help a retailer showcase products that it doesn't have room for in stores. It's also a way for retailers to reach consumers without having to go through traditional advertising channels. Of course, a catalog has to be properly designed and printed, and it also has to contain the right products. Otherwise, it won't make much of an impact. Labels: catalog, retail The World's Top-Selling Shirt How many shirts do you think you need? Probably not 1,000. In 2014, Amazon sold that many of a simple white, v-neck t-shirt. It's the top-selling shirt on the site. The shirt retails for 12.99, and it's made by the MVMT brand. According to MVMT's co-founder, the shirt sells so well because it's a high-quality, ""classic"" design that's a good deal.

"Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that wants to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting generator as a heat source. A start-up called Quaise Energy is developing a new technology that could create the world's deepest boreholes, opening up a new source of geothermal energy. Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that plans to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting generator as a heat source. X-rays will be used to melt rock in a borehole, enabling the borehole to reach greater depths. The company hopes to use X-rays to heat the rock at the bottom of a borehole and melt it into a liquid. Water will then be pumped into the borehole to form a steam that can be used to generate power. The company believes that its technology, which it calls Q-Tunnel, could cut the cost of drilling by more than 50 percent. The microwave power generator will be 10 times more efficient than the best gas or diesel generators on the market. The technology was developed in the lab of MIT Professor David Cahen, who is also the company's founder and CEO. The technology is based on the way that solar energy is created in the sun, Cahen said in an interview. ""The basic concept is the fusion concept,"" he said. ""We try to mimic the sun in a lab."" Sunlight is created when the fusion reaction, which fuses together two nuclei to create a single, larger nucleus, releases energy. Quaise will use a similar concept, but instead of nuclear fusion, it will use ""plasma fusion,"" which is the process of fusing together two electrons to create a single electron. When the electrons fuse, they release energy in the form of X-rays. It is the X-rays that will be used to heat the rock in the borehole. ""We use electrons instead of nuclei, and we use X-rays instead of neutrons,"" Cahen said. As the electrons fuse, they also release a stream of neutrons. The neutrons will be captured and used to heat the rock. ""We use the neutrons to heat the rock,"" Cahen said. ""We need both the X-rays and the neutrons to heat the rock."" Quaise has also developed a generator that can convert the X-rays and neutrons into microwave energy. The microwaves are converted into electricity that can be used to power the company's X-ray generators. Quaise is in the process of obtaining patents for its technologies and is seeking funding from venture capitalists and the government. The company plans to first use its technology in the oil and gas industry to explore for natural gas. ""In the oil industry, the cost of drilling is very high. That is why our technology will be very attractive,"" Cahen said. But Quaise's long-term goal is to use its technology to develop geothermal energy. ""Our first business will be in the oil and gas industry. But our dream is to drill 10 kilometers and get geothermal energy from the Earth,"" Cahen said. Quaise, which was founded in 2008, is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company employs 14 people, including 10 scientists.",0,464

"Traitor packages methods to exploit local misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in order to gain root access. Users can just run the binary on the target machine and it will exploit most of the possible vulnerabilities to gain root access. Traitor is able to run in headless mode and can be controlled via SSH. The tool ships with a default configuration file that can be modified to only exploit vulnerabilities that should be avoided. Traitor can also be used to clean up after it is done to remove traces of its activity on the target machine. Being a penetration tester, I have noticed that the most common method for gaining root access on a machine is via SSH. Most of the time this can be achieved by a simple brute force attack. This type of attack is usually not noticed by the administrator of the machine because no one will notice a machine that has been cracked. If you don't have a remote shell access, the next step is to gain access to the console of the target machine and use a Live-CD that contains all the tools that you need. If you are lucky, you can gain access to the console of the machine by simply walking into a data center and opening the case of the target machine. This is usually possible, since most companies don't have security guards in their data centers. If you have no physical access to the machine, the next step is to connect to it via network. In the worst case you have to plug a network cable into the target machine. In the best case you have already gained access to a machine that is in the same network as the target machine. You can either try to exploit local vulnerabilities in the operating system that the target machine is running or exploit local misconfigurations that provide you with an easy way to get root access. This is where traitor comes into play. traitor runs on the target machine and exploits misconfigurations and vulnerabilities to gain root access. If traitor runs in a headless mode, it will connect via SSH to the attacker's machine and send the output of the commands to the attacker's machine. If the attacker has no access to the target machine, traitor provides a way to install an SSH server on the target machine and run a Netcat listener. After the Netcat listener is running, the attacker can connect to the target machine via Netcat and control traitor. Traitor can also be used to remove all traces of the attack. When it is finished, it will automatically clean the file system, registry and the memory. After traitor is finished, there will be no traces of the attack. Traitor is built in C with the Qt framework and it has a modular design. It is released under the GPLv3 license. This project is not endorsed by any company, organization or institution. Traitor comes with a configuration file that allows you to customize what it should do and how it should do it. The configuration file can be found in the traitor folder. The file is called ""traitor.conf"" and is a regular text file. The configuration file is separated into sections. Each section has a header with the name of the section. There are four different sections. The first section defines what traitor should do when it is finished. The second section defines which vulnerabilities should be used. The third section defines which misconfigurations should be used. The fourth section is a debugging section and will be explained in a later part. The following configuration files will show you how to run traitor to exploit all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It will clean the file system, registry and memory. You can also use it to gain remote shell access via SSH. The following configuration file will give you a good overview of how to modify traitor to use specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It will also clean the file system, registry and memory.

"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that targets tech companies. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for the content their users post on their platforms. Now, the administration is looking to curb the immunity, as the order calls for the government to work with tech companies to develop a set of ""best practices"" to ensure that Section 230 is enforced in a manner that protects users and promotes competition. The order says that the U.S. government will ""ensure that the voices of all Americans can be heard."" The order does not provide specifics on how the U.S. government will enforce the law, or how it will work with tech companies to develop these best practices, but the White House said that it will be working with the Department of Justice to craft these recommendations. The CDA protects internet companies from liability for content that their users post. However, the executive order claims that the CDA allows large tech companies to censor certain political viewpoints without legal consequence. Tech companies have argued that the CDA is critical for maintaining a free and open internet. Without it, social media companies would not be able to host user-generated content, and could be subject to more lawsuits. In recent years, social media platforms have come under scrutiny for allowing misinformation to flourish on their platforms. After the 2016 presidential election, it was revealed that Russian operatives had used the platform to spread disinformation.

"As COVID-19 grabs the attention of the world, the war against antibiotic-resistant bacteria wages on. The number of people dying from bacterial infections could grow from 700,000 annually last year to 10 million by 2050, according to the United Nations. Meanwhile, the pipeline of new antibiotics has been virtually dry, and the ones on the market are no longer effective. There is a glimmer of hope in the fight against bacteria, though. Scientists in Singapore have discovered a new class of antibiotics that could help people infected with superbugs and drug-resistant bacteria. The new drug is not yet on the market, but it is promising. The researchers discovered it by accident, as they were doing experiments on a compound to treat malaria. The compound killed several types of bacteria, including tuberculosis and various strains of drug-resistant bacteria. The drug is called lugdunin, and it is unlike any other antibiotics in the world. It is produced by a strain of Staphylococcus lugdunensis, which is a harmless bacteria found on the skin. Researchers at the National University of Singapore were working with lugdunin as a potential treatment for malaria when they discovered its effectiveness in killing bacteria. They were testing the drug on drug-resistant bacteria. This compound killed not just the superbugs but also other bacteria, including tuberculosis. The drug is still in its early stages, and the scientists are still testing it on animals. The researchers are hopeful that lugdunin will work on humans, too. They said that the drug could be used to treat a variety of infections, including drug-resistant bacteria. Drug-resistant bacteria have been a problem for decades. In the 1950s, bacteria that was once easily killed with penicillin began to evolve and become resistant to the drug. Since then, bacteria has evolved even more. Drug-resistant bacteria is not just a problem in Singapore. In the United States, it is estimated that more than 2 million people are infected with drug-resistant bacteria every year. Of those, 23,000 die. The rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria is largely the result of over-prescribing antibiotics. In addition, many of the antibiotics on the market today are prescribed to treat viruses, such as the common cold. But antibiotics do not kill viruses; they are effective only on bacteria. Another problem with antibiotics is that people do not always take them correctly. Some people do not take the full course of the medication, and others stop taking the drugs when they start to feel better. Both of these actions can cause bacteria to become resistant to the drugs. Although bacteria has evolved to become resistant to some antibiotics, researchers are working to develop new drugs to combat the problem. They are also searching for new ways to use older drugs. A 2017 study found that using a combination of antibiotics could be more effective in fighting off infections. The study was done on a common bacteria that causes pneumonia, but the researchers said it could work on other types of bacteria. A 2019 study found that using antibiotics with probiotics could be more effective in treating infections. The researchers found that the combination of drugs and probiotics made it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance to the antibiotics. A 2018 study found that using antibiotics and red wine together could be effective in treating infections. Researchers found that combining the two could make the antibiotics more effective. There are no new antibiotics available today to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The only way to combat the problem is to take the medications correctly and not overuse them. Although researchers in Singapore have discovered a new antibiotic that could help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it is not yet on the market. However, scientists around the world are working to develop new drugs to combat the problem.",0,477

"There is a gene that codes for a protein called cytochrome P450, which exists in many mammals' livers, helping them clean up toxins. Scientists spliced this gene from a rabbit's DNA into the DNA of a potato, and created the GM ""New Leaf"" potato, which has the ability to produce this protein. This protein cleans up the insecticide, Bt, which exists in nature, and is harmless to humans, but is toxic to insects. Since Bt is naturally occurring, it is allowed in organic farming. The GM potato produces its own Bt, which kills the insects that try to eat it. The New Leaf Potato is a type of pesticide producing potato, which produces Bt toxin, a natural occurring insecticide that is allowed in organic farming. This is not what is meant by the term ""frankenfood."" GM potatoes are not a part of the ""frankenfood"" controversy, since they aren't genetically engineered to do something that is not found in nature, and they do not affect the DNA of humans.

"iRobot has announced today it's first autonomous lawnmower robot. Unlike other autonomous lawnmower robots which require a wire to be laid down to define the robot's boundaries, iRobot's lawnmower robot will be fully wireless, using a perimeter wire instead. iRobot's lawnmower robot is expected to be released in 2019, with more details about it to be released in 2018. The iRobot Terra robot mower is designed to maintain lawns up to a quarter acre. It can maneuver across a lawn cutting grass in straight lines, in intricate patterns or along the edges of a flowerbed or driveway. Because of the Terra's wireless operation, there is no need for buried wires or other underground sensors that can be costly, cumbersome or unreliable. As a result, Terra is safe, easy to use, and navigates the lawn with precision. ""iRobot is building an ecosystem of robots and technologies that help you do more both inside and outside of the home,"" said Colin Angle, chairman and CEO of iRobot. iRobot will announce the pricing and availability of the Terra in 2018.",0,482

"InfluxDB has everything you need to build time series applications - a multi-tenanted time series database, UI and dashboarding tools, background processing, and monitoring agent. All this makes deployment and management of time series infrastructure as easy as it gets. InfluxDB is a time series database. In the last 10 years, time series has become one of the dominant database requirements. The demand for time series databases is driven by the rise in applications that require metrics, analytics and insights from machine data (such as log data, sensor data, and metrics data). Examples of time series data are temperature readings, website hits, and sensor data. InfluxDB is an open source time series database developed by InfluxData. It is optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics. What is a time series database? A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time series data, which is a series of data points indexed (most often) by time, and often with additional metadata tags such as location or source. The ability to store and efficiently retrieve millions of time series with a diverse range of data points (from temperature to system statistics) has made time series databases an essential tool for gathering insights from data. Examples of time series data are temperature readings, website hits, and sensor data. InfluxDB is an open-source time series database. It is optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics.

"SpaceX stacked a Starship prototype rocket on top of a Super Heavy rocket booster for the first time on Friday morning at the company's facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Starship and Super Heavy are the two pieces that together will make up SpaceX's Starship system, which is envisioned to be the most powerful rocket ever built. The big picture: In 2017, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk outlined his ambitions to send humans to Mars using Starship and Super Heavy. Since then, SpaceX has been testing and iterating on the design of the two rockets, which it hopes to one day use for missions to the moon and Mars. Yes, but: The version of Starship stacked on top of Super Heavy is not intended to fly. The company is in the process of building a full-scale version of the rocket, called Starship Mk1, which it plans to use to send cargo to orbit as early as next year. What to watch: SpaceX will likely begin tethered hop tests of Starship Mk1 in the coming months, though the company has not publicly released a timeline for the test.

"Tesla's 100MW Powerpack battery has provided South Australia with the same grid services as peaker plants, but cheaper, quicker, and with zero-emissions through its battery system. The energy system cost the state only 36 cents per citizen, yet it has made over 800,000 in profits in the first 6 months. The Powerpack system in South Australia has saved consumers over 30 million in one year, with the ability to charge and discharge rapidly, a capability that many other grid services companies are unable to provide. Tesla's battery has been able to help the grid during a time when gas generators have failed. The Powerpack system was able to help the state meet peak demand in less than 100 milliseconds after the failure of the coal-fired Loy Yang Power Plant. Tesla has released a statement regarding the success of their Powerpack system in South Australia. ""With 100 megawatts of storage capacity, Hornsdale Power Reserve is the largest lithium-ion battery in the world and will play a major role in South Australia's continued transition to renewable energy. The battery will provide essential grid stability and reliability services for the region while also lowering costs for consumers and reducing carbon emissions."" The Hornsdale Power Reserve is a 100MW129MWh Tesla Powerpack system that stores renewable energy and delivers it to the grid when it is needed, especially during peak hours when power is needed most. The Powerpack system has also been able to make 1 million in grid services in the first 6 months of operations, exceeding the expectations of the operators. ""We're pleased to see the Hornsdale Power Reserve performing as expected. We are seeing early signs of the potential for battery storage to provide similar benefits in other areas of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM),"" says Matt Zema, CEO of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). In the first 6 months, the Powerpack system has helped to stabilize and support South Australia's grid, as well as help lower energy prices for consumers. ""We are delighted that Hornsdale Power Reserve is performing well and playing an important role in maintaining the reliability and security of South Australia's electricity supply,"" says Tesla. South Australia has been hit hard by power outages, most notably in the summer of 2016 when the entire state was left in darkness due to a storm that brought down the grid. The Powerpack system was able to help South Australia through the summer of 2017 and 2018. The Hornsdale Power Reserve is able to provide grid services to the state during the day and night, which is a great benefit as the state relies heavily on renewable energy sources. Tesla's Powerpack system is able to help South Australia reach their goal of 100 renewable energy by 2025.",0,488
"GAF Energy's Timberline Solar shingles can be installed by any roofer with a nail gun. They are weatherproof and can be walked on for roof maintenance. Other solar shingles require a subcontractor, are more fragile, and must be installed only by specialists. In 1983, the worldwide solar-cell market was small, and its growth prospects were dim. Just 40 megawatts of photovoltaic (PV) cells were installed that year. But in 1995, worldwide installations surpassed 200 megawatts. Then in 1999, they leapt to 400 megawatts. This year, they will be around 800 megawatts. In 2005, they are expected to surpass 1 gigawatt. According to a report published in 1999 by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the worldwide market for PV systems will grow at a compound annual rate of 28 percent, from 1.4 billion in 1998 to 6.7 billion in 2005. The report projects that by 2005, 57 percent of all PV cells will be used in grid-connected applications. And most of that growth will be in the United States, Europe, and Japan. In 1983, less than 1 percent of the PV cell market was in grid-connected applications. By 1998, 10 percent of the market was grid-connected, and by 2005, 40 percent of the market will be grid-connected, according to the report. In 1983, 90 percent of the PV cell market was in off-grid, stand-alone applications. In 1998, 40 percent of the market was off-grid. And by 2005, the off-grid market is projected to be 10 percent of the total. The PV market is still dominated by the off-grid market, but the biggest growth is in the grid-connected market. With an installed cost of 4.50 to 6.50 per watt, grid-connected PV cells are still more expensive than conventional energy sources. But costs have been falling at an average of 4 to 6 percent per year since 1990. PV cell manufacturers have three main options for reducing costs. They can improve production efficiency, increase production volume, or develop lower-cost PV materials. In the 1980s, most PV cell manufacturers tried to achieve economies of scale by building large factories. But few succeeded. Instead, manufacturers are now trying to improve production efficiency. One of the most successful ways to reduce PV cell costs is to improve manufacturing processes, according to Michael McGehee, professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University. ""The use of hydrogen to reduce the amount of silver used in making PV cells is a good example of how improvements in manufacturing technology can reduce costs,"" he said. The leading PV cell manufacturers in the world are Siemens Solar Industries (formerly known as ARCO Solar), Sharp, Kyocera, Mitsubishi Electric, and the U.S. subsidiary of Sanyo. In 1998, these five companies accounted for 60 percent of worldwide PV cell production. All of the leading PV cell manufacturers are heavily vertically integrated. They manufacture their own wafers, which are the basic building blocks of PV cells. They have to do so in order to control costs and ensure a reliable supply of silicon wafers. ""The cost of a PV cell is mostly the cost of the wafer,"" said McGehee. ""There is a huge bottleneck in manufacturing the wafer."" One way to reduce costs is to develop new wafer technologies. Soitec, a French company, manufactures its own wafers. It uses a proprietary, epitaxial process for producing silicon wafers, which results in lower-cost, thinner wafers. The company has its own pilot fabrication facility, which is capable of producing 250 kilowatts of PV cells per year. Epitaxial techniques are used in a variety of semiconductor fabrication processes. In an epitaxial process, atoms are deposited on a wafer surface in a way that imitates the structure of a crystal",0,489
"Every machine learning model is based on linear algebra. This document contains introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning. The notes are meant to be used as a quick reference for the most frequently used linear algebra concepts. Note that this document is not meant to be comprehensive, and is just a brief overview of the relevant topics. Given a vector x, the operation xT (x transpose) produces a column vector with the elements of the vector x in reverse order. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is a scalar quantity that is equal to the sum of the product of the corresponding elements of x and y. Given two vectors x and y, the vector cross product x y is a vector perpendicular to both x and y with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors x and y. A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers, called scalars in this context. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. A vector space is called finite dimensional if the set of vectors has a finite number of elements. The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space, i.e., the number of coordinates required to specify any vector. Vectors can be added together. For every vector u and scalar c, the vector cu is also in the vector space. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u v) cu cv. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u - v) cu - cv. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u v w) cu cv cw. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, c (u - v - w) cu - cv - cw. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) u cu du. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) v cv dv. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) w cw dw. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) u v w cu v w dv w. For every vector u, v, and w, and scalar c, (c d) u - v - w cu - v - w dv - v - w. A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers, called scalars in this context. A vector space is called finite-dimensional if the set of vectors has a finite number of elements. An inner product is a type of product in vector algebra. The inner product of two vectors in a vector space is a real number (usually) obtained by multiplying the two vectors component-wise, and adding the products. If the vectors are x (x1, x2, ..., xn) and y (y1, y2, ..., yn), then their inner product is x1y1 x2y2 ... xnyn. A vector space together with an inner product is called an inner product space. An inner product space is a vector space equipped with an additional structure called an inner product. The standard inner product on n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the dot product. The dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of two n-dimensional real vectors. The length of a vector is the distance from the origin to the tip of the vector. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is the length of the projection of y onto x. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is equal to the product of the magnitudes of x and y and the cosine of the angle between them. Given two vectors x and y, the dot product x y is equal to the length of y times the length of x times the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of the angle between two vectors x and y is equal to the dot product of x and y divided by the length of x times the length of y. The cosine of the angle between two vectors x and y is equal to the dot product of x and y divided by the length of the",0,490
"Spotify Technology might be looking at acquiring Ringer, a sports and pop-culture startup. Ringer is involved in the podcast business, like the other four startups that Spotify bought in 2019.

"Luminary is a platform for podcasts that will be launching in June. The new podcast app will focus on subscriptions and will be ad-free. Many big names have already signed up with Luminary, including Trevor Noah, Lena Dunham, and Malcolm Gladwell. However, the big problem with Luminary is that it is charging for content that is free on other platforms. Users will have to pay 7.99 a month to access the Luminary app, and it seems that the podcasts that will be on Luminary will not be available on other platforms like Spotify and Apple. If you are already a subscriber to podcasts on other platforms, then you might want to skip Luminary. After all, Luminary podcasts will not be available for free. The question is whether Luminary will be successful or not. It seems that the business model is a bit flawed. Spotify and Apple already dominate the podcast market, and there is no reason for users to switch to Luminary. Luminary has said that there will be some exclusive podcasts that will be available on its platform, but it is doubtful that there will be enough exclusive content to make users switch to the new platform. Some people have also criticized Luminary for its anti-competitive business model. The fact that Luminary will be charging for content that is free on other platforms means that some podcast creators could lose a lot of listeners.

"A study on birth rates between 1950 to 2017 (across all countries) showed a crazy decline in birth rates from 4.7 children per woman in 1950 to 2.4 children per woman in 2017 (we can expect it to be even lower now). In fact, the only country on this list is South Sudan at 4.7 children per woman. South Sudan is the only country that is still at the same birth rate level as the world was in 1950! World Population is still growing, but very slowly, and population is still expected to grow a little more, until around 2050, at which point the world population will begin to decline! We will see birth rates continue to decline from now until the mid 2020's, at which point the declining birth rate should stabilize. The reason for this is that the countries with the lowest birth rates (Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Macao) are already at birth rates so low, they cannot go any lower. In other countries like the United States, Canada, and China, birth rates are at replacement level and will not go much lower, for these countries. The biggest challenge for these countries is the aging population. While the birth rate is still increasing in countries like Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, that growth will stabilize by the mid 2020's (once those countries reach the same level as China in 2017).

"Disney CEO Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board on September 10, the same day that Apple unveiled the launch date and subscription price for the Apple TV Plus. The introduction of a new streaming service from the iPhone manufacturer could be a conflict of interest for Iger, as Disney launches Disney Plus on November 12. Iger sat on the Apple board for almost eight years, but his relationship with Apple CEO Tim Cook goes back to 2006, when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs convinced Disney to buy Pixar. Iger was the only Disney executive who was notified of Jobs's serious illness and then his death in 2011. In a statement, Apple said Iger resigned to avoid ""potential conflicts of interest."" ""Bob Iger has been an excellent board member over the past eight years,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. ""More than anyone, Bob understands the value of creative ideas and knows how to put these ideas to work."" Iger is no stranger to the streaming world and it will be a difficult market. Apart from Disney Plus, the company also owns a 60 stake in Hulu. Disney has invested heavily in the streaming business and is making a bet that consumers will be willing to pay monthly for more than one streaming service. The company's goal is to attract millions of subscribers to its own services and take advantage of its extensive catalog of content. The Apple TV Plus will cost 4.99 a month and will launch on November 1.",0,499
"Motor Neuron Disease eventually takes away its victim's ability to speak, but a new AI-based tool developed by Rolls-Royce may help patients speak again. Rolls Royce worked with the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the National Health Service to develop the technology. It uses AI and machine learning to analyze a patient's speech patterns and habits, then translate those patterns into written and spoken words. The tool will be made available to patients through the NHS and MND Association. It will be available to anyone with a diagnosis of MND. People with the disease will be able to create their own speech profile and then use it to help them communicate. Dr. Susie Henley, Head of Healthcare Innovation at the MND Association, said, ""This breakthrough has the potential to transform the lives of people living with the disease who cannot move their arms or hands. It could mean they are able to communicate with their loved ones for the first time in many years.""",0,500
"Facebook is expected to unveil the Oculus Quest 2 at the Facebook Connect conference later this week. Videos posted briefly on Facebook's Blueprint e-learning platform exposed details about the device. The leaked video showed the Oculus Quest 2 and confirmed the presence of cameras on the headset. It also showed a new touchpad design with two touch buttons. The Oculus Quest is a standalone virtual reality headset, which means it does not require a PC to operate. It has cameras on the front and sides of the headset that allow you to see your hands, but the touchpad has only one button. The Oculus Quest 2 looks like it will bring a similar design to the Oculus Quest, with two cameras on the front and side of the headset. The Oculus Quest 2 will reportedly include the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, which is expected to provide significant performance improvements over the Snapdragon 835 used in the current Oculus Quest. Oculus also uses eye tracking to improve VR performance. Another leaked video on YouTube showed a controller for the Oculus Quest 2 with a new design that has two buttons for the index and middle fingers. The video also mentioned the controller's capacitive fingerprint sensor, which may be used for authentication. Facebook Connect will take place from October 23 to 25, with Mark Zuckerberg's keynote speech on October 23rd. Facebook is expected to release the Oculus Quest 2 at the event, which may also include news about Oculus Link.

"Google will start loading Search and Maps with information on vaccination sites. The update will roll out in the coming weeks to Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, with more areas getting the same treatment in the near future. The feature will be available on desktop and mobile, and Google will determine when and where to surface this information based on searches. It's the latest in a series of efforts by Google to make sure that accurate information about vaccines is available on its services. This feature is particularly interesting because it's a way for Google to make information on vaccination sites more widely available in places where it might be difficult to find. If you have a smartphone, then you've got a portal to Google search and Maps, which means you're only a few taps away from finding a place where you can get vaccinated. In areas where vaccination rates are low, Google has the potential to make vaccine information more accessible and hopefully get more people immunized. Google is committed to providing useful, relevant information to people at the exact moment they need it, whether it's for vaccination location information or any other topic. We work to provide authoritative information from the web and other trusted sources, like the US Health Human Services department and HealthMap.org. Google has been the subject of scrutiny recently thanks to its power over how people access information online, but it's also using its position to surface information that's helpful. In a world where misinformation spreads quickly and freely, Google has been trying to do what it can to counteract that by making sure that factually accurate information is available on its services. Aside from this new search feature, Google has also been using its algorithms to flag misinformation about vaccines in search. It's also exploring ways to rank authoritative content higher in search, which can make it easier to find the most trustworthy information on a topic. If you're searching for information about vaccines, Google wants you to find the most reliable stuff first.",0,502
"Python 3.9 was released on October 5 and as with every new version of Python, it includes new, improved, and deprecated features. A link to the complete list of changes can be found at the end of this article. Below are some of the highlights of the release and the Python 3.9 data science and machine learning features you can start using in your projects. In Python 3.8, the new text-based format for serializing Python objects was introduced. For the new version, they added a new option that allows you to store the objects as JSON instead. The json.dump and json.load methods are used to serialize and deserialize objects. There are a number of packages that can be used with the serialization of objects, such as pickle, msgpack, and protocol buffers. The new JSON serialization is a faster alternative to the existing ones. Type hints are a new feature in Python 3.5 and make it possible to annotate types for variables and function parameters. Python 3.9 introduces a new type hint: Literal. It is used for constants that have a fixed value, like 3.0, 100, or 'Hello world'. When a type hint is used, the interpreter can perform more accurate static analysis. In case of the new literal type hint, you can use it to define the type of a variable that has a fixed value. It's also useful when creating a type checker with the mypy package. Python 3.9 introduces new collection protocols to create immutable and ordered sets. The new ordered set protocol is called FrozenSet. It has an associated type named FrozenSet, which can be used to make a set immutable. It's similar to using a tuple instead of a list. The immutable set protocol has an associated type named MutableSet. It can be used to create sets that are immutable. Python 3.9 adds a new module, typing, that includes helper functions that can be used to create type hints. For example, the literaleval function converts a string into a Python literal. It can be used to convert a string like 1,2,3,4 into the list [1,2,3,4]. Another function in the module is the cast function. It casts a value to a specified type. It can be used to convert a string into a number. For example, cast (3, int) returns the integer 3. Python 3.9 adds a new function to the math module: math.isreal . It determines if a number is real. The number 3.0 is real, but a complex number such as 3.0j isn't. You can also use math.isinteger and math.isimaginary to determine if a number is integer or imaginary. The numpy module was introduced in Python 3.5. It is a library for working with large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It includes two new functions in Python 3.9: numpy.kron and numpy.kronsum . The kron function multiplies two arrays or matrices. The kronsum function multiplies an array or matrix by a scalar value. A new function was added to the itertools module: itertools.accumulate . It accumulates a generator or iterable into a single value. The function uses the reduce function as an underlying mechanism. The first argument is the function that is used to perform the accumulation. The second argument is the initial value. The third argument is the iterable. The example below shows how to use the function to find the sum of the first ten numbers. The ziplongest function in the itertools module allows you to zip multiple iterables into one, but it doesn't require them to have the same length. If one of the iterables is shorter than the others, the missing values are filled with the fillvalue argument. The next function in the itertools module returns the next value in an iterable. The example below shows how to use the function to get the next value from an iterable. The random module is a standard module that includes functions for generating random numbers. It includes a number of new functions in Python 3.9. The random.choices function returns a random sample from an iterable. The number of elements returned can be specified. The random.sample function returns a random sample from an iterable without replacement. The random.shuffle function shuffles an iterable. There are two functions that shuffle the elements in a list in place: random.shuffle and random.sample . The example below shows how to use the functions to shuffle a list of strings.",0,503
"Amazon will be adding a Venmo option to checkout for users in the US starting next year. The retail giant recently announced its third-quarter results, a 13 year-over-year revenue increase. Much of the earnings came from the company's Amazon Prime service which is currently estimated at 100 million subscribers worldwide. Venmo, which was acquired by PayPal in 2013, has become a popular peer-to-peer payment platform in the US. In the last year, the mobile application's user base has grown 78 year-over-year with 12 billion in volume. This is up 80 from the year before. As a popular payment option for millennials, adding Venmo to the Amazon checkout could give the eCommerce giant a significant boost in younger shoppers. Amazon has been working with PayPal for the last two years in order to add the Venmo payment option to its website. In addition to its Amazon Prime service, the company has also been seeing a major increase in its Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cloud platform has grown 46 year-over-year for the quarter. Amazon also saw a 29 increase in its North American sales.",0,504
"Boston Dynamics has released a new video showing its entire lineup of robots doing a coordinated dance routine. The company was recently purchased by Hyundai from SoftBank for 1.1 billion. Boston Dynamics was formerly owned by Google, but was sold off to Softbank in 2016. The company was then purchased by the South Korean auto giant for 1.1 billion. The company is best known for its work in developing animal-like robots, including the Atlas and SpotMini. Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 by Marc Raibert and is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. The company has not yet released a commercial robot for consumers, but its robots are used by the military and other public organizations for various tasks. Boston Dynamics is best known for the Atlas and SpotMini robots, which resemble dogs and horses. The company is also working on a robotic antelope, which is capable of jumping over large obstacles. In the video, Boston Dynamics shows its lineup of robots doing a coordinated dance routine, with the Atlas robot even doing a backflip. The Atlas robot has been shown before performing tasks like walking over rubble and opening doors, but it has never been shown doing a backflip. Boston Dynamics also shows the SpotMini, a smaller robot, doing a dance routine. The SpotMini is still being developed and the company has not yet released a price or release date. In the video, the SpotMini is shown doing a dance routine in front of a Christmas tree. The SpotMini robot is a smaller version of the Atlas. In the video, the company shows the SpotMini running around the office. Boston Dynamics has released several videos showing its robots doing various tasks. The company's videos are very popular on social media, with several of them being viewed more than 10 million times. The company has not yet released a robot for consumers, but its robots are used by public organizations, including the military. Boston Dynamics has also shown its robotic dog opening doors and climbing stairs. The company has not yet released a price or release date for the SpotMini. According to Boston Dynamics, the SpotMini will be available for a range of applications soon. The company is currently developing the SpotMini for the commercial space.",0,505
"This is an article written by Jeff Atwood, former CEO of Stack Overflow. He says that Stack Overflow isn't a discussion forum, it's meant to be more like a wiki. Wikipedia is the best example of a wiki. Wikipedia is all about providing reliable information that you can find, not about providing a place for people to discuss the information. Discussion is discouraged on Wikipedia. Jeff doesn't like people using Stack Overflow to debate each other. He thinks that the focus of the site should be on providing answers, not discussion. There's a separate site, Stack Exchange, for discussion. Jeff says, ""If you are more interested in debating programming trivia than finding quality answers to your programming questions, you are in the wrong place."" I think Jeff is right. The problem with the wiki model is that it's only good if everyone is trying to work together. If someone is trying to make the site worse or spread misinformation, then the wiki model falls apart. If you edit an article on Wikipedia to spread misinformation, other editors will revert your changes. If you keep doing it, you'll eventually be banned. On Stack Overflow, there is no mechanism for enforcing good edits. If you post an answer that is wrong, people will downvote it. If you post a good answer, people will upvote it.

"Fuchsia is Google's latest operating system for the Google Home Hub. The OS is only available for the first-generation Home Hub devices. Fuchsia was launched quietly. It wasn't even mentioned on the Google Home Hub device page, but it was mentioned in a Reddit post. Fuchsia runs on a customized Android OS, which is an open-source platform developed by Google. It's not clear why Fuchsia is a new OS, but it may have to do with the fact that Google hasn't updated Android in years. Android is still an open-source platform, but it's only compatible with a few devices. In addition to running Android, Fuchsia also runs a version of the Google Chrome browser. Unlike Android, Fuchsia also runs Chrome OS. Chrome OS is a lightweight, low-cost version of Chrome. It comes with a fully functional web browser and a built-in file browser. Chrome OS also has some basic utilities and productivity tools. These include a calendar, a clock, and a calculator. Chrome OS is the operating system used by the Google Home Hub. It's also used by the Google Pixelbook laptop. It's available for all Android devices and supports a wide variety of hardware. Fuchsia is the only operating system that runs on a Chromebook. It's not available on Android or Chrome OS. It's also available for Chromebooks that run on ARM processors. It's unclear whether Fuchsia is based on Chrome OS or not. Google hasn't yet confirmed the source of the OS. However, the developer documentation indicates that it is based on Android, and it's not based on Chrome OS. The Google Home Hub is the first device to support Fuchsia. It's also the only device that has the OS. Fuchsia is currently only available on the first-generation Home Hub devices. The Home Hub isn't yet available on the Google Store, but it can be purchased from other retailers. The Home Hub is the first device to support Fuchsia.

"This is a video of Mark Zuckerberg announcing Oculus Quest, a wireless All in One VR headset with touch controllers shipping next spring for 399. There will be 50 games available at launch. The first model of the Oculus Quest will ship with 64GB of onboard storage, but it is unclear if there will be a 128GB option. Oculus also announced that Oculus Go would be getting a price drop to 199. The headset is supposedly using the same technology as the Santa Cruz prototype we saw last year. It will feature 6 degrees of freedom and inside out tracking. This means that all the sensors needed for motion tracking will be in the headset. There is a possibility that Oculus Quest will be a rebranded Oculus Go with inside out tracking, but that is just speculation at this point. We will have to wait until next spring to see what Oculus Quest really is. Oculus Quest is designed to bring a wireless VR experience to anyone, anywhere, with the same quality you've come to expect from Oculus. The headset features Oculus Insight technology built-in, so you don't need to set up any external sensors for 6 degrees of freedom tracking. Oculus Insight delivers a hybrid inside-out tracking system, meaning you can use Oculus Quest anywhere in your home - in a bedroom, living room, kitchen, or anywhere in between. Oculus Quest uses the same displays as Oculus Go, with a resolution of per eye and a refresh rate of 72Hz. Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift are completely separate products, both in hardware and software. Quest is not compatible with Rift software. Oculus Quest is designed with a different use case in mind than Oculus Rift, and we believe they'll offer different but equally compelling experiences. Both headsets have the same tracking technology and are built to deliver a great experience. However, the Rift will ship with a higher quality display and audio system, plus support for 5 sensors for expanded room scale tracking. The Rift's higher resolution display and additional room scale sensors will enable many new experiences that won't be possible on the Quest. We'll be launching more than 50 titles with Oculus Quest at launch, including Robo Recall, The Climb, and Moss. We're also excited to be working with some incredible developers on new titles coming exclusively to Quest, including Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series - Episode I, a first-person narrative experience set in the Star Wars universe, Asgard's Wrath, a Norse-inspired action RPG that lets you wield the power of the Gods, and Stormland, a VR action adventure game that lets you explore an alien world. If you're a developer, you can learn more about the Oculus Quest here. We're excited to share more details about Oculus Quest and our full lineup of new VR experiences at Oculus Connect 5 this fall. Oculus Quest will launch in Spring 2019 starting at 399 USD.",0,509
"The Apple Store went down for just over an hour on Tuesday and came back with a brand-new look. The new design is filled with cards, similar to Apple's Store app for iOS, and is more about helping you buy a product, rather than just shopping for one. The site now features a card-based design similar to Apple's iOS and tvOS apps, including Apple Pay support for purchasing items directly from the site, along with the addition of a new account preference allowing for site-wide dark mode to match the dark mode option in macOS Mojave. The redesign includes a ""Shop Now"" button on the top right, which takes you to the site's full catalog. In the left-hand navigation bar, the old ""iPhone"" option has been replaced with ""Apple,"" which will take you to all of the company's devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod, and more. The left-hand navigation bar also includes categories for Services, Apple Store, Support, and Apple Newsroom, while the right-hand side has options to log in to your account, check your order status, chat with a Specialist, set up an appointment at an Apple Store, or find your local Apple Store. On the homepage, Apple highlights its latest and greatest products with larger images and fewer words, a major change from the previous design that featured many products with smaller images and a lot of text. The website is also full of touches from Apple's ""beyond the page"" design language, including curved page corners, drop shadows, and more. In the navigation bar for individual product pages, there's now a ""More Details"" option that can be toggled to show more specs about the product, and Apple has added a new ""Compare"" feature to make it easier to see the differences between products. The new Compare feature is also available on iOS in the Apple Store app. The site's checkout process now supports Apple Pay, allowing you to complete a purchase with Touch ID on the iPhone or Mac, or Face ID on the iPhone X. Apple Pay can be used in the browser to complete purchases on the new Apple Store, even when using an iPad or Mac without Touch ID. The redesigned Apple Store website was first noticed by users in early October. Apple is in the process of revamping its online store experience to better highlight products. These new store pages are built on a completely new platform that Apple is calling ""WebKit2,"" which will be replacing the company's old e-commerce platform, ""Yosemite."" For Apple, this means that the online store will be updated more frequently with new content, and new products will be easier to launch. Apple's website is designed in a way that allows the company to launch new products, pages, and even site designs, without having to go through the App Store review process like third-party developers. Update 1023: Apple has also introduced a new ""Dark Mode"" option in the footer of its website. When enabled, the Apple Store's website design and content will have a dark tint to it, matching the new ""Dark Mode"" option in macOS Mojave. The new option is available to Apple's website users in macOS Mojave. I hope they bring back the product configurator for iPhones. It's a real shame they took that away. I feel like this website is getting more and more dumbed down for the masses. They've had the product configurator for iPhones in the iOS app for a while now. I think they should put a toggle in the mobile site for light and dark mode. I'm confused, I thought this was a MacRumors article and not an Apple press release? They have no need for that, iPhones can be configured on the store app. I really hate the product pages. They just show a few images with a lot of blank space. And they don't even have the basic details like a full list of included accessories.",0,510
"The results of a Phase 1 trial to study the effects of microdosing LSD have been published. Researchers were testing whether microdosing psychedelics could be useful as a therapeutic approach for depression and anxiety. The study, conducted by UC Berkeley and UCSF researchers, was co-authored by James Fadiman, PhD, a psychedelics expert who had been leading a citizen science study on the effects of microdosing psychedelics. The study, published in the journal Neural Regeneration Research, involved 12 participants between the ages of 28 and 65. The study did not include a placebo control group, and it was not double-blinded, which is a limitation to the study. However, because the study was not a double-blind study, the researchers were able to follow up with participants after the study and learn more about their experiences. During the study, participants were asked to microdose LSD for a few weeks. A microdose of LSD is considered to be 10 to 20 micrograms, about 10 to 20 times less than a full dose of LSD. Microdosing psychedelics is thought to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. The goal of the study was to determine whether microdosing LSD could improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other conditions. The study also looked at whether there were any adverse effects associated with microdosing. Researchers determined that there were no adverse effects associated with microdosing. They also found that LSD microdosing was associated with improvements in depression, anxiety, and an increased sense of well-being and mood. The study showed that microdosing LSD was associated with long-lasting improvements in mood and well-being. Researchers found that participants experienced ""increased well-being, enhanced openness, and improved relationships."" They also reported a decrease in anxiety, depression, and stress. The findings were ""consistent with previous reports of the beneficial effects of psychedelic psychotherapy,"" the researchers wrote. However, they emphasized that the study is limited by its small sample size and lack of controls. ""More research is needed to validate these preliminary findings and to investigate the psychological and neurological mechanisms of action of LSD-assisted psychotherapy,"" they wrote. ""As a follow up, we hope to conduct a larger study with more participants, a placebo control group, and a double-blind design,"" Dr. Fadiman told Psychedelic Times. To read the full article, you can visit Neural Regeneration Research. Note: The original version of this article did not state that Dr. Fadiman was one of the co-authors of the study.

"Companies such as Facebook and Google may soon be forced to inform customers individually on how much profit they gain from customer data. The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act would require companies to file regular statements disclosing the value of the data they collect, and in the case of Facebook, would reportedly amount to an average of around 150 for each user, according to the bill's sponsor Senator Mark Warner. The disclosures would be similar to those used to inform shareholders on earnings, the Wall Street Journal reports, and would also include the number of users, revenue made from processing the data, and the contracts made to share the data with third parties. During an interview with Axios, Warner said the legislation could take a year to be approved, with the senator adding it could change before then. He also noted that the proposed law isn't intended to be punitive, but instead would serve to inform the public of what their data is worth to the company. ""The goal of this legislation is to bring transparency to a marketplace that has become increasingly opaque,"" Warner said. ""I hope that this legislation creates a real conversation about the value of our privacy, and leads to increased consumer control over their own data."" In a statement, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said ""We look forward to engaging with policymakers on these issues, as the health of the internet depends on people feeling confident about their privacy and how their information is used."" Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rohit Chopra has argued that the ""real price"" of a social media service is the data users give up to use the service, and as such the DASHBOARD Act could be a useful tool for measuring the social cost of data collection. Warner's DASHBOARD Act is the latest attempt at data privacy laws by members of the Senate, following one proposed in February by Senators Marco Rubio and Dianne Feinstein that would ""enhance the rights of individuals to control their data."" The Bill, called the Data Care Act, would ""create a duty for companies that collect sensitive personal data to exercise reasonable care and implement reasonable security practices"" and would require firms to inform users if their data is being collected, with options to opt out. Data privacy is a hot topic right now, and the calls for stronger regulation have become more vocal in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social network has been heavily scrutinized for its data privacy policies, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg undergoing two days of questions in front of Congress in April, and in May, the company co-founder Chris Hughes called for the company to be broken up. A few weeks ago, it was discovered that the personal information of 4 million Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a figure that is more than ten times larger than what was initially reported. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica Problem: How It Could Have Been Prevented The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on Friday, and it could affect businesses outside of the E.U. as well. The regulation is designed to give users more control over their data and how it is used, and could make some firms change the way they handle personal data to be compliant. One business that could change as a result is Apple, with the company's Health Records feature that's currently being tested in the United States potentially being blocked from the E.U. market due to the regulation. In the United States, hospitals decide which patients are included in the Health Records system, but in the E.U., that decision must be made by the individual, something that Apple has yet to address. This would be a terrible law. We want the value of personal data to be as low as possible so that companies can't exploit it. And it's the wrong approach anyway. It's not Facebook's job to keep users' personal data private. It's Facebook's job to provide a service that's compelling enough that users voluntarily give it access to their data. I'm not sure this is a good idea. I want to have control of my data, and I want to have the freedom to give it away if I want to, but I don't necessarily want to know the exact dollar amount that Facebook is making from me. I don't want a price on my head. I have always liked the idea of giving consumers a discount if they agree to be tracked, but the idea of a",0,513

"A group of startups is using end-to-end learning to teach self-driving cars how to drive. Despite investors sinking more than 100 billion into self-driving car technology, driverless tech is still in a phase of experimentation. Investors are beginning to doubt the value of self-driving car technology. The failure of Uber and Lyft's initial public offerings (IPOs) has created a sense of doubt about the future of the self-driving car market. I don't believe that self-driving cars are dead, but I do believe that the way in which they're being developed is flawed. That's why I've decided to highlight a handful of startups that are using a different approach. The main difference between the startups I've mentioned and the big players in the self-driving car market is that the startups I've mentioned are using a technique known as end-to-end learning. End-to-end learning is a process that helps a self-driving car learn how to drive by teaching it how to interpret data captured by a camera. The first step to end-to-end learning is to teach a self-driving car how to process the data captured by a camera. The next step is to teach a self-driving car how to interpret the data captured by a camera. This process allows a self-driving car to learn how to drive by recognizing the difference between objects such as a bicycle and a car, and learning how to respond to these objects. The main problem with the approach taken by most self-driving car companies is that they use techniques such as machine learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive. Most self-driving car companies use machine learning to make driving decisions, such as whether a self-driving car should change lanes or whether a self-driving car should stop. The problem with using machine learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive is that it's too impractical. There are too many different factors involved in driving that need to be taken into account for machine learning to be a viable option. The companies that I've mentioned are using end-to-end learning to teach a self-driving car how to drive. End-to-end learning is a much more practical approach that gives a self-driving car the ability to learn how to drive by recognizing the difference between objects such as a bicycle and a car.",0,517
"A team of Chinese researchers used a quantum computer to design a new type of qubit that significantly outperformed their previous designs. The new qubit design can hold its quantum state for more than 100 microseconds, compared to just 27 microseconds for the previous record-holding qubit, while also increasing the potential for scalability. The new qubit design is based on a different quantum bit structure than before. Rather than using a system of electron spins as the previous record holder did, the new qubit design uses a system of nuclear spins, which are more easily controlled and therefore more reliable, according to the researchers. The design of the new qubit was achieved using a quantum computer, specifically one that was programmed with a special software algorithm designed to optimize the design of quantum devices. ""We used the quantum computer to calculate the parameters of the pulse sequence and then applied those parameters to the experiment,"" said Jiangfeng Du, an associate research professor at the University of Science and Technology of China. The previous record for the length of time a qubit can maintain quantum coherence was held by the University of New South Wales, in Australia.

"Python autocomplete is a project that experiments with using an LSTM model to autocomplete python code. Test results show that it can save users between 30 to 50 percent of the time they usually spend on typing code. Python autocomplete is a project that experiments with using an LSTM model to autocomplete python code. It takes advantage of the open source python library, keras, to build an LSTM model that predicts the next word in a sentence. This project has one script, predictor.py, that runs the model and predicts the next word. It also has a tester script, tester.py, that generates random code and tests the LSTM model on it. Test results show that it can save users between 30 to 50 percent of the time they usually spend on typing code. Python Autocomplete uses a custom LSTM model, which is a recurrent neural network. It consists of one-dimensional input, two hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer has the dimensionality of a number of characters in a word. The hidden layers each have 128 neurons. The output layer has 600 neurons, corresponding to the total number of words in the vocabulary. The LSTM model takes in a sequence of words as an input and predicts the next word in that sequence. Python autocomplete converts each word in a sentence to a vector of real numbers. A word vector has the same number of dimensions as the input layer in the LSTM model. In the case of this model, the number of dimensions is 100. A word vector is a vector of real numbers between 0 and 1 that represents the word. Python autocomplete uses a pre-trained word vector called GloVe. The LSTM model then takes in the sequence of word vectors as inputs and predicts the next word vector in the sequence. The word vector is then converted back into a word. The project has two scripts, one to train and predict and another to test. The first, predictor.py, is run only once to train the model and then to predict the next word in a sentence. The second, tester.py, generates random sentences in python code and feeds it to the model. It then compares the predicted word to the correct word and calculates the accuracy and the time saved. The predictor.py script first builds the vocabulary of words that it can use. It takes a list of all the words in the python code and removes all the words that don't start with a lowercase letter. This is because the LSTM model is case sensitive. It also removes any words that are less than three characters long because the model cannot predict those words. It then goes through the list and converts each word into a word vector. The script then trains the model on the word vectors and saves it. The predictor.py script then takes in an input of a sentence and predicts the next word. It first converts each word in the sentence into a word vector. The script then feeds the word vectors into the model and uses the output to predict the next word vector in the sequence. It then converts the word vector back into a word and outputs it. The tester.py script generates random python code and feeds it to the model. It first generates a list of all the words in the vocabulary. It then generates a random sentence based on that vocabulary. The script then runs this through the predictor.py script to predict the next word. It then compares the predicted word to the next word in the random sentence. It calculates the accuracy of the model by how many words it got right. It also calculates how much time the model saved by the number of words the model predicted correctly. The model is an LSTM model. It has one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer.

"Scientists have created a vaccine for cat allergies that trains the immune systems of cats, instead of desensitizing the immune system of people allergic to cats. Hypocat trains the cat's immune system to ignore the protein Fel d 1, which is the culprit responsible for allergic reactions in cat owners. ""Cat allergen is a huge social problem,"" said study researcher Clare Bryant, from Cambridge University. ""Our study shows that we can effectively reduce levels of the most potent cat allergen, Fel d 1, from a cat's coat by simply vaccinating the cat. This could reduce the risk of developing allergies in a person exposed to a cat."" The vaccine is an injection of modified cat protein, which is an extract of dead bacteria. The cat's body sees the protein as an invader, and makes antibodies to fight the invader, so that the next time the cat encounters the protein, it will be able to fight it. The scientists injected two cats with the vaccine, and compared the allergens in their blood, saliva, and fur to those of a control group of cats who were not injected. The results showed that the levels of the protein in the vaccinated cats' fur was 10 times less than in the control group. The vaccinated cats also had less of the protein in their saliva and blood. Hypocat is currently being tested on cats in the United States and will be tested in Europe later this year. The goal is to reduce the amount of allergen in the cat's fur, saliva and urine.

"Scientists from Stanford have posted the mRNA sequence that powers the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on GitHub. The scientists sequenced the mRNA using samples obtained from discarded vaccines. No vaccines were harmed in the making of this mRNA sequence. But the move is controversial. Some scientists are claiming that posting the sequence online could discourage companies from investing in developing the vaccine. ""If a competitor has your sequence, they're not going to make a vaccine,"" says Joerg Zwirner, a virologist at the University of Bern. He says that this could mean that companies, like Johnson Johnson, will be less willing to develop the Moderna vaccine, instead opting to use an approach that's similar to Pfizer's or AbbVie's vaccines. Moderna, the company behind the vaccine, has stated that the team from Stanford did not obtain their mRNA sequence from their vaccine. They say that their ""vaccine is safe, effective, and differentiated from any other in development."" The scientists involved with the sequence posting defended their actions, arguing that the scientific community needs to be able to build on the work of other researchers. ""It's important for the public to be able to see the work that's being done,"" said postdoctoral researcher Sarah Cohen, who was involved in the mRNA sequencing. ""I think that's the scientific process. We don't have secret science."" Posting the mRNA sequence could allow other researchers to make their own vaccines and conduct their own studies. But some scientists worry that posting the sequence online could encourage the development of illegal and untested vaccines. Several clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine have been completed.

"It is possible to draw appealing animations with just a little SVG, Javascript, and CSS knowledge. This tutorial shows you how to create an animation using JavaScript functions to calculate the position of a circle on a grid. You can then apply a CSS transition on the circle's position, to give the impression of movement. There are many ways to animate SVG elements, including using CSS, SMIL, or scripting. The technique demonstrated here is one of the simplest, yet still quite effective. The SVG used in this tutorial is a simple 20x20 grid. Each of the grid's squares is a 10x10 rectangle, which I'll call a ""cell."" The SVG file is shown in the following code snippet, and the SVG output is shown in Figure 1. rect width""10"" height""10"" fill""none"" stroke""gray"" stroke-width""0.1"" rect x""20"" y""0"" width""10"" height""10"" fill""none"" stroke""gray"" stroke-width""0.1"" Figure 1: SVG Grid We'll want to start by adding the circle to the SVG, and give it some basic CSS styles to make it appear somewhere on the grid. These styles are shown in the following code snippet, and the SVG output is shown in Figure 2. circle cx""0"" cy""0"" r""5"" fill""red"" stroke""black"" stroke-width""0.1"" Figure 2: SVG Grid with Circle The circle is not really an SVG element. It's a mathematical definition of a shape that the SVG specification recognizes. The attributes that we can set on a circle are listed in the SVG specification. The center of a circle is defined by the cx and cy attributes. The radius of the circle is defined by the r attribute. The cx, cy, and r attributes are the only ones we need for this tutorial. The SVG grid is drawn with a series of 400 rectangles. In this example, I've left out all of the styling of these rectangles, so they just have black borders, with no fill. We want to animate the circle as it moves from cell to cell on the grid, but we don't want to use a scripting language like Javascript. Instead, we want to use CSS transitions. To create an animation, we start by giving the circle a transition property. The following code snippet shows how to do that. The SVG output is shown in Figure 3. transition: cx 2s, cy 2s; Figure 3: SVG Grid with Circle with CSS Transition The transition property applies to the whole circle element, and it means that when the cx and cy properties are changed, then the circle will move in 2 seconds. It's important to note that this transition doesn't actually move the circle. It just makes a change to the circle, and then the browser moves the circle. There are several transition properties that control how transitions occur. The ones that are most relevant to our animation are as follows: transition-property: the properties to be animated, in this case cx and cy. transition-duration: the duration of the animation, in seconds. transition-timing-function: a function that defines how the animation progresses over time. For this example, we use ease, which means the change will be smooth. transition-delay: the delay before the transition starts, in seconds. transition-delay: 0.5s; transition-timing-function: ease; Figure 4: SVG Grid with Circle with CSS Transition and Delay The keyframe animation uses a similar set of properties to the CSS transition. However, instead of the transition-property, we use the animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, and animation-delay. We set the animation-name to cellmove. This is the name of our animation. The animation-duration is the length of time for the animation, which is 2 seconds. The animation-timing-function is a function that defines how the animation progresses over time. We use ease again. The animation-delay is the delay before the animation starts. We also have to define how the animation is run. For this, we use the keyframes rule. This rule gives the values of each property for each percentage of the animation. In this case, it just gives the value of the cx property, starting from 0, and ending at 2000. The SVG output is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: SVG Grid with Circle with CSS Key",0,530

Here, we used a new method called self-distillation to train an algorithm that can diagnose 14 different pathologies on chest X-rays with high accuracy. Diagnosing a patient from a chest X-ray is challenging because of the difficulty in extracting and quantifying relevant information from the image. However, with recent advances in machine learning, algorithms have been developed that are able to detect and diagnose various pathologies on chest X-rays. For example, an algorithm called CheXNet was developed to detect the presence of 14 pathologies on chest X-rays with an accuracy of 84. However, this algorithm used a large amount of hand-labeled X-rays for training, which are difficult to obtain. Here, the researchers develop a new method for training a deep learning algorithm that can diagnose 14 pathologies from a chest X-ray with an accuracy of 83, using only 224,316 X-rays with no hand labeling. This new method is called self-distillation, and it relies on the assumption that the output probabilities generated by the algorithm are accurate and reliable. For example, if the algorithm predicts that a patient has a 0.9 probability of having a pneumothorax, then the researchers assume that the patient most likely has a pneumothorax. This allows the algorithm to generate a training dataset by extracting labels from the output probabilities of the algorithm. In addition, the researchers use a technique called co-distillation to make the algorithm learn from multiple teachers rather than a single teacher. As a result, the algorithm is able to learn from the probability distributions of multiple teachers, which enhances its ability to learn accurately. The algorithm was tested on a dataset of 420,567 chest X-rays obtained from two hospitals in India. Using the algorithm, the researchers were able to diagnose pneumonia with an accuracy of 95.2 and a sensitivity of 90.8, which is comparable to the performance of a radiologist. The researchers also used the algorithm to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) on chest X-rays. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that the key to ending TB is to detect it early and provide treatment, but this is often difficult to do in developing countries. Therefore, the researchers' algorithm could be a useful tool for diagnosing TB in developing countries, where there is limited access to radiologists and other clinicians. The researchers also used the algorithm to develop a web application that can diagnose 14 different pathologies from chest X-rays. This application has been tested in India, where the results were found to be reliable. In summary, the researchers have developed a deep learning algorithm that can diagnose 14 different pathologies on chest X-rays with high accuracy, using only 224,316 X-rays that have no hand labeling. The researchers' algorithm could be a useful tool for diagnosing different pathologies from chest X-rays, especially in developing countries where there is limited access to clinicians.

"The Maui Shell is a new convergent Linux shell that aims to work on both mobile and desktop. It is still a work in progress, but there are some usable demos to check out. Maui is described as a ""pure Qt convergence shell for GNULinux-based operating systems."" The idea is to provide a shell that works on both mobile devices and desktop computers. Torvalds said ""I'm not a huge fan of smartphones and tablets, but I can see that they're the future."" The Maui Shell can be used on Android, but it is in no way a replacement for the Android Shell. Instead, it is meant to complement it. The Maui Shell is also designed to be used on desktop computers. It features a ""convergence desktop"" with a window manager that can be used on a normal desktop computer or on a touchscreen device. The convergence desktop can be used to run multiple applications at once. The Maui Shell is a Qt application and uses Qt libraries. This means that it can be used on pretty much any Linux distribution. It also means that it has a very clean and modern look and feel. Maui currently has three different demos for people to check out. The first demo is a virtual machine image that can be used to test Maui. It is a Qemu image based on Ubuntu 14.04 that has Maui installed on it. The second demo is a Maui virtual machine that can be used with VMware Workstation or VMware Player. It is a little bit larger than the Qemu image. The final demo is an Android x86 installer. This installer is designed to work on both PCs and Android phones. It will install Maui on Android devices and can also install Maui on a computer if the user wishes. The Maui Shell is an interesting project that is definitely worth checking out. Hopefully it will gain some traction and help to make Linux a more viable option on mobile devices. Image credit: Maui Project",0,533
"Follow this step by step guide with working code examples to build a ""Spotify Wrapped"" clone using Mux's Data API. The Spotify Wrapped website, which has received over 1 million visits, breaks down a user's listening habits across the year, giving them a visual representation of their most-played artists, songs, and genres. With the Mux Data API, you can build your own version of Spotify Wrapped without any of the data science work. Follow along with our step-by-step guide and code examples, and build your own Wrapped in less than 10 minutes! Want to try it out yourself? Sign up for a free Mux account and get started with a 20 credit towards your first month! Start by importing the Mux Python SDK into your project. Mux provides a number of methods for getting data from your project. In this example, we'll be using the Mux API to get a list of all the videos that the user has watched over the past 12 months. The getevents method will return a list of all events for the past 12 months. In this example, we're only interested in the videoplay events, which we can specify by passing a query parameter of typevideoplay to the method. We can also specify a timeframe of the past 12 months using the since and until parameters. Now that we have a list of videoplay events, we can extract some useful information. Now that we have a list of video IDs, we can use the getvideo method to get data about the video itself. The getvideo method will return a dictionary that contains information like the title, description, and thumbnail. To be more concise, we can also write the code above as a one-liner. Now that we have the video title, we can loop through the list of video IDs and print out the title for each video. Now that we have the list of videos, let's count the total number of plays across all videos. We can count the total number of plays using the groupby method. This method will return a dictionary that contains the number of plays grouped by the videoid. Now we'll create a graph that shows the total number of video plays over the course of the past 12 months. To create the graph, we'll use the sum of the number of plays as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. The getevents method will return a list of events, where each event is a dictionary. The event dictionary contains the timestamp of the event, the videoid, and the amount of time the video was watched. We can loop through the event list to find the number of plays for each day in the past 12 months. Now we'll plot the data on a graph. To generate the graph, we'll use the plotly library, which provides a number of useful plotting methods. We can use the graphobjs method to create an array of trace objects, which contain the information for each data series. The graphobjs method takes the x-axis and y-axis data as parameters. Since we're plotting the number of plays over the past 12 months, the x-axis will contain the day of each month. We can use the datetime module to get the first day of each month. Since we're plotting the number of plays on the y-axis, we'll use the sum of the plays for each day. Now we can use the plotly library to generate the graph. The graph object will contain the data for the graph. We can use the createdict method to turn the graph object into a dictionary. We can then convert the dictionary into JSON and embed it in our HTML template. Now let's build a graph that shows the average amount of time the user spent watching videos. To create the graph, we'll use the sum of the time watched as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. To get the total time watched across all videos, we'll use the sum of the playtime property from each event dictionary. Now we can build the graph using the same method as before. Once again, we can embed the JSON data into our HTML template. Now let's build a graph that shows the total number of unique videos watched. To create the graph, we'll use the count of unique video IDs as the y-axis, and the day as the x-axis. The first step is to get a list of all the unique video IDs. The getevents method will return a list of events, where each event is a dictionary. The",0,534

"Skelleftea is a town in the far north of Sweden with a climate-conscious focus. It runs on 100 renewable energy and recycles 120,000 tonnes of electronic waste a year. The town was an early adopter of LED street lighting, which has cut its energy bills and CO2 emissions, and now it is testing smart lighting systems as part of a broader plan to become a smart city. Skelleftea is piloting a smart lighting system that can control street lighting based on a number of factors, including traffic and weather conditions. The system uses LED lighting to provide 70 per cent energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions. ""We are also testing the possibility of using lampposts as a platform for other smart city applications, for example sensors to measure air quality,"" says Tommy Alenius, Mayor of Skelleftea. The municipality is an early adopter of LED technology, which reduces the energy needed to run street lighting. ""We have installed 4,500 LED lampposts across the municipality and we are currently testing a new control system to determine how we can make the most of it,"" says Alenius. LEDs typically use up to 40 per cent less energy than conventional lighting systems. They also have a longer lifetime and are easier to maintain. The control system is also piloting the possibility of using lampposts as a platform for sensors to measure air quality. ""We have installed sensors to measure CO2 levels in the street lighting and are currently testing how to handle the data,"" says Alenius. The town's long-term ambition is to become a smart city, which it defines as one that uses digital technology to become more energy efficient, improve quality of life and reduce environmental impact. ""Our vision is to be an open and sustainable city, where smart city solutions and digitalisation improve quality of life and economic growth,"" says Alenius. The municipality is also taking part in a European Commission-funded pilot project, REMOURBAN, to redevelop its city centre. It will include a smart district heating grid, which will deliver low-carbon heating to 10,000 properties. ""We will also test innovative solutions to boost energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions in buildings, such as energy monitoring and management systems, and thermal storage in existing buildings,"" says Alenius. The project is also developing new types of electric buses, which will be powered by the district heating system and use waste heat from buses to heat the buildings. ""This is a way of showing that our city is open for innovation and that we are ready to test new technologies and share the results,"" says Alenius. The municipality has been a long-term supporter of renewable energy. It is home to Sweden's first wind farm, which was built in 1996, and runs on 100 per cent renewable energy. The wind farm generates around 360GWh per year, which is enough to supply 100 per cent of the municipality's energy needs, including heating, hot water, street lighting, industrial processes, electric vehicles and buildings. The wind farm is owned by a local co-operative, which invests the money generated from the sale of the electricity in local projects and environmental initiatives. It also recycles 120,000 tonnes of electronic waste a year and is home to Europe's largest recycling plant, operated by Ecotek. The municipal waste management company, AB Skelleftea Renhallning, which runs the plant, is 75 per cent owned by the municipality and 25 per cent owned by Ecotek. The municipality has also invested heavily in fibre connectivity, with 90 per cent of the population covered by fibre to the home. ""We are actively investing in smart city infrastructure to make the city more attractive to investors, residents and businesses,"" says Alenius.",0,536
"Lucid has beaten the Tesla Model S Plaid prototype's Laguna Seca race track record with its Air electric vehicle. The tri-motor performance version of the Air electric has over 1,200 lb-ft of torque and 1,000 horsepower from the electric motors. The Model S Plaid was tested at the Laguna Seca racetrack for the Model S Plaid to show its capabilities.

"Large and mysterious land carvings have been discovered in India's Thar Desert. The geoglyphs may be the largest-ever graphical depictions designed by humans. They were discovered using Google Earth during an investigation into the possibility of finding ancient remains in the area. The carvings were first discovered in 2012 by a group of Indian researchers led by Rohan Rawat, who was an Indian student at the time. Rohan discovered the carvings after a project to map and survey the region using Google Earth. After finding the images, he contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for further research. The researchers and ISRO then went to the region, and found that the carvings were depicted using small rocks and boulders that had been laid out in patterns over the ground. The rocks are not aligned with the ground, but are rather laid out to give the appearance of the design from an aerial perspective. The researchers found that the carvings were created by piling up small rocks, which would have required a massive amount of work. Researchers at the time estimated that it would have taken 1800 hours of labor to create one of the carvings. The carvings depict ancient gods, goddesses, and animals. The carvings were created by a group of people called the Indus Valley Civilization, which was the largest ancient civilization in India. The civilization existed from 3300 BC to 1300 BC. The images are difficult to see from the ground, which may be why they have not been discovered earlier. The carvings are created by placing rocks on the ground in various patterns. The carvings are so large that the entire depiction can only be seen from an aerial perspective. The carvings are a mystery to researchers, and it is not clear why the Indus Valley civilization created them. The carvings are located in the Thar Desert, which is one of the least hospitable places on earth, making it unlikely that the carvings were created for practical purposes. Many of the carvings depict animals and gods, which suggests that they may have been used for ceremonial purposes. Researchers also note that some of the carvings are located near roads and land routes that may have been used for trade. More carvings are expected to be found in the area as further research is carried out. The carvings are one of the oldest forms of graphical representation made by humans, and they demonstrate the complexity of the Indus Valley civilization.",0,540
"The pandemic is making it more normal for people to start and develop relationships online without ever meeting in person. For many people, online romance is now the only option. In the past, this was not considered to be a genuine alternative to meeting in person. There is a stigma associated with meeting people online, but this stigma is becoming irrelevant. Many people are finding it easier to connect online than in person. There are many reasons for this, but mostly it is because people are more honest and open about themselves online. There is a certain anonymity that allows people to be more vulnerable. Sometimes this openness is a result of the fact that in person, it is difficult to be honest about one's illness. It is easier to talk about it online, before a face-to-face meeting. Another reason for online relationships is the mobility of many people. This is particularly true for people who are diagnosed with HIV late in the illness, for example, when they already have AIDS. People with AIDS often become seriously ill and immobile. They may have a fear of being seen in public in a weakened state. They may not be comfortable with people seeing the symptoms of their illness. In addition, their doctors may advise them to stay away from large crowds and public places to avoid infection. Some people become homebound as a result of their symptoms. Some people may simply not have the time to go out. Many people are working long hours to support themselves or a family, and they may not have the energy or time to go out. This is true for people who have jobs that are physically or emotionally draining. For others, going out means having to put on a mask, to appear well and healthy even when they are not. As a result, some people may not go out until they have reached a level of acceptance of their illness and are ready to disclose their status. If you are online, take advantage of the resources that the Internet has to offer. The Web is a wonderful place for support and for finding others like you. The Internet has made it easier for people with HIV to meet and connect. This is particularly true for people who may be homebound or who find it difficult to meet people in their community. There are many sites that offer chat rooms and forums for people with HIV. Some sites have the option of remaining anonymous. This option allows you to express yourself more freely and openly. There are online dating sites and sites that are geared for people with HIV. These sites make it easier to find other people with the same concerns as you. They allow you to search for people by location, age, and gender. Keep in mind that people may lie about their HIV status. Some people may not know they are HIV positive. Some may have been diagnosed but are not ready to disclose their status. Some may not want to reveal their status because they are not ready for the commitment and responsibility that come with a relationship. They may not be ready to be part of a community. Make sure that you are ready to date before you begin to date. If you are not ready, you may end up hurting others or getting hurt. Be honest with yourself and others. Take it slowly and get to know the person you are dating. Be careful not to get too attached too quickly. It is easy to do so when you are communicating via text. The written word can be very powerful and intense. You may want to wait until you meet in person before you get attached to the person you are dating. Meeting in person is important to have a relationship. Once you find someone you would like to meet, take your time. Communicate by phone and by text. Have a few conversations before you decide to meet in person. Meeting in person can be scary for some people. Meet in a public place and don't stay out too late. Bring a friend with you. If you are ready to have sex, make sure you have a plan for safer sex. Do not have sex if you are not ready to do so. You may find that you are no longer interested in the person you met online once you meet them in person. You may not be attracted to them. You may discover that your personality or interests are very different. You may find that the person is not who they presented themselves to be online. If you feel there is a connection, make sure you take it slow. Take your time to get to know each other. If you have any doubts, discuss them. If you feel uncomfortable, express yourself. You may need to have some honest conversations. If you are looking for a relationship, you may want to avoid online dating sites. Most people on these sites are not",0,541

"The gene-editing performed on Chinese twins in order to immunize them against HIV may have had unintended mutations. He Jiankui had targeted the CCR5 gene in twins Lulu and Nana to immunize them against the AIDS virus. But researchers found that He's team missed their mark. Instead of deleting the CCR5 gene, the team removed other parts of the girls' DNA. ""It is almost certain that these mutations did not occur naturally,"" said Seoul National University's Kim Hyeong-Cheol. Chinese scientists have found that the gene-editing He Jiankui performed on twins Lulu and Nana last year had unintended consequences. They found that He's team didn't just delete the CCR5 gene as intended. The researchers also found that the girls' genomes were missing other important parts of the DNA. In a report published today in the journal Molecular Therapy, scientists from the Guangzhou Medical University in China said they found the twins' genomes were missing 15 other genes in addition to CCR5. But it's unclear whether the missing genes will affect the twins' health. Missing genes in the Chinese twins Lulu and Nana's father is HIV-positive, so the scientists intended to remove the CCR5 gene in the embryos to make the girls immune to the AIDS virus. He also intended to make the twins immune to smallpox and cholera. But the researchers found that He's team deleted large chunks of the girls' genomes. ""It is almost certain that these mutations did not occur naturally,"" said Kim Hyeong-Cheol, a molecular biologist at Seoul National University. ""It is a very disturbing finding."" When He Jiankui announced the gene-editing last year, other scientists were critical of the work. They said that the twins were too young to determine the effects of the gene-editing. But He's team now says that the twins are healthy. The girls' immune systems are still functioning, but it's unclear whether the deleted genes are affecting other areas of the twins' bodies. But the results of the report were ""highly inappropriate,"" said He Jiankui. He said that he would monitor the twins' health over the next 18 years.

"Researchers from London have developed a deep neural network that can determine a person's emotional state by analyzing wireless signals. The technique involves sending radio signals towards targets and measuring the reflected signals to determine how the brain's electrical patterns alter the target's response. The researchers used an off-the-shelf WiFi router to send wireless signals towards a person and a modified receiver to analyze the reflected signals. The modified receiver can analyze complex signals and the researchers have used this capability to detect the presence of humans in the wireless signal's path and also to analyze how the brain's electrical patterns can affect the signal. The researchers discovered that by measuring the time it takes for a radio signal to be reflected by a person's body, they can determine the person's emotional state. The technique can be used to detect 4 emotional states - excitement, sadness, boredom, and happiness. They were able to achieve this by using the wireless signal to measure the tiny changes in a person's body as the brain sends electrical signals to the body's different organs. The wireless signals are reflected differently when a person is feeling excited as opposed to when a person is feeling sad. The researchers believe that the technique can be used to develop systems that can better understand people's emotions. This would allow technology to interact with people in a more human-like manner. The technique also raises privacy concerns since it can be used to determine a person's emotional state without asking for permission. The technique can also be used to analyze a person's emotions when he or she is trying to keep their feelings hidden.",0,547

The team plans to send the satellite to a higher orbit to see if solar sailing will be able to take the spacecraft beyond Earth's orbit. The LightSail 2 is a cubesat, a type of nanosatellite that has a 10-centimeter cube-shaped chassis. It will be launched into space on June 22. It will be attached to the aerospace company's Falcon Heavy launch vehicle along with 23 other satellites. According to the Planetary Society, the LightSail 2 will be released from the Falcon Heavy into a circular orbit 720 km above the Earth. After a few days, the LightSail 2 will deploy its solar sails. The satellite's four triangular sails will have a total area of 32 square meters. The LightSail 2 will be the first spacecraft to be propelled by solar power. The sails will be made of a special type of material that's only 4.5 microns thick. It is similar to the material used in Mylar balloons. The material will be coated with a reflective substance that will make it more durable and more reflective. The thin material will be pulled taut by the satellite's booms, which will unfurl to 4.5 meters. The booms will be made of a polyamide and fiberglass material that is stronger than steel but only a fraction of its weight. The satellite will be able to move by using solar pressure. Solar pressure is the small push exerted by the sunlight that strikes the sail. The pressure will slowly increase the spacecraft's orbital velocity over time. If the LightSail 2 succeeds, it will be the first spacecraft to be propelled by solar power alone. While it won't be used to travel to another planet, the LightSail 2 will prove that solar sailing is a viable form of space travel. For more space news, visit Cosmic.news.",0,548
"Regular Expressions (regex) are a tool for manipulating strings. Regex can sometimes take an extremely long time to match or fail on some strings. This can be exploited by malicious users by feeding a regex engine a large string, causing a denial of service. In this case we need to run the code through a regex engine that can be fooled into running forever. The regex engine used by PHP is easily tricked into running forever on certain inputs. If we can get a user to run our code through PHP's regex engine, we can cause a denial of service on the system. You can see the attack being run in this video.",0,549
"A researcher from the Swiss research institute EMPA has developed an invisible lock system that uses conductive ink on a transparent polymer film to create invisible buttons. The result is an invisible button on the smartphone that can only be used when the user knows its location. The smartphone's security function is quite important, and researchers are constantly looking for new ways to prevent users from unlocking their phones. A researcher at EMPA has developed a new way to lock smartphones and other devices using a transparent polymer film with a special conductive ink pattern. This invisible button system can only be unlocked if the user knows its location. The new system is now being tested in a number of pilot projects. The development of a transparent polymer film is actually quite simple. The researcher from EMPA, Dr. Tapio Rosenius, said: ""First, we use a transparent polyurethane film, which is hard to wear, and then use a laser to create a fine structure in the film. The structure acts as a mold. Using a method called ""microembossing,"" we use a metal stamp to form conductive ink on the film, which creates a new structure similar to a button."" The final step is to apply a layer of transparent paint over the entire structure. The paint acts as an insulating material and blocks the conductive ink layer. Rosenius said: ""The result is an invisible button, which can only be activated if you know its location."" The invisible button system can be used to lock smartphones, tablets and other devices. In addition, the button is inexpensive to produce, and it can be completely integrated into the device. The invisible button system is currently being tested in a number of pilot projects. For example, EMPA researchers are working with partners to develop an invisible fingerprint scanner that can only be activated if the user knows its location. In addition, EMPA researchers are also working with Swiss companies to develop a card locking system. The system uses the invisible button system to detect whether the card is in the card slot. If it is not detected, the system will automatically lock the card.

"Japan's terrain doesn't allow for forests of wind turbines or fields of solar panels, so Japanese engineers are looking to ocean currents for renewable energy. The IHI Corporation has completed a tidal power generator that looks like a massive paddle wheel and it's capable of generating electricity for about 1000 homes. The generator is 45 feet in diameter and is installed at a depth of 46 feet. It is being tested at the mouth of a river in Nagasaki Prefecture where strong tidal currents are a guarantee. The wheel turns 15-20 times per minute and it's connected to a generator that produces 1000 kilowatts. It's rated at 2200 kilowatts for short bursts.

"Google's DeepMind AI team has successfully trained its software to control a tokamak. Small reactors like tokamaks use software to monitor the state of the plasma they contain and respond to any unexpected fluctuations. The same techniques that allow the software to determine which changes it needs to make to the plasma to keep it stable could be used in other applications. Google's AI team says its software could be used to control autonomous cars, for example. Google's AI is being trained on a tokamak at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center. It's a system that's used to train students and researchers on the finer details of controlling plasma. The tokamak was deliberately chosen because it's particularly challenging. ""The tokamak is a highly nonlinear, multi-input, multi-output system, whose behavior is characterized by a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal scales,"" the researchers write in their paper describing the AI system. ""Control of the plasma is crucial for efficient operation of the fusion experiment, and it has been a topic of active research for many years."" The software they're using is called a neural network. Unlike traditional software that's programmed to perform a specific task, neural networks learn by analyzing data. As they process more data, they get better at whatever it is they've been asked to do. Google's neural network has been trained on plasma data collected over the course of thousands of experiments on the tokamak. After it had processed the data, the software was able to control the tokamak's plasma. It managed to maintain the plasma's stability even when the conditions changed and the plasma became unstable. ""This is a very significant result,"" says Robert Granetz, a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT and a researcher in the Plasma Science and Fusion Center. ""We have now shown that AI can handle the underlying physics of fusion plasmas better than our best current models."" ""This work is very interesting,"" says David Kingham, a fusion researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""The ability of a neural network to learn an unknown nonlinear mapping from inputs to outputs is quite powerful."" Kingham warns, however, that it's still unclear whether these results can be directly applied to the design of a real-world fusion reactor. ""We need to keep working to see how these concepts will be applied in real tokamaks,"" he says. It's easy to imagine, though, that the same type of software could be applied to other situations where there's a need to process a large amount of data and make decisions based on that data. ""These tools have been used to learn the shape of a cat, but they haven't been used to learn the shape of a fusion plasma,"" says Julian Kates-Harbeck, a graduate student at MIT and a member of the research team. ""We wanted to use deep neural networks to see what they would capture."" The research was presented at the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.

"Cows at the RusMoloko dairy farm near Moscow in Russia wear VR headsets to improve their conditions and to enable them to relax into producing more milk. Data from farms across Russia, Europe and the US suggest that dairy cows produce more milk when wearing VR headsets. Russian farmers are not alone in thinking that cows are more productive when they have something to keep them entertained. A farm in Connecticut in the US claims that installing large TVs showing rolling pastures in their cowshed has led to a reduction in anxiety among the cows and a resulting increase in milk production. In a similar move, the Ministry of Agriculture in Moscow is sponsoring a competition to develop virtual reality content for cows, with the aim of helping the country's dairy industry improve its global competitiveness. ""We are currently testing VR headsets on a herd of cows,"" said an official at the Ministry, ""and we are seeing that the cows are much more relaxed and much happier."" This is how happy cows look like. The ministry is encouraging software developers and hackers to come up with new ideas for VR content for cows. The competition's website suggests ""visualisation of a summer field of flowers"" and ""a nice cowboy"" as possible options for the cows to view. The Ministry also suggests that developers could use existing human-focused virtual reality content such as ""a walk in the forest, along a river, or in the mountains."" It is thought that some existing VR content could be adapted to provide relaxation and entertainment for cows. ""It is important to note that not all cows are the same,"" the competition's website explains, ""so we need a variety of content to meet the needs of all cows. It is recommended that developers consult with veterinarians and animal psychologists to help come up with ideas for new content."" It is thought that dairy cows are more productive when they are relaxed and entertained. The organisers of the competition say that the winning VR content will be distributed to farms across the country. It is thought that providing cows with virtual reality headsets will not only improve their overall quality of life but will also help to improve Russia's dairy industry. ""By improving the welfare of cows we will improve the quality of their milk and increase our global competitiveness in the dairy market,"" said an official at the ministry. ""This will help us to address the problem of food security in Russia,"" he said, ""and will also provide a significant boost to our national economy.""

"India shut down the internet in the state of Assam during protests against a new citizenship rule. The Citizenship Amendment Bill, which creates a pathway for citizenship for minorities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, would likely exclude Muslims and could apply to millions of people, according to Al Jazeera. The bill was first proposed in 2016 and reintroduced in Parliament this year. On Wednesday, the lower house of Parliament approved the bill, which means it now has to pass the upper house. The shutdown began at around 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to NetBlocks. The government said the shutdown was in response to violent protests, which have led to three deaths, dozens of injuries and the torching of a police station, according to Al Jazeera. ""This is a clear move to prevent the spread of disinformation and rumours that could incite further violence and unrest,"" said NetBlocks Director Alp Toker. Internet disruptions and shutdowns are increasingly common in India. The country shut down the internet in all of Jammu and Kashmir and in parts of New Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in August in response to protests. India has had the most shutdowns in the world this year, according to Access Now. Internet shutdowns are common in other countries as well. The government of Myanmar has blocked the internet in eight regions in 2019, and Sri Lanka blocked social media sites and messaging apps in March during a terrorist attack and again in April during communal violence.",0,556
"Facebook Gaming has been launched in beta for a limited group of people. The service will launch with five games, including Gameloft's Asphalt 9: Legends. Out of Facebook's 2.7 billion monthly users, two billion play games on the service each month. Facebook today unveiled Facebook Gaming, a hub for gamers to discover streams and live broadcasts, play games, and chat with other gamers. The service will launch in beta in a limited number of countries, and will begin with five games, including Gameloft's Asphalt 9: Legends. In a blog post, Facebook Gaming Director Farem Meemawat said Facebook's mission is to ""make it a place where people can come together around games they love."" The company also announced that it's rolling out a redesigned Facebook gaming tab in the main navigation bar, where users will see videos and live streams from game developers, publishers, and creators. Facebook also announced that it's launching a new pilot program with select content creators where they'll be able to monetize their content, including through ad breaks in their videos. ""We're just getting started and we look forward to continuing to work with our gaming partners to help this community grow and thrive,"" Meemawat wrote. Facebook's gaming portal has been rumored to be in the works for a while now, and it's sure to be a massive challenge to the popular live-streaming platform Twitch, which was acquired by Amazon in 2014.

"BepiColombo, a joint mission between the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, has sent back pictures of the crater-riddled surface of Mercury. The mission launched in 2018 to study the planet and send back information about its composition, formation, atmosphere, and environment. BepiColombo is the first mission to Mercury since Mariner 10 in the 1970s. The new images, taken from a distance of 1,300 miles, show the planet's cratered surface and give a taste of what we can expect when BepiColombo eventually enters orbit around the planet in 2025. The images show a surface littered with craters, with some reaching several hundred miles in diameter. The images also show terrain that is covered in smooth plains. These areas are the result of volcanic activity in the planet's past. The plains are also streaked with ridges and cracks, which were likely the result of the planet's cooling and shrinking. The spacecraft also spotted smaller craters with bright halos around them. Scientists believe that these areas are covered in ejecta from other craters. The images show the planet's surface in much greater detail than what we've seen previously. Scientists hope that the images and data will help them better understand the planet's geology and formation. BepiColombo will remain in its current orbit around the Sun until late 2020. It will eventually make several flybys of Venus before entering Mercury's orbit in 2025. At that point, it will begin a one-year mission to study the planet.",0,558
"When you want to edit something using an online tool today, you usually have to upload the file to the tool by selecting the file or dragging it into your browser. At some point, the tool will ask you to save the file and download it to your computer. Google Docs is probably the only service today that lets you edit files without having to upload and download them. The Web service stores your files on its servers and makes them available to you whenever you need them. So, for example, when you create a new document in Google Docs, it is saved to your Google Docs account right away and made available for editing online immediately. This works well for documents but not for other types of files such as videos, music or executable files. The reason for this is that those files are more complex than simple text documents. They require different storage and management options, and the services that you use to edit them are usually different from Google Docs as well. Goo.gl is Google's URL shortening service. Its main purpose is to make long URLs shorter, for instance to share those on Twitter where only 140 characters are available per message. I personally use it sometimes to share links in chat programs, as it is easier to remember a shortened URL than a longer one. When you click on the link that is created you are taken directly to the website that it is linking to. You can furthermore add a plus symbol followed by a keyword to the end of the link to track click-throughs. The service has been around for a while but has not received any major updates in the past. Google just launched a new service that is called Google Play Music All Access. It is a music streaming service that is similar to Spotify, Rdio or Pandora but with some distinct differences. The service is currently only available in the United States but will be rolled out to other regions in the future. What makes it different from other services is that it is directly integrated into Google Music. That means that all the music that you have uploaded to your Google Music account will be available in All Access as well, and you can switch between your uploaded music and the All Access music library at any time. Google's Safe Browsing is a technology that the company introduced in 2007 to protect Internet users against phishing attempts, and more recently malware as well. Whenever you access a website that has been flagged as malicious or phishing by Google, you receive a notification that you should stay away from that website. To test this, I have just visited a malware infested website, the Google Chrome browser warned me that it was potentially dangerous and that I should stay away from it. It also listed three safe alternatives that I could check out instead. Google announced that it will be rolling out several new features in the next days that make searching the Web easier. The company is introducing Knowledge Graph enhancements, additional search features, and new privacy controls. As part of the update, the company will be rolling out new privacy controls that enable you to edit or remove your Web History and take-out your search data. Google Earth is a great service. You can use it to explore the planet, travel to distant locations, study maps, and even find your own home on the service. It is however quite limited as well. It does not offer features such as time traveling or a closer look at planets and the moon. You need to use another service for that. Google Street View is a Google Maps feature that enables you to take a closer look at individual streets and buildings. The feature is only available in a limited set of countries and cities. It is also not available in all areas of those cities. Luckily, there are alternative services out there that let you have a look at areas of the world that Google does not have data for. If you have been following Internet related news recently, you may have heard that the US National Security Agency is monitoring emails and phone calls of citizens and foreigners alike. While that is not really a surprise considering that a similar program has been active in the UK for some time now, it is still something that many Internet users are not too happy with. The big question here is, is there a way to prevent that monitoring from happening? The answer is no, as long as you are using a phone, the Internet or other electronic communication methods that are accessible to government agencies. Google's web service that lets you access and play your music collection from anywhere is a great thing for users who are using the service. The only problem that I have with Google Music is that it is currently only available to users from the United States. There is however a workaround that you can make use of to access your music library from anywhere. Have you ever wondered which search",0,559
"Frequency Therapeutics is seeking to reverse hearing loss by regrowing hair cells in the inner ear. It has developed a drug candidate that can be injected into the ear to stimulate the proliferation of supporting cells in the inner ear, which have the potential to become new hair cells. Frequency is based on discoveries from the lab of Robert Langer, an MIT chemical engineer, and Jeffrey Karp, a biomedical engineer at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Frequency's cofounder and CEO is David Lucchino, who was formerly a biotech investor at Polaris Partners. Lucchino joined the startup in 2015, not long after the startup won an undisclosed amount of funding from the Coulter Foundation. The Coulter Foundation is funded by the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation, which was set up by Wallace Coulter, the founder of the health care company Beckman Coulter. Frequency has said little about its progress since then, but it has grown to about 20 employees, according to the Boston Globe. It is working to develop drugs for a variety of different types of hearing loss, including noise-induced hearing loss and age-related hearing loss. Frequency is developing a ""pro-hair cell"" drug, which, in animal studies, has been shown to induce supporting cells in the inner ear to proliferate and form new hair cells. The idea is that these new hair cells could restore hearing to those with some types of hearing loss. Frequency's drug candidate is a small molecule that can be delivered to the inner ear through a standard injection into the middle ear. In animal tests, the drug has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of supporting cells in the inner ear to form new hair cells. Frequency is currently testing the drug in a Phase 12 study. In 2016, the company received an FDA fast track designation for the drug, which is meant to accelerate its path to market. Frequency's cofounder Langer is known for his work in creating new biomaterials and using them to deliver drugs in new ways. His company, Living Proof, was bought by the cosmetics company Unilever in 2016 for an undisclosed sum.",0,560

"Cymbospondylus youngorum may have been the first giant animal that ever lived on Earth. The new type of ichthyosaur was discovered in the Augusta Mountains of Nevada with a skull that is 1.4m long (5ft). The skull is just 40cm (1ft 4in) short of the largest known ichthyosaur skull. It is still not known how long the body of the animal was but it is estimated to be as long as 7m (23ft). Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that lived in the Triassic and Jurassic periods between 245 million and 145 million years ago. They resembled dolphins or porpoises and were carnivores. They were the top predators of their time and diversified into a number of different species. Cymbospondylus youngorum, first discovered in 2013, is the oldest and largest of the known species of ichthyosaurs. Its remains were found in the Triassic period rock deposits that were about 245 million years old. Based on the shape of its skull, scientists think that Cymbospondylus youngorum may have been the first ichthyosaur to have developed the large teeth that all ichthyosaurs have. The teeth were used for catching and eating prey and not for breaking the shells of sea creatures. The new species was named after Shon and Judy Young, who were the owners of the land where the fossil was found. The Youngs have been supporters of the study of paleontology, a science that studies ancient life on Earth. Researchers are excited about the find since the discovery of Cymbospondylus youngorum is the earliest evidence that ichthyosaurs had evolved their unique characteristics.",0,562

"Brewster Kahle founded Alexa Internet and the Internet Archive on the same day in 1996. Alexa was acquired by Amazon in a deal worth 250 million and converted into an analytics service. The Internet Archive was founded with the vision of storing copies of every website in the world, and is currently in the process of doing exactly that. Kahle has been a technological innovator, entrepreneur, and advocate since the beginning of the web. He has worked with the Internet Archive since 1996, creating what is today a home for the millions of books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. At the Internet Archive's headquarters in San Francisco, Kahle shows us the Wayback Machine, the Petabox, and a book scanner. The Internet Archive is a digital library of free media, including books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages. The Archive has not limited itself to collecting the digitized works of others. It now creates its own digital versions of other published works, as well as of live public domain films. The organization also oversees the Wayback Machine archive, which preserves the web pages of now defunct websites. When Kahle founded the Internet Archive in 1996, he envisioned it as a library of the Internet - a place where anyone could go and find information that has since been lost to the digital ether. Today, the Archive is growing at an enormous pace, thanks to Kahle's unending energy and vision. The Archive is home to 150 million books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Was the Internet Archive created to archive the Internet? Kahle: We founded the Internet Archive on April 30, 1996. The World Wide Web was 1,500 days old. It was that young. The Archive was a library that you might build to collect the last 1,500 days of the Internet. That was the plan at the beginning. We would keep a copy of every website. Today, it is a library that keeps a copy of every website, and it is a library that keeps a copy of every book, and it is a library that keeps a copy of every TV show, and every movie, and all the software. It is the library for the world. Was this the first time you have ever tried to archive something? Kahle: I was an archivist before I was an entrepreneur. My first job was in a library, where I worked in the rare book room, which was a place that they kept copies of the books that no one else had, and that is the kind of job that I loved. It is the kind of job that led to the Internet Archive. What have been some of the major challenges? Kahle: Everything at the beginning. There were no books to scan, no one who wanted to help us. We had no money, so we had to try to figure out a way to get books to scan, and to get people to help us. We had to figure out how to get money so that we could pay for the books to be scanned. What is the Wayback Machine? Kahle: The Wayback Machine is the website where you can go and find an older version of a webpage. You can see how it used to be in the past. It is a very handy thing. It is the library card catalog, or the index, or the Dewey Decimal System. The Wayback Machine is the index for the Library of Alexandria. Kahle: It is basically a very fast scanner. It turns the pages and takes a picture. It turns the pages and takes a picture. It turns the pages and takes a picture. It does this very quickly. Then, it has a bar code scanner, so that we know what page it is that we are looking at. A book is put on, it is scanned, and in the end, we have a digital book. It is very fast. The pages turn very quickly. It can do a book a minute. It can do 1,000 books in a day. It is a machine that is scanning all the books in the library.

"SAGA's LUNARK is a habitat designed to help people live on the lunar surface. It has a carbon fiber shell that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to be assembled quickly and easily. (LUNARK habitat for lunar surface) The habitat was designed and built by SAGA Space Architects; it was unveiled last month at the Space Tech Expo in Bremen, Germany. The habitat uses a carbon fiber material that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to be assembled quickly and easily. It has a compact shape and a maximum internal diameter of 6.8 meters (22.3 feet), and it is designed to be able to house a crew of up to four people for up to 30 days, according to the company. The habitat is designed to provide protection from temperature extremes, which can range from -200 degrees Celsius 328 degrees Fahrenheit) at night to 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) during the lunar day. The habitat is also designed to withstand the impacts of micrometeoroids and cosmic radiation, according to the company. Lunar dust is also a hazard, so the habitat was designed to collect lunar dust in a non-contact way, according to the company. SAGA's team said that the habitat's design would allow astronauts to easily attach or detach the habitat, depending on the mission's needs. Fans of lunar science fiction (as well as science) might be reminded of the lunar observatory from Robert Heinlein's 1941 short story Solution Unsatisfactory: The housing of the observatory was a flattened sphere, fifty feet in diameter and fifty feet high, resting on three legs, its top and bottom plates five feet thick. It was made of armor plate and its ports, heavily baffled, gave the appearance of gun emplacements...

"Snapchat's Snap Kit allows developers to integrate Snapchat features into their apps. Hoop, a Tinder-like app developed on Snap Kit, quickly saw 2.5 million downloads after its launch. The app allows users to scroll through potential matches and swipe left or right, but users can also unlock more information on potential matches by using Snapchat. This is Hoop's first step in monetizing its platform and it looks to be a successful one. Tinder is popular for its simplicity. All you do is swipe left or right to indicate whether you're interested in someone. If you and your potential match swipe right on each other, you're matched and you can start chatting. Hoop, a new dating app for iOS and Android, is essentially Tinder on steroids. Users can swipe left or right on potential matches, but there's a catch. To see more information about a potential match, users must send that person a Snapchat. The goal is to ""increase the quality of matches and help curb ghosting,"" said Anthony Dilollo, co-founder of Hoop. ""We're re-introducing the personal touch of dating,"" Dilollo said. ""Swiping is addicting, but it's also an impersonal way of meeting someone, and we're changing that."" Dilollo and his co-founder Michael Perlman developed Hoop on Snap Kit, Snapchat's development platform that allows developers to integrate Snapchat features into their apps. Users who don't already have Snapchat will be prompted to download the app. They'll then have to use Snapchat to unlock information on their Hoop matches, like photos and videos from the person's Snapchat story. Hoop is Snap Kit's first publicly announced partner, and it's already a success. The app hit 1 million downloads within the first week of its launch in mid-May. Now, it has 2.5 million downloads. For Snapchat, this is a good way to get more users on its platform, which has been struggling to grow over the past year. Hoop is also one of the first apps to monetize its platform through Snap Kit. If users don't have a Snapchat account, they're prompted to download the app and create one. From there, they're directed to Snapchat's camera to take a photo for their Hoop profile. In order to be eligible for Snap Kit, developers must either have a product that is live in the app stores or have raised at least 100,000 in funding. Hoop has raised 3.4 million, Dilollo said. The company is also part of Y Combinator's Summer 2018 class and it plans to use the money to further develop its app. Snapchat's Snap Kit is a smart move for the company.

"Bandit is a pure Elixir HTTP server for Plug applications. It can serve HTTP1.x and HTTP2 clients over both HTTP and HTTPS. The project prioritizes correctness, clarity, and performance, and aims to eventually become the default HTTP server for the Elixir language. We are currently in the process of merging with Phoenix and expect to land in v1.4.0. All of Bandit is written in pure Elixir (no NIFs or any other native code) and provides a nice OTP API for use in your Plug application. Bandit is a full-featured HTTP2 server that includes support for request and response HPACK compression and HTTP2 server push. We are also experimenting with various techniques for reducing the number of frames in the initial connection establishment to get the benefits of HTTP2 sooner. Bandit provides a nice OTP API for use in your Plug application.:conn - The connection that is being served.:response - The HTTP response to send back to the client.:timeout - The timeout after which a connection will be closed.:priority - The priority of the request (only for HTTP2 connections).:keepalive - If the connection should be kept alive or not.:requestpath - The path that was matched by the router.:requestmethod - The HTTP method used.:remoteip - The IP address of the remote client.:remoteport - The port of the remote client.:headers - The HTTP headers in a map.:params - The query string parameters in a map.:cookies - The cookies set by the client in a map.:host - The host name of the request.:port - The port number of the request.:pathinfo - The path after the matched route in a Plug application.:requestbody - The request body.:scheme - The scheme of the request (http or https).:querystring - The query string.:requestversion - The HTTP version of the request (1.1 or 2.0). Bandit provides a light-weight custom Plug adapter that uses the same connection API as Phoenix. This allows you to migrate your code from Phoenix to Bandit without having to re-write your Plug code. The adapter is also a good starting point for other HTTP servers looking to implement a Plug adapter for the Elixir language. Bandit is fully tested with the ExUnit test framework. The test suite is also automatically run when the project is compiled. Bandit is actively developed by Chris McCord, author of the Phoenix framework. Bandit is released under the Apache 2.0 license.",0,567
"Airseas' Seawing is a parafoil kite designed to attach to ships to reduce emissions on shipping trips by up to 20. It can be mounted onto the deck of any vessel for a fraction of the cost of more complicated kite systems.

"Ford is releasing a comprehensive self-driving dataset to academics and researchers. The data was collected over a year and it comes from multiple self-driving vehicles. Ford is also sharing a software tool to aid in the development of self-driving cars, and to help reduce the amount of effort required to gather and annotate data. It's difficult to test self-driving cars without risking collisions and accidents, so the industry is largely reliant on simulators. Ford is hoping to improve the accuracy of the simulators by sharing its own dataset, along with a software tool. The data was collected by a trio of self-driving vehicles in Detroit, Pittsburgh and Miami. According to Ford, ""these self-driving vehicles, which use the latest LiDAR sensors and cameras, provide a 360-degree view of the surrounding environment."" The dataset is approximately 1500 driving hours and contains data from over 1 million miles of travel. The dataset will be used to help train and test artificial intelligence in order to improve self-driving capabilities. Ford also unveiled an open-source computer vision software tool called ""ARGO-S."" The software can analyze images and label the various objects in the image. Ford says that the software ""can help researchers efficiently annotate and edit image data captured by autonomous vehicles, such as the location of vehicles, pedestrians and lane markings, and to identify objects.""

"Apple has extended its deadline for employees returning to the office because of the increase of Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant. The return to the offices was controversial since it was announced, with many complaining about the lack of safety precautions and the speed with which the company was returning employees. It was at the end of February that the company announced that it would start returning employees to the office on March 2nd and that there would be two shifts a day. It was also announced that employees would have to wear a mask and get a temperature check. Today, the company announced that the first group of employees will return to the office on March 16th, not the 2nd. Apple's official statement was that it will return employees to the office in two stages. The first group will be the teams that have a direct impact on customer service and software updates. The second phase is scheduled to start in the middle of this month. The teams that work on the production of hardware and other Apple products will return to work. Apple's insistence on returning employees to the office was seen by many as a bad move. Apple employees have been calling on the company to wait until the outbreak is over.

"The SvelteKit beta is now available. SvelteKit is a framework for building high-performance web apps. It features server-side rendering, routing, code-splitting for JS and CSS, adaptors for different serverless platforms, and more. If you haven't already, head over to SvelteKit.com to sign up for the beta. SvelteKit brings the Svelte compile-time execution model to the server. In Svelte, you write your application's logic in JS. That code is then compiled to a set of plain HTML and CSS, ready to be shipped to the browser. Because the code is compiled, Svelte is able to perform a lot of optimizations. For example, if a component isn't being used on the page, Svelte is able to omit it completely. SvelteKit takes the same approach on the server. It parses your JS files, extracts the logic, and renders the result into HTML. Because SvelteKit knows exactly what the browser will need, it can optimize the server-rendered output to keep it as lightweight as possible. With server-side rendering, your web app can start rendering immediately, before the JS is downloaded and executed. This reduces the initial load time, and makes your app feel faster and more responsive. SvelteKit automatically generates bundles for your JS and CSS, including all the code your page needs to work offline. This means you don't have to manually split your code into different files. You can simply write your app as if it were a single page app. The bundles are also automatically code-split. SvelteKit will only load the code that the browser needs to render the current page. Code-splitting is important because it helps to reduce the amount of data that has to be transferred to the browser. It also makes the initial load faster, and means the browser can start executing your code sooner. Routing lets you build multiple pages using the same codebase. This lets you share code across different parts of your app, while keeping each page focused on a specific task. SvelteKit also works great for single page apps. The only difference is that all of your code is always loaded. This means there's no need for code-splitting. SvelteKit works with existing web frameworks, like Express.js. You can simply wrap your existing app with SvelteKit to take advantage of its features. If you're building a new app, or you're using a simpler framework like Koa.js, you can use the SvelteKit app generator to scaffold a new project. SvelteKit is designed to work with serverless platforms like Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify, Zeit Now, or Webtask. SvelteKit adaptors make it easy to deploy your app to these platforms. They will build your app, minify and bundle your code, and upload it to your serverless provider. SvelteKit can also work with traditional web servers. This is useful if you're deploying to a platform that doesn't support serverless (e.g. AWS S3) or you prefer to control your own web server. To deploy to a traditional server, simply configure your web server to serve the correct files. You can find the file structure and instructions in the SvelteKit docs. If you're interested in trying SvelteKit, sign up for the beta on SvelteKit.com. The beta includes a code editor, compiler, and tutorial. It also includes documentation for getting started with the SvelteKit CLI and running SvelteKit on different serverless platforms. To get started, sign up for the beta, then run the sveltekit tutorial command to install the CLI and start the tutorial. Because SvelteKit is still in beta, you'll need to install it locally. It will be released publicly as soon as it's ready. You can also find the SvelteKit beta on GitHub. If you have any questions or feedback, you can join the SvelteKit beta community on Spectrum or get in touch with us on Twitter.",0,576

"Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling sequential data. In this article, we will explore a Recurrent Neural Network in Python using Keras. By the end of this article, you should have a basic understanding of how to build a Recurrent Neural Network in Python. The topic of Recurrent Neural Networks is very broad, so this article is just a starting point. After reading this article, you might also be interested in checking out my article on LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) since LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network. The data that we will use for this tutorial will be the Shakespeare dataset. The Shakespeare dataset contains the complete works of William Shakespeare. We will only use the text portion of the dataset, and we will use the first 25,000 characters to train our model. The first 25,000 characters of Shakespeare's plays is 10,471 words. There are 1,126 unique words in this portion of the dataset. The first 3 unique words are 'a', 'an', and 'and'. If we train our Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next word in a sequence of text, then we would expect 'the' to be the most likely next word since 'the' is the 4th most common word in the dataset. To start, we will need to import the packages we will need for this tutorial. We will need to import the Keras package for the backend of our Recurrent Neural Network. In addition, we will need to import the Tensorflow backend for Keras to use for its calculations. In addition to the Keras and Tensorflow backend packages, we will also need to import a few other packages. We will need to import the numpy package to work with arrays. We will also need the sklearn package to load the Shakespeare dataset. We will use numpy arrays to store our dataset and to store the weights and biases of our network. The sklearn package will help us load the Shakespeare dataset. Next, we will load the Shakespeare dataset. We will use the loadfiles method to load the dataset into the array we defined. The loadfiles method will load the file into a pandas dataframe, so we will need to convert the dataframe to a numpy array before we can use it. After we have loaded the dataset into a numpy array, we will split the dataset into training and testing subsets. We will use the randomstate parameter to avoid having the same training and testing subsets every time we train the network. We will use the trainingsize parameter to specify the number of samples we want to use for the training subset. We will use the remaining samples in the testing subset. Once we have split the dataset, we will create a helper function to build a dictionary mapping between a word and the index of that word. The first time we call this function, the dictionary will be empty. The first time we add a word to the dictionary, we will add it as a key. The subsequent times we add a word to the dictionary, we will use that word as the key and the index as the value. Next, we will loop through our dataset to create the dictionary we will use for the next step of our tutorial. For each word in the dataset, we will add that word to our dictionary with the index as the value. Now, we will loop through the dataset again to create a new array that will have the index of each word as the value. Next, we will convert the index values of our new array into one-hot encodings. This will create a matrix that has a dimension of words x samples. In addition to converting our dataset into a matrix, we will also create a one-hot encoding of the training labels. We will use this one-hot encoding of the labels to make sure that our Recurrent Neural Network is predicting the correct label. Now that we have split our dataset into a training and testing subset, we will loop through the training subset to train our Recurrent Neural Network. We will start the loop by building the Recurrent Neural Network we will use for this tutorial. The recurrent layer in our network will have 128 units. The output layer will have a single unit since we are trying to predict the next word in the sequence. In addition to our RNN layer, we will also have a dense layer. The dense layer will have a single unit to match the output layer. We will use a rectifier activation function on the output of the dense layer. To train our network, we will use the fit method on our model. We will pass our training subset as the x",0,578

"A new finding suggests that the Ebola viruses behind a new outbreak in Guinea may have originated from a survivor who carried the virus for at least five years. The discovery suggests the possibility that Ebola survivors can infect others, even after a long time. Ebola Survivors: Can They Pass On The Disease? Researchers from the University of Cambridge conducted a study to figure out how the Ebola virus spreads through the population. The study was based on mathematical modeling of real-world data gathered from Guinea. The results suggest that at least one case in the new outbreak of Ebola in Guinea came from a survivor who had the virus in his or her system for at least five years. It is not clear how the virus stayed in the person's system for so long. However, it is known that the Ebola virus can stay in bodily fluids for long periods of time. The Ebola virus in West Africa is believed to have come from an animal reservoir, most likely bats. The virus is passed on to humans by close contact with an infected animal. It can also be passed on through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. Ebola is known to have a long incubation period, which means that it can be passed on before an infected individual becomes ill. This makes it harder to contain the spread of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there have been 23,371 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. WHO also estimates that there have been 9,380 Ebola-related deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in March 2014. The new finding is alarming, as it suggests that survivors of the Ebola virus could also pass on the disease. ""The risk of reintroduction of infection is particularly high when Ebola survivors have ongoing contact with susceptible people in the community,"" said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome Trust, in a press release. The finding also suggests that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not over.

"Scientists have grown plants in lunar soil using samples collected during the Apollo missions to the moon. The scientists grew thale cress, a small flowering plant that is attractive to pollinating insects. It is considered an ideal specimen for scientific experiments. The researchers say the experiment is the first step in mankind's long-term goal to colonise the moon. The lunar soil was collected from several Apollo missions to the moon, which took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The soil was mixed with earth from Iceland to create the growth medium. Thale cress was chosen for the experiment because it grows rapidly, produces a large amount of seeds and has few nutritional requirements. The cress was exposed to several different concentrations of simulated lunar soil. The plants were also exposed to varying concentrations of lunar and earth soil. The researchers concluded that the growth rate and survival rate of thale cress was similar to that of plants grown in earth soil alone. The research team consisted of scientists from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden and Wageningen University in the Netherlands. The team says the results of the experiment provide a good basis for continued studies into the feasibility of growing plants on the moon. The researchers say a manned moon base could provide shelter and fuel, but astronauts would have to be provided with fresh food. Researchers have previously suggested using hydroponic greenhouses, but the new experiment shows plants could be grown in lunar soil without the need for complex systems to provide nutrients. The results of the experiment are published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta.",0,583
"The same CSS code can sometimes output different and unexpected results. CSS is a complex system and subtle differences can change how properties behave. This article looks at layout algorithms, cascading, specificity and other complex topics. Over the years, I've created a number of CSS demos, some of which have unexpected results. One that particularly stands out is my CSS3 Gradients, which caused a number of comments in forums and tweets. It looks like this: The demo shows three columns of the same element, which is a div with a class of ""gradient-example."" Each column has the same gradient, but they all look different. The reason for this is that the elements have different sizes, so the gradient is stretched or squashed depending on the height of the div. Each column is a different size because I'm using CSS columns to control the layout. The second column is bigger than the first and the third is smaller. This is because I've set the break-after and break-before values of the first and third columns to always, which tells the browser to put the breaks either side of these columns. The second column is smaller because it doesn't have a break either side of it. I decided to use columns because it's one of the best ways to do multi-column layouts. Each column is a block-level element, which means it takes up the whole width of the container, and columns can be sized in a number of ways: 1fr - The column takes up the same amount of space as all the other columns fr - The column takes up a specific amount of space auto - The column takes up as much space as it needs none - The column is the same size as its contents This gives us a lot of control over the layout. In addition, the browser will automatically reflow the columns to fit the available space, which means we can create flexible layouts that work on different screen sizes. Although the columns feature is great for controlling layout, it does have some drawbacks. The main problem is that it uses the available space in a very different way to block layout. In block layout, we measure space using the edges of the element and the edges of the container. This means that if you set an element to be 100px wide and the container is 400px wide, the element takes up 14 of the container. Columns, on the other hand, use the space between columns to measure the size of the columns. This means that if we have three columns with a width of 1fr and the container is 400px wide, each column will be 133px wide. This is because the available space is 400px and that's divided by 3 columns to give a width of 133px. It doesn't matter what we set the column width to, the size of each column will be the same. This is very different to block layout. In block layout, if we have three elements with a width of 100px, they will all be different sizes. This is because the browser has to account for the space between the elements, which is called the margin. If we set the margin to 10px, then the first and third elements will be 100px, and the second element will be 100px 10px 110px. If we set the margin to 50px, then the first and third elements will be 100px and the second element will be 100px 50px 150px. As you can see, we don't have the same control over the layout using CSS columns. However, there is a way we can change the size of each column using the column-fill property. This property lets us define how wide a column should be and it can be used to make sure all the columns are the same width. In my demo, I've set the column-fill property to auto on all columns except for the second. The second column has a value of balance, which means that the column should be the same width as the other columns. This causes the second column to be the same width as the first and third columns, so they all have the same gradient. If you're still confused about the differences between block and column layout, I've created a demo that shows how each of the layout methods work. Layout isn't the only thing that affects how CSS is rendered. There are a number of other factors, including cascading, specificity and inheritance, and they can all cause CSS to output the wrong result. The reason CSS cascading can cause problems is because it can change the value of a CSS property. Let's look at a simple example.",0,584
"Researchers at MIT have created a rechargeable lithium-ion battery in the form of a 460-foot-long fiber. The batteries can be manufactured to arbitrarily long lengths. They can be 3D-printed into the shapes of hairs or other fiber-like structures, which can then be embedded into textiles for use in clothing, toys, and other applications. In a paper published in Nature Energy, the team describes a fiber made from a continuous core of electrodes, which are surrounded by a solid electrolyte. The core is made of two carbon nanotubes; one positively charged, the other negatively. The core is coated in a conductive polymer, which is surrounded by an insulating polymer coating that also acts as a solid electrolyte. The electrodes, which are separated by a nanometer-thick polymer layer, are too far apart to exchange ions, so the battery is not in a charged state. When the fiber is placed in an electrolyte solution, ions migrate through the solid electrolyte and set up an electrochemical reaction between the electrodes. In the experiments the researchers wound the fiber into a yarn-like structure and sewed it into a fabric. When this fabric was placed in an electrolyte solution, the fiber was charged by the migration of ions. The researchers found that this charge was stable over time, although it gradually decreased over the course of several days. This is a limitation that could be overcome by improving the quality of the electrolyte coating or designing a better electrode, says the team. The team is also working on improving the performance of the battery, including increasing its charging rate and its capacity for storing charge. These rechargeable batteries can be made into long, thin fibers that could be woven into fabrics.

"The International Space Station is supposed to retire in 2024, though that date will probably be pushed back to 2030. It is slowly leaking air and getting increasingly expensive to maintain. A commercial space station is a real possibility, and NASA is open to it, but it is not a given. NASA's initial estimates were that the International Space Station would cost 8 billion to build and maintain. That number ended up being off by a factor of four. It cost 35 billion to get the ISS into orbit. That is about 60 billion in today's money. In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope, an amazing piece of space technology, cost 1.5 billion in 1990, or about 2.9 billion in today's dollars. The International Space Station is one of the greatest human achievements. It is a testament to our engineering and technological prowess. But like any home it needs maintenance and upkeep. Even with the best maintenance, things break and need to be fixed. Space walks are the most expensive type of repairs. It takes astronauts about 300 hours to prepare for a space walk. Two astronauts spent 22 hours installing a replacement coolant pump on the ISS in 2010. This repair cost an estimated 110 million. One of the major costs of maintaining the ISS is sending things up in rockets. A rocket launch costs around 200 million. These rockets need to be sent up periodically to supply the station with food, water, and other necessities. The International Space Station will need to be de-orbited and destroyed when it is no longer useful. Currently, the ISS orbits 240 miles above the Earth's surface. De-orbiting it will be an expensive task that will take a lot of time and resources. The International Space Station is a modern marvel. It has been in operation since 1998 and has been visited by over 200 astronauts from 15 different countries. It has been used as a space observatory, a space laboratory, and a space hotel. It has allowed us to perform experiments in microgravity and observe our home from a vantage point that was previously unimaginable. But the International Space Station is an old space station. And like all old homes, it requires a lot of maintenance. It is expensive to keep up. The United States alone spends about 3 to 4 billion per year on the International Space Station. That is a lot of money for a country with over 21 trillion in debt. In this article, we will explore some of the costs of maintaining the International Space Station. We will also explore whether it is worth continuing to use the space station or whether it is time to de-orbit it and replace it with a new space station. The International Space Station was first imagined in 1984. It was the result of a collaboration between the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and the European Space Agency. The space station would be an international scientific laboratory. It would allow astronauts from different countries to live and work together in space. In the beginning, the International Space Station was envisioned as a much smaller space station. It was supposed to cost 8 billion to build and maintain over 10 years. The projected cost of the space station ballooned to 35 billion by 1993, the year the first component was launched. The United States agreed to pay for 25 billion of the cost. This was a pretty penny considering the United States had a budget deficit of about 300 billion that year. The International Space Station had a rough beginning. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster of 1986, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster of 2003 all threatened to derail the project. But the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, and 11 members of the European Space Agency remained committed to the space station. The International Space Station was constructed piece by piece over the course of a decade. It was launched in parts and assembled in space. Each component was launched into space by a Space Shuttle or a Russian Proton rocket. The first component was the Russian Zarya module. It was launched in November 1998. It was followed in December 1998 by the American Unity module. Over the next decade, more components were added to the International Space Station. The final component, the European-built Columbus module, was launched",0,586

"Public health officials have long been urging Americans to limit the consumption of red and processed meats due to its links with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Researchers have known for decades that the consumption of meat is linked to the risk of ill health. A 2010 study published in the journal Circulation calculated that eating two servings of red meat, processed meat, or poultry per week was associated with an increased risk of dying over a 20-year period. Red meat consumption was linked to 16 increase in the risk of death from cancer and a 21 increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. A 2013 study published in the British Journal of Cancer found that people eating about 76 grams of red and processed meat a day had a 20 increased risk of colorectal cancer compared to those who ate about 21 grams a day. A 2015 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism found that people who switched to a high-fat, high-protein diet for four days showed changes in their gut microbes, including a reduction in the diversity of microbes and an increase in the abundance of bacteria that are linked to obesity. A 2015 study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research found that red meat increased the levels of N-nitroso compounds in the human gut, which are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. A 2016 study published in the journal Microbiome found that the microbiomes of people eating a diet high in red meat differed significantly from those eating a diet high in grains, producing metabolites associated with heart disease, inflammation, and cancer. A 2017 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that each 100 gram increase in red meat consumption was associated with a 14 increase in cardiovascular disease risk and an 18 increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. A 2017 study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research found that red meat, in particular beef, increased the levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the blood. The study found that people eating a diet rich in red meat had triple the blood levels of TMAO compared to people eating a diet rich in either white meat or mostly plant-based foods. TMAO is a metabolite produced in the gut from nutrients found in red meat. TMAO is associated with increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and early death. A 2018 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism found that a diet high in red meat changed the microbial composition of the gut to one associated with increased heart disease. A 2018 study published in the journal Molecular Metabolism found that long-term consumption of a diet high in red meat triggered a biological process that caused the intestines to become leaky, allowing the bacteria in the gut to enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammation. A 2019 study published in the journal Nature found that a diet rich in red meat can trigger a pathway associated with cancer. The study found that a diet rich in red meat can turn up a chemical pathway in the body that is linked to the development of inflammation and cancer. A 2019 study published in the journal Gut found that a diet high in red meat led to an increase in the levels of TMAO in the gut. A 2019 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism found that a long-term diet high in red meat can increase the risk of heart disease by triggering chronic inflammation. The study found that a diet high in red meat led to a gut microbiome that produced trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) which triggered chronic inflammation and caused heart disease. The study found that gut bacteria produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) when digesting nutrients from red meat. TMAO causes chronic inflammation in the arteries, which leads to heart disease. A 2019 study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that a diet high in red meat changes the composition of gut bacteria which leads to heart disease. The study found that a diet high in red meat led to the growth of certain gut bacteria which digest carnitine, a nutrient",0,590

"Iberospinus natarioi, a newly identified 8-meter-long predatory dinosaur, represents a new genus and species of spinosaurid, a group that includes the Spinosaurus. An analysis of the spinosaurid's jaws found that it belonged to the most complete dinosaur skull yet found in Europe. The skull, which was discovered in Portugal in 1999, is being presented in the journal Cretaceous Research. The fossil was embedded in the rock of the Guimarota mine, a large-scale open pit coal mine. Since its discovery, the fossil has been studied and prepared by researchers in Portugal and Spain. Spinosaurids were a group of large carnivorous dinosaurs that first appeared about 170 million years ago and were extinct by about 90 million years ago. They had distinctive skulls, with long snouts and sharp teeth, and were adapted to eat fish and other aquatic animals. The group includes some of the longest predatory dinosaurs known to science. Spinosaurid fossils have been found in Europe, North Africa and South America. Iberospinus is the second spinosaurid found in Europe, and the second in Portugal. It is the first known dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Iberia, a region of the Iberian Peninsula. It lived about 150 million years ago. The fossil is the most complete dinosaur skull found in Europe and has a number of unique characteristics. One of the most striking is the presence of a long spike-like snout. The snout is long and narrow, with a long skull that is similar to the skull of other spinosaurids. The researchers identified three key features that led to the classification of the fossil as a new species. It has three skull openings - a large one in the middle of the skull and two others near the tip of the snout. The fossil also shows that the skull was covered with a thick layer of bone. The features are distinct from other spinosaurids. The researchers also discovered that the new species has a number of unique features in the skull bones that are found in other spinosaurids. These features may have helped the spinosaurid to catch and consume its prey. The fossil, which was found in the Late Jurassic strata, suggests that this dinosaur lived alongside a diverse group of dinosaurs, including the giant herbivorous dinosaurs called diplodocids. The fossil was discovered in the Guimarota mine, a large-scale open pit coal mine. The mine, which is located in the Leiria District in central Portugal, is an area rich in dinosaur fossils. In 2001, researchers reported that they had discovered an 8-inch (20-centimeter) claw from a theropod dinosaur in the Guimarota mine. The theropod, which was later named Baryonyx galae, lived about 130 million years ago. It was the first dinosaur discovered in the mine. A second dinosaur, Alocodon kuehnei, was discovered in 2002. It also lived about 130 million years ago. In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of two new species of dinosaurs in the mine. They included an unusual plant-eating dinosaur and a theropod dinosaur. The new fossils were described in the scientific journal PLOS ONE. Both fossils are from the Jurassic period, which lasted from 200 million to 145 million years ago. The plant-eating dinosaur was a member of a group known as diplodocoids, which includes sauropods like Diplodocus and Brontosaurus. The theropod was a member of the Allosaurus family.",0,595

"Scientists from the University of California San Diego have developed a method to create neurons. The technique is able to convert astrocytes, the supporting cells in the brain, into neurons, and they are able to transmit electrical signals. The researchers were able to induce the astrocytes to transform into neurons by introducing the protein NeuroD1 and a small-molecule cocktail. The cells then also started to form connections with neighboring cells. The researchers said they were able to convert 70 of astrocytes into functional neurons by using the technique. The researchers believe this method could be used to generate new neurons to repair the brain in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as in brain injuries and stroke. ""The most significant advantage of the new technique is that it works in the adult brain, is non-toxic and can be administered through a simple intravenous injection,"" co-author Dr. Alexandra Joyner, professor in the Department of Medicine and the Institute for Genomic Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine said in a press release.

"Daniel Wang, a professor of astronomy, has stitched together hundreds of images to create a panorama of the center of the Milky Way. The resulting map captures some of the best images of the galaxy ever created. With the help of a dozen of the world's most advanced radio telescopes, Daniel Wang, a professor of astronomy at UCLA, has created the highest-resolution map ever produced of the Milky Way's center. The map, which stitches together hundreds of individual images, contains roughly 1,000 individual objects, including massive star clusters, stellar nurseries and even a supernova remnant. It's a testament to the capabilities of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, or ALMA, which, as its name suggests, is a large radio telescope array located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The array, which is composed of 66 antennas, operates at wavelengths ranging from 0.3 to 3.6 millimeters. It's also a testament to Wang's dedication to the project. It took him years to assemble the images for the map, in part because ALMA has been under construction in phases since 2003 and didn't begin operating until 2011. Since then, ALMA has given astronomers unprecedented views of the center of the galaxy, a region that lies some 25,000 light-years from Earth. The map represents a portion of the galaxy about 600 light-years across, or roughly 2 percent of the entire Milky Way. The galaxy's central region is bustling with activity. It contains a supermassive black hole that is 4 million times more massive than the sun, and an array of hot, ionized gas clouds known as the circumnuclear disk. These gas clouds feed material into the black hole. The circumnuclear disk is also home to a large population of massive young stars that are rapidly burning themselves out and producing strong stellar winds. The intense radiation from these stars pushes the gas outward, creating large cavities in the disk. In the map, these hot stars appear as bright spots, while the dusty filaments, which are cold, appear as dark lines. The dark band near the center of the map is a cloud of cold molecular gas that is collapsing under gravity to form new stars. The circumnuclear disk is also home to the Arches Cluster, one of the densest clusters of young stars in the galaxy. The cluster, which is only 2.5 light-years across, contains more than 100 massive young stars that are less than 2 million years old. It's an exotic, hostile environment, with intense ultraviolet radiation and extreme stellar winds. ""In the scale of the galaxy, the Arches Cluster is very close to the supermassive black hole, which is really exciting for us because we can study the interaction between the two,"" Wang said. The map also reveals two arcs of gas that appear to be streaming away from the galactic center. One of the most interesting features in the map is a supernova remnant near the bottom of the image. A supernova remnant is the glowing debris of a massive star that has exploded at the end of its life. The supernova remnant in the map, known as Sagittarius A East, is the oldest one ever discovered in the galaxy. ""This supernova remnant is an extremely energetic object - it's like a small version of the Crab Nebula, but many times more powerful,"" Wang said. The Crab Nebula, which lies 6,500 light-years from Earth, is the remnant of a supernova that was observed in the year 1054. Wang's map will be an important tool for astronomers who study star formation in the center of the galaxy, he said. The map will also help astronomers who study the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, he said. The research is published in the journal Astrophysical Journal. One of the biggest challenges Wang faced in producing the map was assembling the data from ALMA's 66 radio antennas, which are up to 12 miles apart. Because the antennas are so far apart, the images from each one are slightly different. ""We had to find a very clever way of stitching them all together,"" he said. ""It's like taking a",0,602
"Jack Ma has been absent from public view for the past two months. His last public appearance was in late October, where he blasted China's regulatory system.

"Amazon recently unveiled a brand called'Made for You' that makes custom-fitted clothes. Its first product is a 25 custom t-shirt. The process starts with the user inputting body dimension data and then answering a short questionnaire. Once Amazon has that information, it compares it to a database of body measurements and uses a proprietary algorithm to find the closest fit. The t-shirt is made of 65 polyester35 cotton. The fabric is made in Los Angeles and the shirts are assembled in Kentucky. The company is offering free returns and exchanges if the fit isn't quite right. Amazon isn't stopping with t-shirts. It plans to expand the service to other categories, including women's, children's, and even athletic apparel. I can see this being a big hit with consumers. I've certainly felt the frustration of ill-fitting clothes. I think the biggest drawback will be cost. If it's not very competitive, people will probably just continue to buy their t-shirts off the rack. What do you think of this new service? Do you think you'd use it? Sounds like a great idea to me. My husband is 6'4"" and it's hard to find pants that fit. I think this is a great idea, especially since I have a hard time finding clothes that fit. I would definitely give it a try. I think this is an awesome idea. I have a hard time finding t-shirts that fit. I'm a big girl, so I know that I'll never be able to go in the store and buy them off the rack. I think this is something I would really consider doing. I think it is a great idea and I would definitely use it. My husband is tall and slim and it is hard to find clothes that fit. I think it sounds really cool. I don't know if I'd use it, but I think it's a great idea. I do think this is a great idea for people who cannot find clothing that fits. I think it is a great idea.

"Vince Ramos was the owner of Phantom Secure, a company that customized BlackBerry phones to make ordinary wiretaps impossible. Phantom was started in 2008 as Ramos saw a need to help people protect themselves from surveillance, which he felt was a violation of their privacy. By modifying BlackBerry devices, he and his company helped others maintain their privacy while communicating through emails and text messages. Throughout its years of operation, Phantom Secure attracted customers from all over the world, from business executives to diplomats to heads of state. But, in 2016, Ramos was arrested and charged with conspiring to aid and abet international drug trafficking organizations and with conspiracy to engage in money laundering. The US government prosecutors accused him of modifying BlackBerry devices to make them harder to wiretap and then selling those devices to drug cartels. The charges were the result of a four-year investigation by the FBI. Ramos denied the allegations against him and his company. He said that he didn't know any of his customers' crimes. He felt that the government was targeting him to please their allies in Canada. Ramos was convicted of racketeering in a US federal court in 2018. He is serving a sentence of 12 years in prison.",0,607
"Droidlet is a platform for building intelligent agents that simplifies integrating a wide range of machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid prototyping. It can be used to quickly test out new ideas or build a fully fledged agent. An agent is a program that acts in an environment. It can perceive the environment and act upon it. The actions can be as simple as moving to a different location or as complex as playing a board game. We think of an agent as a brain in a robot. This brain can be used in many different robots, from a little robot in a computer game to a real robot in the real world. The brain can be connected to the robot's sensors and actuators and thus observe its environment and act upon it. Droidlet aims to provide a platform for creating intelligent agents that is easy to use and allows for rapid prototyping. Droidlet is inspired by and based on the OpenAI Gym framework. Droidlet consists of the following components: The environment is a module that simulates a robot's sensors and actuators. An agent is a module that implements a controller for the environment. It observes the environment through the sensors and acts upon it through the actuators. A task is a module that controls the environment and the agent. It provides a goal for the agent and evaluates its performance. To help you get started we provide several sample environments, agents and tasks. The samples are available from the droidlet-samples repository. Please note that the documentation in this repository is incomplete and outdated. For more information, see the full documentation. To help you get started we provide the following tutorials: Tutorial 1: Introduction to Droidlet Tutorial 2: Reinforcement Learning with Droidlet Tutorial 3: Neural Networks with Droidlet We provide a number of sample agents. Each sample is in its own repository and includes a README with an explanation of how the sample works. To get started, clone the sample repository and read the README. Many of the samples include a unit test that will be run automatically by Travis CI when you push a new commit. If you are interested in contributing to the samples, we recommend that you start with one of these samples. Droidlet is written in Python 3.6 and makes use of the following packages: numpy (v1.14.5) six (v1.10.0) requests (v2.18.4) gym (v0.8.0) joblib (v0.11.0) pygame (v1.9.5) colorama (v0.4.1) All modules are available as PyPI packages and can be installed with pip. If you want to run the unit tests you will also need to install pytest. To run Droidlet from a virtualenv, activate the environment and then run one of the following commands: python -m droidlet.examples.tutorials.tutorial1 This will run the first tutorial, a simple example of reinforcement learning. You can run the individual agents using: python -m droidlet.agents.agent1 This will run the first agent, a simple agent that moves around in the environment and avoids walls. You can run the individual tasks using: python -m droidlet.tasks.task1 This will run the first task, a simple task in which the agent is rewarded for moving to the center of the environment. Droidlet is released under the MIT license. Droidlet was developed by Brian Fabella and Johannes Faulhammer. We would like to thank the following people for their valuable contributions: Christian Beck. Tobias Rudolph. Reinhard Heckel. Sebastian Rudolph. Copyright (c) 2017 Brian Fabella.",0,608
"Google is planning to launch a high-end version of its Pixel Buds. The Pixel Buds Pro will come in four colors and will likely feature Adaptive Sound, a feature that's a part of the Pixel 4's Motion Sense feature. The news was reported by 9to5Google, which says that it's heard the rumor from multiple sources. The publication also has a few mock-ups of the headphones that give us an idea of what to expect. The Pixel Buds Pro are expected to come in four colors black, white, dark grey, and light mint green. The site also claims that the headphones will feature a similar design as that of the original Pixel Buds, but will have a modified earbud shape. The Pixel Buds Pro will have a multi-function button on the outer side of the earbud, similar to what we've seen on other AirPods-like headphones. The Pixel Buds Pro are also expected to be fitted with Active Noise Cancellation and Adaptive Sound technology. The latter, as we saw at Google's hardware launch event, is a part of the Motion Sense feature on the Pixel 4. Adaptive Sound can detect when the user is talking to someone and automatically lower the volume of the music or podcast that the user is listening to. It will also resume playing music at the same volume when the user stops talking. It's likely that the Pixel Buds Pro will be launched alongside the Pixel 4, which is expected to be unveiled on October 15. The headphones will likely be priced at 200, which is 100 more expensive than the original Pixel Buds.

"Zoom has bought security start-up Keybase, which will allow it to implement end-to-end encryption in its meetings. Users will not be able to call into encrypted meetings via phone, and will need to be using Zoom Meetings or Keybase's desktop software. Keybase's smartphone app will continue to be available, but will only allow users to send and receive encrypted messages. Keybase's 30-person team will join Zoom. Keybase has just received a lot of cash to help grow its service. The company, which offers encrypted messaging and file sharing, was acquired by Zoom on Friday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but CEO Max Krohn told CNET that the acquisition would allow the service to grow faster. ""It was not an easy decision to sell, but ultimately we wanted to execute on the vision of bringing encryption to the masses and we thought this was the best way to do it,"" Krohn said. Keybase allows people to use encryption without needing to be technically savvy. The service uses a phone number as a user's public identifier, and people can then share files and chat securely. ""We're going to be able to invest a lot more in building out the vision of the service,"" Krohn said. The company was founded in 2014 by Chris Coyne and Nathaniel Popper, and is based in New York. Krohn said that all 30 employees, including Coyne, will move to San Jose, California, where Zoom is based.",0,611
"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be end-to-end encrypted, meaning that Facebook and even the government won't be able to read your messages, unless of course you want them to. In an open letter to Facebook users, Zuckerberg detailed the plan to build a unified ""privacy-focused"" messaging platform that will be powered by Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. The platforms will continue to be separate apps, but their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified. The ultimate goal, Zuckerberg says, is to develop a ""simple, fast, reliable and private"" platform that people can use for secure communication. The shift to encryption, Zuckerberg said, will be a ""positive force in the world"" by preventing abuse and by building a space where people can share information securely. Zuckerberg says that his company has been working on this plan for the last six years, and the company is investing tens of billions of dollars to make it a reality. He says that the shift will allow the company to compete with the ""E2E"" messaging platforms that have become popular in countries where WhatsApp isn't dominant. ""People want to know their data is secure, and they want to be able to communicate privately,"" Zuckerberg writes. ""We're working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks."" Zuckerberg says that this means Facebook will need to rebuild its business around encryption. He says this means that it will be harder to prevent harmful content from spreading, and harder for governments to keep track of illegal activity. He says that Facebook will work with law enforcement to address these concerns, and that it will build its own systems for detecting harmful content, but that the trade-offs are worth it. Zuckerberg acknowledges that Facebook has been a bit of a pariah in recent years, and says that the company is taking steps to change its image. He says that Facebook is now working to rebuild its reputation. ""I understand that many people don't think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform - because frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services,"" he writes, ""and we've historically focused on tools for more open sharing."" He says that Facebook has been thinking about these privacy issues for ""a long time,"" and that it's been working on these plans since before the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit last year. Zuckerberg says that Facebook will still provide some useful services to advertisers, but that these services will be limited to targeting and measurement. Facebook won't be able to provide them with access to user data, he says. ""I understand that many people don't think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform - because frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services"" He added: ""We're building a foundation for social communication aligned with the direction people increasingly care about: messaging each other privately in encrypted services."" Zuckerberg says that Facebook will be holding discussions and debates about the future of the internet over the coming months, and that he hopes to ""work through"" the various issues that the company's new vision will raise. ""I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever,"" Zuckerberg writes. ""This is the future I hope we will help bring about.""",0,612

"All art establishments are concerned with the degradation of paintings. Harmful factors such as sunlight, moisture, and certain volatile organic compounds can accelerate degradation. Graphene may be the solution to this problem. Graphene, which is a one-atom thick sheet of carbon, has been found to have many potential uses. One of its lesser known properties is its ability to protect objects from harmful UV rays, moisture, and volatile organic compounds. This ability has not yet been used to protect paintings from degradation, but it is highly possible that it could be used in the future. Graphene's ability to protect paintings from degradation has not yet been tested. The article on graphene and its potential use to protect paintings is found here.

"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with it, including the LAPD. Well, this morning, the LAPD announced that it's no longer using PredPol, and that it never really used it in the first place. The press conference was called to clear up confusion following a Wired article that claimed that the LAPD's use of PredPol had, in fact, led to an overall decrease in crime. The LAPD's senior lead officer for predictive policing, Sean Malinowski, did not dispute the Wired article's claim that PredPol had led to an overall decrease in crime. But he did dispute the implication that it was PredPol itself that had led to the decrease. ""Predictive policing is not a software program. It is not an algorithm,"" Malinowski said. ""Predictive policing is a philosophy, an idea."" Malinowski said that PredPol's algorithm did not, in fact, inform LAPD officers where to go or what to do on patrol. Instead, the algorithm merely told them where to focus their attention. The algorithm did not actually make any decisions about where officers should go, nor did it ever guide an officer to a specific location, he said. The purpose of the algorithm is to help officers focus their attention on specific areas that are likely to be crime hotspots. It's up to the officers to decide how to police those hotspots, Malinowski said. In fact, Malinowski said that a lot of the time, officers may not even use the software at all, if they're busy with other things. ""You don't have to use PredPol,"" Malinowski said. ""You don't have to use it if you don't want to."" PredPol, he said, was merely another tool in the toolbox. It's the latest in a series of setbacks for PredPol and other predictive policing technologies. Last month, the Santa Cruz Police Department in California announced that it was suspending its use of PredPol, following a scathing report by the ACLU. The ACLU had found that the predictive policing software was disproportionately targeting low-income, minority communities for police patrols. Similarly, a recent ProPublica investigation also found that the predictive policing software used by the Chicago PD disproportionately targeted black communities. The ACLU is also currently fighting a lawsuit against the New York Police Department, challenging the constitutionality of its predictive policing program.",0,615

"Alibaba, known for its e-commerce platforms, has branched out into retail, restaurants, and even hotels. It has opened a hotel near its headquarters in Hangzhuo where almost everything is automated. The hotel was developed in only 90 days. The hotel uses facial recognition technology for many services, and the company has plans to expand its smart hotel model into a chain. While this is a 1-of-a-kind example, it does highlight the importance of integration across the board for a seamless guest experience. Just like the hotel, operators in the restaurant and retail sector are looking at ways to make it easier for customers to order and pay for items. This is evident in the growing trend for mobile ordering and payment. According to Statista, mobile ordering will grow by 57 in 2019. McDonald's and Chipotle have been early adopters of this technology, allowing customers to order from their mobile devices and skip the line. In addition, 55 of consumers said they would pay more for a better customer experience. The key for mobile ordering is to give customers a seamless experience that is fast, easy, and intuitive. That's where a skilled integration partner comes in. An integration partner should be able to provide a seamless, frictionless mobile ordering system. It should be easy to use and work in concert with other systems, such as the POS system, to provide a complete ordering and payment experience. Technology is also changing how customers interact with their favorite brands. One big change is the growth of social media. Customers now use Twitter and Facebook to not only communicate with friends and family, but also to get news and share information. Restaurant and retail operators are using social media to reach out to customers and offer specials, promotions, and discounts. Savvy restaurant and retail operators are using social media to learn more about customers and reach out to them. A good integration partner will be able to incorporate social media platforms into the customer experience. Social media can be integrated into the website, mobile app, or even the in-store ordering system to make it easier for customers to order and pay. In addition, the integration partner will be able to incorporate loyalty programs so customers can receive rewards and special offers.

"Last year, SpaceX bought two oil rigs off the coast of Texas to convert them into ocean spaceports. One of the rigs, Phobus, has been moved to Pascagoula, Mississippi, where SpaceX will begin construction on the first stage of the rig's conversion. The plans are now official, as the state port authority has signed off on a lease for the oil rig. The 14,000-ton rig will be docked near SpaceX's commercial spaceport, where the company already plans to launch Falcon 9 rockets carrying commercial satellites into orbit. The first stage of construction will cost SpaceX 200 million and create an estimated 350 jobs, and that's just for the conversion of the rig. That money will go to the construction of a hangar to store and repair equipment, including the rocket stages. The company also plans to launch as many as 12 Falcon 9 rockets per year from the facility, which would require 50 employees just to operate. The rigs will only serve as landing platforms for the rocket stages. The rocket will launch from a nearby spaceport, and the first stage will autonomously guide itself to the landing platform to be refurbished for the next launch. Ultimately, SpaceX plans to land and reuse every rocket it launches. This will dramatically reduce the cost of launching payloads into space, which is currently around 60 million per launch. SpaceX also plans to build a similar landing platform on the west coast of the United States, and in the Atlantic Ocean as well.",0,618

"Twitter's board intends to enforce Elon Musk's merger agreement. Musk had agreed to a transaction at 54.20 per share, but put the deal on hold pending proof that less than 10 percent of Saudi Arabia's wealth would be required to close the deal. Twitter board members want Elon Musk to pay up if his plans to take the company private fall through. Citing anonymous sources, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Twitter's board wants Musk to go ahead with the deal he proposed last week to take the company private at 420 a share. It also wants Musk to pay the penalty if he fails to close the deal, which would amount to about 50 million of his own money. Musk put the plans to take Twitter private on hold last week pending proof that less than 10 percent of Saudi Arabia's wealth would be required to close the deal. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund has invested 3.5 billion into Uber, and Musk had hoped it would do the same with Twitter. But Musk, who owns nearly 20 percent of the company, agreed to a transaction at 54.20 per share, and the company is said to be preparing to enforce the merger agreement. The board's decision to move ahead with the deal comes as Musk is facing criticism over his management of Tesla. The electric car maker's shares have dropped 21 percent this year, and the company is grappling with production delays and other issues.

"A Windows zero-day exploit tool was stolen from the NSA's Equation Group by Chinese threat actors, who used the tool for years before the flaw was patched. A hacking group known as the Equation Group was exposed in 2015 by the security firm Kaspersky Lab. The group is believed to have ties to the United States National Security Agency (NSA). The group used a Windows zero-day exploit, which gave it a 100 success rate when it came to the remote execution of malicious code on target computers. The security firm Symantec was able to trace the Equation Group's activity back to 2006. The exploit that the group used was called EternalBlue. In April 2017, a group called the Shadow Brokers released the exploit to the public, who were quick to begin using it. The EternalBlue exploit was used in the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. Once the exploit was released, Microsoft released a patch for it. Following the WannaCry attack, which infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, the NSA issued a rare statement. ""The NSA seeks to discover and advance knowledge in the field of cybersecurity, not to enable malicious attacks,"" the NSA wrote. ""Releasing exploits for malware vulnerabilities under responsible disclosure principles helps to secure the Internet. The] NSA shares [its] vulnerabilities with other vendors and with US government partners. The exploit was stolen from NSA, and [the] NSA has not and will not confirm the identity of [the] party that stole it."" The NSA did not claim responsibility for the EternalBlue exploit, but the firm was widely believed to be behind it. The agency did say that it would share more vulnerabilities in the future and would disclose them to software vendors, who would then be able to patch them. The Shadow Brokers, who released the EternalBlue exploit, did not respond to requests for comment from the media. A Russian cyber security firm, Kaspersky Lab, announced that it had discovered a new and mysterious hacking group that was targeting military and diplomatic agencies around the world. The group was named the Equation Group and was found to have links to the NSA. Kaspersky said that the group had been around since 2001 and operated mainly in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, Mali, and other countries in Africa and the Middle East. The company said that the Equation Group could have been behind a 2010 attack on the Iranian nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The attack was discovered in 2010 by researchers at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Kaspersky believes that the Equation Group had ties to the NSA. The group is believed to have used a zero-day exploit called EternalBlue to break into target computers. The NSA was not specifically named by Kaspersky, but there was enough evidence to point to the agency. The group was able to infect the firmware of hard drives manufactured by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba, and other top manufacturers. The infected firmware was able to give the Equation Group remote access to the computer at all times. The group was also able to infect USB drives. Once the USB drive was inserted into a computer, the group was able to gain remote access to the computer. The group also used a tool called DoublePulsar, which was used to inject and execute malicious code on a computer. Kaspersky discovered the Equation Group's tools while investigating a hacking campaign against hotels in Asia. The group was using a malicious worm that was found to have links to the Stuxnet worm, which was used to attack Iran's nuclear program in 2009 and 2010. The Equation Group also used two zero-day exploits that were known as EternalBlue and EternalSynergy. The first exploit was used to gain access to computers through Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) service. The second exploit was used to spread the infection across local networks. Kaspersky said that the group had infected more than 500 computers in 42 countries, including Iran, Russia, and Pakistan. The group's tools were stolen by a group of unknown hack",0,622
"SVGs have become popular due to their scalability, flexibility, and how lightweight they are. This article takes a look at SVG techniques such as SVG grids, fractional SVG stars, masks, and animation. SVG is no longer just a way to put pretty vector graphics on your website, with most modern browsers supporting all of SVG's advanced features, it has become a tool that can be used to create web pages that are beautiful, usable, performant, and accessible. In this article, we are going to look at some of the latest SVG techniques that we can use to push SVGs to their limits. Let's start by looking at SVG grids. It is important that we design for different screen sizes, so if we are using SVGs as background images, it is important that we design the SVG to scale with different viewports. I am going to start by creating a simple grid SVG in Sketch using the rectangle tool. Once I have my rectangles, I am going to export them as an SVG. The SVG will be exported with a viewBox that defines the aspect ratio of the SVG. The SVG will scale if the viewBox is changed, so if we want to change the aspect ratio, we need to change the viewBox. To make sure the SVG scales with the viewport, we need to make sure that we remove the viewBox. SVGs have a lot of advanced features such as masks, clipping paths, filters, and more. A lot of these features can be combined to create advanced effects. Let's take a look at some examples. SVGs can be clipped to different shapes, making them only visible in the clipped areas. Let's say we want to add a circle in the middle of our image. We can use a clipPath to clip our image to a circle. It is also possible to clip multiple elements to different shapes. SVGs can also have text applied to them. SVG text has a lot of different features, such as fonts, alignment, and justification. If we want our text to be only visible in a certain area, we can use a mask to only show the text in that area. You can also have an SVG with multiple masks. With some CSS, we can change the text to make it more readable. There are many filters that we can apply to an SVG. Let's take a look at some examples. SVGs are also very useful for creating interesting overlays. We can use SVGs to create a circle. SVGs can also be used to create interesting shapes. We can use a path to create a star. These stars can then be animated using CSS. SVGs are also useful for creating animations that are lightweight and performant. We can create animations by adding more paths to the SVG. The animation can then be triggered by adding a class to the SVG. SVGs are a great tool for creating performant and scalable websites. They can be used for creating background images and overlays, and can be used to create beautiful animations.",0,623

"The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (Star) is the first robotic system to plan, adapt, and execute a surgical plan in soft tissue with minimal human intervention. It recently performed laparoscopic surgery on a live pig, completing a series of complex steps with no human assistance. Laparoscopy is a type of surgery where a small incision is made in the abdomen. A scope and other tools are then used to perform the procedure. It is also known as minimally invasive or keyhole surgery. In the Star system, a surgeon defines a surgical plan, which is turned into a computerized, three-dimensional model. An automated arm then performs the surgery while a computer guides and monitors the procedure. Star uses machine learning and advanced computer vision techniques to enable it to make decisions and perform tasks during a surgical procedure. It also uses MRI and ultrasound imaging to provide data about the surgical site. Star is one of the first surgical robots that can be used for soft-tissue procedures, such as a gall bladder removal or hernia repair. Previous robots have focused on removing organs and tissue from the body. Dipan J. Shah, a clinical lecturer in the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan, and a collaborator on the Star project, says that current robots can be used for organ-removal procedures, such as a prostatectomy or partial kidney removal, but are not suitable for soft-tissue surgery. Star is the first robot to use a combination of suturing, cutting, and grasping to achieve a single surgical task. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot is the culmination of a decade of work by a group of researchers at Children's National Health System and the University of Maryland in the United States. Most of the equipment used in Star is off the shelf. The robotic arm was originally built for the military, and the instruments and sutures are common in surgical procedures. Star has two different modes of operation. It can either perform a surgical task autonomously, or it can be guided by the surgeon. In both cases, the surgeon can intervene at any time during the procedure. The researchers used an algorithm that teaches the robotic system how to perform surgical steps in the right order. It can also detect when a task is not performed correctly, and then make adjustments to correct the mistake. The algorithm is based on a set of instructions for each surgical step. The robot knows the ideal steps for each procedure, and it can detect when one step is out of place and make adjustments to carry out the task correctly. So far, the researchers have used the robot to perform three laparoscopic procedures on live pigs. In the first surgical procedure, the researchers did not use Star at all. Instead, a surgeon performed the surgery from start to finish. The robot recorded the surgical steps, which were used to teach the robot how to perform the surgery. In the second surgery, the robot performed two of the three surgical steps with no human intervention. The surgeon then performed the final step. The third surgical procedure was performed entirely by the robot. The researchers monitored the robot, and a surgeon was prepared to intervene if necessary. However, the robot was able to perform the surgery from start to finish without any assistance. The researchers behind Star believe that it is only a matter of time before robots perform surgical procedures without any human intervention. The ultimate goal is to develop an autonomous system that can perform a wide range of surgical procedures. In the meantime, Shah and his team are continuing to work on the project, focusing on improving the safety of the robot and optimizing the software.

"Masten Space Systems will develop a lunar navigation and positioning system similar to GPS as part of a contract awarded through the Air Force Research Laboratory's AFWERX program. Current spacecraft navigation systems are centrally controlled by a single ground station, and so cannot operate in real time and are incapable of detecting and correcting their own errors. Masten's project will improve on this by developing a new navigation system that can be used onboard a spacecraft and can correct its own errors on a real-time basis, potentially reducing mission errors by 500 times. Masten has already started working on the first phase of the AFWERX contract, which includes a study to identify and evaluate various technologies for the onboard navigation system. The company will design the system architecture and develop navigation algorithms to be used during the project's second phase.

"Scientists have observed electrical activity similar to the brain activity of premature babies in lab-grown brains. The lab-grown brains are simplified versions of the organ that is grown in a dish from stem cells. Scientists made stem cells from the skin of adults and then turned them into neurons. The neurons were placed in a dish to grow and form a brain-like structure. The researchers observed a spontaneous electrical activity in the neurons. The spontaneous electrical activity was seen even though the organoids did not have a synapse, which is a specialized structure of the neuron that permits transmission of electrical or chemical signals from one neuron to another. The spontaneous electrical activity lasted for approximately 25 days. The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature. The researchers also observed spontaneous activity in the brains of premature babies. The brain activity was observed in the brains of premature babies that were born at less than 29 weeks. The babies were monitored for 12 months after their birth. The researchers observed a similarity between the spontaneous brain activity of the organoid and the premature babies. ""The similarities that we observe between our cultures and the developing human brain are intriguing and represent an important step in our understanding of human brain development,"" said senior author Dr. Alysson Muotri, associate professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine departments of Pediatrics and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, in a news release. ""We are excited to follow up on this study and explore its clinical implications. The generation of human cortical organoids is a new and promising avenue to study human brain development and neurological disease using a combination of genetics, stem cells and modeling,"" added Muotri. The researchers also noted that there are limitations to the study. The organoid did not have all of the structures of a human brain. The organoid also lacks a blood supply, which is important for the brain's development. The researchers also noted that the electrical activity was seen in premature babies who were born at less than 29 weeks. The babies that were born at 29 weeks did not display this activity. ""It was striking to see the similarity in spontaneous electrical activity between the organoids and the human brain,"" said Dr. Muotri. ""This suggests that organoids can provide a good model to study human brain development. Moreover, our work establishes that we can mimic brain activity in a dish with this method.""

"A quantum effect called superabsorption allows a collection of molecules to absorb light more efficiently than if each molecule were acting individually. Researchers have used this phenomenon to create a new type of laser based on an array of molecules on a surface. The molecular laser was created by Roberto Morandotti of INRS-Universite du Quebec, Canada, and colleagues, and uses a large number of organic molecules embedded in a semiconductor matrix. The researchers used the new laser to create a hologram by recording the interference pattern produced by an object and a reference beam. The molecular laser uses an array of organic molecules embedded in a semiconductor matrix. The team's results were published in the journal Nature Photonics. The laser uses an array of organic molecules, each of which acts as a subwavelength antenna. The molecules are arranged in a periodic fashion, and as a result they couple together. The coupling is based on resonant energy transfer between molecules and leads to superabsorption, which means that the molecules absorb more light than can be accounted for by the absorption of each molecule individually. The array of molecules coupled together is then placed next to a semiconductor matrix. The energy produced by the light absorption travels to the semiconductor, where it is converted into an electronic current and eventually emitted as light. The laser could be used in high-resolution microscopy to increase the magnification of optical imaging systems. It could also be used in optical data storage, with its holographic capabilities potentially enabling large data volumes to be stored in a small space. Molecular lasers could be used in optical data storage and holographic imaging. The team is now working on increasing the efficiency of the laser, which is currently around 0.1 percent. The laser could be used to produce images of molecules on surfaces, which could be useful in medical diagnostics. ""We are also working on the use of arrays of molecules for sensing, imaging and fundamental physics. The coupling of molecules to a solid-state environment provides unique and promising opportunities,"" said Morandotti.",0,630

"Project Amber is a project from Alphabet X that is now available for the mental health community to help build upon. The project originally aimed to identify a specific biomarker (a measurable indicator of a biological state) that correlates with depression. The researchers were particularly interested in markers that could be measured via smartphone sensors, such as heart rate, activity levels, or speech patterns. Now, Alphabet is open sourcing the tools it used to collect the data and develop the algorithms. In doing so, the company hopes that others will build on the research and help them understand what patterns could indicate depression in people. The tools include the app that was used to collect the data from participants, the web app for clinicians, and the data analysis pipeline that was used to process the data. The data collected in the study, which will remain private, is also available for download, and includes over 400,000 measurements collected from 94 participants. Each participant had a mood disorder and was asked to record their mood using a smartphone app. Participants then had their heart rate, activity, and audio recorded continuously over a period of 24 hours. Although the study didn't end up producing a biomarker for depression, the researchers discovered a number of interesting trends. They found, for instance, that the participants' mood and their activity levels were linked in some cases, but were different in others. Participants who suffered from bipolar disorder also tended to be more active than those with unipolar depression. The project also found that participants who reported low moods also had low levels of activity, which could indicate that passivity and avoidance behaviors are a marker for depression. This research is far from conclusive, but it could provide a starting point for other researchers to build upon and extend. The researchers hope that others will use the tools to reexamine the data and potentially identify patterns that they missed. The researchers also believe that more data from a larger, more diverse sample will be needed in order to develop a truly useful tool. The tools are available on GitHub for anyone to use.",0,633

"A study has demonstrated how the sight or smell of a meal can trigger an inflammatory response that guides insulin production. The findings reveal a molecular link between the nervous and immune systems and a possible new route for treating type 2 diabetes. The results also suggest that people who are not active, who are overweight or who overeat may be more likely to suffer from inflammation in their gut, which may in turn lead to insulin resistance, a common cause of type 2 diabetes. A team of researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Colorado led by Dr. Seth B. B. Nesathurai, now at the University of Michigan, worked together to show that the sight and smell of food can trigger an inflammatory response that guides insulin production. A molecule called GDF15 is known to regulate insulin production in the pancreas. However, what is less clear is how GDF15 in the bloodstream affects the brain and insulin production. In their paper, the researchers describe how they used a novel approach to look at the effect of GDF15 on insulin production. They used a mouse that had been genetically modified to lack the receptors that GDF15 binds to in the nervous system. This mouse does not show a normal response to GDF15 in the nervous system. The researchers found that the modified mice produced 22 less insulin than normal mice when fed by a tube for 3 hours. However, when the modified mice were allowed to eat and smell food, their insulin production returned to normal. The results suggest that the activity of GDF15 in the nervous system is an important factor in insulin regulation. The authors say that the findings also suggest that the sensory aspects of eating can trigger insulin production via GDF15. ""This is a whole new way of looking at insulin production. We've known for a long time that insulin production is regulated by the nervous system, but we didn't know exactly how. The findings show that GDF15 is a molecular link between the nervous and immune systems, and provide new targets for the treatment of insulin-related diseases. The authors suggest that drugs that inhibit GDF15 in the nervous system could be used to reduce insulin production in type 2 diabetes. ""It is always exciting when two completely different fields of research come together in an unexpected way,"" says Dr. Joseph Schofer, senior author of the study. ""We found that a molecule that has been studied extensively in the immune system is also important for regulation of the nervous system,"" he adds. In a video about the study, Dr. Nesathurai explains that the researchers have uncovered a molecular pathway that connects the nervous and immune systems, and that they are now working to see if the same pathway works in humans. In the meantime, people can protect themselves against inflammation by avoiding sugary, fatty foods, as well as high-carbohydrate foods such as refined grains. The researchers plan to continue investigating how GDF15 affects insulin production and insulin resistance, and how it may be involved in other diseases such as Alzheimer's and obesity. Medical News Today recently reported on a study suggesting that an insulin nasal spray may improve working memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",0,639
"The way a river flows, where the path splits up and breaks into smaller channels like the branches of a tree, is called branching flow. It has been observed in rivers all over the world, and was first studied in detail in the 1980s. At the time, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, developed a simple, one-dimensional model to explain the phenomenon. The model did not take into account the complicated three-dimensional geometry of the actual riverbed. Now, for the first time, physicists from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware have developed a three-dimensional model that describes branching flow. The results, which were reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, could help predict when a river is likely to branch, which could be important in mitigating floods and in protecting the natural environment. The study was led by Douglas Durian, professor and chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy in Penn's School of Arts and Sciences. He collaborated with Laura Carruth, a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science; Mary Silber, professor of geology in SAS; and Mark M. Wilde, a graduate student in Penn's Department of Physics and Astronomy. Durian, who has spent the last several years studying granular flows, became interested in branching rivers after a trip to the site of the Schuylkill River Restoration Project. The project, which was completed in 2009, was an attempt to return the river to its natural course as it winds through Fairmount Park. Durian wondered what would happen if the river were allowed to change its course naturally. ""What would the river look like if we let it go where it wanted to go?"" he asked. Durian's previous research suggested a possible explanation. He had studied the branching phenomenon in dry granular flows, which look similar to avalanches of sand. The granular material, like a river, is a collection of particles, and, like a river, the particles flow under gravity. The granular material naturally forms a branching network, and the same branching rules apply to both dry granular flows and river channels. In both cases, the branching occurs because of a feedback loop between the flow and the riverbed. The flow changes the shape of the riverbed, and the riverbed in turn changes the flow. To understand this feedback loop, the researchers first had to develop a model that described the complex three-dimensional geometry of the riverbed. This was not a simple task, as the riverbed is a complicated combination of bends, curves, flat areas and steep drops. To represent the riverbed, the researchers created a digital map, called a digital elevation model, that contains height values for each point in the riverbed. They then developed a mathematical algorithm that could convert this digital elevation map into a set of equations. The equations could predict how the water would flow through the riverbed. The researchers then compared their model to the behavior of a real river. The Snake River, which runs through Wyoming and Idaho, was chosen because it has been studied extensively. It is a large river, and therefore is a good candidate for branching. The researchers had already collected data about the Snake River's flow rate, channel shape and sand supply. They used this information to make a simulation of the Snake River, and then compared the simulation to the real thing. They found that the two were remarkably similar. The researchers are now working on a model that predicts branching in rivers. ""We're trying to understand when a river is likely to branch, and under what conditions,"" Durian said. The ability to predict branching behavior could be useful in many circumstances. For example, engineers who are trying to protect a river from flooding could use a branching model to predict where the river is likely to branch, and therefore how to protect the surrounding area from the flood. In addition, ecologists could use a branching model to predict where a river is likely to branch, and therefore which areas will be protected from development. ""Some species of plants and animals require certain habitats, and it's important to be able to predict where those habitats will be,"" Durian said. The National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Simons Foundation provided support for this research.",0,640

Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing is facing an uncertain future after its co-founder and president Jean Liu announced her resignation, according to a report by the New York Times on Sunday. Liu, whose husband is also a Didi co-founder, told close associates that she plans to step down as she expects the government to eventually take over the company and appoint new management, the report said. The 39-year-old executive became Didi's chief in 2014, and her resignation comes amid a string of negative headlines about the firm over the past two years. Last year, a 21-year-old female passenger was murdered by a Didi driver, and the company has been accused of failing to properly protect the personal data of its customers. The firm was also criticized for allegedly discriminating against women in an attempt to improve its image after the murder, and it has also had to deal with the emergence of a number of upstart competitors. Liu's departure comes after Chinese tech giant Tencent sold its entire 20 stake in Didi in January and ended a strategic partnership with the ride-hailing firm. In a statement sent to CNN, the company said Liu had no plans to step down and that she was looking to improve Didi's corporate governance. Didi said that Liu is ""currently exploring ways to improve our corporate governance structure so we can better serve the needs of our users and drivers and continue to innovate in the transportation industry."" ""Jean has no intention of stepping down from her current role as President of Didi Chuxing,"" the company added. Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.

"Tesla has warned its employees that they could lose unemployment benefits if they choose to stay home due to COVID-19 concerns after being called back to work. Elon Musk reopened the Tesla factory in Shanghai on Monday, in spite of the fact that the city is still in quarantine, after the Chinese government ordered the company to do so. The message from Tesla's head of HR was reportedly sent on Sunday and read: ""There have been cases where we have seen people decide to go to work even though they are ill to protect their team, which puts everyone else in the team at risk. If you are asked to return to work, you should consider the risk to your health and your team and, if you do decide to come in, you should be prepared to work from home and stay out of the factory if you are sick."" Tesla China claims to have received approval from the local government to do so, and it has reportedly asked the employees who are currently in quarantine to stay home. The United States government has issued an official travel warning to China, advising U.S. citizens to avoid travelling to the country and to stay at least 6 feet away from anyone who may be sick. This is the second time in recent years that Tesla has asked its workers to return to the factory after a health issue. In 2019, the company reopened the factory after the coronavirus outbreak (a different one) and asked its workers to come back after the Chinese New Year break. In case you're wondering, the Chinese New Year break lasts for about a week. ""If you are unwell or have recently been in contact with an unwell person, please do not come to work,"" the message to employees reportedly said. ""We are happy to have everyone back at Giga Shanghai, but your safety and the safety of your coworkers is our top priority."" Tesla's factory in Shanghai is a crucial part of the company's business. It manufactures the Model 3 and the Model Y, as well as batteries and powertrains. It is also a major part of the company's efforts to break into the Chinese market. The factory has been shut down for over a week now, and the company has reportedly lost 1.9 billion in market value. Related Topics:coronaviruscovid-19elon muskfeaturedtesla",0,643
"Space tourism may become a reality soon, with the construction of the Aurora Station beginning later this year.

"Starship, SpaceX's next-generation rocket, partially burst apart during ground tests in Texas. SpaceX was conducting some pressure tests with the vehicle. The explosions were not completely unexpected, according to SpaceX. SpaceX's Starship hovers over its launch pad after a test flight at the company's facility in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, U.S. August 27, 2019. By Christian Davenport The Washington Post The uncrewed vehicle, called Starship, had been tethered to the ground at SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, during what the company called a series of tests of its next-generation rocket engine. The vehicle, which is a prototype for a rocket that SpaceX envisions flying people to the moon and Mars, was undergoing pressurization tests. ""The purpose of today's test was to pressurize systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected,"" SpaceX said in a statement. ""There were no injuries, nor is this a serious setback."" A video posted to Twitter showed the vehicle bursting apart, with a large explosion and flames shooting out. In a statement, the company said: ""During a pressurization test on a Starship prototype, there was an anomaly resulting in the loss of the vehicle. This happened during a routine test and took place at the launch site in Boca Chica, Texas."" The company said it would provide more information once the teams have reviewed the data. The incident is the latest in a string of mishaps during the development of a rocket that SpaceX founder Elon Musk has touted as a breakthrough in the cost of spaceflight. The company has been testing the vehicle, which it refers to as a ""hopper,"" at its facility in Texas. Musk has said the hopper would be used to test the vehicle's ability to land, something the company hopes to demonstrate in the coming months. SpaceX has been building a more advanced version of the rocket, which the company plans to fly to space. It is expected to be 180 feet tall and capable of carrying 100 tons to orbit. The company said earlier this week that the first orbital flight of the Starship could come in two to three months. In a tweet, Musk said the company will ""take this learning"" from the failed test and ""build flight design for orbital Starship."" SpaceX is one of several companies developing rockets and spacecraft capable of flying humans into space. In addition to its work with NASA, it is also building a capsule that it hopes to use to fly tourists to space. Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin, which has a facility in Huntsville, Alabama, is developing a rocket called New Glenn, which it plans to use to fly satellites and, eventually, people. And Boeing is working with NASA to build a capsule called the Starliner, which it hopes to use to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Musk has set an ambitious timeline for the development of the Starship. He said recently that the company would like to begin flights to orbit within two to three months, and then, in the next six months, fly the vehicle around the moon. The company has been developing a giant rocket - known as the Super Heavy - to be used with the Starship. That vehicle will be used to send a Japanese billionaire and a handful of artists around the moon. In the coming months, Musk said, the company will try to fly the hopper to an altitude of 12.4 miles, and then land it back on the launch site.

"A 122,000-tonne ultra-large natural gas tanker is the first large ship to make an ocean passage of over 10,000 km under autonomous control. Prism Courage made the 33-day voyage from South Korea to China, where it is now being fitted out to operate as a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU). The 260-metre long LNG carrier was built at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard for Norway's Knutsen, and is being converted at the Wison Offshore Marine Shipyard in Nantong, China, for operation as a floating LNG import terminal. During its maiden voyage Prism Courage was controlled by a system developed by Rolls-Royce. The company says that the cargo handling was fully automated, with the ship's control and navigation systems on board monitoring the vessel's position and movement at all times. It is not the first time that Rolls-Royce has demonstrated autonomous ship technology. In December 2018 the Norwegian Coastal Administration's multipurpose vessel, RV Gunnerus, also completed a sea trial in the Trondheim fjord. A major milestone in the development of autonomous ship technology is now being achieved by the Finnish firm Wartsila. It has announced that it is to test a ferry with autonomous navigation in the waters of Finland. The tests are to be carried out in the first half of 2019, and will use the 83-metre long ferry Falco, owned by Finferries. The vessel operates on a route between the Finnish mainland and the island of Korppoo. The 1,500-tonne ship will be fitted with a Wartsila Nacos Platinum Joystick system, which will control the ship's navigation. The system incorporates dynamic positioning and route optimisation, and has a track control system that can compensate for external factors that affect a ship's progress, such as waves, wind and currents. Wartsila has made it clear that the Falco is not to be an unmanned vessel. The system will be operated and monitored onboard the ship, with no remote control. The main objective of the tests is to develop autonomous navigation and positioning capabilities. ""It is important to note that vessels like Falco operate in an intensely congested sea area where there is an especially high volume of ferry traffic and cargo transports,"" said Wartsila's Jonne Jokela. ""Developing this technology can have a considerable impact in terms of safety and efficiency,"" he added. The pace of development of autonomous ship technology is such that Rolls-Royce has now established its own autonomous vessel operations centre in Turku, Finland, which has the responsibility for developing the technology. The control centre is equipped with sophisticated software that enables it to operate several ships at the same time from a distance of hundreds of miles. ""We want to take a leading role in developing fully autonomous ships. This is the most important development project for us today,"" said Rolls-Royce's Esko Mustamaki. ""We will use the centre to develop our technology and to find out what regulations are needed for autonomous ships. This is an excellent example of a partnership between industry and academia, and we hope to learn a great deal from the feedback provided by our partners in Turku,"" he added. Meanwhile, the US Coast Guard is stepping up its efforts to develop regulations for autonomous ships. It has published the first draft of a document that is intended to provide guidance to owners and operators of autonomous ships. It is called Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-18, and is described as a first step towards addressing the use of emerging technologies in the maritime industry. The NVIC states that autonomous systems have the potential to enhance maritime safety, and can provide a means to reduce workload onboard, improve vessel performance and efficiency, and decrease the likelihood of human error. ""To properly and fully address autonomous technology in the marine environment, the Coast Guard is pursuing a 'think big, start small and scale fast' strategy,"" said the Coast Guard's Jeff Lantz. It is not just Rolls-Royce and Wartsila that are developing autonomous ship technology. Last year we reported on how an autonomous containership had been operated by Japan's MOL in a demonstration in Tokyo Bay.",0,650
"Tuplex is a parallel big data processing framework that runs data science pipelines written in Python at the speed of compiled code. It generates optimized LLVM bytecode for the given Python function and executes it on multiple CPUs in parallel. Tuplex is not a general purpose parallel data processing framework like Spark or Flink. It is a dedicated tool for optimizing and parallelizing Python functions written in the form of the data science pipeline, typically used in data-driven applications. Pipelines are a popular programming pattern for big data processing. They are the core of many data science tasks such as natural language processing, image processing, bioinformatics, recommendation systems, etc. The pipeline is a sequence of functions, where the output of one function is used as the input of the next one. The pipeline typically starts with reading data from an input source and ends with the output of the result. For example, a simple text processing pipeline could look like this. The function readtext reads the text from a file, tokenizetext divides the text into a sequence of tokens, and counttokens counts the number of occurrences of each token in the text. In the traditional sequential processing, the functions are executed one after another. The functions in the pipeline are not independent from each other. For example, the output of counttokens is used in the computation of the term-frequency vector. So, why not execute the two functions in parallel and save some time? Tuplex will automatically generate the code for the parallel execution of the functions in the pipeline. Tuplex is a runtime library that must be installed as a Python package. Tuplex is compatible with Python 3.5 and above. Tuplex generates the LLVM IR code from the given Python function and executes it on multiple CPUs in parallel. The first step is the most important one. Tuplex implements the LLVM API in Python. It generates the LLVM IR code from the Python function, analyzes it, and produces a parallelized version of the code, which is then compiled by the LLVM compiler to native machine code. The generated code is automatically compiled as an internal extension module of the Python runtime. Each CPU core in the system runs a separate copy of the compiled code. After a function is parallelized, the execution of the pipeline can be divided between multiple CPU cores. Each core executes a different function in parallel. This is the execution plan for the example pipeline above. All the functions in the pipeline are executed in parallel on the available CPU cores. Tuplex is a library written in Python. It does not modify the Python runtime. It does not use any external services. It does not require Python to be compiled with LLVM. It does not require any installation of LLVM or compiler toolchain. It does not require JIT compilation. It does not require any special optimizations to be turned on in the Python runtime. It is compatible with all of the existing Python modules. It is compatible with Python 3.5 and above. It is compatible with Python 2.7. It is compatible with all of the existing Python frameworks, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Tensorflow. It is compatible with all of the existing Python applications, including web servers, machine learning frameworks, data analytics, and more. Tuplex is a parallel execution library. It does not provide any tools for parallelizing the code. All the functions must be parallelizable by definition. This includes all of the functions that can be executed in parallel on different pieces of data. An example of the non-parallelizable code is the code that performs a single computation on a data set, such as the sum of all elements in the data set. The example pipeline above can be parallelized. It can be executed in parallel on different files. It is not possible to parallelize the pipeline if it is executed on a single file. The function counttokens is non-parallelizable because it is executed on a single data set. The easiest way to parallelize the code is to use the Tuplex decorators. tuplex.parallelfor is a decorator for the Python for loops. It enables parallel execution of the for loop. tuplex.parallelif is a decorator for the Python if statements. It enables parallel execution of the conditional block. The decorators are used by the parallelfor and parallelif functions. The parallelfor function is used to parallelize a for loop. The function computes the term-frequency vector for a list of tokens. The parallelif function is used to parallelize the if statement. The function counts the number of occurrences of each word in the text. The example above can be parallelized using the parallel decorators. The functions parallelfor and",0,651

"The reddish-brown'scars' that form on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa are actually etched into the layer of water ice that covers the surface of a potentially habitable subsurface ocean. Scientists have long thought that the dark reddish-brown lines and spots that crisscross the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa are simply surface features, much like the ""mare"" (Latin for ""seas on Earth's moon. But new research suggests that these so-called ""brown spots"" are actually etched into the surface ice. In a new paper, researchers at Brown University have found that the spots are likely a sign of geologic activity on Europa. The findings suggest that Europa's surface ice is warm and mobile, and that the reddish-brown spots are fresh cracks in the surface. ""This is the first time that someone has been able to identify specific surface features on Europa that can be linked with geologic activity,"" said Christine McCarthy, a graduate student at Brown University and the lead author of the paper. ""That, to me, is the most exciting aspect of the work."" The findings are published in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Europa has long been thought to have a global subsurface ocean, kept warm by the squeezing and stretching of the moon's orbit around Jupiter. Where that warm water hits the bottom of Europa's solid ice shell, it's believed to melt the ice to create a layer of liquid water. That water then rises and spreads out at the surface, freezing once again and creating a shell of ice. The appearance of these ""brown spots"" - which are also found on Jupiter's moon Ganymede - has been one of the most tantalizing hints that this process is occurring today on Europa. ""What I think is really exciting about these features is that we've been able to link them with a process that's really important in terms of habitability,"" McCarthy said. ""If these spots are as we interpret them, they are areas where Europa is exchanging material with the subsurface ocean."" In 2011, NASA's Galileo mission detected clay-like minerals on the surface of Europa, which appeared to be deposited by water from the subsurface ocean. Since the spots are also associated with locations where the subsurface ocean is interacting with the surface ice shell, McCarthy and co-author Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University, looked at whether the spots might be caused by the breakdown of the clay material by radiation from space. To test that hypothesis, they created ammonium sulfate deposits by exposing mixtures of ammonia, sulfur, and water to radiation in the laboratory. The resulting deposits were colored, and they also contained organic material, the building blocks of life. ""We're not claiming that we found evidence of life, but we found a chemical that's associated with life,"" McCarthy said. ""It's associated with two things that are important to life: food and energy."" The researchers then examined images of Europa's surface from the Galileo and Voyager missions, and found that the spots on Europa look like the lab deposits. To follow up those results, the researchers also compared the spectra of the lab samples to the spectra of the spots on Europa. Spectra are created when light is split into its constituent wavelengths. The wavelengths of light that are absorbed by a substance can tell scientists something about what that substance is. ""We found that the spectra of these deposits in the lab were a very good match to the spectra of these spots on Europa,"" McCarthy said. ""So we're pretty convinced that the spots are ammonium sulfate."" The researchers also tested the idea that the spots might be caused by plumes of water vapor erupting from Europa's surface ice shell, as has been suggested by other researchers. The plume model does offer a way to explain the origin of the spots, but the plume activity would have to be much lower than what is thought to be happening on Europa. And the model doesn't explain the origin of the organic material associated with the spots. ""We're not able to say definitively that plumes are not the source of the features,"" McCarthy said. ""All we can say is that plumes are not the only exciting thing that",0,656
"Researchers from the University of Central Florida have engineered a nanomaterial that repels water and can stay dry when submerged underwater. The design was inspired by the structure of a lotus plant's leaves. Water-repellent coatings have been around for years. It's a big business, and many manufacturers try to outdo each other with claims of being the world's most waterproof material. There are waterproof jackets, waterproof gloves, waterproof mascara, and even waterproof socks. But not all of these products work as advertised. For instance, waterproof gloves get soaked through once you touch something wet. While a nanomaterial coating may work great on a smooth surface like glass, it's a lot more challenging to keep water off a textured surface such as a fabric or paper. The Florida team, led by Aliasger Salem, set out to create a coating that can repel water from even rough surfaces. They knew they had to do something different, so they turned to nature for inspiration. Researchers have long been interested in the lotus plant's unique ability to repel water. The plant's leaves have a bumpy texture, similar to an egg carton. Water droplets don't stick to these bumps, but roll off the leaf's surface. This is called the lotus effect. When water rolls off the leaf, it takes any dust or dirt with it. The lotus leaf is self-cleaning. For their nanomaterial, the UCF researchers designed tiny particles similar to the bumps on a lotus leaf. The particles are made of two types of plastic: fluorocarbon and poly (dimethylsiloxane). They can be added to a coating or paint and applied to any surface. The particles are only a few nanometers in size, which means there are thousands of them in a drop of water. In fact, there are so many particles in the coating that the surface appears flat and smooth. But the particles are close enough together that they touch, forming a network. Water that touches the coating gets caught up in this network. But because the particles are hydrophobic - they repel water - the water droplets roll right off. Droplets of water roll off the surface of a lotus leaf. The plant's surface is covered with tiny bumps that cause the water to roll. In the lab, the researchers sprayed the coating onto a variety of materials. They tested it by spraying water, oil, and milk onto the coated surfaces. On nonporous surfaces such as glass and metal, the water droplets beaded up and rolled off. When they tested the coating on a textured surface, the results were even more impressive. On paper and fabric, the water beaded up and rolled off, leaving the surface dry. And even after the paper was bent and crumpled, it still stayed dry! The coating is cheap and easy to make, and the team thinks it could be used in a number of ways. It could be applied to clothing, cars, boats, and even airplanes. This story was updated 10182018 to correct the name of the lead researcher. Take a look at the lotus leaf. How do the bumps on its surface help it repel water? Now think about your skin. Your skin is mostly smooth, but it also has tiny bumps. Do you think your skin would repel water if it were covered in the nanoparticle coating? Why or why not? The nanoparticle coating is a hydrophobic material. Hydro means ""water"" and phobic means ""fear."" What do you think a hydrophobic material is? What other materials can you think of that repel water? What other materials can you think of that attract water? Do you think the coating would work in saltwater? Why or why not? Would you want a waterproof coating on your clothes? Explain your answer.",0,657

"Two plant-based burger companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are set to launch the next versions of their burgers. While both burgers are plant-based, their formulas are quite different. Beyond Meat's new Beyond Burger is said to be meatier with a better texture and better cooking qualities. Impossible Foods' new Impossible Burger is said to be closer to beef in taste and smell, and will contain no gluten. Both burgers were introduced in 2016, and since then they have expanded in supermarkets, fast food joints, and restaurants around the world. Beyond Meat will launch the new version of its Beyond Burger on January 15 at the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York City. The new version will launch in retail stores in the U.S. in the coming months. According to reports, it will be sold in the same packaging as the old version, and its price will remain the same. It is said to be meatier, juicier, and to have a better texture and better cooking qualities. Beyond Meat is known to be the first plant-based meat company to successfully scale up its operations, and the company has already sold more than 13 million of its Beyond Burgers. Impossible Foods has announced that it will launch a new Impossible Burger in early 2019, but it has not revealed much more about the burger yet. A company spokesperson did say that the new version will be gluten-free and will be more like meat in taste and smell, and a patent application suggests that it may be more similar to beef in texture as well. Impossible Foods is currently in the process of scaling up its production. The company has already raised more than 400 million to do so. Even if you are not vegan, you should try one or both of these plant-based burgers if you have the opportunity.

"This article follows the story of Kayode, an A-grade student that was studying at one of the country's most elite educational institutions who turned to cybercrime during the pandemic. The first part of the story can be read here. On March 18, 2020, a notification arrived on Kayode's phone. He had just returned from the compulsory pandemic leave and was glad to receive it. It was from the NCC and contained details of the graduates' job placement for the graduating class of 2019. Kayode had applied for an engineering position at one of the biggest tech firms in the world, a Nigerian company that is now a global tech giant with over 100 billion in revenue. He had spent almost all his free time in his final year, sending job applications to this company and was sure he had a good chance of being accepted. He had even gone as far as networking with the company's HR team on LinkedIn, to try to improve his chances of being accepted. But he was disappointed when he found out he was not accepted. Afterwards, he had gone to his department and was told that no one from his class had been selected for the company's graduate program. Kayode's hope had been shattered. He had been accepted for a graduate program at another company but it wasn't what he really wanted. He had no idea what to do next and spent the next few days in bed, crying and lamenting. During this period of mourning, he received a message from one of the people he had met on an online forum he frequented. The person had been his classmate and had been involved in a lot of online jobs and cybercrime. After their school, they had gone their separate ways but Kayode had been following his activities on the internet. The person had been running a popular blog and was involved in a lot of online activities. Kayode was confused by the message but after he had read it, he decided to reply. The person sent another message a few days later. This time, Kayode did not hesitate to reply. They exchanged messages over the next few days, and Kayode had been learning a lot of new things. He learnt that the person was running a very successful business, helping people cheat in their exams. He had a team of over 10 people who helped him with this business. One of them did the hacking, another one had access to the database of different institutions and was able to find the questions and answers to most exams in the country, another did the marketing, while others were involved in the delivery of answers to students. The person was making huge amounts of money from this business and this got Kayode thinking. ""What if I join this person's business?"" he thought. ""What if I use my tech skills to improve it? ""It will be a very risky venture, but if I get caught, the consequences could be terrible. I could go to jail for a very long time."" This thought terrified him. He had never really done anything illegal before and the thought of jail was something he didn't want to consider. ""What if I get away with it?"" he thought. ""What if I make a lot of money and no one finds out? I would never have to worry about money again."" Kayode thought about this for a few days. On March 30, he sent a message to the person. ""I would like to join you."" This article was originally published on TechCabal. Cover Image: Kola Tubosun Nigerian writer and poet.",0,660
"SQLFlow connects SQL and Tensorflow together so that SQL can be used for machine learning. SQL is a popular data storage solution, so implementing machine learning capabilities to work with SQL data would be highly beneficial. Add a new SQLFlow repository, in this case 'SQLFlow'. Add the sqlflow package. We need the latest version. Run the script to install the SQLFlow packages, including the latest Tensorflow version and MySQL driver. Run SQLFlow, and connect it to the MySQL database. First we need to read the dataset. The read query will extract all the user information from the database. In this case we select the userid and username columns. Now that we've defined the dataset, we can start predicting. The first step is to extract the user names from the dataset into a vector. The dataset has a one-hot encoding, meaning that each user name is represented by a 1, and the rest are 0's. The dot product between two user names gives the number of similar users. For example, the dot product between 'John' and 'Mike' is 0.5, because they both have a 1 for 'John' and a 0 for 'Mike'. Next, we can define the model. In this case, the model is a linear model, meaning that the prediction is a dot product between the input and the weights. In addition, we need to set the training parameters. For example, how many iterations do we want to train for, and what is our learning rate. Now we can start training. First, we need to declare the weights, which will be trained. Finally, we train the model. Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions. Before we can make predictions, we need to load the model. Then we make predictions on our dataset. Finally, we make predictions on the entire dataset.",0,661
"It can be difficult for adults to learn other languages even after years of exposure. In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and promote the formation of new neural connections. Could this have an effect on how animals learn? A new study by CSHL scientists, led by Assistant Professor Joshua Gordon, shows that stimulation of the vagus nerve in adult mice improves their ability to learn and retain information. The research team's work, which appears online today ahead of print in Nature Neuroscience, suggests that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in humans may also have similar beneficial effects. ""There's a lot of interest in this,"" said Gordon, who is a member of the CSHL Neurobiology Behavior Program. ""Vagus nerve stimulation is already being used in some human conditions, and this may open the door for other uses of VNS in humans."" The vagus nerve is a major nerve that runs from the brain through the neck and thorax, to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic system, which regulates heart rate and digestion, among other functions. VNS has been used to treat epilepsy and depression in humans, and recent studies have suggested that it could help treat other conditions such as chronic pain and inflammation. Gordon and his colleagues studied mice with VNS devices implanted in their necks. The VNS devices stimulate the vagus nerve, which is the largest nerve in the parasympathetic system. The vagus nerve carries information about the state of the body's organs to the central nervous system, including areas of the brain that are important for learning and memory. The researchers found that mice with VNS implants showed improved memory and learning in several behavioral tasks. They were better at remembering the location of a hidden platform in a water maze and they were better at recognizing objects they had previously encountered. The team found that VNS also increased the number of new neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for learning and memory. VNS increased the expression of genes in the hippocampus that are important for learning and memory. It also increased the release of a brain chemical called norepinephrine, which is important for arousal and attention. ""What's really exciting here is that we're taking insights from animal neuroscience and trying to figure out how to help people with psychiatric and neurological conditions,"" said Gordon.",0,662

"A company from Finland, Solar Foods, is planning to sell a protein powder that is made out of CO2, water, and electricity. The idea for Solein originally began at NASA, where researchers were looking for a way to make food for astronauts using recycled air and water. Solar Foods is now looking to scale up production of Solein. Using electricity, water, and carbon dioxide, a Finnish company is producing a protein powder that is meant to feed the world's population without any impact on the environment. This revolutionary foodstuff is made using renewable energy that combines CO2, hydrogen, and oxygen. The company claims that they're creating ""food from air."" The protein that the company is producing, called Solein, is very similar to wheat gluten. Solein is the brainchild of the company, Solar Foods. The foodstuff is the result of a joint effort between VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The company says that the creation of Solein is part of a project called Food from Electricity. Solein is a protein powder that is made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy. This protein powder is very similar to wheat gluten. The company is claiming that Solein is the most environmentally friendly protein powder in the world. They say that 1 kilo of Solein requires 20 times less land and 10 times less water than beef, five times less than soybeans, and four times less than wheat. It's also made in a way that is carbon-neutral. Solar Foods says that they're feeding the world without impacting the environment. In the future, Solar Foods hopes to expand the production of Solein by up to 2 million meals per year. They have already opened a pilot factory in the city of Espoo, Finland.

"Amazon has introduced a new initiative called'less packaging, more smiles' that will see the company reduce the materials used for sending out items as well as provide instructions for reusing packaging. The company said that it will be launching a new slimmed-down package designed for smaller items and will be using ""frustration-free packaging"" for the first time in the UK. Frustration-free packaging is recyclable and made without any plastic clamshells or wire ties. The move comes after research conducted on behalf of Amazon revealed that 80 per cent of UK consumers would prefer to have packaging that could be reused. However, only 48 per cent of people actually reused their packaging. Amazon has said that it will be providing consumers with instructions on its website for how they can reuse their packaging, and will also be encouraging people to send unwanted packaging to a local recycling centre.

"Elon Musk has asked his Twitter followers to vote on whether he should sell 10 of his Tesla shares. The poll is a response to a proposed billionaires tax, which could see him lose more than 40 percent of his wealth. It comes as US politicians debate a new proposal from Senator Elizabeth Warren to tax the wealthiest Americans. In a Medium post, Warren outlined how the richest 75,000 families in the US, who hold 40 percent of the nation's wealth, would face a two percent tax on their wealth. Elon Musk is worth an estimated 19 billion, placing him as the 80th richest man in the US. By Warren's calculations, Musk would pay 3.5 billion in taxes each year. If the tax was retroactive, it could cost him as much as 12.9 billion. Musk has previously warned that automation could lead to higher taxes for the wealthy. ""There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better. I think we should be thinking about how do we minimize the downside and accentuate the upside,"" Musk told CNBC.

Having questions shows you are genuinely interested in the company and the role, and have made an effort to find out more. It also shows you are a curious person with a proactive attitude, which is always a good thing. Here are some examples of what you could ask at your next job interview: What will my main responsibilities be? This is a great opening question that will help you understand what you will be doing in the job and what will be expected of you. What is the biggest challenge the team is facing right now? A question like this shows you are interested in the team and will give you an idea of what the business is struggling with and what you can do to help. What is the most important thing I can do to help the team in the first month? This will help you understand the company's expectations of you in your first month and gives you a chance to demonstrate you have the skills and knowledge to hit the ground running. What is the culture of the company? If you are leaving a toxic work environment, it is important to understand what the culture is like at your new employer. If you want to work in a relaxed office where you can wear jeans, then it is important to find out whether a formal dress code is expected. This is another important question to ask, particularly if you are looking to progress in your career. If the company offers training and development opportunities, you will be able to develop your skills and reach your full potential. What do you like about working for this company? Asking your interviewer about their personal experience of the company will give you a deeper insight into what it's like to work there. What is your vision for the company? Asking your interviewer about their vision for the future of the company shows you have a genuine interest in the organisation and want to know where it is going. What are the biggest challenges you have faced in this role? A question like this will give you an idea of what to expect from the role and any challenges you will face. Do you have any reservations about me or my qualifications? Asking this question will give you a chance to address any doubts the interviewer may have about you. Will you be offering any additional benefits? Questions like this will give you an insight into whether you will get extra perks and benefits, such as pension contributions, gym memberships or flexible working. Asking questions shows you are genuinely interested in the company and the role, and have made an effort to find out more. What are the next steps in the recruitment process? Asking about the next steps in the process will give you an indication of when you will hear back and the next stage. Do you have any feedback on my performance in the interview? A question like this will give you a chance to hear what you did well and what you could have done better in the interview, which will help you in future interviews. Is there anything else you need from me? It is always good to finish the interview on a positive note, and asking the interviewer if there is anything else you can help them with will give them the opportunity to ask you any questions they may have missed. If you are looking for your next career move, then get in touch with our team of recruitment consultants. We will be able to find you the best jobs in your local area that match your skills and experience.",0,672
"The plant-based meat industry is now worth 800 million and accounts for two percent of packaged meat sales. Both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have started to expand their product lines to include additional products, such as Beyond's beefy crumbles and sausages and Impossible Food's sausages and ground ""beef."" Both companies have also been working to expand their reach in the fast-food industry, with Beyond Meat's product now available at Burger King and Impossible Foods available at White Castle. It's likely that in the coming months and years, the companies will continue to expand to other major fast-food chains. As these companies continue to expand their reach, they are bringing more attention to the plant-based meat industry as a whole. Additionally, the companies will continue to grow as they receive funding from various investors. Beyond Meat recently saw a 163 percent increase in their stock price after going public. Furthermore, Beyond Meat received a 25 million dollar investment from McDonald's, who has also announced that they will be testing plant-based meat in their restaurants. Similarly, Impossible Foods recently received a 300 million dollar investment from various companies. As the industry continues to expand and receive more attention, it is likely that more people will be encouraged to try plant-based meat and that these companies will continue to flourish.

"Running out of cash is probably a founder's biggest fear. Indie Hackers is a community mostly made up of founders who shoulder their company's financial burden personally. They generally take very little or no salary to ensure their companies survive. Money is an enormous source of stress for them. They have to worry about covering the cost of their personal lives in addition to the cost of their companies. This is no easy task, especially if you're bootstrapping your startup. There are two main ways to save money as a founder. The first is to reduce your personal expenses. The second is to increase your personal income. In this article, I'll show you how to do both. I'll provide examples from my own life and from other bootstrappers in the Indie Hackers community. If you're looking for inspiration and ideas for how you can save money while starting your company, you're in the right place. In this section, I'll go over several ways to reduce your personal expenses. I'll also explain how you can earn more income to pad your bank account. By the end of this article, you'll have several ideas for how you can save money and make more money as you work on your startup. The first thing you should do is create a budget. Include your monthly expenses as well as your projected income. When I first started working on Indie Hackers full-time, I created a spreadsheet with the following fields: Projected income: The amount of money I think I will earn each month. Actual income: The amount of money I actually earn each month. Projected expenses: The amount of money I think I will spend each month. Actual expenses: The amount of money I actually spend each month. This has been an invaluable tool for me. It's a simple spreadsheet, but it provides me with a clear view of my finances. At the beginning of each month, I fill out the projected income and expense fields. At the end of the month, I enter the actual income and expense fields. Most people spend more than they earn. They spend their earnings and then some. This isn't surprising. What is surprising, though, is that most people don't track their income and expenses. They have no idea where their money is going. This is a big mistake. If you don't track your income and expenses, you'll never know how much you're spending. You'll never be able to make your money last longer. If you want to reduce your expenses, you have to know how much money you're spending. That's why you need to create a budget. You also need to track your income and expenses. I recommend using a tool like Mint. When I was working on Indie Hackers, I would track my personal and business expenses in Mint. It was incredibly useful. Mint will sync with your bank accounts and credit cards to automatically track your spending. It'll tell you where your money is going. It'll show you which expenses are recurring and which are one-time. All you have to do is link your accounts to Mint. The app will take care of the rest. Mint makes it easy to see where your money is going. Once you start using a tool like Mint, you'll be able to see exactly how much money you're spending. You'll be able to see which expenses are necessary and which are optional. This will help you reduce your expenses. You'll be able to remove recurring expenses that you don't need. You'll be able to cut back on your non-essential spending. So, create a budget and start tracking your income and expenses. These two simple steps will help you reduce your expenses. I've made several changes to my personal budget since I started Indie Hackers. In particular, I've reduced the following expenses: I'll go over these in detail. Housing is often one of the biggest expenses for founders. Many founders live in cities where housing costs are high. They have to pay thousands of dollars per month in rent. Some founders live in places like San Francisco and New York where housing is outrageously expensive. They end up paying more than 2,000 per month for a small apartment. This is not a good way to bootstrap a startup. Founders should keep their housing costs as low as possible. They should do everything they can to reduce their monthly rent or mortgage payment",0,675
"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has issued a recall of 53,822 Tesla vehicles due to the Assertive mode on the company's Full Self-Driving software. Cars set on Assertive mode may not provide any warning to the driver if they are drifting off the road, which NHTSA has deemed ""unreasonable risk to safety."" This recall affects all Tesla Model S and X vehicles manufactured between August 2017 and October 2017. Tesla has stated that owners of affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software update which will change the steering assist system. Tesla released a statement about the issue, saying: ""Tesla has provided NHTSA with a detailed explanation of the design change and the underlying engineering, and we are awaiting their formal response.""

It is still unclear whether or not the vehicles' Autopilot feature was engaged during the collisions.",0,676
"A group of researchers has developed a way to create food without sunlight using artificial photosynthesis. The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding it to bacteria which produce protein. The process is not quite efficient enough to be used on a large scale yet, but the researchers believe that with a bit of optimization it will be possible. Two features set this system apart from other methods of creating food. The first is that it does not need sunlight, meaning that it could be used in space. The second is that it can create protein, which is the most difficult nutrient to find in space. The researchers also believe that the system could be used to create food in places where sunlight is scarce, such as in the Arctic. The conversion of carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate is a form of artificial photosynthesis. It involves using two electrodes to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon dioxide, and the resulting mixture is converted into acetate. The acetate is then fed to bacteria which convert it into proteins and other nutrients. The system is not yet efficient enough to be used on a large scale, but the researchers believe that it will be possible to make it efficient enough eventually. They also think that it could be used to grow vegetables in places where sunlight is not plentiful enough for plants to grow.",0,677

The code can create high-resolution 3D models of humans from a single image. A trained neural network takes an image and outputs a high-resolution 3D mesh in a canonical pose. This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of ""Multi-Level Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution 3D Human Digitization."" The code can create high-resolution 3D models of humans from a single image. A trained neural network takes an image and outputs a high-resolution 3D mesh in a canonical pose. This is achieved with a combination of pixel-aligned implicit representations with a multi-level network architecture, which allows high-resolution output while keeping the number of parameters in the network manageable. The results are comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The neural network is trained using the same dataset and code as SMPLify. The implementation comes with three pretrained models. Download the model weights for the aforementioned models. The weights are in the weights directory. The weights can be loaded using the following code. In order to predict a high-resolution mesh from a single image, you can use the following code. The code is heavily based on the SMPLify code, and as such, the interfaces are compatible. The code is tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

"Following the popularity of MoviePass, which peaked at 3.2 million subscribers earlier this summer, AMC rolled out its own subscription service, a 19.95 pass to watch up to 3 movies a week. The AMC service, which unlike MoviePass, isn't restricted to certain theaters, launched in June, but the chain isn't satisfied with just the theater experience, as Variety reports, AMC is now considering getting into the streaming business. AMC CEO Adam Aron said the theater chain is ""giving thought"" to launching a subscription streaming service, which would offer movies in the home theatrical release window, about 90 days after they hit theaters. He said AMC is ""evaluating the merits of an at-home product that would be in tandem with, and not replace, theatrical release windows."" ""We know that there are a lot of people that are not going to come to the movie theater, so we want to participate in that,"" Aron said in the call, adding, ""We have to make a careful decision and our goal would be to do it in a way that does not jeopardize the existing ecosystem that is producing those terrific movies."" Aron said the chain would explore the possibility of creating such a service if the studios could provide an exclusive license to offer the films. He said the service would be ""complementary"" to the current theatrical-release windows, and not ""competitive"" with them. TAGSAMCtheaters",0,679
"China has blocked Bing, even though Bing already censors results in China. It's part of a wider crackdown on internet freedoms by the Communist Party, as they've blocked Instagram and WhatsApp as well. It seems the only Western social media company that's doing well in China is LinkedIn, as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram, WhatsApp, Bing, and many others have been blocked. China has blocked access to Bing, the Microsoft-owned search engine, across the country. In a statement to TechCrunch, the company confirmed the blockage, noting that it has been in touch with the Chinese government to understand the blockage. It's unclear why Bing has been blocked. China regularly blocks websites and services that are not in compliance with its strict censorship laws, or that it perceives to be a threat. Bing has been censored in China for years, so the blockage is unlikely to have been triggered by recent events. It's possible that China has opted to block Bing due to its close ties with Microsoft, which the Chinese government has been increasingly suspicious of in recent years. The blockage is a further blow to Microsoft, which recently saw its LinkedIn service become inaccessible to users in Russia. The service was blocked by the Russian government, which decided to ban LinkedIn because it failed to comply with a 2014 law that requires internet companies to store Russian user data in the country. Bing was never going to unseat Google as the top search engine, and a lot of that is due to China, the world's largest internet market. Google long ago pulled out of China, where Baidu has a massive lead over Google and Bing. It's sad that the government is blocking all of these Western social media companies and tech services, but they're only hurting their own people.",0,680

"data2vec is a multi-modal artificial intelligence algorithm from Meta that attempts to replicate the general learning ability that the human mind possesses. The team aimed to create an AI that can learn to understand the world in a way that mirrors the human brain, including how the brain thinks about concepts, how it retains memory, and how it learns new things. The AI attempts to understand how the brain thinks by modeling the way that the brain's neurons work in real time. The neurons in the human brain are responsible for processing and transmitting information. The data2vec algorithm models the ways in which neurons interact with each other, including how they transfer information between each other. Meta's AI is able to retain memory in a way that is similar to the human brain by modeling the way that synapses work. Synapses are the junctions between neurons that are used to transmit information. The AI is able to retain and recall information in the same way that synapses in the human brain do. The data2vec algorithm is also capable of learning new things in the same way that the human brain does. The AI is able to combine information from multiple sources in order to learn new concepts. The AI can learn new information from a single source, but it will not be as effective at understanding the concept as if it learned the information from multiple sources. An example of the way that the data2vec algorithm combines information from multiple sources is the way it learns about colors. The AI can learn about the concept of red by looking at a single red object, but it will learn more about the concept of red by looking at multiple red objects. By looking at multiple red objects, the AI can learn about how red can be different shades and intensities, how red can be used in different contexts, and how red can have different meanings.

"The US Navy has banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices. It claims that the short-form video app is a cybersecurity threat, but declined to describe in detail what dangers the Navy believes are present. According to a memo obtained by the Associated Press, the Navy claims TikTok is a ""cybersecurity threat"" and cites the potential for data leaks as the primary reason for the ban. It also mentions the potential for third-party data collection. In the memo, the Navy's cybersecurity officials warn that using government-issued phones to use TikTok or any other social media platform could pose a threat. They ask that Navy personnel delete TikTok from any government-issued phone and even to uninstall it from any personal phones that are used for Navy work. As we've reported previously, TikTok has a history of vulnerabilities that have led to unauthorized data collection. For example, in May 2019, researchers from the University of California, San Diego found that the TikTok app could be exploited to extract personal information. TikTok's parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, has faced accusations that it is too closely tied to the Chinese government. Last month, the US Army barred the use of TikTok in order to avoid a potential security breach. ""These concerns were raised to the Army by soldiers who use TikTok,"" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Ochoa told Military.com. ""We do not allow it on government phones."" The US Navy has not responded to The Verge's request for comment.

"Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, has told Square employees that they will be able to work from home even after the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders end. Twitter had recently said that it will be opening up its conference rooms for coworking. Dorsey has been a vocal advocate of remote work and has helped pioneer a new ""team"" model in which employees work remotely. Fortune has reported that Dorsey sent out an email to Square employees explaining that the company's leadership team was discussing the question of what to do after the current shelter-in-place orders are lifted. ""We are going to let our teams work from home when the shelter-in-place orders lift (likely sometime in April),"" he said in the email. Dorsey is the founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square, the mobile payment processor. He is also one of the most prominent Silicon Valley leaders to promote remote work. He has publicly said that he prefers working from home, and both Twitter and Square have large remote workforces. In 2019, Square announced a new ""team"" model, in which employees work in teams that are fully remote. The model is designed to let remote workers avoid the feeling of isolation that sometimes comes with remote work. ""We're asking every team to think about how they can work together remotely, and how they're going to run their day-to-day work through Slack, Zoom, and all the other tools we have,"" Dorsey told Fast Company at the time. In a 2018 profile of Dorsey, The New Yorker talked about how he works from home most days. He also runs a podcast called ""Tech and the City,"" which discusses the potential of remote work. Twitter had already said that it would be opening up its conference rooms for coworking. Twitter has its headquarters in San Francisco, and it has offices in other cities as well, including Atlanta, Seattle, New York, Washington DC, and Boston.

"Stories of data loss can be embarrassing, but they help people learn useful things in case they end up in similar situations. This article tells the story of how a user ended up losing his important data due to a ransomware attack and what he did to prevent the same from happening again. Before I tell you the story of what happened to me, I would like to tell you about ransomware and what it does. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks a user's files. The files are locked in such a way that they become inaccessible. The malware then presents a screen that asks the user to pay a ransom in order to get back their files. It is usually a crypto currency like Bitcoin. The ransomware then gives a link that can be used to make the payment. After a payment is made, the hacker will release a decryption key that will enable the user to decrypt their files. This malware can be downloaded as an email attachment or by clicking on a link. This story happened about two years ago. I was a second year student at the time. I was a victim of ransomware, and I lost my important files. The malware locked my files, and I had no way of accessing them. When the malware appeared, it demanded that I pay some money to be able to decrypt my files. I had no money at the time and decided to look for another way to decrypt my files. I tried looking for some online tools, but I had no luck. I had to wait for a few days until I came across a site that had a list of ransomware decryption tools. I downloaded a few of them, and they were not able to decrypt my files. I then realized that I had no choice but to pay the ransom. I had no money at the time, but I knew of a friend who could help me out. I asked her for the money, and she helped me out. I paid the hacker, and he sent me a decryption key. This enabled me to decrypt my files. I was very happy that I had gotten back my files. I had no other choice but to pay the ransom. I learned from this experience, and I decided to find a better way to protect my files. I searched online for some software that could help me to recover my files in case the same thing happened. I came across a data recovery software. This software was able to recover my files in the case of a ransomware attack or any other type of data loss. I have been using this software for about two years now, and I can say that I am happy with it. This software is called Disk Drill. It is available for Mac OS X and Windows. There are three versions of this software, and they are: Free, Basic and PRO. Disk Drill is capable of recovering over 200 file formats. This software can recover files from hard drives, USB drives, memory cards, iPods and other devices. This software has a simple user interface and is easy to use. It is also capable of creating an image of a drive or a partition. This software can be used to recover files that have been lost due to ransomware, accidental deletion, OS crash, partition deletion and other data loss scenarios. The free version of Disk Drill is capable of recovering up to 500MB worth of data. The Basic and PRO versions are able to recover unlimited data. I would recommend that you give this software a try. You can download the free version and see if it is good enough for you.",0,688
"Apple Glasses could have the ability to transform any surface into a virtual touch interface, according to a patent that the company filed back in 2016. The patent describes using a combination of cameras, projectors, and motion sensors to interact with objects on flat surfaces. The patent calls for ""projecting images onto a nearby surface and then using the cameras to track when you interact with the projections,"" according to Engadget. It is unclear when this technology will be incorporated into Apple's product line, but the company is expected to release its first AR headset in 2020. MacRumors reports that Apple has filed a patent application for a new haptic feedback system that provides users with haptic feedback without the need for the Taptic Engine. Instead, the patent suggests using an electromechanical polymer to provide haptic feedback to users. This is a technology that Apple has previously experimented with, but it's possible that the company is looking to create a more efficient system that could be used to provide haptic feedback in Apple Glasses, or even a device like the Apple Watch. Apple is rumored to be working on a new AR headset that will be released in 2020, according to Bloomberg. The device will have a ""box-shaped"" body that houses the computing and battery, with the headset connecting to a pair of Apple's AR glasses. Apple is said to be developing a new chip specifically for the headset, which is expected to run the company's own custom operating system. Apple's AR headset will reportedly be built for heavy-duty applications, including mapping, virtual meetings, and 360-degree video. Apple Glasses has been rumored to be in development for a long time now, but Apple could actually be working on two versions of the device. According to sources who spoke with Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple could be working on an augmented reality headset and a mixed reality headset. The mixed reality headset would include a transparent display that would overlay objects and information on the real world. The augmented reality headset would be closer to the style of Google Glass, displaying information on a normal display. Kuo's sources say that Apple could release the mixed reality headset in 2020, while the augmented reality headset could launch in 2023. Apple Glasses could be equipped with an array of sensors to monitor the body's movements and health, according to a patent filing from the company. The patent describes a ""sensor system"" that could be used in a head-mounted device, like AR glasses. The system would be able to monitor the body's movements, including the angle of the user's neck, which would help determine the user's gaze direction. The system could also monitor the user's heart rate and blood pressure, as well as how the user is breathing. Apple Glasses could be equipped with a slew of sensors to track the movements of the user, including an accelerometer, a light sensor, a barometer, a magnetometer, a proximity sensor, and a gyroscope. These sensors would be able to track the position of the device in the user's environment, as well as track movements like shaking and gesturing. Apple Glasses could also include a microphone and a camera, which could be used to track the user's movements and gestures, as well as their voice.",0,689
"React Arborist is a fully-featured tree component for React. It provides all the common features expected in a tree, for example, it can open and close folders, efficiently show thousands of items, and so on. The tree is implemented using Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI when the data changes. The tree also automatically renders the items in a tree structure, and you can easily customize it to display any kind of data. An important feature of the tree is its memory optimization. The tree uses a Virtual DOM representation of the tree to efficiently update the UI. It also uses an efficient algorithm to render the tree, minimizing memory usage by reusing the same instance of an item when it appears multiple times in the tree. A tree is defined by an array of items. Items can have children. If an item has children, it is a folder. If an item doesn't have children, it is a leaf. You define the type of an item with a config object. It specifies the data, children and other features for an item. The React Arborist library is a standalone component, and it doesn't depend on other libraries. You can download it from npm or import it directly from unpkg.com. The tree is a React component that is built on top of a Virtual DOM representation of the tree. When the tree data changes, React automatically updates the Virtual DOM tree and only the changes are reflected in the DOM tree. This provides a significant performance boost when rendering thousands of items. The tree supports keyboard navigation, which enables the user to navigate the tree using the keyboard only. The tree supports drag and drop which enables users to reorder the tree, move items between folders, and so on. The tree provides a Context API which enables you to open and close folders and items, and access the data, selection and other items in the tree. The tree is highly configurable and you can customize it to display any kind of data. It provides an extensive API to customize the look and feel of the tree.

"The resignations of Larry Page and Sergey Brin from their roles as CEO and president of Alphabet marked the end of an era. The pair cited changes to Google's all-hands meetings, in which they say they are no longer able to speak freely, as one of the reasons for their departure. But now they're reassuring employees that they are not stepping back from the company. Alphabet's CEO and president, respectively, will remain on the board and ""deeply engaged"" Brin and Page founded Google in 1998, and for the first 11 years were both CEO and president. In 2011, they stepped back to become co-CEOs of a new entity, Alphabet, and hired Sundar Pichai to become CEO of Google. Brin and Page stepped back again in 2015, naming Pichai as CEO of Alphabet too. In the original letter announcing their resignations, Brin and Page wrote, ""We are deeply humbled to have seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment for billions - a bet we made as two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets."" Now, in a letter to employees, they write, ""We will continue talking with Sundar regularly, especially on topics we're passionate about!,"" and explain that they will still be involved in the company. Page and Brin are stepping down amid growing public criticism of the company and its leaders. A New York Times report last month alleged that Google shielded executives accused of sexual misconduct. Earlier this year, employees organized in protest of the company's involvement in the US military's drone program, Project Maven, and the company's development of a censored search engine for China. The pair's resignations were announced on the same day that Alphabet was reported to be facing a federal antitrust probe and dozens of state attorneys general were set to announce a separate probe into Google. ""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,"" Page and Brin write in their letter. ""While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it's time to assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!"" But they also note, ""We are deeply humbled to have seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment for billions - a bet we made as two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets."" The resignations are effective immediately. Pichai will remain CEO of Alphabet and Google.",0,692
"Axiom Space has been selected by NASA to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station. The module will be used as a destination for future commercial space flights. NASA announced this morning that Axiom Space has been selected by the agency to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station. Axiom, led by former ISS program manager Mike Suffredini, will fly the module to the station using a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and attach it to the space station's node 2 forward port. NASA said in its press release that the module will be used as a destination for future commercial space flights. The space station's current configuration can accommodate five people for long-duration missions. Axiom said in a news release that the node would be the first of several modules the company plans to build to expand the station's capacity. Suffredini, Axiom's CEO, said in a statement that the node would be the ""world's first commercial space station."" He also said Axiom plans to begin manufacturing the node in 2019 and fly the first module in 2022. Suffredini said the station would be a ""complement to the ISS,"" which is scheduled to be retired in 2025. NASA said in its press release that the agency will fund the development of the module. ""Axiom will work with NASA to finalize the module's design so it can accept NASA and commercially-developed research payloads,"" the agency said. The announcement comes as NASA transitions the space station from a government-only facility to a commercially-supported platform. Last month, NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing for the development of commercial crew vehicles that will fly astronauts to and from the station beginning in late 2018 or early 2019. The agency also is in the process of developing the Deep Space Gateway, a small space station to be built near the Moon that would serve as a jumping off point for future deep space missions. In addition to Axiom's commercial module, NASA is funding the development of the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), a test module that is scheduled to be launched to the station in April. Mike Suffredini is a real aerospace visionary. When I was working at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) he was the head of the ShuttleISS Program. When he left MSFC, I was told he was going to Houston to work on the new commercial crew program. I was not surprised when he ended up at Axiom.",0,693

"Bitcoin mining uses a huge amount of electricity. A mining setup requires a building, hundreds of high-speed computer servers, a heavy-duty cooling system, and a location that can handle a ton of electricity. All of this costs money and takes time to set up, so Bitcoin mining is a serious business. There are several other cryptocurrencies that are worth mining. Litecoin and Ethereum are two of the more popular options. In 2018, Bitcoin mining will use more electricity than all of Argentina, according to Digiconomist. Even if Bitcoin prices drop, the demand for mining is high enough to keep miners competitive. It is important to note that miners don't have to purchase the actual computers used for mining. They can opt to use a Bitcoin cloud mining service and simply pay for the computing power that they use. This is more cost effective and doesn't require any upfront hardware costs. To learn more about mining, check out this guide. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process. Mining rigs require a large amount of electricity. According to Digiconomist's Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, the estimated annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin is 67.83 TWh. To put that in perspective, the entire country of Argentina used 63.28 TWh of electricity in 2016. This is an important topic because electricity costs money and mining Bitcoin is designed to be profitable. The problem is that the price of Bitcoin is volatile. It can change rapidly, which makes it difficult to predict whether mining will be profitable. In a bull market, the increase in Bitcoin price can offset the rise in mining difficulty. In a bear market, the decline in price can make mining unprofitable. If the price of Bitcoin declines, the mining difficulty will adjust itself to ensure that the block time remains at 10 minutes. This means that if the price of Bitcoin drops 50, miners will stop mining until the difficulty is adjusted to reflect the new price. Bitcoin's price is expected to continue to rise, which means mining will become more profitable. Bitcoin mining is expected to become more energy intensive because the difficulty will increase with the price. According to Crescent Electric Supply Company, the national average cost of a kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the United States is 0.129. This means that one Bitcoin costs 4,758.40 to mine at current prices. This is based on the average energy consumption of 45.30 kWh, which is derived from Difficulty and Network Hash Rate. The cost of electricity is cheaper in certain countries. For example, it is cheaper to mine in Venezuela. According to El Universal, electricity will cost residents dollars per kWh. At this rate, it only costs 0.26 to mine one Bitcoin in Venezuela. Since mining is an energy intensive process, many miners have moved to countries with cheap electricity. This is also known as ""electricity arbitrage."" Iceland has become a popular destination for miners because approximately 100 of the country's energy is produced by renewable sources, which makes it very environmentally friendly. Miners are also moving to Canada because of the country's cheap energy. Quebec and Manitoba are currently home to several Bitcoin mining operations. Quebec's energy is so cheap that a proposal has been made to give citizens free heating in exchange for mining Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is an expensive process, but if you have access to cheap electricity, it is worth it. You can use a Bitcoin mining calculator to determine the profitability of mining Bitcoin in your area.

"An Israeli startup, Nanox, has developed a new type of X-ray machine that generates 3D images. It emits less radiation and costs a fraction of the price of conventional imaging machines. The company's CEO is Dudu Baum, who co-founded the firm with Professor Yuval Zilberman, a serial inventor who holds 80 patents in fields such as telecommunications, semiconductors and bio-medical sensors. Baum said that, ""we have completely reinvented the way imaging is done. We started from scratch, from the chip."" The Nanox machine contains a special chip with a grid of 1,600 x 1,600 miniature detectors that capture all the information in a single X-ray shot. The company has received 5 million in investment so far and expects to raise a further 25 million to bring the product to market in 2018. The new X-ray machine is based on technology developed at Haifa's Technion university. Nanox's system is completely different from conventional machines, which use a single detector and a rotating arm to take multiple X-ray shots. Nanox's system captures all the images at once, using just one shot, thus reducing the amount of radiation and lowering the cost. The result is a 3D image that can be viewed from any angle, in sharp detail. Baum said that, ""if you want to see inside an artery, for example, you can't do it with a single shot. You need to do many shots, from different angles. We can do it with a single shot. If you want to do a CT [computerized tomography] scan, you need to do 600 slices. We can do it with one shot. And there are no moving parts, so there's nothing that can break."" The Nanox machine has a chip with 2.5 million detectors. According to Baum, ""it's 100 times more sensitive than a standard machine."" Another advantage is that it can identify materials such as bone, calcium and metal, so it can also be used for airport security. The company's first machine will be launched in 2018, at a cost of 200,000, a fraction of the price of a conventional X-ray machine. Nanox plans to sell a million machines in the next 10 years, and the total market for X-ray machines is 9 billion a year. The company is now looking to expand its workforce and grow to 200 employees over the next five years. The company has won awards for its technology, including a Wall Street Journal prize and a first place prize at the International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva.",0,702

It isn't currently usable by owners of the device yet, but Apple has previously included hardware that later becomes usable in products. Nest has updated its Hello doorbell with a new version that offers HDR imaging. The video quality upgrade is matched with a price increase to 229. Apple CEO Tim Cook was on hand at the 2018 White House State Dinner on Tuesday, which honored French President Emmanuel Macron, who was in Washington to discuss trade and the Iran nuclear deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Apple may be working on a way to simplify the setup of its HomeKit network of connected devices by introducing a QR code system, with one HomeKit accessory maker already offering the system to customers. A new report suggests Apple is working on a high-end speaker to rival Sonos with premium audio, and potentially integrate with Siri and HomeKit to compete in the connected home space, but an Apple-branded speaker is not expected to arrive until 2017 at the earliest. While Apple's HomeKit platform launched more than a year ago, and new devices continue to roll out, the company's ecosystem for controlling home automation devices and appliances is still missing a key piece: a central hub. Apple's HomeKit platform, designed to connect various devices around the home to be controlled by an iOS device, will be supported in two new Nest thermostats to be launched in the coming months, a report said on Friday. As more HomeKit-compatible devices become available, an early adopter has run into a major problem with HomeKit and his home automation setup: devices outside Apple's HomeKit ecosystem are unsupported. Apple's HomeKit home automation platform will be supported in a new line of Insteon light bulbs, which will also come with a new hub for remote control of a wide variety of devices throughout the home. Following its unveiling in June, the first certified HomeKit accessory is now available for purchase. The Elgato Eve Energy smart plug, which lets users monitor and control powered devices in their home from iOS, is priced at 49.95. In the wake of Monday's reveal of iOS 8.1, Apple on Wednesday published a new support document that sheds further light on the company's HomeKit platform, the protocol for controlling connected home devices via iOS 8. Apple's newly unveiled iOS 8.1 will add support for Apple Pay, but the update will also bring a much-anticipated feature that will let users control connected home devices with their iPhone or iPad. Home automation hubs and accessories manufactured by Lutron are coming to Apple's HomeKit platform, the company announced on Wednesday, promising to bring its ""smart home"" technology to the iOS-powered ecosystem. Ahead of the expected launch of iOS 8.1 this month, support for Apple's HomeKit home automation platform has appeared in the latest beta of the software update, revealing new details about the platform and its compatibility with a wide range of products. Apple's recently announced HomeKit smart home framework for iOS will support a wide variety of hardware, including window shades, appliances, cameras, thermostats, and garage door openers, from companies like Honeywell, iHome, Haier, Kwikset, Schlage, Chamberlain, and more.",0,706
"Researchers have discovered a new Linux backdoor called Symbiote that uses novel evasion techniques to conceal its presence. It is able to scrub any sign of infection from the file system and its malware is encrypted to evade detection. The backdoor has been used in cyberattacks on targets in the financial industry, according to Check Point. The malware uses a two-stage process. First it creates a temporary backdoor with minimal functions that gathers information on the targeted system. ""It scans the host's network configuration, creates a list of installed processes, checks if it's running on a virtual machine (VM) and sends it all back to the command and control (CC) server,"" Check Point researchers wrote in a blog post. The server then sends a second-stage payload, which the researchers dubbed ""the Symbiote,"" that supports a wide range of malicious functions including keylogging, downloading and running other malware, and taking screenshots. ""This second stage of the infection, Symbiote, is encrypted with a password that is unique to the victim, and is packed with a custom packer to avoid detection. Symbiote uses its own encryption scheme and doesn't download the decryption key from the CC, thus evading detection by anti-malware tools,"" the researchers said. The attackers also use a unique password for each target, which makes it more difficult to detect a common infection and helps it bypass antivirus. The researchers said they first discovered the malware in a targeted attack on the financial sector in Italy. The initial infection was found in a software package used by Italian companies to process salaries. ""The first stage backdoor was included in a software package used for processing salaries and managing other payments for employees. The software was created by an Italian company, but it appears that it was compromised and infected with the backdoor without the knowledge of the developers,"" the researchers said. They said the first stage backdoor was disguised as a DLL file and was downloaded from the developer's website to the targeted computer. ""The backdoor's malicious DLL file was signed with a legitimate certificate, stolen from a company called 'Innovative Solutions' from Jordan,"" the researchers said. They said once the DLL was installed, the backdoor would collect information on the targeted system and send it to the CC server. It then downloads the Symbiote payload from the CC. ""The malware operators are using a unique password for each victim to avoid detection by anti-malware tools, and to allow the attackers to remotely control each victim separately, without the risk of accidentally running a command on all the infected machines simultaneously,"" the researchers said. They said the malware operators use a custom CC infrastructure that contains several IP addresses controlled by different domains, all pointing to the same server. ""The attackers create a new server for each new victim, and once they've finished controlling the victim, they stop using the CC server, and abandon the IP address,"" the researchers said. Check Point said the malware was also used in targeted attacks on the financial sector in Japan and Hong Kong.",0,707
"A college student who stole 5 million in cryptocurrencies using SIM swap attacks (hacking the user's phone and using that to gain access to their email and cryptocurrency wallets) has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Nicholas Truglia, 21, was found guilty in a Manhattan court on November 14 for stealing 750,000 in cryptocurrency from one person and 450,000 from another. In addition, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office (DANY) said Truglia was sentenced to pay 762,000 in restitution to his victims, and a further 100,000 to his other victims, with more victims set to be added to the indictment. Truglia was also sentenced to pay a 100,000 fine, in addition to his 10 year prison sentence. The three counts on which Truglia was sentenced were: first-degree identity theft, computer tampering, and grand larceny. Truglia's arrest came after a six-month investigation by the DANY, with the help of the US Secret Service and the New York Police Department. ""This case should serve as a wake-up call to all who own digital currency,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. ""The lucrative allure of virtual currencies continues to incentivize bad actors to exploit unsuspecting investors, and my Office will continue to investigate and prosecute those who do."" Truglia is not the only SIM swapper to be convicted by US authorities this year. In April, another SIM swapper, Joseph Harris, 22, of Massachusetts was sentenced to 10 years in prison for SIM swapping and stealing 14 million worth of cryptocurrencies. Harris and Truglia operated in parallel, with Truglia's scam starting in October 2018, and Harris's starting a month later, in November. Both were eventually arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison, and both were also ordered to pay back the money they stole. Authorities said the two men didn't know each other and were operating in parallel, but according to a Wired report from earlier this year, the two may have crossed paths in a private Telegram group, where hackers would talk about their SIM swapping attacks.

"Tech companies are operating shuttle buses that go all the way to the Central Valley as more and more tech employees move into the area. When tech companies first started transporting employees from San Francisco to their offices in Silicon Valley, the shuttles were small and were considered a novelty. But now, they are huge and take workers from San Francisco to Silicon Valley and even further. Google runs 62 shuttles, Apple has 18, and Facebook has 24. The shuttles have become a symbol of the tensions that exist between tech and the neighborhoods of San Francisco. The shuttles are said to take up space that could be used by public transportation, and there is controversy over the price of the use of public bus stops for the shuttles. In a New York Times article, a real estate agent in San Francisco says that the shuttles are helping to bring more tech workers to the city. ""As much as people hate them, they are part of the reason that the market is so hot in San Francisco right now.""",0,710
"With the rise of cheap small ""Cube Satellites,"" startups are now taking photos and infrared images of factories, retail parking lots, oil tankers, and more and selling these images to hedge funds. Tuesday morning, the TSX hit a record high. I'm not sure what the reason for the surge was, but I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is going to be meeting with the president of the People's Republic of China this week. It seems that the Liberals' move to end the Harper-era free trade talks with China and instead explore a looser approach to trade, has turned out to be a big hit with investors. So far, the Liberals have been able to walk the fine line between keeping the US happy while at the same time, being able to do business with China. With the White House turning into a laughing stock on the world stage, Canada could be in a very strong position to be the go-between. There are many possible reasons why the TSX is hitting record highs, but I think that the Liberal government's plans to normalize trade with China could be one of them. In fact, since the announcement that the Liberals were going to be scrapping the Harper-era free trade talks, there has been a surge in Canadian trade with China. In 2015, the year that the Liberals were elected, Canada exported 20 billion worth of goods to China. The following year, that number doubled. It seems that the Liberal approach to trade with China, the ""progressive trade agenda"" is working. Canada is in a very strong position, with the United States looking to be in a state of decline and China continuing to rise. In order to take advantage of this, the Liberals will need to continue to balance trade between the two nations. So far, the Liberals seem to be doing a good job. Let's hope that continues.

"Microsoft has updated its Xbox Cloud Gaming app for Android, adding support for the dual-screen Surface Duo. Surface Duo users will see a virtual gamepad on one screen and the game itself on the other. Microsoft plans to release the Surface Duo, a dual-screen Android phone, in 2020, and the company is gearing up to support the device by adding support for it in its own apps. Today, the company released an update to the Xbox Cloud Gaming app for Android, adding support for the Surface Duo. With this update, you'll be able to use your Surface Duo to play Xbox games using Microsoft's xCloud service, which streams games from the cloud. As the screens on the Surface Duo are 8.7-inches, the Xbox app will split the screen into two halves; one half will display a virtual gamepad, and the other will display the game itself. As the Surface Duo is still a few months away from launch, it's hard to say how this will work in practice, but it's a good idea that could set the stage for a better mobile gaming experience. The Surface Duo doesn't have a gamepad, so adding virtual controls to the screen is a good way to get around the problem of mobile gaming. That said, a gamepad is always going to be better than virtual controls. Still, the fact that the Surface Duo runs Android means that it will have access to thousands of games on the Play Store, so you won't have to rely on the xCloud service.

"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology works, we do not know how the conclusions are reached. This is a scary thought, especially since many of these algorithms are going to be making decisions for us. For instance, we may find ourselves in court one day, with a jury, a judge and an AI to decide whether we are guilty or not. The good news is that it is possible to understand what is going on under the hood of these black box algorithms. A new method has been devised that will allow us to understand how the algorithms reach the decisions that they do. This method is called deep-Xplore, and it has the potential to change how we view AI technology. The AI Algorithm Industry There are many companies developing algorithms today. Many of these companies rely on AI, and they use algorithms to solve difficult problems. Some of these algorithms are used to predict the weather, while others are used to identify spam. Many of these companies believe that there is no need for their customers to understand how their algorithms work. These companies believe that the algorithms do their jobs well, and they will not need to reveal how the algorithms work. For a long time, this has been the case. The algorithms were hidden behind closed doors, and no one was able to understand how they worked. All that is about to change, and there is a new method in town. The New Method: Deep-Xplore Deep-Xplore is the new method that can allow us to understand how these algorithms work. The method will make it possible for us to look at the way that the algorithms work and understand how they work. In essence, we can look at the algorithm and find out what it is doing. The main reason for this is that the method can show us where the algorithm makes the mistakes. The mistakes are the weak points, and by understanding them, we can understand the strengths of the algorithms. According to the researchers behind the method, the method is highly accurate, and it will be able to detect any mistakes in the algorithms. The method works by probing the algorithm in a variety of ways. It will make small changes to the algorithm and find out how the algorithm reacts to the changes. The changes will be small, and they will not affect the performance of the algorithm. This will give us the ability to understand how the algorithms work. We will be able to understand why the algorithms work the way that they do. How Deep-Xplore Works Deep-Xplore can be used with any black box algorithm. The method can be used to test the algorithms and understand them. The method is not restricted to any one field. You can use it with algorithms in any industry. For instance, you can use the method with AI algorithms that are used to make medical diagnoses. You can also use it with AI algorithms that are used to predict the weather. The method will be able to show you how these algorithms work. You will have a better idea of why the algorithms make the decisions that they do. What this means is that you will be able to use the algorithm in a safer manner. For instance, if you are using an algorithm to make diagnoses in the medical field, you will know exactly why the algorithm is making the diagnoses. If there is an error, the method will show you the error, and you can then correct it. According to the researchers behind the method, Deep-Xplore can be used to detect errors in the algorithm within 20 minutes. The method is fast and accurate. It can also be used with new algorithms. You can use the method to test the algorithms and detect any errors that they may have. The method is expected to be released into the public domain soon. The algorithm will be available to all companies that want to use it. This means that all companies will have the ability to understand how their AI algorithms work. This is a big step in the field of AI. It will allow us to gain a better understanding of how these algorithms work and how to use them safely. There are many companies that will be using the method to find out how their algorithms work. They will be able to find out whether the algorithms have any mistakes. This is a big development in the field of AI. With the new method, we are sure to see the development of new and better algorithms.

"Amazon will acquire MGM Studios for 8.45 billion. It will be the second-largest acquisition in Amazon's history after its purchase of Whole Foods in 2017. The deal shows how Amazon is determined to dominate the entertainment industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Photo: Paul Sakuma (AP) According to a press release, Amazon will pay 8.45 billion for the movie studio, but in the long term it could be much more expensive. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but there were reports that Amazon is paying 8.45 billion to MGM, Variety said. MGM was formed in the 1920s as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was one of the most successful and powerful film studios in Hollywood's history. The company produced Gone with the Wind, Ben Hur, and The Wizard of Oz and is the second oldest movie studio in the world after the French company Gaumont. MGM has been sold and restructured several times, and its most recent iteration was in 2005 as a subsidiary of the media company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Holdings Inc. Amazon is already one of the largest distributors of movies and television programs in the world and the purchase of MGM is another sign of the company's growing ambitions in the entertainment industry. Amazon also produces original content, including the award-winning TV series Transparent and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The company has also attracted a number of high-profile stars, such as Woody Allen, who were hit by the MeToo movement. Jeff Bezos, the head of the company, has made it clear that he is determined to make Amazon the most influential company in the entertainment industry. Amazon has already launched a streaming service to compete with Netflix and in 2017 it acquired the rights to broadcast NFL games. Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein in 2018. Amazon is the world's largest Internet retailer and Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, with a fortune of more than 100 billion. Bezos is also a man who is accused of crimes against humanity. The purchase of MGM is one of the company's largest acquisitions, behind the 14 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017. Amazon also acquired PillPack for 1 billion in June 2018 and Zappos for 1.2 billion in 2009. The company has also invested billions in its other businesses, including Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime. Amazon declined to comment on this article.

"More than 14,000 Etsy workers are striking from 11 to 18 April to protest the company's increase in transaction fees. The workers are asking the company to cancel its fee increase and to offer more transparency. Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, charges its sellers 3.5 of every sale. It's doubling that to 7 to help pay for product placement, payment processing, search traffic and product promotion. ""The Etsy seller community has been at the heart of our business for 13 years, and we will continue to put them at the center of every decision we make,"" Etsy wrote in a statement. The sellers are also asking the company to provide more transparency on the fees it charges, the changes to its search algorithm and the use of staff teams that promote items on the site. They are asking the company to stop closing shops without warning and to reinstate the 10-year-old forums that let sellers communicate with each other. Etsy seller Francesca DeCaro, who helps lead the protest, says that she has seen ""a really dramatic decrease in sales"" since the search change was implemented. DeCaro, who sells handmade jewellery and prints, says that Etsy's priorities have shifted to the large corporations on the site. She believes that the large sellers, with the help of Etsy employees, can game the site's search function to ensure that their products show up more prominently in search results. ""Etsy has changed so much,"" DeCaro says. Etsy has been trying to grow its business by recruiting larger sellers. In 2018, the company launched Etsy Ads, which allows sellers to pay to have their products show up more prominently in search results. The company, which debuted in 2015, has been struggling with slowing growth and fierce competition from larger e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay. Its shares are down 40 from their peak in 2015. Etsy, which says it has 2 million sellers and 39 million buyers, is trying to expand its business to counter the competition. It's doing so by recruiting larger sellers who use the site to set up wholesale businesses. The protest comes at a sensitive time for Etsy. The company announced last week that its CEO, Josh Silverman, will step down after the company reports its first-quarter financial results in May. He'll be replaced by board member and former media executive Rachel Glaser. ""We are committed to giving sellers the support, tools and platform they need to succeed,"" the company said. DeCaro, who has been on the site since 2007, says she is not opposed to the company's growth. But she wants Etsy to communicate better with its sellers. ""The sellers feel that there is a lack of transparency, and we don't understand how the search algorithm works,"" she says. ""We're just asking for transparency.""",0,723

"Karate is a tool that combines API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing, and UI automation into a single framework. It uses BDD syntax and has powerful JSON and XML assertions built-in. Developers can run Karate on any Java-enabled machine, or on a Docker container. Karate provides a framework for Web APIs and Mobile Apps (including hybrid apps). Tests can be executed using the JUnit runner, which provides parallel-execution, or by using a Maven plugin. Sauce Labs supports the testing of mobile apps using Karate. This doc assumes you're familiar with writing Karate tests. See Karate for the details. This will prompt you for the Sauce Labs username and access key. You'll be able to specify a platform to run your tests on. When your tests execute, you will be able to view the results in the Sauce Labs Dashboard. You can also use a Maven plugin to run tests. You will need to configure your Karate Maven plugin to use Sauce Labs, following the steps outlined above. How long should a mobile test be? This is a very subjective question, and depends on the nature of the app you are testing. However, 3 to 5 minutes is a good target. If you have an app that is very intensive, with lots of interactivity, then you may be running your test for 15 minutes or more. If you have an app that is mostly static, with a small number of interactions, then you can probably test the whole thing in 3 minutes. You can also target different test durations for different Sauce Labs platforms. For example, you can target a test duration of 5 minutes for iOS 9.3 and a test duration of 10 minutes for Android 4.4.",0,725
"Amazon has placed an order for 1,000 autonomous driving systems from Plus, a startup founded in 2016. Plus is set to go public soon with a valuation of 3.3 billion. The reason for Amazon's interest in Plus's technology is unclear. The systems Plus will sell to Amazon are a far cry from a full-fledged autonomous driving system. They are capable of identifying people, cars, and other objects in the car's path, but they do not actively direct the car. Instead, they send information to the driver, who can then decide how to react. The Wall Street Journal reports that it's unclear whether Amazon will use the systems for its own delivery vehicles or will sell them as a service to others. It seems possible that the systems will be used by Amazon as a service to deliver packages to customers' cars. As with many of the moves Amazon makes, there's no real way to know what Amazon has in mind with this order. But it will be interesting to see how the company incorporates autonomous driving technology into its business.",0,726

"Over the last two years, researchers have rewritten nearly every major chapter in our galaxy's history due to working with better data. In 2018, the European spacecraft Gaia released a second batch of data that, for the first time, allowed astronomers to study the positions and movements of individual stars. With that information, the team could trace the stars' motions backward in time to see where they came from. This was akin to rewinding a tape to see how the Milky Way assembled from bits of smaller galaxies that flew together. Last week, the team presented a video of the Milky Way's history. An annotated version of the video can be found here. ""We are trying to understand the universe in which we live,"" said study leader Carme Gallart, an astronomer at Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in the Canary Islands. The researchers have already learned that the Milky Way's present-day spiral shape was not always present. Instead, it formed when the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, each the size of the Magellanic Clouds, crashed together 11 billion years ago. ""It was quite a surprise,"" Gallart said. ""I was expecting an early spiral galaxy, but not this kind of galaxy."" The Milky Way's origins The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are the two biggest galaxies in the Local Group, a collection of more than 50 galaxies. While Andromeda is approaching the Milky Way at 250,000 miles per hour (400,000 kmh), don't expect a collision anytime soon. Astronomers think the two galaxies will collide in about 4 billion years, but right now they are separated by about 2.5 million light-years of space. When the galaxies do finally meet, they won't crash together like two cars in an intersection. Instead, Andromeda's gravity will warp the Milky Way, stretching our galaxy out into a long, thin filament. The two galaxies will pass through each other, leaving Andromeda slightly larger than it was before, and slightly smaller than the Milky Way. ""The big question is: Why are there spiral galaxies?"" Gallart said. To trace the history of the Milky Way, the researchers focused on the galaxy's oldest stars. These stars, called population II stars, formed early in the universe and have very low metal content. As a result, these stars contain the same mixture of elements that was present in the early universe. Population II stars are also very dim, making them hard to find and study. Gaia's dataset included the positions and movements of more than a billion stars. Among those stars, the researchers found 33,000 population II stars. By analyzing these stars' motions, they found that the Milky Way was not the only galaxy that helped to build the Milky Way. Instead, the Milky Way assembled from the pieces of lots of little galaxies. For instance, the Milky Way's halo - the sphere of stars and gas that surrounds the main disk of the galaxy - is made of stars from 13 different galaxies. ""The halo is the fossil record of all the little galaxies that merged together,"" Gallart said. In addition, the researchers found that the Milky Way's disk was made of at least eight smaller galaxies. In comparison, Andromeda's disk contains stars from only two or three little galaxies. ""The disk of the Milky Way is quite peculiar,"" Gallart said. About 11 billion years ago, the Milky Way and Andromeda smashed together. The resulting collision stretched out the Milky Way, which was a small, flat galaxy at the time. As the Milky Way grew, it gobbled up other little galaxies, including the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. To learn more about the Milky Way's history, the researchers also traced the motions of a class of stars called Cepheids. These young stars have a very tight relationship between their brightness and pulsation periods, which is handy for astronomers. As Cepheids age, they become less luminous, so their pulsation periods get longer. If a Cepheid is farther away from the sun, it appears fainter and pulses more slowly. ""You can compare the real pulsation period with the apparent pulsation period,"" Gallart said. ""This allows you to determine the distance to the star."" This technique is called the period-luminos",0,729
"Scientists in China have developed an extremely fast charging technology that can charge a lithium-ion battery to up to 60 percent capacity in under six minutes. The technology involves a new anode, but also a new cooling system that keeps the batteries from overheating. A new method for growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) directly onto a silicon surface has been developed by University of Illinois researchers. The technique is the first to produce large-scale CNTs on a silicon surface and could lead to nanotube integration into silicon chips. Silicon-based electronics have been reigning for several decades and could continue to do so for the next few decades, but there is a lot of excitement around graphene as an alternative material for future electronic devices. Graphene is an extremely good conductor of heat and electricity, and its other intrinsic properties make it an ideal candidate to replace silicon in electronic devices. Now, researchers at Rice University have made a breakthrough in the science of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) by developing a new method to grow GNRs on silicon. The University of Minnesota's School of Physics and Astronomy has developed a new form of carbon nanotube-based electronics that are faster, smaller, more heat-tolerant, and more durable than previous forms of electronics. Scientists at Stanford University have created a new type of carbon nanotube that is capable of transmitting electricity as efficiently as copper. The results, published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, show that the new nanotubes could be used to make electrical wires that are more efficient, more resilient, and lighter than copper wires. The world's first nanotech chip that can process optical signals and electrical signals simultaneously has been developed by IBM. The new chip was developed at IBM's Watson Research Center and will lead to a new class of optical-electrical-optical (OEO) devices that can be used in future optical networks. Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have discovered a method for growing carbon nanotubes on a silicon wafer. The discovery paves the way for the next generation of high-performance computer chips and may lead to the development of smaller and more efficient semiconductors, which could revolutionize the electronics industry. A team of researchers from MIT and Samsung have created the world's thinnest nanotube transistor, which is only one nanometer thick. The nanotube is the thinnest semiconducting filament ever, and will lead to the creation of ultra-fast electronic chips. Researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have discovered a way to make single-walled carbon nanotubes self-assemble into uniform arrays of nanoscale electronics components. The process is similar to techniques used in the semiconductor industry, and could lead to the creation of nanotube semiconductors that are superior to silicon-based semiconductors.",0,730

"While CRISPR technology has the potential to help many people, it also has the potential to be used as a dangerous weapon. The technology works by editing genes within living things. This technology could have a lot of potential to be used to cure diseases, or to be used to improve crops. Unfortunately, it could also be used as a weapon of mass destruction. Recently, the US government announced that it would be making funding available to three research projects that are focused on improving the safety and reliability of the technology. The government will be making 65 million available to fund these projects, and the money will be coming from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The three projects are being developed by Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Broad Institute. The three projects that are being funded will be working on three separate parts of the technology. The first project will be working on making the technology safer by limiting the ability to change a gene to a certain area. The second project will be focused on detecting unauthorized use of the technology. Finally, the third project will be working on developing methods to reverse the effects of the technology. The US government is not the only one that is concerned about the potential misuse of the technology. The government of the United Kingdom has also been working on ways to prevent the use of CRISPR as a weapon. The UK government has announced that it will be spending around 70 million on a new research center that will be focused on gene editing technology. The research center will be focused on using the technology for medical use. The announcement of the three funding projects comes just a few months after a Russian scientist claimed that he had edited the genes of two human babies. The scientist, He Jiankui, claimed that he had edited the genes of the babies to prevent them from getting the HIVAIDS virus. The claim was widely condemned by the scientific community. The scientists said that the experiment was unethical, and that the CRISPR technology is still too unreliable to be used in humans. Many scientists have called for a moratorium on using the CRISPR technology in humans.",0,732

"Microsoft's DirectStorage API has arrived for Windows. The API allows games to stream tremendous amounts of data from an NVMe solid-state drive to a GPU without needing a CPU to be involved. It's a major improvement over the current situation, which requires that the CPU process the data. This creates a bottleneck in the process, which can introduce significant lag. At the moment, games are limited to using the CPU to access the data on your storage drive, which creates a bottleneck that can introduce noticeable lag. By allowing the GPU to access the data directly, the lag is eliminated. The result is a significant boost to performance that will allow for more fluid, immersive game play. Unfortunately, at least for the moment, the only GPUs that support this functionality are the Quadro RTX 4000, 5000, 6000, 8000, and Titan RTX. That is expected to change in the months ahead, but it's a fairly limited rollout at this point. Even so, it's a good move, and one that ultimately benefits gamers. The move is also a solid indicator that the gaming industry is slowly moving away from the hard drives and magnetic tape storage of the past and into the solid-state drive territory of the future.

"Deep fakes or videos created using artificial intelligence technology and these videos are increasingly common and easy to make. The US government has taken notice of this technology and its potential to be abused. The House Intelligence Committee, at the request of California Representative Adam Schiff, has called on companies like Facebook and Twitter to look into ways of identifying and combating deep fakes. In a letter to the companies, the committee asks them to consider creating a database that could be used to identify these videos. The letter reads in part, ""As deep fake technology becomes more advanced and more accessible, it could pose a threat to United States public discourse and national security, with broad and concerning implications for offensive active measures campaigns targeting the United States."" This database would act as a fingerprint for videos so that companies like Facebook and Twitter can stop them from being uploaded to their platforms. YouTube has already built a database that does this and the committee wants to see others do the same. Democrats and Republicans are both concerned that these videos could be used to spread misinformation about political figures. Many have pointed to the use of deep fakes to make it look like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slurring her speech as an example of how dangerous these videos can be.

"While there has been remarkable progress on object detection and re-identification in recent years, little attention has been focused on accomplishing the two tasks in a single network to improve detection and re-identification performance simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-task Joint Multi-Instance Learning (MJMIL) framework to integrate object detection and re-identification into one unified network. In particular, we formulate the detection and re-identification problem as a joint multi-instance learning (MIL) task. The framework can be trained with large-scale weakly labeled data and does not require strongly labeled bounding boxes or instances for training. In addition, the framework is trained and tested as a single network without requiring any post-processing. We evaluate the framework on two benchmark datasets (VIPER and Market-1501) and show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection and re-identification methods.",0,739
"This thread discusses projects that were developed but never became profitable. While we hear a lot about successful ventures, there is still a lot to learn from completed, yet unsuccessful, projects. Every entrepreneur goes through a failed project, and this thread is about sharing the stories behind these projects and what was learnt. If you're an entrepreneur and would like to share your story, please answer the following questions. 1) What is the name of your business? 2) What did you sell? 3) How long was the business running? 4) What was the revenue, profit and profit margin? 5) What went wrong? 6) What would you do differently? 7) What did you learn? Example (by Brent from ) I ran a company called PageWise, a publishing company for high school students. We taught them how to publish, edited their books and designed covers, and then printed the books and sold them on Amazon. We sold books, but we weren't profitable. We ran the business for a year. Revenue: 100,000 Profit margin: -12,000 Our biggest problem was the length of the sales cycle. The process for each book took about 6 months (editing, cover design, printing), so we didn't have much cashflow. We were using all of our profits to pay for new books, and that was holding us back. I would focus more on the sales cycle and cashflow. We had a handful of high school students who wanted to publish, but it took so long that many of them gave up on us. We could have had a lot more money if we had made the process a bit faster. I learned that I need to focus on cashflow. With PageWise, we were bringing in money, but we had too many expenses and they were all up front. We needed to make the sales cycle shorter or make the books cheaper, or both. Always a great lesson to learn from. I've had some other ideas that never made it off the ground, but the one that I learnt the most from was a community I ran (back when I was a teenager). I would run an article on the community once every day, and the community would write comments on the article. The whole community revolved around the commenting system. I would then pick the best comment and that person would become the ""comment of the day"" winner. This community was a great way for me to practice my writing and to learn about website programming (it was built in PHP). It was also the first community that I was ever involved in, which is a great way to learn about how people interact. My community never made money because I never tried to make money from it. It was just a project that I did for fun and to learn from. What I learnt from the community was that people are lazy. Every time I would go away on holidays for more than a day, my community would start to die. People are just lazy, and if you don't have something to give to them every day then they will just ignore you. I have learnt that people need constant stimulation from you, or they will forget about you. The other thing I learnt was that communities take a lot of time to build. It took me years to build my community, and it would take the same amount of time for someone else to build their own community. I still have my community and it's a great source of traffic. I hope other people will post their stories here. I have started an online business and was running for 2 years but due to lack of funds and other business commitments I had to close it.

"This article covers five common types of tech interview questions. They include trivia-type questions, questions asking about technical specifics, questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording, and questions with unspecified behavior or edge cases. The best way to prepare for technical interviews is to practice solving technical problems and reviewing technical concepts. But no matter how much you practice, the technical interview questions you'll actually get will surprise you. In my experience, there are a few common types of tech interview questions. Let's take a look at some of them and consider strategies for answering them. Above all else, remember to breathe. There are lots of reasons for taking a deep breath. Deep breaths can help you calm down and think about the question. They can help you make sure you understand the question and that you're getting what the interviewer is asking. They can help you buy time and formulate a response. If you're in an in-person interview, you can also take a sip of water. This is a great way to buy yourself a few seconds to formulate a response. In-person interviews can be a little nerve-wracking, and having a little water to drink can help you get through the interview. Different types of interview questions have different strategies. Trivia-type questions are often used to help an interviewer assess your familiarity with a technology. For example, you might be asked to describe the differences between two programming languages. In this situation, you have two strategies. One is to try to answer the question directly. The other is to try to dodge the question. If you're able to answer the question directly, great! Just answer the question. If you don't know the answer, it's okay. In some cases, it's better to admit that you don't know the answer to a question than to try to make something up. If you're unable to answer the question directly, you can try to dodge it. You can reframe the question or ask a question back to get more information. In this situation, you're trying to get back on solid ground so you can answer the question. For example, you might be asked a question about which version of a library to use. In this situation, you can ask a question back. You can try to get more information on why the interviewer is asking the question, what the priorities are, and what the tradeoffs are. In some cases, the interviewer is looking for a specific answer. In other cases, the interviewer is trying to assess how you think about tradeoffs. Questions asking about technical specifics are often used to help an interviewer assess your ability to think about how different parts of a system work together. In many cases, you can get more information by asking questions back. You might ask about specific use cases or business requirements. In many cases, it's okay to ask the interviewer to clarify a question. The interviewer might be using terminology that you're not familiar with. If you are familiar with the question, you can answer it directly. If you're not familiar with the question, you can ask the interviewer to rephrase the question. You can also try to answer a similar question. If the question asks about how you would use one piece of technology, you might answer a similar question about a different piece of technology. In many cases, it's okay to answer a similar question. Some interview questions are designed to be tricky. The interviewer might be looking for a specific answer. In this situation, you can ask the interviewer to clarify the question. You can also try to answer the question. If you're able to, great! If you're not, you can ask the interviewer to rephrase the question. Often, there isn't a right answer to these kinds of questions. In many cases, the interviewer is trying to assess how you think about a problem. You can also try to reframe the question or answer a similar question. In many cases, the interviewer is looking for a way to assess how you think about the problem. In these cases, it's okay to answer a similar question. Some interview questions are designed to assess your ability to think about corner cases or edge cases. In many cases, there isn't a right answer to these kinds of questions. Instead, the interviewer is trying to assess how you think about a problem. In these cases, you can try to answer the question directly. If you're not able to, you can try to reframe the question or answer a similar question. In the case of corner cases, you can often",0,742

"This article discusses tips and tricks for using SSH more effectively. It covers how to add a second factor to your SSH login, use agent forwarding safely, exit from stuck SSH sessions, and more. Here is a collection of tips and tricks I've picked up over the years that can help you use SSH more effectively. In case you haven't noticed, it is possible to connect to an SSH server with a key-based login without having to type a passphrase. This is convenient, but there is a risk that it exposes you to a man-in-the-middle attack. You can avoid that risk by using SSH with the ssh-agent and a passphrase-protected private key. I'll demonstrate this technique using a Mac, but it will work similarly on any other platform. If you run ssh-add -l at this point, you should see your passphrase-protected key listed. You can also run ssh-add -d, which will disable the passphrase-protected key. This might seem like more work, but it's really not, because the ssh-agent runs in the background until you explicitly kill it. To verify this, run ssh-add -l. You should see your passphrase-protected key listed. Now run ssh-add -d, which will disable the passphrase-protected key. Then run ssh-add -l, and you'll see that the passphrase-protected key is not listed. SSH is probably the most widely used technology to securely access remote machines. As the name implies, Secure Shell (SSH) was originally designed to provide a secure replacement for the original telnet protocol, which sent passwords in clear text. Like many other Unix utilities, SSH has a lot of options and features, some of which are not well known. Here are some tips and tricks for using SSH more effectively. SSH is designed to securely access remote machines using public-key cryptography. It's usually more secure to use SSH key-based login rather than password-based login. Key-based login eliminates the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack, because the SSH server is configured to accept only a key, not a password. This is a secure method, as long as you use SSH with a passphrase-protected key. If you don't use a passphrase, you risk falling victim to a man-in-the-middle attack. But if you use a passphrase-protected key, there is a risk that someone can get access to the machine you're using to generate the SSH key. In that case, the intruder could use ssh-copy-id to copy the key to another account. The solution to this risk is to generate the SSH key on a machine that is in a secure location and never let anyone else access that machine. I call this machine the ""key machine."" The first step in creating a key-based SSH login is to generate an SSH key pair. To do this, log in to the key machine, and run ssh-keygen. This will prompt you for a passphrase. You can then use ssh-copy-id to copy your public key to your remote account. To add a second factor to your SSH login, you'll need to install a program that generates one-time passcodes. One such program is Google Authenticator, which is available for Android, iOS, and Blackberry devices. Then log in to the remote server, and run ssh-copy-id to copy your public key to your remote account. Next, run google-authenticator to configure your key machine. This will prompt you to enter a user name, a secret, and an issuer. The user name is the name of the account you're using on the remote server. The secret is a random number. The issuer is the domain name of the server. You can specify the domain name with the -I option. This will generate a QR code, which you can scan with the Google Authenticator app. It will then prompt you for a passcode, which you can get from your Google Authenticator app. You should now see a 6-digit passcode that refreshes every 30 seconds. Enter the passcode, and the QR code will be saved in the remote account. Now you can log in to the remote account, and instead of being prompted for a password, you'll be prompted for a passcode. To get the passcode, simply scan the QR code displayed on your screen with your mobile device, and enter the passcode. If you have multiple accounts, you can copy the QR code to other accounts and set up passcode authentication for each one. After you set up",0,745
"Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO and former Alphabet executive chairman, has announced his decision to step down as a board member of Alphabet. He will be retained in the company as a technical advisor to the management team. Alphabet is the parent company of Google and a host of other companies. Schmidt has been a member of the board for 18 years and he has been its executive chairman for the last eight years. In a blog post, he says he will be able to dive into technical issues and spend more time on science and technology issues. After spending eight years as the CEO of Google, he stepped down from the role in 2011. Larry Page took over the role and he was appointed as the executive chairman of the company. Page and Sergey Brin, the other co-founder of Google, have been the leaders of Alphabet ever since. Schmidt has been an important part of the growth of the company. He joined Google when the company was still in its early stages. He managed to expand the company by making strategic acquisitions and helping it to increase its market share. With Schmidt stepping down, there is no doubt that Alphabet is moving in a new direction. According to reports, the board has been working hard in the last two years to reduce its size.

"Apple has been criticized for placing its own apps at the top of the App Store search results. While Apple denies the accusations, an analysis of search terms showed that for some searches, Apple's apps were ranked at the top of the list. This caused competitors to argue that it was unfair. Now, the European Commission has launched an investigation to determine whether Apple has violated European competition law. ""The Commission has received complaints from app providers in the European Economic Area, claiming that Apple's App Store does not comply with the European Union's antitrust rules,"" said European Commission spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso. ""The Commission has decided to open a formal investigation."" The probe is not expected to be completed anytime soon. Apple has not commented on the investigation. The App Store launched in 2008 and has continued to grow. Currently, the App Store has over 2 million apps available for download. Apple is often criticized by developers for taking too much of a cut of the sales and not being fair to them. For developers, the App Store has been the best way to distribute apps. However, the lack of competition has made it more difficult for developers to market their apps. Apple has always been the one to decide what apps get to be featured on the App Store. ""The App Store is the most important distribution channel for developers, who have no choice but to follow Apple's rules,"" said developer Samuel Brault. ""If Apple does something that's bad for developers, they can't do anything about it. Developers can only reach users through Apple, and Apple has the power to destroy apps or developers if it feels like it."" Brault wrote a blog post in February in which he shared his experience with the App Store. He was forced to remove his app, DC Unlocker, from the App Store in 2015. Apple told him that his app violated a rule that it had created just for him. He's not the only developer to have a run-in with Apple. ""I think the App Store is a mess,"" said Brault. ""Apple has been very greedy in the last years and developers have been getting less and less power. That's why I think the App Store needs to be opened to competition."" Apple has never given a reason for why its apps are always the first to be seen when using the search function on the App Store. ""I'm a little puzzled by this,"" said analyst Jan Dawson. ""It's not clear to me why the European Commission is taking this up now. They're making a big deal about it being a formal investigation, but I'm not clear why it's a formal investigation now."" Dawson said that the EU could investigate the App Store's search results and conclude that Apple is not being fair to developers. However, it would be hard to come up with a solution that wouldn't cause problems with consumers. ""It's a really thorny issue,"" said Dawson. ""It's not clear to me what remedies could possibly be available in this case. It's a really tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the EU could really do about it."" The investigation was not a surprise to many, as there have been several complaints from developers that their apps are being buried in the search results. While Apple has not commented on the investigation, it has denied the accusations in the past.",0,747
"Apple announced updates to iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, TV OS, and WatchOS in the opening keynote for WWDC2020. Public betas will start next month. iOS 14 will introduce new capabilities for iPad, a rebuilt Maps app, and a new HomePod. iPadOS will include multiple windows, a redesigned home screen, support for external drives, and Apple Pencil improvements. The Apple Watch, TV, and iPad are all about to get some very important updates. And no, it's not just a new watch face or a better remote. The company is really giving us the goods. SEE ALSO: Apple's iOS 13.3.1 update fixes iPhone 11 Pro's location tracking issues During its annual WWDC developer conference on Monday, the company announced updates to iOS 13, iPadOS, macOS Catalina, watchOS 6, and tvOS 13. Public betas will be available next month, and Apple says the software will be officially released this fall. Some of the updates are pretty standard. There's the usual round of app updates and changes to Apple services like Apple News, Apple Music, and Apple Podcasts. But there are also some notable additions that will change the way you use your devices. Apple's big announcements for its operating systems are below. Apple Watch: New faces, a dedicated App Store, and more The Apple Watch will receive two new faces: a modular face called ""Gradient"" that can display up to nine complications (i.e. information like your next calendar event) and a ""X-Large"" version of its ""X-Large"" analog face for showing more details at once. The Apple Watch will also get its own App Store, a new Voice Memos app, the ability to use the speaker and microphone for phone calls, and an Apple Books app. A new Noise app can also detect the decibel level of the room you're in and warn you if it's too loud. The Apple Watch will also track your menstrual cycle (and when you're fertile), and a new Trends tab in the Activity app will show you 90 days' worth of your activity and how you compare to the previous 90 days. Finally, Apple is also introducing a new version of its Apple Watch for the first time since 2016. The Apple Watch Series 5 has an always-on screen that doesn't dim and is still on when you lift your wrist to check the time. The Series 5 starts at 399. iPad: External drive support, mouse support, a Home screen redesign, and more iPad will get its own dedicated operating system with iPadOS. The iPad will now support external storage (including thumb drives), as well as mouse support. The iPad will also get a new Home screen with widgets, a redesigned Photos app, and new multitasking features for apps that support it (think using two apps at once). There's also a new ""Dark Mode"" to make your iPad easier to read at night. The Apple Pencil is also getting a new ""Pencil Kit"" for developers to support handwriting and drawing across iPadOS. iPhone: A redesigned Maps app, Memoji stickers, and a new Look Around feature iOS 13 will get a redesigned Maps app. Apple says the new app is faster and more accurate with better information about roads, beaches, parks, and buildings. It will also have more detailed ground cover, better pedestrian data, and more precise addresses. The new app will be available in the U.S. by the end of 2019 and in more countries in 2020. There's also a new ""Look Around"" feature that gives you a street-level view of a city, similar to Google's Street View. It uses the same 3D rendering technology as the Apple Maps ""Flyover"" feature. Apple's new Memoji stickers are exactly what you'd expect. They're customizable stickers based on your Memoji that you can send to friends in iMessage. Mac: A new Music app, Sidecar, and Screen Time The Mac is getting an updated Music app and a new Sidecar feature that lets you use an iPad as a secondary display for your Mac.

"Matt Dupree recently wrapped up a job search after around 65 days. During that time, Dupree applied for 16 jobs, attended seven interviews, and received two offers. Many companies required him to create a profile on their careers page in order to submit his resume. ""It was a bummer to submit my resume and never hear back,"" he said. ""I put a lot of time into crafting a resume and cover letter, and it's always disappointing to not receive any feedback."" The recruitment software company iCIMS, which surveyed 500 full-time employees, found that Dupree is not alone: 96 of candidates expect at least a basic acknowledgement of their application. Employers, meanwhile, are aware of the problem. In 2018, the Society of Human Resource Management found that 51 of employers don't send a confirmation email to applicants. Of those who don't, 44 said they don't have the resources to send such emails, while 21 said that they didn't believe applicants wanted to receive them. Many companies have taken steps to communicate better with candidates. There are now websites that notify you when an employer views your resume or cover letter. Google Hire, a recruiting software tool, allows you to add automatic emails that go out when an applicant is rejected. And many companies have taken a page from Amazon's playbook and created ""candidate experience"" teams. But automated emails and ""candidate experience"" teams can only do so much to improve the application process. An estimated 75 of all applicants to open jobs are not qualified. And while companies have made it easier to apply to jobs in recent years - some now accept LinkedIn profiles as a form of application - the sheer volume of unqualified applications can make the hiring process longer. Ultimately, there's no easy way to make the application process better for applicants without making it worse for employers. ""There's a balance,"" said Ware. ""You have to make sure you're giving the right people a positive experience, but also make sure that you're not giving a negative experience to the people who are not a good fit."" In other words, there's a reason employers aren't rushing to change their hiring process.",0,750
"Research on psychedelic compounds has boomed in the last few years. Many companies are now springing up in the psychedelic sector with the aim of creating new analogs of drugs such as LSD and MDMA in the hopes of developing therapeutic treatments for a variety of mental health conditions. While many of these substances have great therapeutic potential, they can also be abused as recreational drugs. This has led to fears that some of the drugs may become widely used by the public before they are properly understood. To avoid this, the Beckley Foundation has begun running an information campaign on psychedelic drugs called ""Psychedelic Liberty."" The main aims of this campaign are to highlight the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, and to help educate the general public about them. The campaign hopes to engage members of the public and raise awareness of the issues surrounding psychedelic compounds. The Beckley Foundation believes that, if a substance is to be legalised, it is important that the public are well informed and able to make informed choices regarding their mental health. The campaign has released a series of short videos which discuss the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs and the need to legalise them for medical use. Several psychedelic compounds, such as MDMA and psilocybin, have shown great therapeutic potential for the treatment of various mental health conditions. Psychedelics and psychotherapy have been shown to help people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A 2011 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that, when combined with psychotherapy, MDMA could help treat PTSD more effectively than psychotherapy alone. A recent review of 16 studies found that MDMA could be used to treat social anxiety in autistic adults. Many psychedelics, including LSD and psilocybin, have shown great promise for the treatment of addiction. A 2014 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that LSD could reduce the craving for alcohol, and a 2014 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that LSD could reduce the craving for tobacco. Psychedelics have been used to help treat alcohol addiction for years. A 2012 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that psilocybin could reduce the craving for alcohol. Many psychedelics have been used to help treat depression. MDMA has shown great promise for treating depression, and a 2013 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that psilocybin could help treat depression in patients with advanced cancer. Psychedelics have also been used to treat anxiety. LSD has been used to treat anxiety disorders, and a 2014 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that psilocybin could be used to treat anxiety in patients with advanced cancer. While there are many potential benefits of psychedelic compounds, they have also been shown to carry risks. While the risks associated with psychedelics are much lower than those associated with alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, they are still present. While many people have positive experiences with psychedelic drugs, a significant minority report having difficult or traumatic experiences. A 2008 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that 7.6 of participants reported having a difficult experience after taking psilocybin. While psychedelics are generally non-addictive, they can still lead to psychological dependence. As psychedelic drugs are currently illegal, they are often sold on the black market. This means that many of the substances available on the street are of unknown purity and strength. This can lead to overdose and other risks. There are other risks associated with psychedelics. The research carried out so far is extremely limited due to the classification of psychedelics as Schedule I substances. This means that psychedelics have been lumped in with other Schedule I drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and are thought to have no therapeutic potential. As a result, researchers have had extreme difficulty in carrying out clinical studies on psychedelic compounds. This is not only a problem for researchers, but also for potential patients.

"Foxconn CEO Terry Gou has announced that Foxconn will start manufacturing iPhones in India and that the company is currently in talks with the Indian government regarding investment terms. It is expected that Apple's primary manufacturing partner in India will be Wistron, which has been making iPhones in the country since 2016. Gou did not say which iPhone model (s) will be manufactured in India, but local assembly is expected to start as early as this year. The production of iPhones in India is expected to help Apple lower its prices in the country. Apple has been struggling in the Indian market, where the iPhone is a niche product due to its high price tag. Analysts say Apple's share of the Indian market is expected to stagnate at around 2 unless it broadens its distribution and pricing strategy.

"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so please correct me if I am wrong) it is a new protocol for transferring and storing data that is less centralized than the internet we know today. For example, people can run a node on their computer to create a peer-to-peer network, which is more democratic than the centralized servers of companies like Facebook. Solid is designed to work with the existing internet, but it is an attempt to solve some of the problems with it. For example, people will be able to create their own ""pods"" or little data centers, and these pods can interact with other pods. These pods are more secure than the internet is today, and they are more stable because they are not dependent on the stability of centralized companies. In the same way that the internet revolutionized communication, Solid is supposed to revolutionize how we store and transfer data. I think Solid could be a very powerful tool for artists, but it will be a challenge for them to adapt to the technology. I really like the idea of people creating their own pods and hosting their own data. This is very relevant for artists because we often depend on technology that we don't control and have very little power over. For example, I am constantly frustrated by how Facebook is designed. I use it because it's the best way to reach an audience, but the interface is terrible. I have no control over how my art is displayed on the site. The layout is inflexible. And when Facebook decides to change the interface, I am left scrambling to figure out what's going on. As artists, we have very little control over how we are perceived online, and Solid seems to be a way of taking that control back. I've heard that Solid will allow artists to create pods for their art, and that these pods will be able to interact with other pods. This is really interesting because it means that artists will be able to create an independent website that is still connected to a larger network. It will allow artists to have their own space and control over their work, but it will also allow them to interact with other artists. For example, an artist could create a pod for his or her art and share it with other artists. They could then decide to collaborate on a piece by interacting with each other's pods. One of the most interesting aspects of Solid is that it is supposed to be a neutral platform. I think this is important because it will prevent people from using it to promote a political agenda. Solid's only goal is to create a better internet. It's not trying to stop the spread of fake news or regulate hate speech. The only regulation that it will impose is the regulation of its own structure, which is crucial for it to work. I think it's important that people understand this, because I don't want to see Solid used as a political tool. It's also important to note that Solid will only be as useful as people make it. It's not going to be a magical device that will automatically solve the world's problems. Solid is a tool, and it is up to us to use it properly. I think this is important because many people are concerned about the internet, but they are not willing to do anything about it. I've only been following Solid for a short time, but I am really interested in the project. I'm not sure if I will be able to use it to benefit my work, but I'm excited to see where it goes.",0,757
"Waymo has begun to ramp up its operations by offering an early rider program to selected customers. These customers are selected based on ZIP code and are required to sign up to use the service. Waymo will be deploying a fleet of Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans with sensors, and cameras. These vehicles have been specially adapted to be used as autonomous vehicles. Waymo will be using the early rider program to learn more about the needs and preferences of the public. The early rider program is part of the company's strategy to gather real-world experiences about the use of autonomous vehicles. Waymo will be working closely with these early riders to gather feedback on how the system is performing and what areas need improvement.

"While Google shut down Project Loon earlier this year, some of the technology remained in development. Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) links can create a 20Gbps broadband link from two points, as long as there's a clear line of sight between the two. This means the technology can't be used in cities, where high rises and other tall buildings would interrupt the line of sight. Google's researchers found a use for the technology that may save lives. When natural disasters strike, communication networks are usually one of the first things to be affected. Rebuilding the networks is critical to relief and rescue efforts, but getting the equipment into affected areas is often a challenge. FSOC links can be deployed on the ground, or using aerial drones to link a few points. This can create a network in a matter of hours, which could help victims communicate and allow rescue workers to coordinate. Google's researchers tested the technology with a few sets of links over a distance of 16 kilometers. One set of links was on the ground, while another set was on towers at the same height as the ground links. Another set of links were at a higher elevation. The researchers found that the higher links were the most reliable, as they were less affected by environmental conditions. They did find that the technology doesn't work well with tree cover, which is another reason that it can't be used in cities. Google is working with OSOM Technologies, a company that is already using FSOC links to provide broadband internet to rural areas in India. The two companies are working with the government in Andhra Pradesh to create a temporary network for use in disaster relief.",0,763
"Nvidia's Perlmutter supercomputer is the fastest in the world for AI workloads. Its first task will be to build a 3D map of the universe. The map will help scientists create simulations of the universe, which will help us understand the effects of dark matter, dark energy, and gravity on the cosmos. Perlmutter is an AI supercomputer. It has 100 GPU-accelerated servers, which use the new Nvidia V100 Tensor Core GPUs. The supercomputer is installed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is operated by the National Science Foundation. It's been used to conduct a Deep Learning Survey, which looks at how galaxies in the universe have changed over the past seven billion years. The survey used a method called gravitational lensing, which uses the gravity of massive objects to bend light. It's then used to help astronomers understand how the universe has changed over the years. The survey studied 2,300 galaxy clusters. This has resulted in an enormous amount of data that needs to be processed. The supercomputer has 100 GPUs, which makes it one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world. ""Science is always about pushing the boundaries of knowledge,"" said Alan Dabney, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ""I think deep learning is going to be an extremely powerful tool that we can use to analyze astronomical data. The scale of the data that astronomers produce is gigantic, and we have to cope with that somehow."" ""The promise of using GPUs in combination with deep learning algorithms to analyze huge datasets is great, and this is particularly exciting for me as an astronomer,"" he added. The data for the survey is collected using the Dark Energy Survey, which is a 570-megapixel camera that is located on a telescope in Chile. The survey is named after dark matter and dark energy, which is believed to make up 95 of the universe. ""Perlmutter will allow scientists to analyze huge datasets in a fraction of the time that it would take with slower systems,"" said Sharan Bruhadeshwar, a researcher at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. ""The time saved in the data analysis will mean more time for the science itself, a change that will have ripple effects across many areas of discovery."" ""We're trying to make sense of the universe, and the universe is really big,"" said Dabney. ""We don't understand a lot about it. We're trying to understand the physics of the universe. We're trying to understand the physics of the stuff we're made of, the stars and the planets we see. We're trying to understand the physics of the stuff we can't see, the dark matter, dark energy, and the like.""",0,764
"Facebook Gaming is launching on Android today. It is Facebook's attempt to take on the streaming community. The app will be available on iOS once it is approved on the app store. Facebook Gaming aims to give people more of what they want when they're looking for a gaming-specific community and video content. Facebook says they are partnering with over 50 game publishers and creators to have content on the platform. Facebook Gaming will feature both live and on-demand content as well as an enhanced gaming video experience that includes a dedicated gaming video section on the Facebook Watch carousel. Creators on Facebook can now broadcast via Facebook Live and can share video content via a gaming video destination. The gaming video destination will be based on the video format, duration, and type. For example, creators can add a title to their video to give more context, and longer videos will be eligible for ad breaks, which we're testing in the U.S., UK, and Ireland. Creators will be able to choose the ad breaks that appear in their videos, including when and where they are placed. Facebook is also working on creating a separate community for people who are on the platform for gaming. They will have the option to add Facebook Gaming to their profile. This will give their followers the option to choose what they see from the user, and will allow for a more gaming-centric feed. At launch, Facebook Gaming is available in 40 countries, including USA, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Poland, India, Australia, and more. It will be interesting to see if Facebook Gaming can take any of the market from Twitch. Twitch has become the king of the streaming market, and with the recent success of Fortnite, Twitch has only seen an increase in viewers. It's not clear if Facebook will have exclusive content or streams, and even if they did, it's unclear if it will be enough to move people from Twitch to Facebook Gaming.",0,765

"South Korea will soon see a drop in their military personnel due to a decline in birth rate and recent laws that make it easier to avoid mandatory national service. The Wall Street Journal has the story: South Korea has traditionally relied on conscription to fill its military ranks, with men serving two years and women, who can choose to enlist, doing about a year and a half. Now the military is getting smaller as the pool of potential recruits is shrinking - and as the country increasingly turns to the private sector to help fill the gaps. Conscription is an emotive issue in South Korea, which is still technically at war with North Korea. Avoiding military service is difficult, and has long been considered a stain on a man's reputation. But changes in the law in recent years have made it easier for some to get an exemption, such as top sportsmen and classical musicians. The number of male recruits will fall to 210,000 next year, the lowest since 1957, when South Korea's population stood at 21 million. It is now around 50 million. The story goes on to note that Korea has begun to rely more on civilian contractors to meet its military needs. This comes at a time when the country's defense spending is set to rise, despite the diminishing pool of soldiers.

"GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub. Developers can orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, and GitHub will manage the execution and provide rich feedback. GitHub Actions is a new API that GitHub just released. It lets you write actions that can be executed in response to certain events, such as when a pull request is opened, or a tag is pushed. The actions can be written in any language and can call out to any web service. The actions are executed in a container that is managed by GitHub, so you don't have to worry about setting up an environment, or keeping it up to date. This repo contains the action that I created, as well as a bunch of scripts that I use to develop and test the action. The action is currently a work in progress. It has a few features, but it doesn't do everything that I want it to do. It also has some bugs. I'm working on it, but I wanted to release it to the public so that others can get started using it. There are two types of actions in GitHub. Workflow actions and personal actions. Workflow actions can be executed on any repository in your organization. They can be used to enforce policies, or to perform code reviews. Personal actions can only be executed on your own repositories. These can be used to perform code analysis and linting. They can also be used to publish artifacts, such as pre-built docker images. This action is a personal action. It should also be noted that personal actions can only be executed on the master branch. This means that you can't execute them on pull requests. This is a problem if you are using the action to perform code reviews on pull requests. The only way around this is to set up a workflow action. Workflow actions can be executed on any branch, but only on repositories that you have write access to. If you want to perform a code review on a pull request, you'll need to set up a workflow action on the repository that the pull request was submitted to. The action looks at the files in the pull request, and then runs a series of linters against each file. The linters are defined in the action configuration file. You can add as many linters as you want. When the action is done running the linters, it will report the results back to the user. You can add as many linters as you want. I'm using the linters that are provided by the action-linters GitHub organization. They have linters for a bunch of languages, including Node.js, C, and TypeScript. They also have a generic linter that can be used to run any linter. When you add a linter, you'll also need to create a linter configuration file. This file contains information about how to run the linter. This action depends on the action-linters. Make sure to add it as a dependency. You'll need to add the action-linters organization as a collaborator on your GitHub account. You can do this from your GitHub account settings. The configuration file is an object with some required properties, and a bunch of optional properties. You'll also need to define a set of linters. The linters are listed in a linters property. Each linter must be defined as an object. The required properties are name and path. The name is the name of the linter. You can set it to anything that you want. The path property is a relative path to a directory that contains the linter. The linter must be installed in that directory. The path is relative to the action's working directory. This is the directory that you specify in the action configuration file. The path is relative to the root of the repository, not the branch. When you run the action, it will look in the repository for a directory named pathtolinters, and it will run the linter that's inside that directory. The linters directory can be anywhere in the repository. It doesn't have to be in the root. The linter directory must not have a trailing slash. The path property is optional. If you don't set it, the action will try to find the linter in the nodemodules directory. You can set the path to a specific nodemodules directory. For example, you could set it to nodemoduleslinter-name. This will cause the action to look in the nodemoduleslinter-name directory for a linter. If you set the path to a directory that doesn't exist, the action will try to install the linter. If you want the action to always try to install the l",0,773
