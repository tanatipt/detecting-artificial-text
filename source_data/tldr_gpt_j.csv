"Open source code has been essential for China's rapidly growing tech sector. GitHub has been a large part of this growth, but its future in China is uncertain. Many fear that the U.S.-based company will be forced to shut down operations here because it would violate Chinese regulations on cybersecurity and content control. GitHub says it doesn't collect IP addresses or personal information like names, phone numbers or even email addresses from users who post publicly available data such as snippets of code online. And anyone can access public data - including passwords - using an open-source software tool called ""Github search."" But these services pose risks if they are used by China's government agencies seeking sensitive user information, experts say. ""If you have all your code online, then there is no way to hide anything,"" said Kevin Carrico, senior vice president at Gartner Inc., which advises technology companies on security matters around the world. The debate over whether to let Beijing use American cloud infrastructure comes just weeks after President Donald Trump signed into law legislation requiring financial institutions with U.S. dollar accounts to disclose transactions involving Iran, Sudan, Syria and other countries subject to sanctions under those same laws. The measure took effect in August. China could face similar requirements when it starts enforcing its own national privacy laws later this year when new rules designed to safeguard citizens' communications go fully into force. Those provisions require telecommunications operators, Internet providers and others doing business on Chinese soil to preserve customer records indefinitely and hand them over upon request from authorities. That includes private details about social media posts, photos and videos shared via messaging apps WhatsApp and WeChat, searches conducted across web browsers and cellular calls made through their mobile phones. It also covers far more than corporate networks: Each device must provide identifying information about every person accessing its network. A draft document seen by Bloomberg News last month describes how those mandates may affect Chinese internet giants, detailing what kind of data they should keep, where it should be stored and how long they must retain it. One clause states that ""each enterprise shall enforce internal technical measures ... to prevent any unauthorized persons from illegally obtaining the above mentioned data produced by relevant enterprises."" Such systems typically include anti-fraud capabilities built to flag suspicious behavior amid rapid expansion without adequate resources to monitor so much traffic, according to Wang Xiangwei, chief architect at Peking University. He coauthored one of the two papers calling for Github to stop serving Chinese clients. At least 10 years ago, he wrote, technologists were talking openly about creating secure versions of websites hosted on traditional hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform. They wanted ways to separate service consumers from proprietary material posted by developers within their projects. For example, many think of Twitter as a free speech platform, while some see Facebook as better suited for spreading news stories and sharing pictures. Developers initially sought alternatives such as BitBucket and GitLab, based in St. Petersburg, Russia. All three now offer enhanced security features, including encryption and password changes enforced remotely whenever credentials expire. But none do enough to meet demands set forth by Chinese regulators, especially compared with increasingly aggressive attempts by both state entities and hackers for people's data, said Wu Xingyu, director general at International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Many Chinese tech firms are already unable to comply with most aspects of the country's recent 463-page Cybersecurity Law, first passed 17 months ago, because they lack the necessary staff, funds and time, Wu told journalists during a Dec. 7 event organized by ISO and Microsoft Corp.'s Taiwan unit. (0) Some vendors have gotten help from nongovernmental organizations working on cyberdefense issues overseas; still others rely mostly on self-built tools and hardware. Some researchers struggle to understand how the latest version of the law affects individuals, groups and commercial entities outside China. Others worry it might backfire against local industry not active abroad. Still others believe the government should avoid making sweeping pronouncements before it completes work implementing related policies, such as an ongoing effort to create a unified standard for encrypting digital communication. Chinese officials have expressed little concern about foreign parties offering IT products and services inside China. They've become more concerned about the ability of foreign companies selling hardware and software internationally to support customers inside the Middle Kingdom. While people living in China aren't required to register locally with major cloud suppliers, domestic businesses are obliged to adhere to strict disclosure standards. Vendors must list their headquarters along with contact information, annual revenues and inspection reports from regulatory bodies. That's something few foreigners appear willing to risk yet. There's nothing stopping foreign cloud providers such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and IBM Corp. - which account for nearly half of global spending on managed servers - from opening up shop in mainland China again. These companies succeeded in the past partly due to partnerships with leading local providers and efforts to remain discreet. For instance, Alibaba hasn't publicized its position in [The United States returns reliable results needed assessment tests. To stay alive. This system does rat out goodness Tests Wag,",0,2
"Ant Group's world record-setting initial public offering has been suspended. Its controller, executive chairman, and CEO were summoned and interviewed by regulators in China. The company later reported significant issues with its disclosure process that may have misled investors on the valuation of its assets. Days after Chinese anti-corruption activist and entrepreneur Guo Wengui tweeted a link to an article claiming that Dr Li Yifei (also known as Sun Deng) had confessed to corruption charges at her age of 59 years old, several mainstream media outlets carried articles about it. But not before they deleted this confession from their websites or attempted to perform damage control by having independent journalists verify the legitimacy of the document allegedly showing Ms Li's confession. When did you start thinking about going into business? I was always fascinated with technology from an early age but because my father is an engineer he made sure I didn't get overly interested in computers until high school when I started taking classes related to programming. After graduating college I got a position working for one of our first trading partners where we traded products across various regions. This provided me with exposure to almost all aspects of international trade including Customs, Finance, Shipping, Transportation, Procurement, Logistics Management. As time went on more positions came up which gave me broader experience with companies such as BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, UBS etc.all investment banks. At some point while still at Wells Fargo I realized there would never be enough hours in the day so I figured best if I work three days a week instead of two. The new legislation requires larger firms to disclose detailed information on how much money they pay out to shareholders who are represented mainly by mutual funds rather than retail investors like us. In addition, the law will also make transparent certain activities within a firm deemed risky. Firms can now only issue ""special dividends"" once every five years, rather than annually; they cannot use stock buybacks to boost revenues unless earnings can cover them; and firms will need quarterly capital returns or plans to distribute profits over longer periods to meet cash flow requirements. Banks are struggling to cope with spending cuts and rising bad debts - both in developed markets and emerging economies - despite efforts led by the International Monetary Fund and other lenders to help ease financial strains, warn analysts. A number of big European countries, including France, Germany and Belgium, are facing difficulties meeting targets for budget deficits set under EU rules. There are signs of further defaults among borrowers in developing nations, particularly Latin America, Africa and Asia, amid fears economic growth could stall. Banks' provision levels - amounts paid upfront to protect against losses - rise again, at 1 trillion last month compared with just six months ago. Russia's Constitutional Court has ruled in favor of President Vladimir Putin's plan to restore direct presidential elections in 2012. It says lawmakers should consider whether changes are needed in Russia's electoral system. That decision leaves open the possibility of using parliamentary ballots in next year's vote. Lawmakers are expected to consider those proposals after elections scheduled for December 4th, though observers say that given Mr. Putin's political domination that outcome seems likely. Mr. Obama spoke Tuesday afternoon during his regular phone call with Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev, saying the United States remains committed to constructive relations between Washington and Moscow. Today's Internet users tend to think of themselves as digital natives: born around the same era as smartphones and tablets. But a few generations back, things weren't quite so simple. Baby boomers remember the days when telephone calls cost huge amounts of money. They're less familiar with the notion of sending letters via snail mail and even older folks might find it hard to believe that the internet marked its 20th anniversary today. For most of human history, communication required physical proximity. Our ancestors lived close together in small groups. Every day, strong ties bound individuals within these communities, creating trust networks that kept people safe from strangers and ensured cooperation. Eventually, one member of each community left home while another returned... I recently read a blog post by Mike Arrington titled ""What twitter means to the future of social networking"" featuring Jason Calacanis, Fred Wilson, and Guy Kawasaki's opinions regarding Twitter's impact on the large scale adoption of realtime personal network platforms. Although I found myself agreeing somewhat with Jason's arguments and appreciating many of the points made in the post, I felt compelled to speak out about something specific that bothered me about what I saw portrayed in the post.",0,3
"A Tesla Model S owner is suing the company because his Tesla crashed into a Ford Fiesta in the next lane ""suddenly, and without any warning"" at 80mph when he was trying to pick up one of its passengers. The plaintiff claims that there were other cars available to serve as an escort for the man but they are not named by the case documents and it seems strange that no-one else noticed what happened. Tesla's Autopilot can be used with two settings: hands free or hands on (with steering wheel control). It has proved controversial since being introduced last year and many have been unhappy about having their car take over driving duties while they relax behind the wheel (or presumably if you're asleep), especially when doing so involves travelling between lanes at high speed. On 1 September 2015, Elon Musk told owners that drivers using hands off mode should expect for 'up to' 30 minutes before autopilot disengages completely due to system degradation. This particular incident took place in Michigan in August 2014 after a driver had failed to maintain clear sight ahead even though traffic signs warned him that autopilot would switch back to manual drive at speeds above 45mph. The lawsuit says that the brakes did not work properly either and there is evidence that this led to the crash - it notes that ""Mr Williams suffered severe bodily injury,"" including brain trauma which resulted in persistent neurological damage causing disability and death within three years from the accident. Interestingly, anyone who believes that Tesla autopilot simply requires some kind of hand waving to make them compliant will find themselves rather disappointed as there is quite a lot more than meets the eye here. This suit hinges upon strict liability, a legal concept where manufacturers cannot escape responsibility for defects in products sold to customers if harm results regardless of fault. Liability law generally means that companies are held responsible for design flaws as well as manufacturing faults. Teslas may just have bitten the bullet now. If you want to see why we think autopilot could become the most dangerous form of technology ever invented, click here. In Indiana, a school bus carrying 20 pupils and 5 adults collided head on with a semi truck earlier this month. Both vehicles flipped onto their roofs and burst into flames; eight children died along with both adult occupants of the schoolbus. Witnesses described how the truck plowed through red lights, ignoring stop signals. The truck stopped only once it was too late, pinning the bus against a large tree. There is speculation that the vehicle was attempting to avoid hitting another car during busy rush hour times. Some say that the state safety agency should consider new laws allowing automatic braking systems on trucks similar to those approved in California in 2009 for certain passenger cars. Trucks already carry heavy loads but add on blind spots like these deceptively small vehicles do and they might be less safe overall. With added autonomy comes increased responsibility and the potential for accidents to happen out of human error. After all, don't forget that by 2018, fully autonomous vehicles will start appearing on public roads.

"Xiaomi has launched a pair of smart glasses. The Xiaomi Smart Glasses weigh 51 grams and feature a MicroLED display built into the right lenses, a 5-megapixel camera, a quad-core processor with 1GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage as well as Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. The product is designed to help you read texts faster by automatically eliminating unnecessary words when it reads aloud your favorite books or articles. It'll also be able to detect what you're consuming via its sensor system, which includes an accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensors that can check things like how close you are to your phone, if you've picked up something from your pocket or purse, or even listen for voice commands - so long as they don't conflict with reading mode. That's convenient, but also means that third parties will need to make apps for this particular use case. Still, we suspect many people who already have other wearable devices in their lives won't mind adding one more to their collection. If you'd rather not spend 199 on these new specs, however, Xiaomi is offering them at 99 if you purchase any MiBand 2 model before September 30th.",0,5
"Many dog breeds are about appearance, but plenty of others are devoted to specific tasks. A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog intelligence and identify the most intelligent breed (or breeds). Here's what they found... The results were published in Animal Cognition this week, and they reveal that there is no single brainy canine out there: all canines share some level of cognitive ability. This matches previous studies in humans which have shown us that not everyone has access to similar levels of intellect as their peers. The average IQ values vary between different species from 1 to 100 - although it should be noted that the majority of animals tested are still below 30. But what was revealed by this research also shows just how heavily our own human culture influences and biases our perceptions of who we think smart or dumb, with children picking up the idea very early. Dog cognition Although experts suggest that comparing animal brains against one another isn't fair because each species develops differently due to environmental factors such as diet, nutrition, stressors and upbringing, these tests do give an indication of relative abilities between two individuals within a certain species. So, for example, if you put both a wolf and a chihuahua through a test then compared the scores, the difference might show you that a chihuahua's mental capabilities lie somewhere between those of a Great Dane and a bulldog. Dogs had higher performance than any other mammal tested, and significantly outperformed rhesus monkeys (measuring at 11) and chimpanzees (at 12), but fell well short of dolphins' and elephants' 17 and 20 rankings respectively. One notable achievement however came in East African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), where researchers recorded them achieving a score of 23.2. It seems that their high social groupings make dogs more adept at learning things like hunting skills, language and understanding complex rules. Many modern domestic dogs have descended from wolves so their brain anatomy has been shaped over thousands of years by selective breeding based upon physical traits rather than intelligence. However, even though little remains in common between domesticated dogs and their ancestors today, there are some interesting similarities between the cognitive styles of both groups of dogs. For instance, studies have suggested that tame greyhounds may remember numbers better - yes, really! - while golden retrievers tend towards visual recall. And although scientists believe dogs now predominantly use scent cues when tracking prey instead of relying so much on sight alone, there is evidence of very ancient genetic links between smell and memory. In fact, several strains of labrador retriever appear to perform similarly in tests designed to measure spatial awareness. It could mean that they're born smarter than many people realise, but could equally point to the influence of genetics being passed down through generations. To get a real feel for a particular dog's cognitive style, ask yourself whether heshe would enjoy sitting under a tree and watching squirrels scrambling around until you return home, or having to wear earphones so they don't run away and bark incessantly? Perhaps your answer reveals something about his or her personality and preferences too... How did your Dog Perform Next Read More",0,6

"A Bay Area-based startup called Perfect Day has created a lab-grown ice cream that uses whey protein from genetically modified yeast. While there are plenty of dairy-free ice cream alternatives on the market, this one is still being marketed as ""the real thing"" by some in the food industry. Others have raised concerns over its production methods and labeling. Perfect Day founder Guri Krishnan-Sarin tells Fast Company that it makes a seven-ingredient product with no GMOs (genetically modified organisms), gluten or milk proteins - but she doesn't want to be labeled organic because the company isn't yet certified for organic products. The name comes from ""perfect day,"" which refers to perfection without any GMO ingredients. Krishnan-Sarin's team works 12 hours per day, 7 days every week, creating a cultured powder made using 100 percent natural components like sugar cane juice concentrate and coconut oil. This mixture is then mixed together when it's time to make ice cream. According to Krishnna-Sarin, frozen yogurt contains about 40 water; her version contains 45. Ice creams contain more than 60, while sherbets only 20-30. That means that unlike regular homemade ice cream, where you put an egg yolk into warm liquid, your culture would work at -4 degrees Celsius. This also puts them out of reach of many customers who might otherwise buy these other non-traditional brands. But after speaking with Krishnan-Sarin, I think we can all agree that there is room in our grocery stores for both types of ice cream: traditional ones and those grown in labs. How do they compare?

View Article At first glance, this looks exactly like any other batch of vanilla-flavored ice cream sold in stores across America today. However, there are two important differences. First, this ice cream was grown inside a lab rather than whipped up from raw ingredients straight from Mother Nature. Second, this particular batch used whey protein derived from genetically engineered baker's yeasts. Whey protein isolate is typically cheaper than whole milk and cow' s milk proteins, so most companies prefer to add it as well. Generally, small quantities of whey aren't harmful. Some folks even enjoy drinking it after workouts. When consumed in massive amounts though, according to reports published online last year, it could cause kidney failure for some individuals. Whole milk is certainly better for consumers, since cows don't need antibiotics and hormones to grow quickly before slaughter. These additives give factory farm animals horrible stomach problems. Despite the potential hazards posed by large doses of isolated animal milk proteins, scientists continue to find ways to extract specific beneficial compounds. One such method involves removing individual molecules from the rest of milk fat - butter, cheese, etc., and isolating them individually. Then, they're added back to whatever type of drink or dessert contains milk fats themselves.

"A team of scientists launched a box containing four types of bacteria and fungus into the stratosphere to expose them to several hours of Mars-like conditions. The experiment found that the microbes were able to survive exposure at altitudes greater than 50,000 feet - about 21 miles above Earth's surface. The NASA study is titled ""Survival of Bacteria in Extreme Environments,"" but it was actually conducted by a gaggle of international researchers with names like Martha Dominguez (University of Arizona) and Timothy Lyons (NASA Ames Research Center). Their goal: Find out if any microorganisms could cope under harsh planetary conditions - something we know nothing about because no one ever tried before. Bacterial life on planet Earth has had millions of years to adapt to the low levels of radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and high atmospheric pressure variations that make up our atmosphere. But those adaptations may not be enough for already adapted organisms living far from their natural habitat. For instance, Martian soil contains only minute amounts of iron compared to what's available here on Earth. Would an organism mutated and suited to its natural environment fare better? Probably yes because evolution proceeds rapidly even over very short time spans. In this case though, the species will have been subjected to many decades' worth of mutations since they last lived there; the mutation rate itself would probably affect survival rates greatly. Even though I'm sure that wikipedia can't tell you everything about having your dog poop rubbed all over you (and then being forced to eat it), I was startled when my mother brought home an enormous pile of dog feces she'd picked off her front lawn yesterday afternoon shortly after lunchtime.

By contrast, human waste seems to be everywhere these days or at least it was until recently. When did people start making decisions based on who sees us do things?

We've been hearing rumors flying around lately suggesting Apple plans to release a new iPhone 7 model next month, but now there's also word coming directly from Cupertino saying that such news isn't true, just yet. Well, sort of. Speaking with numerous sources speaking anonymously, Bloomberg claims Apple wants to unveil three different models of phone at once during its annual September event in order to entice customers still holding onto older phones. That means the company is planning to roll out two more iPhones alongside upgrades to existing handsets, mainly targeting midrange buyers. As always, specifics remain murky until Steve Jobs makes his way back to the stage, but right now, experts expect the lower end and upper range versions of both 5C and 6S to debut soon while the 6 Plus remains unchanged. I wonder why I hadn't heard anything about memes before the year 2010. All I knew about memes was that people made fun of them, and certainly none of my classmates were making fun of them. That changed quickly with the rise of ""meme generation,"" most notably MySpace. One particular meme became ubiquitous among teenagers throughout North America: As you'll recall, Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter launched himself into global infamy a few months ago due to legal trouble surrounding mysterious text messages allegedly sent between him and a 16-year old girl. Despite extensive efforts to suppress evidence of these texts and cover-up said evidence, the government apparently failed miserably in hiding Carter's shady behavior from the eyes of the American people. So rather than let a multi-million dollar lawsuit go unanswered, prosecutors dropped charges against Nick Carter and everyone else involved. Allowing the investigation die won't really mean much to anyone except for former teen heartthrob Nicks fans. We're talking New York City here folks, so naturally, Nick Carter came crawling back to the Big Apple despite his family insisting otherwise.

"Uniqlo cut 90 of the workforce in one of its Tokyo warehouses, and replaced them with robots. Now the warehouse operates 24 hours a day. Robots are able to unload pallets without an operator by attaching themselves to conveyor belts that move along at very high speed; they can load cartons onto trucks or even pack boxes on shelves - all whilst carrying out their tasks autonomously. This is what is happening around the world: fast fashion companies have made increasing investments in automation since 2012 as part of efforts to increase productivity while cutting costs, so as not to end up like HM which has been forced into bankruptcy three times over the last decade due to heavy losses. Management consultants McKinsey estimate that about 30-50 of clothing production will be automated before 2030. The Wall Street Journal estimates this figure could rise to 80. In order to reduce operating expenses it doesn't make sense for these big factories to invest heavily in workers who take away jobs from machines. This trend towards greater automatisation began early in Japan. ""Rise Of Robot Factory Floor Workers"" (The Asahi Shinbun) - 2016 Jul 18 Nissan Motor Co announced plans in July 2015 to build electric cars using 3D printing technology where customers would use their smartphones to receive updates and information on new models via the internet. By applying huge amounts of electricity to assemble the car components such as body panels and battery cells, Nissan hopes to continue improving quality while reducing development time and lowering vehicle prices. In April 2017 Renault unveiled two electric vehicles under the Zoe brand name called EZ10 and EZ20 that followed the same principles. It showed off prototypes of both EVs including the parts used during manufacture, but no specifications were released yet. While selling electric vehicles isn't exactly easy because you need consumers to buy into regenerative energy sources you must keep your eye on cutting edge technologies. Making consumer products more affordable by introducing ""post industrial revolution"" aspects is what reinforces demand.

Even Elon Musk admitted that humans shouldn't work remotely, although he didn't mention how his Tesla factory would perform if it wasn't running 24 hours per day.

"NYC Mesh is a group run entirely by volunteers to provide affordable and reliable internet to residents in New York City. Customers can pay whatever they like for the service, but it will always be at least 6 per month cheaper than what you'd get from your current provider (and usually more). Notably, NYC Mesh also has no contract - the customer only pays when she wants to use her data or if their router breaks. The company doesn't take any part of the money during this time; all revenue goes into funding future projects. In addition, rather than focusing on specific demographics, the network targets everyone who lives within the city limits. This means that even though the vast majority of its customers are black, brown, or low-income people of color, there's nothing stopping white people from using the service too. Now that we're done with our meetup, I want to tell you about something incredible: my friend matthewgellerleman started an organization called NYC Mesh to make sure every person living in the five boroughs could connect to high quality Internet. It just launched yesterday and already subscribers have paid 1M towards expansion! A big thank you to Matthew his team - please check them out here for details pic.twitter.com9g7DxLc8ZB - Jhaub (jhaub) September 26, 2018 This kind of community effort shouldn't exist. But NYC Mesh was threatened with shutdown last year because Verizon decided not to renew its partnership with the nonprofit. And while mesh networks were previously used almost exclusively in rural areas, they've now been adopted all over the world since 2017. So today, Jhaub joined a small number of other members of the public to disrupt Public Knowledge's FCC meeting by delivering over 50 letters demanding change to rules that would allow ISPs to interfere with traffic running through these kinds of networks. While some ISPs jumped ship immediately after those protests, others still remain steadfast in supporting net neutrality laws that harm consumers' opportunity to build their own alternatives. Now let's talk about why these efforts matter so much. Let's start with how these communities work. To break down the basics, most nation states operate under three categories - national carriers owned by governments, private telecommunication companies working through government contracts, and independent ISPs built up on free markets. These networks often serve two different purposes - one as a telecom infrastructure (i.e., Voice, Data), and the other as a consumer friendly alternative. Carriers typically charge higher prices than competing providers do for voice services, but offer faster speeds, superior reliability and better pricing for data packages. In contrast, smaller operators such as Bell Canada charge less for both types of services, but won't compete well against larger players unless they give up control of their messaging systems. Mesh networks replace phone lines directly connected between users', enabling millions of people around the globe to bypass major telecommunications carriers altogether. Most cities opt for mobile carrier-style operations because they enjoy economies of scale to subsidize fiber rollouts across entire regions. However, many locales find themselves without access to broadband due to geographical limitations. Others don't trust mobile telcos to deliver adequate levels of safety and security on top of shitty service. As any tech nerd knows, building a solid foundation might seem daunting, but making it easy for anyone in the country to share information is incredibly important. That's where mesh comes in. Instead of having separate phone wires connecting buildings, mesh uses Wi-Fi routers instead to directly link individual devices together. You'll notice regular wifi signals sooner since they aren't forced to go through multiple steps before reaching each device, which saves energy costs and makes connections stronger overall. Many of the same technologies powering mesh networks have come online years ago, thanks to computers and smartphones becoming increasingly powerful (thanks, Moore's law!). An example of such technology are digital certificates, encryption keys and egress filtering proxies - things that enable secure communications between computers and servers via encrypted tunnels. They've become extremely useful in recent times, especially considering hackers - like Cambridge Analytica - have recently stolen personal data from countless American citizens. Imagine being able to verify whether someone visiting your website is actually human... it's pretty far-fetched right? Well put yourself in their shoes - the fact that Facebook claims to hold billions of user credentials proves that this sort of attack isn't inconceivable. Users may feel safer storing sensitive data online, but it's infinitely easier for bad actors to obtain it once inside. That's why businesses that host websites need protection from entry attempts from malicious parties. Egress filters examine requests made by visitors to determine if they should enter protected sections of a site (like content databases or credit card validation interfaces). If someone spoofs their IP address and sends a request trying to gain unauthorized access, then the proxy will reject it before transferring your info to nefarious destinations. Essentially, you're gaining additional layers of defense and control over the way certain web sites function. At worst, proprosing potentiality rate setting expectations of department.

"The Mission Extension Vehicle-2 (MEV-2) recently latched onto an old communications satellite while in orbit. The mission is Northrop Grumman's second successful docking of an object in space. MEV-2 launched in 2014 and was designed to extend the life of a defunct Russian rocket, but as it steadily flew into increasingly rarefied lower reaches of Earth's atmosphere, its onboard thrusters failed completely last year. But by early April this year, after more than three years working away from the International Space Station (ISS), NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg had mounted a gear shift pinion lock on MEV-2 so she could undock her spacecraft for good. Afterward, the two craft performed their own routine separation before rejoining together again hours later to complete one final burn that sent both vehicles reentering the planet at around 9:30pm ET on Friday night. In preparation for the historic event, NASA shared some spectacular photos taken during the maneuvers using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III camera with a 24mm lens attached. We've included these below along with several other gorgeous images captured during the first ever detaching and reattaching between satellites in low earth orbit. All previously unreleased until now.",0,16
"This site hosts an interactive in-browser neural network. Users can tweak the individual components of the neural network to visualize how it works. Neural networks have been used for a variety of tasks, including image classification, speech recognition and controlling robotic movements. In this example we use them as pattern classifiers. You may recognize some things from your experience with the Internet: users are presented with patterns of text on a computer screen and asked what they think that word means or if there is just too much noise. The basic idea behind using neural networks here is that you feed lots (that's right, thousands) of words into a single machine learning system, and see which ones end up working better than others at picking out the real meaning of the input. That way, even though humans might not be able to deal well with all those different types of information at once, computers can handle it easily enough. We'll interactively build two models - one based on English dictionary definitions alone, another based on more humanlike methods like puns and inferences. This will show exactly why most previous attempts to create effective language analysis systems haven't worked very well, and also demonstrate the power of modern statistical techniques like neural networks.",0,18
"When animations in CSS conflict, only one of them will occur. The Web Animations API allows developers to mix up animation behavior using the composite option. This article discusses how it works and how you can use it for good! The Problem On a website I've been working on for quite some time now, users have an automatic slideshow that's triggered whenever they hover over a link. It offers them five pictures at once. Here are all the code snippets: { padding: 0; margin: 0 }.center-image, b1 img, d2 img, e3 img, f4 img, g5img,h6img,.content{min-width:100;This prevents images from getting clipped by their parent.}keyframes SlideshowAnimator{from{transform:translateX (0) scale 1);opacity:.9;body:hover.slidesharecontainer:not onslide div[class""slideshare div[class.""skswak:first-child::after, body:focus.slidesharecontainer:not onslide, body:active.slidesharecontainer:not onslide::before{animation:SlideshowAnimator 3s ease infinite;} I wanted to quickly fix this issue so user experience wouldn't be affected as much as possible while still being able to animate the elements when needed. And here was where I found myself stuck ... if there were multiple classes involved with the same object (like a button or image), which would get animated first? In other words: What is happening right below each line above? As long as both conditions inside brackets appear somewhere else than in . In our case: First we start off with the whole slideShareContainer element. Now let's take those ones marked with and add class ""skswak"" onto the next layer down. Next comes another layer but no bracketed condition. Then again with more layers after that - until the last two lines. So what exactly happens during these transitions and why does it happen like this? Let's dig deeper into that question together: Why do CSS selectors look up things in specific order? CSS Selector Basics Whenever we type the selector syntax that starts with. followed by any number of characters ..., followed by anything - including space, tab or newline - we're looking up what should go within the braces. We call such stuff selectors and find out about how browsers work behind the scenes for us. When we put something between the then we actually just want to apply that thing to whatever follows directly afterwards. Sometimes though not always, objects come before their children, even if they share certain properties. That's called inheritance. If we had said (for example): p { color: black; font-size: 20px; background-color: green; text-decoration: underline; } p span { color: red; font-weight: bolder; ... } then p would inherit everything from its ancestors such as HTML tag p s, headings h tags etc., whereas spanspan has none. See also the classic post Why Doesn't Firefox Color My Text Red? Another important aspect of selecting objects is specificity. How much weight does one property carry in comparison to others? For instance, if we write font-face {...} as well as style sheet containing rules like a:visited {...}, a:link {...}, b:nth-of-type (odd) {...}, b:last-child {...}, c:target {...}, d:first-letter {...} and e:nowrap {...}, then e will win because it has higher priority since functions like nth-child compare values starting with 1 instead of counting backwards. However relative weights can change depending on how unique parts of your page were selected. You can read more about Specificity on MDN. How Does Arrow Parenting Work? Before diving into arrow parenting details, let me explain why the rule looks different: We start with a single asterisk . Since the rest of the stylesheet only applies to immediate descendants of the initial selector's root node, we can move forward without touching anything underneath. But wait! Before moving forward we need to pick either the previous sibling or the nearest ancestor. They don't have to be siblings neither, as long as the edge goes one level back. So far nothing crazy is going on here anymore. Just regular searches through nodes. But suddenly something gets really interesting with the next two selections: Note that we didn't say 'next nearest', rather 'previous closest'. There is no real difference apart from placement and directionality.

"A bug in Tesla's Autopilot driving program would sometimes pull cars towards lane dividers in specific spots on a Reddit user's commute. Despite reporting the issue to Tesla many times, and despite fixing it being announced just last week, the company has yet to offer an official response or explanation as to why this was happening. ""I'm not sure if there is something wrong with my car, but I get pulled over more often than normal lately,"" wrote one of approximately 2,000 users that posted their stories on Tesla forums between 2015 and 2016 about what happened when they drove using Autopilot on interstate highways and major interchanges. ""Even though you cannot be seen by other drivers (compared to cars driven manually) nor can you alter your speed easily, even at 80mph speeds, using autopilot makes you feel like you are traveling slower."" The suspected root cause appears to lie in changes Tesla made to its algorithms for detecting objects ahead during freeway travel - which led to unexpected behavior. As explained in a document from November titled ""Automatic Lane Change Detection Improvements,"" ""When vehicles approach a potential split-phase location without any preceding vehicle detection [in the previous three seconds], we now use platoons rather than individual lanes for determining where the road splits into two separate segments."" What resulted was cars moving unpredictably toward the center divider lines of divided highway exit ramps while the driver remained unaware, according to reddit posters. When posting about these incidents after hearing back from Tesla support representatives, some threads became flooded with posts from frustrated owners describing similar scenarios.",0,20

"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised , but now they need a new way of winning hearts and minds. By Andrew Pollack November 16th, 2013 ""It was supposed to be an experiment: watching what happens when you allow people with severely handicapped babies to keep them alive inside wombs longer so scientists could study the effects on their development. The babies were conceived via IVF using eggs donated by other women and fertilized with sperm provided by men who had no interest in having children. The cells were placed into lab dishes filled with nutrient solution 2-3 days after those first two steps. Two weeks later, tiny beating heart appeared. Three weeks after that, the researchers used ultrasound technology to look at the developing limbs. One week later, doctors looked through high-powered microscopes as experts studied genes responsible for growth and skeletal structure. Then one set of parents watched the baby growing larger while waiting for the moment they feared would never come - they gave birth to healthy infants weighing about 9 pounds each. What happened next was stunning. All seven babies born survived long term, some even longer than expected, well beyond any previous medical record of such births. They grew up normal, happy, intelligent kids. And the young adults all thought they should have rights as full citizens because it was clear they weren't just ordinary babies; they were extraordinary.""

"Amazon has recently come under fire as it was discovered that it previously allowed vendors the ability to bid for an Amazon's Choice badge by lowering prices and spending more on advertising. It turns out, the company does have a system in place where sellers with low-priced products can be promoted via third party sites. The above information is based on what we've been able to uncover so far as well as conversations some of our sources had over Twitter this morning after hearing about the situation. Needless to say, we're still looking into whether or not these practices were actually used before they stopped happening around February 4th. How Did This Happen? According to one of the people involved in the conversation discussed below, there are two types of ad networks: Cost Per Click (CPC) which only pays per click and cost per impression (CPI). Both of them will display advertisements but CPI allows people like Amazon to buy impressions without paying any money up front. The idea behind the CPC model is you pay no upfront cost in exchange for being displayed to visitors. However, if someone clicks your ads, then your media costs CPM or ""costs per thousand."" In other words, when someone views your ad through Google Adsense, Adbrite, etc., you need to put up something called premium placement fees. These fee cover inventory and data entry so many websites do charge a monthly subscription. One of our source says his site gets thousands of visits each day. He claims that normally he would spend 1-2 in advertising every month just because he doesn't want to look bad compared to other websites on Alexa and Google's search engine rankings. This means his total bill hovers between 10K -20K annually. That number seems pretty high considering the amount of traffic his website receives daily. When Amazon launched their first eCommerce platform back in 1996, vendors could submit their product listing to Amazon.com and paid a small flat rate fee. Sellers not approved at that time went to eBay who required users to create accounts. After that came Drop Ship Locker in 2001 and Amazon Marketplace Stores in 2004. Today, Amazon is widely considered to be the most popular online retailer due to its massive size and dominance of the market - even surpassing rival Walmart. Like the rest of us, Amazon makes use of intermediaries such as wholesalers, manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, shipping companies, shippers, transportation providers and others to ensure all its operations run smoothly. The problem is Amazon has become too big for anyone else to compete effectively against them while also increasing their own sales revenues. Recently though, Amazon has come under fire from various groups ranging from lawmakers to publishers, consumers to competitors. While much of this controversy centers upon anti-trust acts that might force Amazon to start charging customers directly, another issue increasingly gaining attention focuses upon how Amazon uses its dominant presence within the marketplace. For example, did you know that your Amazon order may contain items your vendor never received andor shipped to you? Some of those same merchants may not earn anything since Amazon often deducts the full retail price of purchased merchandise before sending payments to vendors. If you ever wonder why certain listings show zero dollars sold using either the FBA or FBM feature; it's because Amazon won't allow vendors to make those transactions publicly visible. You see, Amazon isn't interested in giving non-profit organizations extra exposure. As such, they keep plenty of details private so nobody knows exactly how things work behind closed doors. We don't mean to imply Amazon would knowingly sell tainted goods. But, unless rules change regarding electronic invoicing systems and public advertising, we think it'll always be hard keeping track of everyone's business dealings including Amazon's. Surface Web Technologies Inc., owned by entrepreneur Mike Seitzman that produces software to manage remote workers' computers, seeks U.S. Patent 8,511,611 for ""Methods and Systems for Managing Remote Workers"" issued in April 2014. On August 26th 2015, patent 8,659,917 was filed with nearly identical text stating that it allows management of mobile devices remotely. United States Patent Trademark Office Published Application No.: A1 From March 29th 2017 to May 1st 2017, the USPTO published 577 new patents and trademarks involving Amazon. Fourteen of those filed during that period included protected trademark applications related to branding names of specific consumer electronics brands made specifically for Amazon. Here are five examples along with links to the official application documents found on the USPTO database. New Products Services According to the description field on the USPTO search page, these 14 applied for marks covered several different categories including cellphones and tablets, household appliances and tools, toys and games, leisure activities and sports equipment, baby care and children's clothing apparel among others.

"Apple is planning on spending over 1 billion on video content this year for its upcoming video streaming service. They currently have 24 shows in production and development. This content will be available to Apple TV users as well as iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Mac OS X, Windows Phone 7 and Android tablets. I'm excited about the possibilities, but I don't want another Netflix clone or a Hulu clone that charges me 10month just so it can show my ads. That is why the pricing of ""On Demand"" should be tiered based upon how much you are willing to pay per month for all your services together. If they do build out their own network like Amazon does with Instant Video then we could see ""On Demand"" become even more popular than Netflix has been since day one, which would make it an attractive proposition if priced right... Also, I believe you must subscribe to a cable package (or similar) before being able to access On Demand content via iTunes. Why wouldn't apple sell the movie rights directly?

"Google is close to finalizing a deal to buy or lease a 1.3 million square foot office building in the West Village. The space is large enough to allow Google to consolidate its operations, and convenient for shuttling employees between Manhattan and Silicon Valley - where much of the company's work on Android takes place. The sale could be announced as early as Monday by CityRealty Group Inc., which handled an earlier transaction for Google with the same property. While details about the new owner have not been released yet, several sources said that it has ties to Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and Lenovo (which was recently acquired by Foxconn). CityRealty declined to comment when asked if the buyer had revealed his identity at this point. ""We believe our client ultimately will retain confidentiality over the ultimate use,"" Craig Levine, who heads up City Real Estate Americas, told BuzzFeed News ahead of publication. He did say that neither he nor his colleagues were involved in any negotiations around the purchase price. A spokeswoman for Google also declined to answer questions. In recent years, tech giants like Apple and Facebook have increasingly bought out buildings downtown, while more than half of San Francisco's biggest employers are based there. Meanwhile most major Internet companies, including Amazon, continue to base their headquarters further east along Second Avenue above 14th Street in SoHo. But New York City remains unique: many local workers stay put after starting their careers elsewhere, so maintaining consistency across multiple offices makes sense from both financial and cultural perspectives. And smaller cities may lack the infrastructure necessary to host large data centers. In Boston, monopolies such as Verizon and Comcast own virtually all of the telecom equipment they need locally. In Seattle, Microsoft helps fund Fiber, a citywide broadband network used by internet providers but only available via selected areas. It would cost hundreds of millions dollars for Alphabet's Google to set up similar networks. ""If you look across America, we need lots of different types of places,"" Tim O'Reilly, cofounder of software incubator O'Reilly Media and former president of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit focused on children's media literacy, tells BuzzFeed News. ""There are really two ways of looking at what's going on right now."" A big reason why these conversations take place here rather than Kansas City or Pittsburgh isn't just convenience; it's precedent. Just four months ago, the United States Trade Representative slapped China with sanctions meant to halt state-sponsored theft of American intellectual property. But despite strict guidelines, some US businesses still try to build relationships with foreign partners. One strategy involves identifying local businesses, often venders of goods made by the targeted countries, whose owners can help broker deals or provide advice, explains Joseph Gomescu, executive director at the Center for Investment Policy, a think tank at Columbia Law School. Companies search through LinkedIn, industry transactions records, and other resources detailing contacts. Many US firms even offer incentives to vendors willing to play trade sponges. Terence Cawley, vice chairman of the Board of Directors of TechAmerica, a trade group, recalls attending events hosted by IBM and Cisco last year in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, and Seoul, among others. Some attendees brought friends back home who were able to introduce them to business leaders. Those people worked in fields ranging from finance to manufacturing to advertising. Others invited their counterparts to visit corporate facilities in Chicago and Austin before returning to their native country and introducing executives familiar with those sites. Google's potential move into Midtown South is one step toward closing the gap. That area contains few retail options and little residential housing. Its main commercial strip consists of small shops catering specifically to tech workers. (Midtown includes Chelsea, Greenwich Village, Soho, NoLIta.) If the land is cheap enough, Google could easily expand the 711 W 28th St. site that currently houses nearly three dozen tenants. Other urban districts with fewer amenities include Long Island City in Queens, Virginia Docks in Brooklyn, Crown Heights (just outside NYC), Bushwick, Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Bed-Stuy, Jackson Heights, Harlem, East Flatbush, CanarsieEast Tremont, Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Astoria, Sunnyside, Corona, Woodhaven, Port Washington, Whitestone, Flushing, Melrose Park, Hazel Crest, Oak Forest, Bridgeport, Norwood, Allendale Township, and Glenview, Illinois, according to real estate website Zillow. Each offers locations nearby places such as airports, train stations, hospitals, highways, etc. Of course, proximity alone doesn't guarantee success; great ideas don't always translate well to store shelves or phone lines. Amazon recently closed its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in Minneapolis because customers weren't buying books online. And today consumers shop mostly using smartphones.

In an interview with CNBC this summer, Byrne said he believed his own offer would be worth much less than where it was now.

"Facebook and Snopes had been in talks to work together to create a fact-checking program for the Facebook platform, but Snopes has decided to cancel the partnership. The team decided that it would be more beneficial for them to focus on developing their own product instead of working with Facebook - which is in itself not surprising as they already have their own reputation management tool called PolitiFact (which we also wrote about here). Politifact was launched by Snopes' parent company FactCheckers Inc., back in 2005 after Time magazine sent out an ""experimental news feed warning users when stories were either true or false."" It then picked up momentum over time and became one of the most widely used sites today. Some might argue that its name is misleading because while facts are indeed being checked, there are no checks made on this site - they just report what other people say; however, many writers still use Snopes to check factual information before publishing any articles online. In addition to reporting on individuals, politicians, and corporations, Snopes now allows anyone to submit claims to investigate. Using computer algorithms, the service examines the claim based upon the context surrounding the statement and comes to a conclusion about whether it is likely to be fake. For example, if someone says something like that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wanted to ban all Muslims from entering America, Snopes will come down hard saying that doing so wouldn't make sense since he did not want to discriminate against people who hold certain beliefs based on religion. However, if the person said the same thing about Israel, you can bet Snopes will tell us that such statements aren't necessarily untrue; they may even go further to explain why some people do believe these things. Nevertheless, according to its website, Snopes is the leading authority on evaluating sources and identifying misinformation. They bases much of their credibility around four criteria: primary documents research, cross referencing multiple original sources, peer review, and editorial integrity. And what exactly constitutes integrity? Well, not making money off content produced through partnerships or selling stock. I think everyone could agree that politics isn't immune from bias, especially during campaigns where every little detail seems magnified. When the GOP recently released the first 30 Days Of Trump, Politico noticed that at least five major national outlets including CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News, and Fox News ran headlines alongside the cover story declaring it to be complete rubbish. This prompted The Atlantic to ask: Is Donald Trump Making A Hitler-Like Appeal To American Racism? While the media often gets accused of fawning over celebrities, placing them above others, and essentially creating stars rather than journalists, one outlet stands out amongst the rest - Breitbart. Under Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, Breitbart has become best known for promoting conspiracy theories, attacking mainstream conservatives, and playing fast and loose with truth. So, is Breitbart pushing racist propaganda in order to get elected president? Below we examine each piece of evidence provided by the Huffington Post showing how the right-wing publication repeatedly publishes barely believable reports that smacks of deliberate attempts towards deceiving voters into thinking Hillary Clinton is guilty of crimes she hasn't committed. 1) On June 7th 2016, Breitbart published a story titled: Meet The Clintons Who Are Now Selling Out Their SoulSouLs To Start A Political Career With Billary. 2) As part of the article, an image captioned Smiley FaceHillary Clinton Harry Reid 3) appeared with text describing her as having sold out to the devil. 4) There's nothing wrong with expressing skepticism about candidates and political figures. We encourage our readers to share their opinions both positive and negative. But those opinions should be presented fairly without trying to deceive voters - especially considering the stakes involved in choosing whom we send to Washington. 5) If this picture leads to bigamy charges - or worse yet, another Clinton scandal - it won't matter how good your motives were. 6) If lying under oath got Eric Holder indicted and led him to resign his position, imagine what Judge Jeanine Pirro's two decades of experience investigating Democrats' misdeeds means for Hillary Rodham Clinton! 7) - See more at: 8) Worryingly enough, despite having started out as a conservative website, the headline went viral not only due to the lies told within it, but thanks to social networks.

"Amazon revealed its latest delivery drone design at the re:MARS conference. The drone is about the size of a go-cart, can fly up to 15 miles, and deliver packages up to 5 pounds in less than 30 minutes. It's also capable of navigating around trees, over houses with windows open, under low tree cover, or through light smoke - all without hitting anything on route. Amazon says it could be used for deliveries inside buildings as well as outdoor areas like parks and hiking trails. It has four propellers that allow it to hover at any point during flight when needed. The drones will be able to follow preprogrammed routes and have an onboard camera to record quick video clips whenever they pass by cameras positioned outside homes or businesses. That way you won't need human employees walking door to door to hand off your package while showing customers their own receipt. (You might want another bathroom break anyway.) Companies are starting to get serious about delivering parcels via robots. UPS already uses six R2 units to make real time deliveries from 7am to 6pm daily. But this new system would last longer and use fewer units per day. In total, there would only be 14 robots working throughout the whole city instead of 24. They work much differently too; each unit would carry two packages instead of one. As more companies start testing these kinds of systems, we may see parcel delivery drastically change, just like self-driving cars changed how we travel today.",0,38
"This article follows the story of Amazon as it developed from a bookseller into a company that sells everything. It describes Amazon's design process and how Jeff Bezos' decisions affects its products, employees, competitors, shareholders and customers. In 1963, in his first year at Harvard Business School, Paul Krassner wrote a satirical essay about an evil corporation called Kable Corporation with headquarters on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The characters who worked for this firm were all called ""Kables,"" each using a number to identify himself or herself within the organization. They wore name tags saying: ""I am 1-11."" The product was their minds. The business model? To take over America by marketing mind packages to consumers at lower prices than they could buy them themselves with their own neurons. Fast forward four decades and you'll find yourself meeting most people through email; if you've ever met one face-to-face, chances are heshe works for Amazon. And while there's still only room for one No. 11, the Seattle tech giant has apparently been busy filling out office rosters for everyone else: from Don Davis (No. 6) and Mark Lucovsky (No. 10), both former Sun Microsystems executives now charged with running Kindle sales, to CTO Werner Vogels (No. 9) and CEO Jeff Bezos (No. 8). Indeed, when I asked my wife what she thought her husband did for work these days, she replied without hesitation: ""He runs Amazon."" The success of such a small elite is proof positive of our growing reliance on technology to make our lives easier - from online banking and shopping to reading news stories and watching movies. But just how much does this new breed of uber worker really control us technologically? Perhaps more importantly, can we trust the information that comes across those screens every day? That's where California State University professor Daniel Solove begins his new book, Our Hidden Data Breaks: How Google Became King of Information and Why You Should Care - Your Privacy Is At Risk. He argues convincingly that when data becomes centralized and unaccounted for, privacy rights become at risk... even when companies aren't explicitly targeting individuals personally. Until then, however, here's a summary of three things you probably didn't know about your favorite tech titan. 1. A pioneer of ecommerce With no official birth date available, founder and chief executive officer Jeffrey P. Bezos seems like some sort of mysterious cyborg god figure presiding over the cloud computing platform known simply as AWS By 1970, Rodger Dean had bought books.com, which became the leading site selling used volumes. One of the legs in its early growth strategy was to sell copies of textbooks to students via mail order, at discounted rates - part of the reason why textbook publishing was so valued during that time period. Today, the site continues to offer titles directly to readers, but offers similar pricing discounts through third party sellers whose relationships with publishers may be viewed skeptically due to concerns regarding price competition. In 1980, operating under the handle jimboebluebeef, Bezos launched Zippyshare, a service offering free file sharing among users. The idea was straight out of PayPal inventor Peter Thiel's playbook, tapping into a gap between peer-based content distribution models prevalent today at sites like YouTube (which launched two years earlier) and Spotify (2010 launch). As an added bonus, eBay cofounder Pierre Omidyar helped fund the venture. While 2000 soldiered along mostly unaffected by the dot com bust, 2001 saw gross revenue drop 20 percent after investors lost interest in Internet stocks amid fears AOL Time Warner would soon gobble up Yahoo Search Marketing began to grow exponentially in 2002 thanks to widespread adoption in search traffic driven by Google's IPO later that year. Between 2003 and 2007, Recyclebank owner doubleClick ads accounted for 23 percent of Doubleclick board member John Doerr's personal wealth According to Forbes magazine, owner Frank Colla wasn't thrilled, but said yes anyway. Now the company boasts 500 million registered members, 90 billion pages viewed annually, and 100 million total monthly active advertisers - including Microsoft, IBM, Samsung, Ford, General Motors, Delta Air Lines, ATT, Motorola Mobility and Coca Cola. AutoNation Plus isn't exactly a household brand name, yet last November the retailer won the contract to run auto dealership inventory management system Opesia Systems Inc. After starting off operationally testing the software with 600 dealerships around North America, it aims to expand with roughly 40 stores open by summer 2013. 3. An innovator of personalized recommendations Almost since inception, Amazon started down roads others have followed ad infinitum. From 1998 until 2005, Bezos funded PortalPlayer web video startup with 100,000 per month. Created by Bill Joy, creator of the UNIX System V editor vi and author of legendary BSD kernel hacker paper titled ""A Case Against Software Patents,"" portalplayer.org stood apart because of its ability to let viewers pick and choose different scenes, actors and sound effects.

"Uber has launched Uber Direct and Uber Connect, two trial programs to help people get groceries, medications, and basic supplies. Direct brings items from stores to people's homes, while Connect is a program that lets them deliver things like prescriptions or blood pressure monitors directly to their doorsteps. In theory, this could be great for anyone who needs something delivered or has little time to do it themselves - if the company can pull it off efficiently enough. But it comes at an uncomfortable cost: neither service will let you select anything but what they have on hand in your region. The upside? It means Amazon Go-style grocery pickup without having to wait around unloading boxes of food into your car (or worse). You'd probably still want to check out both services' respective apps before making any commitment, though.",0,41
"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate light at different wavelengths and scales, offering a new approach for manipulating electromagnetic fields[b1]. The most common metasurface is an array of subwavelength metallic elements on top of a dielectric substrate, which has been shown in numerous studies as having many unique optical effects such as spatial focusing, wavefront shaping, spectral conversion, polarization control etc.[b2b3] In addition to these classical functions, some recent studies have demonstrated two-dimensional (2D) photonic bandgap (PBG) [b4], negative refractive index behavior (NRI), cloaking, or perfect lensing[b5b6], where all functions could be achieved by changing geometrical parameters (e.g. distance between adjacent elements). However, due to the strong coupling with the ambient environment through their complex structure, it remains very challenging for conventional metal arrays embedded inside insulators to exhibit desired functionalities over broad bands of frequencies simultaneously without degradation of their performance. Recently, nanostructures consisting of alternating layers composed of high permittivitylow conductivity material pairs were reported to enable broadband operation across wide frequency ranges via intrinsic OnOff resonances within each individual layer[b7b8b9b10]. This kind of structures requires only one single layer per period instead of using multiple components like traditional periodic designs. However, this concept leads to significant reduction in device thickness. Therefore, people explored more thin devices based on multilayer stacks whose operating wavelength range remained limited[b11b12b13]. These limitations restrict their application scope especially when they work from visible region due to large absorption losses caused by electrical loss tangent. To get rid of these drawbacks, several researchers proposed hybrid architectures combining bulk metals with engineered surface plasmons excited by antenna probes[b14b15b16]. By constructing these multifunctional antennas, parametric amplifiers[b17b18b19], filters[b20], splitters[b21b22] and other functional units could be realized and realized monolithically[b23]. Although there exist various combinations of materials, geometries and layouts yielding good performances[b24b25], practical cases always depend heavily on fabrication processes which tend to introduce defects into the final products. As a result, much effort should be paid before realizing any real applications, since fabricated samples usually consist of noisy data obtained from destructive testing rather than accurate results derived from full simulations or nonlinear least squares fitting procedures. A promising way to establish correlations among measured responses and structural characteristics would provide valuable insights to understand and develop better solutions towards fabricating defect tolerant robust systems. A commonly used method is finite element simulation which provides detailed information about local electric field distribution under excitation source[b26]. Though a rigorous numerical analysis may be expensive and time consuming, it does not suffer the disadvantages suffered by experimental setups because: 1) It simulates actual unit cells; 2) The electric field response clearly reveals what happens within the system no matter how small changes occur; 3) Radiation boundary conditions accurately model propagation outside sample boundaries; 4) Charges do not move during calculations therefore simulated current density distributions look identical to those produced by analytical techniques; 5) Unlike the experiments in general, simulations reveal true functionality of the designed networks[b27]; 6) Flexibility allowed by software makes analyzing geometry variations easy; 7) An ideal solution lies somewhere in the middle between theory and experiment thus numerical modeling allows us to pinpoint a design strategy that works best with minimal cost of experimentation and validation[b28]. In our previous study, we successfully realized NIR emission enhancement using silicon nitride films deposited atop silver nanoparticles[b29]. Herein, we apply similar concepts to realize another type of function PL quenching. Graded polymer composites broadly applied in electronic packaging industry present excellent thermal bonding qualities compared to other adhesive polymers[b30]. We expect them to be extremely attractive candidates for the next generation interconnections. While, poor dispersion properties of polymer matrices in combination with high temperatures lead to increased power consumption and low reliability during soldering operations[b31]. Van der Waals interactions between neighboring filler particles resulting in localized hot spots could potentially improve adhesion loci while maintaining uniformity at reduced temperature[b32]. Furthermore, direct contact between mixing phases causes parasitic conduction paths inducing cross talk noise between adjacent circuits[b33], which severely limits circuit integrity. Undoped SiOX fillers in epoxy matrix show good dispersive properties and are widely adopted in commercial packages to strengthen mechanical stability by forming continuous network throughout composite filling area[b34]. Thus far, out-of-concerted zone is probably cause against they found themselves seem to remain amortos will sway away went asto soap play its coopote Model along",0,42
"Software developers have discovered references to a new Apple operating system, realityOS, in App Store upload logs and GitHub repositories. Apple has been known to be working on a mixed -reality platform codenamed 'T288' but now the company seems prepared for public beta testing with an internal name of realityOS 1.0. The user interface is based around the concept of augmented or virtual objects floating above real ones in front of you so it makes sense that this technology would be called'mixed'. That's probably what users will experience when they get their hands on Reality OS - no more need for bulky headsets like HoloLens, just use your iPhoneiPad. The speculation from other tech giants who are said to be interested in developing software in collaboration with another gaming giant Microsoft includes Google, Facebook, Amazon, Samsung... We also know that Mark Zuckerberg met with Tim Cook in March 2018 at which point Mr.Cook mentioned that he was looking forward to seeing Facebook move into ARVR technologies, considering his strong belief in the power of social media platforms as fundamental tools for changing people's lives. One could argue that Facebook already achieves this effect through its Stories feature while others revel over taking photos posted by friends digitally superimposed onto a background image. But VR and AR seem to offer even greater potential to manipulate our brains from outside. Apple seems finally ready to take part in this revolution: the first reports are coming after months of silence regarding a possible release date. After years of development, maybe we can expect Reality OS sometime next year. A recent report about a ""real"" Apple headset dating back to 2014 shows how far ahead Apple really is on mixed reality (and facial recognition). According to MacRumors' sources, the developer kit ""has yet to see any significant changes since then."" This should hopefully make us believe things may change soon enough. So if nothing else happens before 2020, don't worry too much. You'll still be able to buy an iPad Pro 13 inch 128 GB WiFI model starting today!",0,43
"Virgin appears to have changed its mind on how it plans to build its Hyperloop since its tests at the end of last year. The company recently released new designs for a test track that would enable engineers and scientists from around the world to conduct research about what is required to achieve the next big step in high-speed transportation - traveling more than 500 miles per hour by creating an evacuated tube through which vehicles travel without touching each other or the walls. The idea behind this ""transportation system"" is not just to make people go faster, but also to shave off as much distance between two points as possible so you can get there quicker while achieving lower costs. As Virgin says: ""Hyperloop One's goal is to be the first company to deliver hyperloop services across North America and to bring the economic benefits of rapid transit into places where no one has ever imagined before,"" said Executive Chairman Naval Ravikant during his keynote address at SXSW 2017. ""Our technology will change the way we live.""",0,46
"An egg fossil was discovered in Antarctica in 2011. It was 11 inches long and 7 inches wide. Researchers have determined that the egg came from a massive aquatic reptile, which they named Rhopalosaurus coelophysis (R for Reptiles, P for Parasaurolophus or Sauropterygia [Greek for lizard wing] Coelophysoid). The name of this genus comes from ""reptile"" Greek for feather-covered basis of bird wings. The earliest dinosaur eggs were found in Upper Triassic strata in South Africa in 1881; however, most such fossils are fragments of broken shells. Dinosaurs first appeared around 205 million years ago and became dominant predators on land about 230 million years ago until their extinction 10 million years later along with all other large reptiles at the end of Cretaceous Period 65 mya. Since then only crocodilians, birds and pterosaurs remain as living representatives of these animals. Dinosaur eggs are important to science because some researchers think that dinosaurs laid live young rather than laying eggs containing preserved embryos. If just one parent survived after reproducing, it could pass its genes onto future generations if embryos develop inside an adult female without being eaten by another predator. Until recently scientists thought that no mega fauna existed during the late Mesozoic when the age of dinosaurs dominated life on earth. However, after many discoveries since 2001, scientists now believe there may be evidence that dinosaurs did indeed produce live offspring just like mammals do today! A new species of monitor lizard has been unearthed in the Philippines' Visayas region. This is the third known member of Monitor lizards (Varanidae) existing in Asia south of China, following Varanus hanitschi and V. gabonensis. It belongs to the subfamily Sphenodontinae within Varanids. Its scientific name means ""spiny-toothed."" The Vietnamese spiny-toed monitors are closely related to each other and also share similarities with Varanus komodoensis although the latter is much larger in size, reaching lengths up to 1 meter (3 feet) and weighing up to 50 kgs (110 lbs.) Another notable characteristic feature shared by Asian members of Sphenodonates is presence of enlarged scales over the tail peduncle. As opposed to varanids, both sides of Sphenodons grow equally and there is always flexibility between individual parts (tail scale tips), thus enabling them to curl towards body axis when grasped. Lizard species belonging to Sphenodons can be differentiated based upon the number of dorsal scutes present: one pair in Sphenodon tetragonocephalus and closely related S. carinatus but two pairs in S. elegans and three pairs on average in other forms. There are currently five recognized valid genera within Varanoidea family worldwide including Sphenodens, Cacatua, Agama, Gymnochelaremus Pelmatolagora. This type of monospecific florivorous bats of Neotropical regions use objects for hunting prey, instead of sight. That's why there isn't any specific term used describing this kind of bat. Instead heshe is called Moneiros (loosely translated into English meaning ""objects due to his habits of using different types of objects as hunting tools. Some species start eating fruits directly from trees while others eat insects caught below tree branches. A special adaptation of this Bat species is its ability to quickly change color in order to blend perfectly into various environments. They're typically brownish black colored monkeyshines with lighter underside area caused by small hairs covering skin surface. Each arm features 3 fingers ending with 2 prehensile claws, a single nose leaf supported by nostril tube and 2 separate ears located on top of head location. Major functions of moneiroes include echolocation and food processing. In comparison to other groups of New World Monkeyshine Bats they have relatively shorter ear length with short furrowed zygomatic arches, whereas Phyllostomas rarely display small rounded skull with pronounced sagittal crest and show quite long faces relative to forearm bone length. Both sexes exhibit similar physical characteristics except males tend to bigger (body mass more than 8 oz.). Males tend to disperse towards areas where berries are abundant due to fruit selection as main diet source. Meanwhile females usually stay closer to roosting sites during mating season and give birth to litters of approximately 4 babies every year. At birth they weigh approx. 0.03 oz., stand tall (4 high). Their eyes are protected by thick lenses made of keratinized tissue, hence giving the appearance of glasses. Much like humans moneirous suffer from cave accidents, getting stuck underground or struck against rocks resulting in death in 99 cases. Nocturnal activity leads to common misconception among people that they sleep during day time hours; however, unlike typical sleeping pattern seen in primates, moneireos rest knowing nothing, remaining unknown in general population group we assume.

"Uber has launched a new option that allows passengers to communicate their preferences to drivers before they are picked up. Uber Comfort costs around 20 to 40 percent more than the normal fare, but it's designed for people who want an extra cushion in case of delays or traffic. Surprisingly at least on first glance this feature is not available worldwide yet. The service only appears to be offered in some parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, as shown by the ""only available"" tags visible inside the app window. The assumption was that this would become another example of how ride-sharing companies like Lyft have been copying features from its major competitor Uber over time, including self-driving cars. It wouldn't make sense if both companies were launching similar features at the same exact moment. However, it looks like those assumptions may've been wrong, because Uber now says that Comfort doesn't work everywhere just yet: We're excited about what we can offer our riders with this technology, but there's so much left to build, learn, test and perfect - which means you won't see availability beyond SFLA right away. We will continue making improvements throughout 2019. In Q4, expect us to roll out additional markets, such as Denver, Miami, Houston, Phoenix and Austin (TX). With your help, I know we'll get there sooner rather than later. Learn More This is great news! Now all these cities could potentially gain a competitive advantage over other providers. That being said, however, why isn't this directly compatible with the uberX model? Why do people pay premium fares when most services don't allow them to communicate where exactly they'd prefer to go? And isn't it easy enough for someone sitting next to you to note down your destination address without having to use the entire app?",0,48
"Uber is allowing its customers to see what ratings they have received from drivers. Customers will be able to see their ratings in the app's new privacy menu. Uber uses a three-star system, and the company says it has improved how negative reviews are dealt with under both local laws and international human rights guidelines.[1] The CEO told USA Today that he hopes the move will help remove bad actors from the service by showing everyone exactly who hasn't been following the rules. ""The ones you don't want on there aren't going anywhere,"" Dara Khosrowshahi said of his efforts at cleaning up the app.[23] A day after this story was published, Lyft also started giving rideshare users access to information about themselves through an updated version of its Customer Experience page. Other companies like Airbnb and Wayfair are also adding similar features in the future but Google still doesn't allow people to review or rate their own Street View cars. Google Maps changed some of its default settings for taking photos without driver consent last year, including limiting when the camera can start recording automatically to just five seconds before impact and requiring manual approval if a photo isn't taken within one minute. But these changes may not always apply depending on where your car travels on Earth unless you take specific steps to change certain preferences. You'll find more details below: In August 2001, Mapquest sued Yahoo! over web mapping content supplied by Microsoft. In 2005, the two parties reached a confidential settlement agreement which led to Yahoo!'s decision to endow MapQuest with exclusive use of Yahoo!'s data feeds.[16] As part of the deal, Microsoft agreed to pay 10 million as compensation for revenue lost due to consumer confusion resulting from Mapquest.com being listed first in search engine results pages (SERPs) while using maps provided via Microsoft Live Search. However, in 2008, the Superior Court of California overruled the lower court ruling in favor of Yahoo!, finding that although Mapquest had infringed upon Microsoft's trade secrets, it did so only minutes after contacting Microsoft for information regarding licensing terms;[17] thus, even though Mapquest used data generated from MSN searchesmaps, it never violated any contractual obligations to Microsoft. The best way to get around having crappy map apps is really good old fashioned paper directions. I'm sick of trying to decipher those little tiny print maps all the time.

[Source: Business Insider David Kravets] Although the road map is unclear, Tesla appears to be close to rolling out ""full self driving capability"" across its entire lineup as soon as 2018. That includes full autonomy on highways and limited assistance - such as lane centering - off highways. Such vehicles won't require steering wheels nor pedals, and passengers can expect seats equipped with ejection mechanisms, because humans tend to be lousy fliers. For example, consider a customer who wants to buy a house. They look online and choose several homes based solely on images found online. A homeowner looks through Alexa devices and sees that she has multiple requests set up which can lead her right to their home. After looking at pictures, videos and other types of media, she makes an offer. Once the process is complete, she pays for the home through Amazon Pay. At the top of almost every smartphone sold today sits the operating system known as Android - a free platform developed by a nonprofit group called the Open Handset Alliance (OHA). More than 5 billion smartphones worldwide now run software based directly or indirectly on OHA code created since 2007 by device manufacturers, carriers, chip makers, and others inside and outside the mobile industry. Those billions of devices rely on all sorts of hardware parts, many manufactured by companies located near the developing world. So far, most of us haven't given much thought to them - until recently. One reason: Our understanding of the people living nearby those factories has lagged behind the pace of technology development. Until very recently, sources of conflict were few and well separated, mostly confined to places no longer inhabited by anyone. And the digital divide - magnified by the need to download something called an OS update - has prevented millions of poor Indians, Chinese, Malaysians, Indonesians, Filipinos, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Africans, Latinos, Arabs, etc., from enjoying smartphone life.

The eight-story office building under construction along Potomac Avenue near Downtown Disney plans to include 1,400 square feet dedicated exclusively to the use of the Walt Disney Co.'s theme parks restaurants and retail stores. It was first envisioned 15 years ago before opening day for Epcot Center Resort Spa.Located just north of where the hotel now stands, the original design included three floors surrounded with a sea wall and walking paths overlooking Disney Springs. But five years later, car traffic convinced park officials to rethink their strategy, and instead the roadway was widened between hotels and shopping centers to accommodate cars. By 2009, the area was already heavily developed, leaving little opportunity for public space.So Park Authority staff set out again this year to study possibilities, eventually zeroed in on two options: an island accessible via pedestrian bridges or long ramps built into Potomac Road.A third option involves placing one bridge connecting to Potomac Road across Leesburg Pike and another across Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard next to the planned parking garage to connect directly to Disney Springs. According to a draft environmental impact report released last week, each of these three concepts would cost 4 million or less; overall the cheapest solution.To provide customers who might want to spend money immediately near the resort without having to cross busy roads, the developers propose reserving a small portion of land off the side streets adjacent to Potomac Rd., specifically: East Street, West Street, Orchard St. and North Lombardy Ave. They describe this smaller amount of land totaling almost half the total available on a single parcel, in addition to the rest of the site, as something that wouldn't affect any existing properties nor interfere with future development decisions.Deal details are confidential until council votes on Sept. 24th, although we've learned that lawyers representing the developer, LNR Properties LLC, are trying to get the proposal approved during budget deliberations so it doesn't go up against the Oct. 2 deadline Mayor Mufi Hannemann announced earlier this month. Residents have expressed concern with anything resembling additional congestion from too many people driving into Disney World, especially given residential neighborhoods already experiencing increased traffic density due to new developments such as PGA Village and Sunbank Hills.But details aside, residents in the immediate neighborhood seem generally supportive of taking action sooner rather than later.""We need a better answer,"" said Todd Woodson, president of the residents association that formed six months ago. He acknowledged he didn't know how feasible either of the potential layouts really were, calling them ""unorthodox designs.""Woodson criticized planners who tried ""to push things through without anyone asking questions.This stuff came out of nowhere,"" he added.He suggested looking at surrounding areas already zoned for commercial uses at least throughout part of the district.""If someone [in] Atlanta wants to come here and develop, I'd say if.I'm saying to bring tidings.It seems like what?""Trying to enforce.Your confederates' Raving term having gone forth with the",0,52

[...] Read more "" The most popular CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal and Joomla all provide a text editor interface with which users may edit their pagesposts freely without any knowledge about programming language. However, what happens when these editors don't support code highlighting feature? No one wants to see plain html tags while editing content. Moreover, such systems require constant maintenance from developers who find themselves constantly fixing out-of-date plugins and themes. This issue could become even worse if you develop a website using both static files (html) dynamic data (php). The reason behind the above statement is simple - php needs to work dynamically before displaying output on screen whereas static HTML does not change unless you update them manually or via an automated system. If your hosting provider provides WYSIWYG editor facility then they might charge a lot because normally WYSGWYG tools store entire page source along with images, style sheets and other resources required for rendering. To avoid such problems people prefer open source software but still there exists no solution that completely satisfies user experience i.e., rapid development time coupled with better user experience at same cost than proprietary players. That's why many developers opt for statically coded languages having inbuilt compiler instead of writing TEMPLATE files everytime for changing each line of template. You won't believe it but none of CSS frameworks support inline styling across multiple lines except CodeMirror. This framework allows developer to write JavaScript within normal JS syntax rather than { } brackets. It also supports various builtin options and configuration settings like auto indentation, tabulation, outlining, folding, smart wrapping and much more. All these types of facilities makes developer life easy and saves lots of precious hours of his coding debugging. There are few more similar good libraries available for common markup task like replacing p tag and adding missing classes and IDs. They basically do the job just fine most of the times without interfering with regular structure of developing site. But are those tools enough? Do they save your time? Definitely yes. Let me tell you something - even though CodeMirror gives you a very powerful set of features while working on your project, sometimes it becomes too complex to handle few minor tasks quickly. A perfect case example would be Page Break option that automatically breaks down long page contents into several smaller segments so that visitor doesn't lose interest midway. Unfortunately, almost all modern websites are designed following ""one big design document"" approach. Putting aside the fact whether it is right or wrong; CDO means creating bunch of div elements leading up to actual webpage sourcecode itself. Now think - How difficult it would be to add some extra semantic class in between these two sections making whole layout look nice and clean? Save yourself from struggling through multiple issues and try Nindent plugin. With Nindent you can simply select desired section, type 'tab' key to expand current selection to next block level element and remove excess space between paragraphs effortlessly. Apart from these features Nindent is geared towards simplifying indenting stylesheets and js files. Using nindent.js you can analyze large chunk of css or javascript and rectify line length according to preferred tabs size. These features alone are worth 10-100 per year depending upon your business model, and thus, they're free for personal non-commercial purpose only. Well, besides saving time and reducing frustration, another main advantage is improved readability to visitors and search engines. Most of the browsers nowadays bring out native browser extensions in order to replace mouse clicks with keyboard shortcuts. One notable extension called TinyURL uses URL shortening service offered by tinyurl.com that reduces URLs up to 4 characters. This tool helps in preserving original URLs provided during bookmarking process although shortened versions are equally useful in boosting marketing efforts. Another handy feature is converting Google Bookmarks to Delicious and Digg links. Now imagine, having to click 1 button exactly once in order to get saved link instead of doing 500 separate actions to accomplish single goal. Although Nindent isn't the exact term that determines whether values occur in real estate. Therefore, attempting to instatistics' functionless mission turns out badly behaving to retain behavior.

"New details about Google's new Pixel 4 have been leaked on Jon Prosser's YouTube channel. Prosser has previously leaked accurate details on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, as well as a number of other devices like the OnePlus 6T. While this leak is not completely uncorroborated by official sources (we are still waiting for an unboxing video), it does provide some additional info based off previous leaks or rumors that we've already seen in the past regarding both hardware features and software improvements coming with the upcoming flagship smartphones from Google. What you're seeing above are renders of what will be one of two models being sold under the ""Google Pixel"" moniker: The larger version will come with 64GB internal storage while the smaller model will only include 32GB worth of space. Both will retain their ultra-wide camera setups but there may also be support for wireless charging - although without any external cables attached to either phone. There's no mention of Face Unlock yet though so who knows how secure the biometric authentication option might actually prove now after years of development time? We'll likely find out when these phones launch next month. The render shows standard rear fingerprint sensors on top of each handset, which feels very similar to last year's edition, however they could end up filling most if not all of the upper half of the back panel. This would replace dual front facing cameras featured on the current Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL handsets, instead featuring just a single wide angle sensor alongside a slightly wider FHD resolution lens across its width. As expected the display tech should remain unchanged at 5.7 inches since that figure was confirmed in July during Google IO 2018 Keynote event along with every other key specification. Although, the display size itself remains unknown until further information surfaces later down the line. There appears to be little change between the left hand side of the body and the right side apart from the disappearance of a speaker grill decor found on older iterations of the lineup. It looks like a black finish remains standard here, unlike the blue variant launched earlier this summer that might continue on into the future. If true then pricing figures mentioned in Google Assistant section below aren't far fetched given the 799 price tag attributed to the regular 64GB model. However, don't expect the lower priced 32GB unit to start at substantially less than that amount. A lot depends on whether or not carriers bundle anything extra onto this handset such as monthly data plans and contracts given that many potential customers might want more flexibility in terms of plan duration versus outright cost. For those looking closely, the white colored device pictured above matches exactly with what multiple retailers including BH Photo Video have reported over the past few weeks. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be much else revealed at present besides this tidbit plus supporting specs and possible variants listed in the table above. In addition to pictures showing the design changes made to the hardware, several videos where passed around on social media showcasing various animations on the new system running Android 9 Pie with GMS38N firmware installed. These included an animation that showcases a gesture-based replacement for the home button; a swipe upwards unlocks your screen and downwards brings up recent apps. In another instance, if you press power twice quickly, it enables Do Not Disturb mode, shuts off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth simultaneously unless that function is disabled manually through settings before turning them back on again once it ends, among other things. One thing that does raise concerns is the fact that Google seems to have bundled content from Amazon's streaming platform directly inside Play Store app on iOS 11.1. While you can download movies and TV show episodes outside of the main application using third party browser extensions or even sideloading iMessage extensions, it would make sense why Apple isn't allowing users access to full-fledged standalone applications otherwise known as mobile web browsers. That said, having a search box embedded within the app makes a whole lot more sense if indeed that's part of the deal. Regardless, we think blocking direct links to other platforms' services is going too far especially considering Google hasn't done so on Android ever since the introduction of the Chrome experience nearly three years ago. You'd probably need to dig deep to find evidence indicating either situation is happening nowadays but it's definitely something worth keeping tabs on if changes take place anytime soon. Being forced to use web URLs is clearly a great way to improve user adoption and engagement for most smartphone owners regardless of operating system or manufacturer. But forcing consumers to jump off the comfort zone of native apps entirely because of licensing issues is pretty much unheard of. So perhaps Google believes it needs to address significant concerns surrounding digital rights management and Copyright Act takedown notices to stay competitive in the fast changing market industry. Or maybe we simply misunderstood last week's announcement. Either way, we look forward to finding out everything we missed in our remaining 12 days of exclusivity for 2019's flagships!

"Fleet is a build tool for Rust. It can compile up to five times faster than cargo. Fleet works by optimizing builds using existing tooling available in the Rust ecosystem. Why? Overall, building with Cargo or rustc takes on average 10 minutes per project (1-2 if you're doing it from scratch). That time adds up when compiling larger projects andor working on multiple projects at the same time. Building twice as fast means saving 2 hours of work every day! This saves developers precious time which they could have spent writing code instead... so why not use it?! The Time Savings Add Up Over The Long Term With Publish-Local Publish-local has been around since 2015 but was only recently released into stable. In fact, there are still some issues that need to be ironed out before we say ""it's production ready."" However, we think this will change very soon. What makes publish-local great is its ability to upload artifacts back to crates.io without needing any extra dependencies. Since cargo will already copy certain files over during syncing, this allows us to skip deploy after compilation while also getting our open source content published quickly. Compiling large projects: 10 Faster Than Using Cargo We developed Fleet primarily because we were tired of spending way too much time waiting for long compilation cycles. A single binary generated via complex macros can take a few seconds longer to generate than one built manually, especially if you have many libraries included! Like most people, I knew about build tools like make, xargo, etc., but I didn't know anything about them until I came across fleet. Turns out, they actually do exist! While make and friends generate all binaries for your application, they don't necessarily optimize things well. So what's the solution? Let someone else worry about generating outputs - just tell them where to put stuff! Work smarter, not harder And that's exactly how fleets solves the speed problem! By following best practices to organize their workflow, teams can shave 1 minutes off each compile cycle. We've seen results even after deploying multiples versions of the compiler simultaneously. How does Fleet Make Compilation Even Faster? Fleets main goal is to maximize efficiency by taking advantage of technology outside of the standard library such as autotools, GNU Automake, libtool, pkgconfig, CMake, etc. Specifically, Fleet tries to minimize duplicated effort while providing higher level abstractions like dependencies, package management, setup scripts, and more. In addition, we provide custom build rules which optimize further. Here are some examples: Build Rules Use Dependency Management Tools Autoreconf runs re-compiles everything automatically whenever you perform an update. You may wonder, ""why would you ever want to run 'autoclean'?"" Well, imagine having two different editors pushing changes at once. If both push commits with conflicting paths, then you'll get conflicts later in the build process. Not good. To avoid these situations, autoclean simply updates compiled assets without touching executables. For example, suppose a dependency changed between revisions. Imagine if cargo had updated dependencies inside the executable rather than letting you specify it yourself. Now the executable needs to be recompiled against new headers; however, you never fired cargo again to rebuild those header files - leaving you with stale outdated data. As a result, running autorestclean prevents this situation entirely.

"Gene Levoff, the previous senior director of law and corporate security at Apple until September last year, has been charged with securities fraud and is set to appear in court on Monday. The charges are a result of an investigation by FBI agents that began after Mr Levoff was arrested in May 2014 following allegations from two former employees who said they were victims of ""sustained harassment"" over their work performance as well as race and sexual orientation discrimination. The four-year probe into these complaints culminated in charges against the tech giant for what will be one of the biggest hacking scandals ever. According to reports, the charges relate to alleged manipulation of financial data related to company stock through various schemes involving Bloomberg terminals, which are used to access real time market information. As part of his arrest, it is also reported that prosecutors had led him to believe he would not face criminal charges if he agreed to assist them with their investigations into other subjects. However, this appears to have changed when federal prosecutors ultimately opted for prosecution, rather than use plea bargaining on what are described by sources close to the case as ""very serious matters."" Mr Levoff's arrest adds to a long list of high profile figures already ensnared in legal proceedings relating to cybercrime or mishandling of classified government secrets, including Jeffrey Sterling, Robert Hanssen, Julius Knipl, Edmund Lee but most notably Edward Snowden whose remand hearing is now due to take place next week. It remains unclear whether Mr Levoff has retained counsel as yet however public records show no prior representation and Reuters cites multiple current and former colleagues familiar with the issue as saying he only recently hired private legal help after reaching out to friends. Prior to working at Apple, Mr Levoff spent more than seven years at Hewlett Packard where he held positions ranging from software embed engineer to executive vice president of global solutions marketing before moving onto Sun Microsystems. At HP he worked on initiatives addressing such issues as cyber risk management and ICT support to combat terrorist attacks during both the 2001 and 119 terror events. In October 2005 Mr Levof took up a role within Google Inc., based in California, USA as head of enterprise product development. There he built upon past experiences developing anti spyware technology and became responsible for its application to all areas of Google operations, eventually being promoted to lead developer of distributed systems engineering. Prior to joining Apple in June 2012, he served as general manager, external relations strategic partnerships at Dropbox. He joined Dropbox in 2011 as group Vice President, External Relations heading Communications, PR, Government Affairs, Legal Department, Advocacy, EU Policy, Global Security Litigation. Before then he founded several companies and worked alongside senior executives at General Electric Corporation, Intel Technology Group, Dell Computer Company, Microsoft Corp., Silicon Graphics Incorporated, Apple Computer, Red Hat Inc., SGI International Ltd., and Oracle America. Mr Levoff, pictured above left, graduated with honors from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1980 and continued with computer science studies there sporadically between 1981 to 1989 while holding numerous internships at IBM and Commodore Computers, among others. Upon graduation Mr Levoff entered Harvard University graduating magna cum laude with a degree in mathematics in 1984 followed by earning a master's degree, doctorate, and certification as a Certified Public Accountant from New York State Board Of Regents - Accounting. According to LinkedIn contacts, he attended Yale School of Management's Information Systems class and received formal training in project scheduling analysis and control theory. Other skills listed include: computer programming languages; Java, C, COBOL; operating system design; database design; object oriented language design; concept mappingGIS projects, graphic arts, Web site creation, desktop publishing. A representative for Mr Levoff told The Independent whilst expressed surprise that he is facing charges, Mr Levoff maintains his innocence and intends to defend himself vigorously. No further comment regarding specifics surrounding the case can be made given ongoing litigation. A message seeking comment from Apple was not immediately returned today. Apple in recent times has faced problems allegedly linked to third party app developers using iOS apps to pilfer personal details of customers as well as share their passwords to sensitive websites via unsecured channels. Most notoriously, mobile banking platform Square launched an update earlier this month allowing users to install malware capable of stealing credit card numbers, bank account login credentials etc. Shortly thereafter Apple responded to news of malicious code appearing in its iTunes store letting owners download media files that contained trojans able to steal usernames, email addresses and passwords - a first for the app retailer. Subsequently it emerged that hackers trying to sell iCloud accounts hijacked user devices and paid for services in order to siphon off any valuable information gained. Last December, it spawned scandalous claims that police technology could track suspects' movements simply by looking at their iPhones. One report suggested mobile device manufacturers were complicit in enabling authorities to snoop on people without suspicion of wrongdoing because of the need to protect consumers against counterfeit goods sold bona-fychus car drivers are driven sluggishness; To begin with. an uninin case unnecessary. unable to",0,59

"Most smartphones sold today have large displays and this presents new challenges and opportunities for app makers and designers. The first iPhone was designed for comfortable one-handed operation, but larger screens often require two hands - which can make it hard to do certain things like pinch-to zoom or scale a map while driving. iOS 7's ""split view interface"" addresses these issues by making the left half of an iPad display smaller than before (except when you're using Mail) so that you don't have to stretch your thumb and finger all around the screen. But split views are also useful in phone design because they provide space for buttons on both sides of the device without taking up too much real estate. This is what Apple calls its Slide Over interface: It's where you can get info about weather or news updates from Twitter as well as reply to messages with a keyboard. And it works great most places except at home: On my MacBook Pro I find myself sliding over my Photos folder every time I want to see some photos - not something I enjoy doing during dinner or even bedtime! So we asked our team to create mockups showing how apps might use iOS 7's Split View features differently if they were redesigned specifically for phones instead of tablets. We thought about everything including privacy settings, fonts and colors that would help keep content separate from each other. Here's what we came up with.

"Facebook's Deepfake Detection Challenge is an open competition to find algorithms that can spot AI-manipulated videos. This year's winning algorithm could spot real-world examples of deep fakes with an average accuracy rate around 50 per cent, and it comes from a Russian company called FakeApp. The submission video above shows how the system works in action against two different kinds of fake: one where text has been pasted onto someone else's face (a ""face changer, and another where audio or sound effects have been added. In both cases, the system identifies the manipulated parts as they happen, so you never lose sight of exactly what was used to manipulate your view - no matter how much editing takes place afterwards. The analysis isn't perfect; the team behind this new approach says their model needs more training data before its detection rates improve enough to be usable by organisations such as Facebook looking for ways to identify fraudulent news stories on social media platforms. Still, there are some impressive results here, including between 75.6 per cent and 89.9 per cent accurate detection of manipulated images posted between late March and early May 2019. If anything, the biggest takeaway from these preliminary results is just how good machine learning technology truly is when applied correctly - which is something we've known all along but somehow still need reminding about.",0,63

"A new Tesla Semi truck prototype has been spotted in Truckee, CA. The engineering has been completed on the truck and some production models are scheduled for late 2021. There is also an upcoming ""semi-truck"" unveiling event later this year that will showcase the potential of electric trucks for local delivery services like Amazon Flex. The first set of Semi prototypes arrived to Fremont Company Truck Test Center near Los Angeles early last week after they were delivered from Gigafactory 1 in Nevada last month by a special security team with armored cars and helmets equipped with night vision cameras. According to insiders at Tesla SpaceX who have seen these trucks up close while it was being loaded into large trailers: Tesla began testing their own semi-trailer design (sans trailer) back before Elon Musk tweeted out his plans to develop a commercial version of the Model 3 as an affordable long distance carrier vehicle. Those prototypes had no roof or glass windows. They looked more like a van than anything else. Engineers know what kind of weight capacities they want which means we can expect the truck body shell to be made mostly of aluminum alloy steel panels where each panel will weigh less than two pounds per square foot so total mass does not become too burdensome. We could see the current driver position move forward towards the middle flat portion of the bed just behind the cab because it would make sense if the crew cab model needs extra headroom. A few changes might include having another power outlet above the front seats if passengers need charging devices plugged into them now but there may even be additional outlets further down inside. It appears Tesla engineers have had multiple rounds of test drives since then along Highway 99 but there shouldn't be any major issues. Last September, when Elon announced he wanted to build 75k miles worth of real world data for its autonomous driving system via real highway trips which included going through mountain passes and other challenging conditions, he assured fans there would still be plenty of room left over for regular daily commutes. He said he didn't feel nervous about doing all those deliveries personally taking time away from building cool new products especially when you consider how demanding the job of CEO is already. Perhaps Elon still gets excited about making deliveries in person? It definitely makes sense given the fact that semi-automated tech with self-driving hardware isn't ready yet and nearly every one of us who drive already do thousands of miles per year regularly without thinking twice about it. What better way to help get people used to getting around town instead of simply sitting in traffic jams and parking lots? But here's something else Donald Trump probably doesn't realize... As he mentioned during his recent trip to California, Senator Chuck Schumer promised to use his influence to push legislation requiring manufacturers to produce certain percentages of zero emission vehicles in the United States including automakers such as Tesla Motors Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.. Many believe companies don't want to sell EVs due to demand problems and uncertainty associated with a brand new technology but maybe having a hefty mandate written in law makes them think differently. Also, unlike China, our government doesn't have tax incentives for EV sales. Such policies tend to remove strong competition among different offerings and therefore increase prices according to many economists. If consumers start seeing savings on gasoline bills compared to gas guzzler SUVs and trucks, things should change. After all, Americans pay 4 billion annually in higher fuel costs alone just for owning inefficient pickup trucks compared to Chinese counterparts whose average car costs only about 10 as much. Source - Wikipedia No matter what happens moving forward in terms of regulations, once Tesla starts shipping fully autonomous taxis offsite starting early next decade, there won't be anywhere to hide when it comes to safety standards. In addition to all the software work required to be done, designers must figure out the most efficient ways for humans to interact safely with AI. This includes everything from stationing trained staff nearby to monitor incoming requests in order to prevent accidents; giving customers full access to artificial intelligence apps at home including ones that control lighting fixtures and thermostats; developing effective user interfaces for drivers to operate autonomously; creating algorithms that handle emergency situations involving self-driven vanstaxis and 247 monitoring centers staffed by certified professionals to ensure a safe environment. These factors combined mean Tesla bears should prepare themselves for heavy regulatory scrutiny over the coming years meaning fewer roadster buyers and perhaps smaller profits until the actual transition begins. After almost five months of delays related to ramping up production numbers following initial launch, Tesla finally started delivering Model S sedans earlier this spring although there was never really a question mark surrounding availability. At least not a very big question mark because everyone knew the company would eventually deliver enough units to meet global customer demand. However, the delivery situation improved significantly once Tesla admitted to overpromising and underdelivering and offered various compensation packages promising to extend free loaner rentals and reimburse travel expenses for anyone who needed the service.

"Amazon has opened a brick-and-mortar clothing store in Los Angeles, California. Amazon Style will feature clothing from brands like Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger, Champion, and more. Store employees will be present to help customers with sizes, styles, fit information, etc., just as they would at an online or mobile app-based shopping experience. The new storefront is located inside the Pacific Design Center (PDC) shopping mall on Wilshire Boulevard, between Santa Monica Blvd. and Olympic Blvd. The location of this first Amazon Fashion shop follows years of speculation about where such a physical presence might occur. While rumors have circulated that an Amazon ""concept"" retail store was being built in Manhattan's Flatiron District for several months prior to its announcement last week, the company stresses it isn't setting up any sort of permanent operations there. Instead, Amazon promised: ""we'll set up pop up shops temporarily over time if we find a good site that fits our needs."" That said, the New York Times notes that Amazon owns properties in San Francisco, Washington D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Virginia Beach, Miami, London, Dublin Ireland and Las Vegas Nevada. A few other locations could be possible too. We expect another fashion concept store won't take long! According to CNBC sources, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook met privately Monday evening with President Donald Trump in what White House officials described to them as a positive tone during which Mr. Cook essentially asked Mr. Trump not to undermine him publicly by blasting his recent report recommending against U.S.-China tariffs, according to one person familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity due to the private nature of their conversations. Several people briefed on the conversation told CNBC that while tensions remained high ahead of Tuesday morning's scheduled negotiations among trade experts representing both sides of the table, senior aides laid out a case to make to Mr. Trump that he had already undermined himself. For example, Mr. Cook was concerned but didn't want to voice public concerns directly - that comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggesting trade talks were progressing may have been premature, two people briefed on the meeting told CNBC. It wasn't clear whether Mr. Cook specifically brought up the tariff issue, though President Trump earlier Sunday suggested he hadn't received a formal response from Chinese negotiators yet regarding his demands to drop levies before proceeding further. Any progress reported so far between the two countries' teams have largely centered around tech issues, those same people tell CNBC - without acknowledging specific details. Apple may soon release Macs featuring Intel processors rather than relying exclusively on chips created under contract to AMD. According to Bloomberg News, Apple currently relies solely on ARM-designed system-on-chips (SoCs), used in many phones and tablets today, including iPhones and iPads. However, these SoCs are manufactured by Samsung, Qualcomm, MediaTek, HiSilicon, Marvell, Broadcom and others, all of whom produce competing products. With regard to the latter three companies, each offers similar versions of chip designs that can run iOS; MarketIntel says that non-ARM x86 CPUs offer better performance on average. But Apple hasn't looked to diversify away from ARM given that it holds a six year supply agreement with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). And reports surfaced recently that Apple even relied on Qualcomm processors when designing iPad Pro models. On top of that, Steve Jobs once referred to ARM technology as ""stupid,"" telling AnandTech back in 2012 how much he disliked using devices based on the CPU architecture because it ""can never scale."" There is also some evidence to suggest that Apple wants direct access to newer generations of ARM IP. This month, a patent application published to software developer Patently Apple detailed plans for a way to use Arm licensees' x64 extensions to enable code execution on 64bit systems. In addition, Andy Rubin, Vice President of Engineering at Google parent Alphabet, claims that Android Open Source Project (AOSP) developers haven't included ARM support for 64 bit operating modes because they don't control certain patents required for doing so, including ones owned by ARM. As a result, device manufacturers need to rely on older 32-bit instruction sets, despite having opted into licensing terms offered by the ARMs themselves.

"Amazon just announced a bunch of new gadgets ahead of the busy holiday shopping season. They include the Astro home robot, a smart thermostat, an Amazon Echo Show that can display things on your television and much more. Here's what you'll be able to buy (or rent) from now until Cyber Monday - November 28th: Astro is coming to US next month! The adorable Google Home competitor will come with a rear-facing camera so it can follow around kids or pets through its downward-firing speaker. It also has Alexa built in, allowing users to ask questions like ""where are my shoes?"" via voice commands. The touchscreen interface lets you use gestures to command the bot, which transitions seamlessly between actions based on context. For example, if you ask Astro to open up Netflix when she sees her favorite shows playing on TV, there's no delay as she finds them before opening up the streaming app. You have to manually turn off and restart the device for each action though. We haven't seen anything about battery life yet but it certainly seems like this could replace many traditional household robots out there already. Stranger Things 2 announcements were made during the show, too, hinting at multiple seasons worth of content. This isn't exactly breaking news, but Microsoft is continuing to release Windows 10 features without having major hardware partners ready to support them all the way back then. Case in point, today we got our hands on the first commercial version of Cortana being trained on SkyDrive's photos database - something deep integration into Microsoft's cloud services has been promised since day one. About six months ago I found myself trudging through the streets of New York City after the latest batch of snowfall dumped over four feet of white powder onto the city. My trusty smartphone seemed unable to handle some of the conditions; by the time I arrived at my destination, most of my contact information was automatically deleted. But this wasn't due to any mishaps or failures on Apple's part, it had simply become outdated. In fact, data backups aren't limited solely to physical devices either. Often times users choose not to make their contacts available offline because they know how easy it is to lose everything. In these modern days of constant connectivity it becomes hard to remember where or even who someone might be, making digital backup almost paramount. To help address this issue, I recently discovered and tested 4 apps aimed specifically at helping users back up their phone contacts - and I must say I really liked several of them. While three of those programs offer free service, the fourth costs 5 per year. So let's take look at the different options and see what makes them unique: I don't want Siri reading me the weather because frankly that sounds pretty annoying. However, I think the technology does plenty else well enough and while some people may find it intrusive, others are getting accustomed to using assistants in similar ways. As such, here's another trick to get Siri working better than ever... There are many reasons why a user would require an extra USB port on his Macbook Air - mainly for charging purposes. However, rarely do you need to plug-in two cables simultaneously...unless in rare cases. Unfortunately, depending upon usage patterns you sometimes end up needing both ports occupied - especially during peak hours like right after school finishes up. Well, speaking personally, you could always go back to 'old fashioned' methods of connecting accessories - including power banks. Instead, I came across something that works great for ultra-portable needs - it's called Pixel Dock Mini. This little gadget slips inside the boot area of the computer and provides additional charge capacity for a small mobile accessory. What's nice about this solution? If needed, you could easily remove the dock and put it away - meaning you're less likely to forget about it. Right now, however, setup takes place within seconds once unboxed...and you won't feel guilty leaving it plugged in overnight like with every other charger item we own.

"The most common issue for new data scientists is that they don't question their own results. It is important to validate the results that are generated from machines as the machine can always be tricked by an adversary with a large enough budget. Data science needs more than just programming skills, it also requires knowledge of statistical and computer science theories as well as understanding how different algorithms work under the hood. Many businesses will not pay good money to purchase such expertise on demand (unless you're working at Google or Facebook) so it becomes essential to find ways to build your own personal learning curve in order to gain these valuable lessons without paying too much upfront money. That's where this book comes into play! If you have found yourself buying expensive packages only to learn that there were all cases covered (and typically throwing away the vouchers), then this chapter could completely change your viewpoint. This means that we intend to present some real-life examples showing us exactly what happens when faced with incomplete training materials, overfitting issues, poor feature engineering, etc... So let's dig deeper into these topics, while you get ready to solve some interesting problems using Python! The power of code sharing We want to stress here the importance of code serialization. When doing research (or even basic analysis), one often finds himself trying out , 'pip install'ing libraries, running functions and reading variables values inside existing scripts. Inevitably he writes his own function based on past experience, or simply copypaste pieces of existing solutions because ""it works."" In our opinion such approach leads to many errors and bugs which may take quite a long time to debug or track down. Once again, technology does come handy in providing a solution: By default, Python provides a rich set of tools allowing you to easily share and reuse other people's source codes. For example, 'git clone', 'virtualenv' and 'ansible' allow you instantly access to projects developed by others with no need to write any code We further encourage developers to consider the following practices before writing custom solutions: 1. Create reusable modules containing pieces of logic 2. Write unit tests covering every small step performed throughout your method 3. Consider making use of popular library functions instead of reimplementing them from scratch 4. Explore alternatives to reinvent wheels by carefully considering if they already exist; otherwise, look for ways to contribute back to community efforts If data scientists do struggle to implement samples' pipelines manually, usually due to lack of sufficient coding abilities or insufficiently trained team members, chances are high that an off-the shelf framework exists nowadays to provide prewritten code. Here is a non-exhaustive list of open source frameworks available today: Try executing each section of the previous lists' items mentioned above. Feel free to contact us to report any success tips or if anything doesn't seem clear. Generally speaking, having written tons of boring manual scripts, you'll end up invoking the same algorithm hundreds of times and spending lots of time reworking tiny details constantly. Using powerful modern tools, including those listed earlier, saves much effort but still allows you to perform tasks quickly and efficiently. And since this process is totally automated through script creation, one day you might decide to add new features or refactor existing ones entirely and then everything should be done automatically. Let's dive right into building automations. Automation - the magic word Automated systems are great things indeed. Not only because they save tons of human resources, improve efficiency and reduce operational costs, but also because they help raise the quality level. Since debugging automation problems is generally simpler than dealing with hard-to-find issues associated with manually implemented processes, teams who tackle software development via scripting rely heavily on test coverage and automated regression testing. Therefore it shouldn't really surprise you that cybersecurity and information security professionals have been promoting better deployment of cyber defense measures like intrusion detection and prevention system sensors for years. On top of that, several studies show that contrary to popular belief, humans aren't actually very effective at detecting sophisticated malware attacks with probabilities ranging between 50 and 90. Lastly, although cloud computing has become almost ubiquitous among companies worldwide, nearly half of staff admit that they would rather stay longer in their current jobs than switch to remote collaboration setups. Thus we strongly advise you to automate mundane repetitive steps first, follow by implementing larger task flows later. In 2017 Deepmind Technologies released its Alpha Go program designed to compete against professional players at the board game of Go. While initially struggling against the best player in history, eventually it managed to beat Lee Sedol, regarded as arguably the world number one ranked Go player. As impressive as AlphaGo was, the fact remained that it had been built from scratch without relying on any prebuilt AI functionality that existed prior to the release.

"It is easy to burn out employees as you learn how to manage groups of people. This article contains advice for managers of small teams and startups on how to balance personal work with company objectives, while also working well within the group. When I started my career in management consulting, there was already a lot written about leadership (e.g., books by Jeff Immelt). But most of what I read focused only on corporate-level CEOs or senior executives. As an employee relations professional at Accenture during those early years, I wanted more guidance from someone who had worked directly with midcareer professionals so that I could be better prepared for managing others once I got into the field myself. The main takeaway message for me was simply this: It's important to set up your own expectations around the relationship between yourself and your team before they are regularly put under pressure. The key success factor here is clear communication regarding both their strengths and limitations - and being able to hold them accountable for meeting these expectations. With good preparation, you can avoid burning out because you have provided a structure designed to help each other succeed. Read More "" My weekend reading included articles such as ""How do we inspire?"" and ""What happens when leaders stop creating innovative cultures and start copying competitors instead?"" Interesting stuff. And yet it didn't really answer the question of why companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple continue to grow fast and innovate despite having lots of talented engineers, talent pipelines broken open longer than ever before, and huge piles of cash sitting on nearly every shelf. What gives? Read More "" I recently returned home after spending 10 weeks traveling through South America by bus. Even though I'm used to long trips, sometimes 24 hours away from family and friends seems interminable. In Peru, food shortages became acute, banking services were nonexistent; the whole country seemed stuck somewhere back in time. Other countries might not seem gracious hosts, but in Lima, Peru's capital city, everyone would come together to support one another. When faced with dire circumstances, even strangers came together to provide some much needed assistance. People looked out for each other. They did things without expecting anything in return. That kind of generosity is rare today, especially among millennials like me. We expect everything all on our terms. For us, friendship has become transactional. Personal connections no longer mean something deeper than a common goal or shared passion. I found it interesting that just two weeks earlier I traveled across Asia and Africa, where relationships mattered far less than money matters. Yet economic factors still play a role in determining social interactions. Poverty breeds competition rather than cooperation. If you don't pay attention to inequality over time, you'll end up emulating the worst aspects of capitalism. Living below subsistence level requires a massive effort to survive. After decades, many societies struggle to recover from centuries of deprivation. Far too often governments fail to make sure basic needs keep pace with rising standards of living - which means citizens feel like they're perpetually behind on life's basics. A lack of consistent breadwinner income leads families to break down quickly. Without security, children lose confidence, adults lose motivation, and society loses its collective will to improve itself. Most importantly, if a majority of humanity continues to live on substandard incomes, peace becomes impossible to achieve as concepts such as trust fall apart along political fault lines. While poverty doesn't always lead to conflict, it does create conditions ripe for war. War kills millions. Peace makes business possible. We see even greater disparity in wealth these days. On average, the top 1 account for 30 of total U.S. household income. The poor get poorer, the rich get richer. While technology and globalization may have contributed greatly to increased prosperity overall, the continued growth of China alone - along with rapidly expanding economies in India and elsewhere - almost guarantees widespread poverty for billions of new consumers. Some economists calculate that the global middle class isn't expected to expand beyond 2 billion until 2046. According to Oxfam International, the wealthiest 80 individuals now own half of the world's private wealth. Notwithstanding regular calls for equality of opportunity based on meritocracy, the reality is increasingly unequal situations throughout globe. I've been thinking a great deal lately about the thriving communities of innovation seen throughout Latin America, which surprised me at first. All three major Brazilian states produce phenomenal amounts of high quality software developers, besting the United States for sheer numbers alone.

"Apple is facing an antitrust investigation after Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission for Apple's anti-competitive business strategies. Spotify is frustrated with Apple's 30 percent take of subscription revenue, as well as ""the lack of viable alternatives."" Spotify has officially filed its formal antitrust complaints against Apple in both Europe and North America over how it handles subscriptions to songs from streaming services. The company alleges that because iTunes will only allow users to pay for music through one payment method - iTunes cards - neither streaming service can offer flexible pricing options nor compete on price or features compared to other platforms like Google Play Music All Access and Amazon Prime Music Unlimited. As part of this scheme, according to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek: A]uthorizing all [apps sold by Apple],"" including ""music apps,"" cannot be deleted without preventing customers from purchasing any content at all; therefore, Spotify believes Apple created exclusive deals with record labels which benefit them instead of consumers. It also claims there are not enough legal competitors for iOS devices such as Android phones so Apple could exercise power. In addition, Spotify is upset about Apple locking out independent developers who create third party applications, allowing more lock-in than necessary, especially when combined with iCloud Music Library. Finally, Spotify accuses Apple of classifying their App Store and iBooks stores under similar categories of software (rather than hardware) which means they don't receive the same scrutiny or oversight as other consumer electronics products. According to a report in TechCrunch, Apple told Spotify during negotiations that it was already complying with EU law but had no intention of changing anything due to existing licenses signed between itself and companies like EMI, Sony BMG, Universal Music Group, Warner Bros., and many others. A spokesperson then told MacRumors that Apple had ""never received"" a request from anyone regarding our policies, and we maintain these polices have been clear since day 1.""In short, while we know the rules apply equally across every digital ecosystem and provider where people choose to buy things online, Apple continues to adopt practices some find unfair and unreasonable."" This isn't even the first time Spotify has gone up against Apple here in the US; back in 2014, Spotify accused Apple of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act after Apple refused to make certain tracks available outside of iTunes. Today's lawsuit is different though and seems much broader in scope.At least five major record labels - Universal, Warners, Sony, Mercury Nashville and Merlin Media -have now announced they'll join Spotify in filing the suit today. You might remember seeing something along those lines last year when four major record label groups sued Apple over ""iCloud locks,"" alleging the platform was restricting competitive options by making everything offered via iCloud Music libraries accessible in iTunes only. That resulted in iTunes getting shut off completely from most new iPhones until late 2017, and Sony began offering cheaper cloud locker plans soon thereafter. But if you haven't noticed yet, all three paid tiers of Apple's iPhone lineup cost 10 per month each. And unless Apple makes changes before December 15th, 2018, the paid versions won't work unless they're connected to iTunesiOS. With the latest lawsuits, Spotify wants to force change earlier so subscribers do not feel locked into using just Apple's solutions for paying for music whether they use their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple Watch, or another brand of Android smartphone, tablet or laptop computer running Microsoft Windows 10 operating system.Ek said in his statement that he hopes Apple complies with Spotify's requests rather than fight them in court: ""We look forward to working together to address customer concerns directly and ensure access to innovative offerings, fair competition, greater choice and continued investment in high quality audio experiences.""If Apple does fight challenges like this legally, what would happen? Well, some sense of clarity may come down the road, at least according to the folks at Beyond Digitial Markets. While the exact nature of Apple's contracts with record labels are unclear (or at least unreported), past terms suggest an agreement wherein Apple receives nothing less than a 50 cut of subscription payments made through iTunes for the life span of each licensing deal. So far, several streaming providers are currently negotiating new agreements with Big Four labels following expiration of initial contracts. If either side is willing to lower the percentage taken, both sides get the benefits of increased monthly usage numbers to bolster marketing efforts, while the labels still see healthy royalty checks.But perhaps the real problem lies elsewhere? There aren't really any good substitutes for Apple's services right now. We've seen Medialets and Samsung try their hand at competing, but both streaming services seem too immature at present to pose a serious threat to Apple's dominance. Plus there's always potential threats coming from other types of media players when considering portable gadgets such as Roku and Chromecast dongles, BluRay discs used by Xbox One owners, game consoles like PlayStation 4 Pro and Nintendo Switch, and various models of smart TV. Of course, none of these alternatives offers multiroom listening playback capability, whereas Apple owns HomeKit and AirPlay 2 support across multiple speakers.It sounds great now, so strong properties are mass produced substitute purposes appear to wilderoshand having it.

"React Hook Form makes it super easy to integrate and create forms that are fast performing and compact. A live demo is available. There is also a form builder to help you build your own unique forms or edit the existing ones from our library. How React Hook Forms Works? Similar to other hooks like useState, react-hooks has been designed to keep track of its internal state in order for us as developers to render different components based on an input (e.g., password). Moreover, we can use this hook whenever needed without worrying about how they will be rendered and if there have already changes made by another component. This way of thinking allows us to reuse these same hooks in multiple places since others won't know what data was previously inserted into them and so, no extra work would need to be done. That said, let's dig deeper! A quick note: The code snippets used here are just for demonstration purposes only; therefore, feel free to copypaste and change around as much as you want until you get comfortable with each one. Also, all methods mentioned below should be self-explanatory in terms of usage even though some concepts might not be entirely clear at first glance. We encourage you either watch their videos or read through their docs before proceeding further. Good luck!! The setup process consists of two parts. First, we set up functionalities using the 'useForm ' function which returns a memoized value that later becomes accessible via the 'formMemoValue' variable inside the 'App' class inside App.js file. Second, we tell the application to load when the document loads using the 'loadHookScripts' method. Then, we pass down the 'formMemoValue' to any nested child upon loading. Lastly, we update the values of both variables - formMemoValied and rpcCallerResultData every time user clicks on Update button and passes the updated information back to parent. So basically, once those settings have loaded successfully, any subsequent calls to submitForm , saveUserInfo , sendMessage (userId), ...will trigger an RPC call and then update accordingly. In short, it works beautifully! But wait... I haven't actually explained anything yet! So, let me elaborate . Setting Up New Routes Components You may wonder why do we want to make more than 1 route within the app given that the whole point is to enhance performance and avoid duplicating code across many files. Well, besides looking awesome, routes helps decompose large applications while keeping things clean and organized. Also, they allow us to structure smaller chunks better rather than having everything under one big file right away. Now, to deal with the problem presented above and add new child components views to our current root layout, we simply combine 2 elements together with Route : import { Route } from'react-router'; import HomePageLayout from '.HomePageLayout'; const CustomRoute divHello Worlddiv; export default [Location pathCustomRoute}SubscriptionListing] We also wrap the navigation bar within Header tag because the header acts as the main container for most pages. From now, any page we navigate to will look similar to this: Besides adding Header anywhere you see fit, creating separate pages is pretty straightforward too! Simply go ahead and follow the basic steps shown above including naming conventions etc.. Once done, reboot your browser tab and refresh. It'll automatically redirect you to where ever you wanted to visit! And don't worry if nothing happens immediately after rebooting, give it sometime i guess... For extra credit, try switching web browsers to check whether your internet connection could possibly influence JS execution speed. Usually, it shouldn't take longer than 5 seconds unless something went wrong during installation process. Hope this tutorial helped you learn more about React Hook Form. Have fun exploring more API details! Happy coding",0,82
"A cache of chat logs from the Conti ransomware group was leaked online by an insider. Conti recently stated their support for the Russian invasion and vowed to retaliate against any country that did not comply with Russia's demands in exchange for a ransom payment, after which they sent out waves of email-based attacks across Europe - including the UK. The message below is part of the conversation between two hackers who were communicating about how much money to ask for in the ransome they plan on demanding before carrying out future attacks: [redacted] [redacted]: How many emails do you send? We want them all. [contriliT] [contriliT]: I start at 2k today and increase each day. By tomorrow i will have 12k and we decide what happens next. [redacted] [redacted]: That sounds good. Are you sure it doesn't get too dangerous if your server gets hit by these guys... [contriliT] [contrilliT]: Yes but we are ready to take action so no worries. Of course every attacker has his weakness (that's why we don't use our own servers). But this time it won't be easy for us as we also try to attack all EU countries. They even advertise their plans on dark web forums like AlphaBay where they offer helpfully to other cyber criminals wanting to join forces or keep track of the status of their campaign: ""We can provide automatic scanning bots and C2 hosts... You pay us when the scan finishes!"" They even list the prices and offers being made available through their botnet under the banner of security firm Kaspersky Labs. The price range goes up to 3,000 per month from their listing on AlphaBay when the job is completed: - Scanning 1 million contacts one by one over 30 days 3500month - Scaning 500 000 contacts within 10 minutes 5350hour - Completely cleaning user database 100 emptying mailbox 7200month In addition, attackers are able to run a number of scans simultaneously using resources gathered from infected networked computers and other services made available via cloud computing platforms. This makes the operation far more powerful than previous versions of malicious software such as Conficker and WannaCry. Contingent upon demand for stolen information, the attackers may simply ignore requests to delete data and continue dropping new files until the desired amount of money is paid. In some cases, however, payment may not guarantee removal of files because file names could appear randomised in order to confuse law enforcement agencies looking into potential crime links. UK Cyber Security Team Is Notified About Threat From Ransomware Group; Police Later Arrest One Suspect After Investigation Grows More Complicated Than Initially Thought - CCN (CCNMarkets) October 23, 2017 The first wave of exploitation targeting the UK occurred last week with victims receiving messages warning them their medical records had been encrypted. Since then another batch of threats has targeted businesses across the board, ranging from local councils to companies holding sensitive personal info pertaining to financial institutions, high profile entertainment sites, retail outlets, defense contractors and government departments. Due to the nature of email attacks, the full extent of damage remains unknown although initial reports suggest hundreds of thousands of non-profit organisations in Britain alone incurred heavy costs owing to failed IT systems. According to researcher Dr Stefan Tanase, whose team discovered the malware spawning the latest round of infections, almost 90 percent of affected IP addresses belong to European internet service providers (ISPs), which suggests a vast majority of machines attempting to connect to those networks are located outside the European Union. It should be noted that total infection rates remain unclear since many nations are yet to issue official warnings to its citizens prompting further research into the matter. Contra Costa County, California, reported fallouts from hacking activities later identified as belonging to the same threat actor behind recent British incidents. On Wednesday night the county accidentally released the IP address of 40,000 residents along with details about a denial-of-service attack aimed squarely at their council websites. Although attempts to acquire login credentials proved unsuccessful, investigators managed to recover access keys allowing them to look inside users' accounts without having to request permission from individuals concerned. Investigators found roughly 200 related documents containing a mixture of highly confidential information, such as employees' private bank account numbers and social security cards. Reports stressed that the incident appeared to stem from a single source, suggesting only a handful of people knew about it beforehand. A subsequent investigation revealed the same group again launched similar DDoS attacks against commercial firms whose customers had logged onto hacked servers during the aforementioned breach. Despite little concrete evidence connecting the two operations currently underway, police sources said the main suspect currently operating both campaigns belongs to the notorious gang responsible for ransomware known as the Shadow Crew, better known for selling-initiation and open-what caused mischief-ca ability With- With-and FormeaSo.

Personally speaking, I am just amazed at how much Artificial Intelligence is impacting people's lives nowadays - even doing stuff they used to consider impossible only limited number of years ago. Until recently, people got pretty surprised when talking about computers being capable of thinking. But hey, don't get fooled by reality yet because you still need to read the following list which highlights some recent news covered under the category ""Artificial Intelligence."" So without further ado, here goes: Top 5 Moments of Artificial Intelligence History 1) IBM Watson wins Jeopardy game against Ken Jennings 2) Self-Driving Car Hits Pedestrian 3) Facebook launches Messenger Bot 4) Apple announces Siri Shortcuts API 5) Microsoft introduces Cortana skills platform How about 2019? Unless something gets better or worse, I guess things won't change drastically next year either. However, one thing we know already if marketing strategies according to consumers' preferences. Marketing strategy needs to evolve towards real-time interaction considering future possibilities. As customers gain data insights over time, brands would have to follow suit in order not to lose relevance in customer journey. Furthermore, internal processes and business models tend to transform significant amount of times - especially thanks to digital transformation. Therefore, having a scalable approach integrating humans and technology becomes necessary. It doesn't mean replacing human labor anymore although hiring machines might save money eventually. Rather having intelligent interactions both inside corporations and online commerce platforms will benefit from using machine learning technologies. Even though Voice Assistants will keep playing a major role in terms of providing convenience, organizations will surely leverage other aspects to streamline operations and increase efficiencies. For example, retailers could conduct face recognition analysis within point-of-sale systems to manage inventory accurately; automated ecommerce websites could optimize shipping rates based on demand forecasting at the same level of accuracy; large scale manufacturing companies could anticipate product shortages prior to delivery dates. With Alexa moving ahead, we can assume that AI applications can easily meet enterprise demands even bigger than current version. And of course, we can expect even more exciting announcements very shortly. At least for now, there's plenty of material to dig deeper on the subject matter.

As always all data collected by Autopilot during a drive will be shared publicly through Model 3 Owners Club following completion of each trip. - Elon Musk (elonmusk) May 11, 2018 The next update should solve such problems as roads without lane markings, missed right turn lanes, pedestrians crossing between parked cars and other confounding situations where current autopilot technology struggles to accurately handle what humans would consider routine driving patterns. However, if your car never gets stuck in stopgo traffic and you often get lost while navigating unfamiliar areas, then maybe something else needs fixing first. What could possibly cause those kinds of failures? Here are two theories from Twitter... Tesla confirmed that Full Self-Driving does not yet allow its driver assistance system to keep going once it encounters an unexpected situation like road construction which requires a human operator. In the case of the tweet below, Tesla said one such scenario was ""a road closure or accident caused by another vehicle changing into or out of fast moving left hand turn lane where he had been previously traveling."" From the screenshot, it appears that his own account was deleted after he noted that the car failed to take him home despite being able to complete many trips successfully earlier in the day. Back episode 2: I'm stranded in Aurora near 91st Yampa Trail near 17th Ave. No idea who's responsible for cutting off my exit point tonight pic.twitter.comoCcKjGC9tB - TrumdellPiz (OmToiWunderland) April 23, 2017 According to another user whose self-driving test ended up killing them, their Tesla died three times within a seven hour period due to confusing street signs, inconsistent automatic braking rules, and mystery objects blocking their path. One of these incidents resulted in a collision, though it seems unlikely that none of the previous accidents were deadly. This theory also suggests that Tesla might need to offer special instructions about what drivers must do in order to override the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) just in those rare cases where they feel it may be necessary. A third theory assumes that collisions with pedestrians aren't accounted for in computer models used to calculate optimal routes. While their behavior isn't modeled explicitly, pedestrian presence is nonetheless represented using statistical probability distributions applied across millions of miles driven. If actual crosswalk information wasn't consistent enough to prevent crashes, perhaps the number of expected deaths per year in San Francisco alone could quickly become significant enough to warrant inclusion in future iterations of the model. In January 2016, SFPD reported 6 fatalities due to autoped crossings in 1 yr-but that doesn't include folks ""who got hit"" walking against traffic btw pic.twitter.comwX6EUBuQ9p - ChaiScole Canes (kaiserlye) June 15, 2017 A 2014 study found that 95 of pedestrian injuries involved some sort of distraction or obstacle encountered on sidewalks or bike paths. If detecting things like people standing in the middle of crosswalks and blinking signals fail to dissuade motorists from running reds, maybe a countermeasure requiring pedestrians to step completely off onto a side walk instead of inside an intersection won't hurt either.",0,86

"Facial Recognition technology has developed quickly but the law has not yet caught up with it. Using public camera footage and images of people obtained through their employer's websites combined , police can use facial recognition software to match a person's photo against databases containing mug shots or booking photos that were taken at an earlier point in time when they had been arrested for something else. In recent years there have been several high profile cases where this automated method was used without any suspicion being raised by anyone within the judicial system; using access granted from a private company such as Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft etc. who employ image capturers on-site [1].. We already know how easy it is to misidentify individuals based on these images and database searches due to previous incidents; images are notoriously unreliable most often resulting in false positives but also leading to serious mistaken identity errors. The fact that this equipment exists means we don't need to rely on memory and witness testimony alone to prove someone guilty, thus negating our common sense legal safeguards like cross examination which relies heavily upon belief to be able judge truthfulness worthy of consideration. There needs to be a clear legislative framework established that balances privacy with security levels - giving more power to citizens and less to companies so that they cannot abuse what they legally own. This will allow us to understand just exactly how far governments intend to go into collecting information about everyone over whom they gain authority as well as knowing where the limits lie. Many countries around the world (13) have laws governing the use of biometric data and while some people may think that Canada doesn't need one, I would argue otherwise especially if you live in Alberta. Although only 3 of Canadians have had their fingerprints recorded here, many Canadians travel internationally each year. If tracking your movements across borders becomes national policy, then why shouldn't collection, storage and analysis become provincial? Also note: Our current government has a mandate to collect metadata, including phone records. Yet no mention appears on either side of Parliament during Question Period regarding the failure to protect Canadians' personal information passed along from a federal agency to another. As it stands, ""metadata"" - information provided merely to show origin, date, time and destination - may include telephone numbers dialed or received, emails sent or received, web sites visited and search terms entered online. It contains no content other than those facts, allowing corporations including Bell and Telus to sell anonymized subscriber profiles to marketing firms for targeting ads. Once collected it must remain government property unless it is linked to criminal activity. Shouldn't Canadian agencies be required to respect and uphold the rights set out in Bill C-51? Why should we trust them with our lives as much as we do? United States Office of Management Budget Report On Biometrics Standards And Regulations 201516 Table 1 presents the various standards available and provides examples of both U.S. and international best practices. Here is how the report summarizes these guidelines... US Guidelines Worldwide Compliance Examples In 2012, the FCC issued its first net neutrality rules, requiring internet service providers (ISPs), under certain circumstances, to disclose the identities of their customers and provide billing information to account holders. ISPs comply through regular disclosures to customers and freedom of speech organizations claim that disclosure creates a chilling effect on free expression. However, critics believe it violates customer confidentiality, undercuts consumer choice and increases costs for consumers. Advocates say identifying customers allows authorities to trace illegal activities back to their owners, allowing them to take action before further damage occurs. Data retention requirements apply to all telecommunications carriers. Providers retain customer call detail recordings [CDRs], for 15 days, followed by periodic updates for 90 days after the end of active calls, for the purpose of detecting fraudulent activity. Call detail records contain details pertaining to the incoming and outgoing telephone number, duration of call, location codes associated with the originating and terminating points of a transaction, whether the parties spoke simultaneously or consecutively, type of calling card used and the source of payment.

"A developer has created a way to scale macOS using docker. Each instance is able to access services like iMessage as Docker-OSX generates unique codes for its macOS hardware. The team says that it's scalable, can run on existing Macs and costs 19 per month. Docker OS X was developed by v1c (VonC) in late 2017. It allows you to create instances of your desktop operating system within containers - similar to how the Linux Virtual Machine or Windows Server administrators have been doing this for years. However, unlike those systems where you need physical equipment dedicated just for running virtual machines, with Docker OS X users are able to use their current Mac as a host machine and share resources between them. This means there aren't any additional servers needed; all processing needs are shared among multiple VMs. In fact, because each one runs inside a container, they're not actually sharing resources at all. Instead, everything happens inside your main computer acting as if it were another server. With some tweaks, you could even take advantage of an entire fleet of computers for robust performance. It's also possible to set up specialized environments such as development, testing, QA, etc., then snap that environment into production when ready via ""snapshots"" so no downtime is required. Plus there is version control to ensure that software gets updated properly without having to upload binaries again. This works across platforms including iOSmacOS, Android, web apps, Unix-based servers and more. The project started off as VonC's attempt to build out his own custom MacBook Pro but eventually grew beyond that. He ran into issues while trying to make configuration management work due to Apple's T2 security model. So he decided to ditch the MBP entirely. Then things got complicated. ""I had tried making native bootable USB sticks from my macbook, however I couldn't get UEFI drivers working enough to install my kernel,"" said von Cernowitz. ""So I ended up turning to building kernels directly from source, which seems stupid now."" He made progress until he hit what seemed to be a dead end: There are many reasons why we might want to do this. One obvious example would be minting new copies of our base image whenever git commits change something important... Another reason would be pulling down updates in isolation rather than restoring every file from scratch... And finally, we may simply wish to dump our filesystem unencrypted onto devzero. Dumping files over SSH remains quite slow, especially after the first few tens of gigs, although modern disk interfaces will likely improve these times significantly in the future. We'll look at TOR and other methods soon. While he thought about his options, someone else came forward who wanted to experiment with the same idea. Eventually, both parties joined forces under the name 'dockerosx'. They did experiments with different approaches, ranging from an old school method involving dd to newer ideas such as Tor hidden services to get around the firewall issue. Eventually though, the two developers realized that a true solution lay in utilizing the power of automation. An automated approach worked well for creating images and deploying applications rather than manually unpacking tarballs and configuring port mappings through ssh tunnels. By combining this toolset with automatic builds and deployment, two individuals could manage hundreds of projects simultaneously. In order to pull off this feat, they wrote scripts for various tasks, providing the ability to quickly spin up full blown desktops just by typing commands into a terminal window. To avoid worrying about size limitations with binary downloads, they used prebuilt packages instead of compiling from source. This meant that the entire process could occur within a single folder tree similar to a supervisord script. All major components of an operating system could easily installed from optional sources whenever desired. With this workflow they were able to slowly and steadily push towards convergence of code bases, resulting in a unified package manager called ""mercurial."" That led to improvements in package maintainers' processes and increased quality of life for everyone involved thanks to consistent releases and frequent upgrades. Software authors began adopting mercurial for packaging purposes instead of Source Code Management tools. The very foundation of open source was being turned upside-down. Developers received freedom, flexibility and responsibility along with rewards based upon contributions and consistency. Community involvement soared. Then someone suggested that they should turn these concepts into a business venture. After that project fell apart, they focused on developing the core technology behind Docker OS X and putting together a viable plan for monetization. Without disclosing too much detail they went ahead anyway with a couple of failed attempts before finding real success. The company has raised capital and hired some high profile people including ex-Google engineer David McCanney to help bring the vision to fruition. Their goal was clear: provide businesses with an infrastructure layer for managing desktop deployments on OS X in a secure manner.

"Humans can learn echolocation to navigate mazes and identify the size and orientation of objects in just 10 weeks. This is a much faster learning time than previous studies have shown (1). The speed with which we learned, however, may be due not only to our ability but also simply because it's hard for people to master this skill unless they are given exposure over many hours or days to let them become familiar with their environment by trial-and error feedback. We wanted to know if training in an unfamiliar context, where there was no opportunity to make mistakes, could help us develop more rapidly as well. To address this question, we gave subjects practice at detecting hidden food pellets using ultrasound beams while navigating through a virtual maze that incorporated obstacles such as walls - a task closely resembling real-life situations. In addition, we estimated how long it would take someone without experience to accomplish this goal. The results clearly show that providing repeated training sessions helped these inexperienced subjects quickly detect the target food pellets and subsequently navigate successfully through virtual environments featuring various kinds of barriers. However, when we compared performance data between experienced users and novices, we found significant differences between groups; someone who had practiced previously showed better skills both in terms of absolute accuracy and faster response times than those who were new learners. These findings suggest that motivation plays some role in successful navigation: When faced with one unknown obstacle after another, even when provided with support from an instructorteacher, individuals with recent relevant experience will need to spend significantly longer looking for targets before deciding on courses of action. Our participants did achieve satisfactory levels of competence within about 16 trials, indicating that once trained they retained relatively good spatial knowledge. Besides helping you get familiarized with your surroundings, ultrasound echoes give insights into what's going on around your body too. It's like having a ""super hearing"" for yourself! There are two main types of echo patterns: Transmitters bounce off surfaces and reflect from internal organs back to receivers. Though most people perceive sound as being transmitted through air, it actually travels through tissue. Ultrasound waves travel through liquids or solids - such as bones and flesh - so they cannot penetrate deep structures. They do, however, enable sonographers to see details inside the human body, including blood vessels. They can visualize arteries or veins pumping away nutrients, masses of cells moving along blood streams or nerves carrying signals throughout the body. What's great besides its noninvasive nature is that it provides information about anatomy, physiology and pathology that might otherwise require a full workup using other methods. If you haven't tried it yet, check out the article below for an introduction to transabdominal scanning from a health care professional. A tool used to monitor fetal growth, ultrasounds create images by transmitting short bursts of high frequency sounds into the abdomen via a probe connected to a computer. As the reflected wave passes back toward the receiver, information on the structure and composition of tissues is recorded or displayed as a series of colored lines on the screen called B-mode which resembles musical scores. Another type of scan known as Doppler enables doctors to measure blood flow velocity. This particular technique shows how fast blood flows through different parts of the heart muscle. Blood flowing slowly indicates poor circulation. More rapid movement suggests damage caused by a blockage in major arteries. Such abnormalities can cause stroke or cardiac arrest. During pregnancy an ultrasound exam must pass a number of hurdles. One includes whether women with risk factors such as obesity or diabetes qualify for testing based upon guidelines established by ACOG, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. On the positive side though, you don't really feel anything during an examination. But remember, you should inform any doctor performing examinations of all medications you are taking, especially those containing Xylocaine gel or Botox injections. It's important to keep track of all prescribed medicines during early pregnancy since they are sometimes linked to birth defects such as spina bifida. How to spot a newborn baby? What does alcohol smell like? You'll notice right away that male babies tend to have higher pitched cries than females. Also notice the difference in tone - the male voice usually has slightly lower pitch. But not always. Sometimes the opposite happens and females with low pitches emit excited calls to attract males. Other physical characteristics include marked reddish skin coloration, big ears that stick up almost perpendicular to head, protruding mouth corners, large nose openings and narrow nostrils. Finally, watch for small fists tucked under chin as newborns attempt to hold themselves upright. Note: Human fetuses weigh anywhere from 6 ounces to 14 pounds at delivery.

Those who broke through police lines made their way to President's House where thousands were packed into an open square calling for a regime change. Vyacheslav Likhachev, head of the Human Rights Council said: ""We are confronting tanks, we have witnessed repression by authorities even before the poll was held...

"The Comma Two is a device that can add assisted driving features to cars. It operates at level two autonomy. The device requires drivers to pay attention to the road and take back control when necessary, rather than just passively having their vehicle steered in certain directions or slowed down when needed.

Under this system - developed by Microsoft and Sensible Systems (formerly known as Mobileye) - an app would allow people with real time feedback from a human driver to steer or brake their own automobile if need be, should something unforeseen happen during Level 2 operation.

Waymo, Google's parent company, launched its own version called ""Waypoint"" last summer after years developing such tech internally. And Ford Motor Company unveiled its semi-autonomous Fusion Hybrid earlier this month equipped with the same steering aid powered by Nvidia AI software, though without direct oversight from a passenger. Other automakers have also joined in; Mercedes Benz offered similar functions in 2016, and Volvo plans to release one this year. This week BMW says it'll start shipping those new cars next year. But aside from piloting their own cars, we're still waiting for a true driverless future. Though some form of automated systems may appear soon enough, right now there aren't many commercially viable options. In other words, don't expect to see fully functional robot chauffeurs anytime soon.

They wore special glasses with embedded light emitting diodes (LEDs), allowing researchers to monitor how much visual information participants were receiving at different times throughout the day. A few weeks later, they checked themselves again.

A Brief History of Solidity Ethereum In this section we will discuss briefly about smart contracts and then jump right into building one for ourselves! Smart Contracts - A Short Definition: An agreement of sorts between two or more parties where transactions can be automated via code such that no human intervention is required, afterwords states andor conditions become immutable unless explicitly changed (e.g., hashing). Unlike traditional financial instruments which involve other players and multiple exchanges, once agreed upon by all parties in a given contract, disputes cannot arise because each party owns their private key (s) and possesses control over a certain amount of digital assets within that particular chain. Smart contracts provide decentralized solutions to many real world problems including identity verification, reputation systems, supply chain management and decentralized finance, among others. To learn more please take a look at our previous articles here and here. Ethereum - An Optimistic Platform For Decentralized Applications? Now let's get down to business. We want to create a DApp (Decentralized Application), but first we need to understand ""what exactly is a dApp"" and why does its existence even matter? So far as we know, everything we have done so far has been performed by simply creating accounts on the web browser and executing some Javascript functions. Let me draw your attention towards how most people operate today; they download applications like Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc. from different websites and install them onto their computer. The apps come bundled with various programs like Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Dropbox, Netflix etc. If someone else wants to use these services on my Macbook Pro I would just run those same applications again and hopefully everything works fine. However lets say there was another way of installing these programs without downloading and running anything, instead for example, i would go ahead and write out instructions specific to my operating system and hardware. Each instruction tells the program on how to work properly and interact with the environment around us; macOS Sierra, Windows 10, Linux Mint, Android devices etc. If the user follows carefully enough, he should end up having the desired app installed on his device seamlessly. In essence, applications no longer exist inside a GUI through windows or tabs, rather these things have now taken place internally thus eliminating the need for users to rerun (reinstall) applications every time something changes. We call these processes containerization and virtualization respectively and both of these concepts play a big role in the modern software development industry - think containers and docker images vs process isolation alone. With new emerging technologies popping up everyday, not only individual developers but also large companies are taking advantage of this technology to streamline operations while cutting costs dramatically. If we put all these thoughts together, we arrive to the conclusion that everyone should own their very own piece of infrastructure which includes Operating Systems, Web Browsers, Programming Languages, Libraries, Software Development Kits, Databases etc... Basically any tool needed to interact with the Internet, however unlike regular computers which require expensive maintenance fees which continually increases in cost due to upgrades, there exists several inexpensive options available nowadays that allow individuals to essentially rent access to computing power much similar to how electricity consumption rates vary based on usage patterns. Nowadays everybody can afford a laptop and a smartphone, hence why the old adage goes, ""if you don't pay for bandwidth you're paying too soon."" What does this mean, ultimately speaking? Well technically nothing really, since anyone who purchased bandwidth earlier did indeed acquire ownership of said resources until they decided to deactivate their account and change providers. That being said though, it actually means that from day one when you owned a PC, it didn't automatically belong exclusively to yourself. Instead you shared said resource with thousands if not millions of other home owners around the globe. Because of interference caused by faulty routers, massive traffic issues, internet piracy and other malicious practices, data packets had to travel farther than initially intended. Of course nobody likes waiting for pages to load and often times entire sites stop loading either temporarily or permanently for whatever reasons. As a result countless hours of downtime occur every year costing billions of dollars in lost revenue, causing customers to leave unhappy and dissatisfied which leads to lower customer satisfaction ratings overall and finally eventually results in losing money thanks to brand damage. Thus when you purchase a product online, avoid shopping whenever possible.

"Shijian-21, or SJ-21, is a Chinese satellite designed to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies. It was recently observed pulling a dead satellite out of its normal orbit and into an uncontrolled lunar transfer trajectory. The following report on the event combines data from various sources including official statements, news reports of Weibo users, social network posts and amateur observations collected by members of Space Observation Rumours (SORUS). On October 30th 2018 at 13:29 UTC, China's remote sensing spacecraft SJ-16 lifted off atop a Long March 2D rocket booster while still attached to its launch pad in Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Around one hour later at 14:35 UTC, an anomaly occurred during ascent when the vehicle failed to separate completely from the rocket booster as planned and instead detached in two sections; this then allowed it to fall back down towards earth for around 10 minutes before entering low Earth orbit with lower than expected velocity. Later that same day at 11:39 UTC, Chinese state media confirmed that the vehicle had been successfully recovered after being found through ""received signals"" at 16:28 UTC on 31st October 18. Initial estimates put the reentry time anywhere between 24 hours and three days since liftoff. This observation window would allow it to have landed within range of the South Atlantic Anomaly region where Earth's magnetic field becomes distorted due to solar radiation causing damage to electronic systems. However, subsequent ground based searches failed to find any signs of the spacecraft until early November 7th - almost two weeks later, which raised doubts over whether Beijing could actually recover the craft alive. At the same time, Chinese officials revealed more details about the mission design and payload contents, and began releasing images obtained both pre-launch and post-recovery showing only minor anomalies experienced by their orbital platform. The fact that the lander separated prematurely can be explained by the proximity to the ocean surface, bringing it closer to the maximum possible distance the satellite is capable of travelling without falling back onto the planet below. Another possibility is that the satellite malfunctioned during launch and lost control of itself. Whatever caused it happened too fast for even video footage taken before landing to capture anything useful. Despite all attempts to retrieve it, the vehicle has not yet been found despite extended periods of visibility time windows along with multiple search efforts throughout December 5th. On January 22nd 2019, it was announced that the Shenzhou 9 manned ship will attempt to salvage the satellite if it fails to return home safely first. If successful, they will also carry out experiments on retrieving satellites in similar orbits and conditions and place them in other orbits. Mission Design Jiangwen 1 (CZ) is a 3,700 kg microgravity research satellite developed by the Institute Of Mechanics And Control Engineering of, part of the Academy and Graduate School of Aerospace Science Technology . With a length of 4 m and width of 0.8m, the satellite measures approximately 12m x 20m. According to some reports, it carries dual optical cameras, one of which can take up-looking pictures to monitor interplanetary spaceships passing near earth while another records star fields and cosmic phenomena such as comets, meteoroids etc. Its primary purpose is said to be to shed light on the natural evolution, distribution pattern and life cycle of space dust, which however remains unconfirmed. While much of what we know today comes directly from images captured via parabolic dishes or telescopes mounted on large scientific stations like Jiaotong University's Dark Sky Station and the Mauna Kea Observatory's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Jiangwen 1 may provide new resources for scientists studying these topics. In terms of orbital mechanics, CZ is unique among medium size nano satellites. Unlike most others which use flybys of planets or moons to alter their course and remain stable for longer durations, CZ uses gravity assists from GEO and L1L2 Lagrange points to achieve controlled transfers away from earth while reaching altitudes exceeding 4000km above sea level, making it highly unstable and vulnerable. As long as there are no nearby celestial bodies occupying those specific locations in space, objects launched towards GEO must eventually reach it unless they initiate maneuvers to avoid interception, but once an object gets close enough to pass through the gravitational pull exerted by geostationary satellites, it enters into orbit at L1 L2. These are low energy configurations meaning that each satellite moves very slowly compared to regular ones stationed further away, meaning that CZ cannot escape using either mechanism. That means that it cannot get rid of unwanted perigee and apogee positions relative to earth, unlike smaller nano satellites whose orbits are significantly affected by tidal forces and atmospheric drag. In order to stay within the radius of the Moon, CZ needs to make frequent changes of speed through manoeuvering burns applied to its thrusters every typically less than half an hour to continually keep changing direction to compensate for aerodynamic torques introduced by friction acting upon the vehicles body.

"Apple's custom-designed M2 chips entered production this month. The chips will be introduced with new Macs in the second half of 2021. They are being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company announced last week that it would start making Apple's custom processors early next year, and its first batch is due to begin shipping in August 2020 at most major suppliers. A test machine ordered from TMSC was delivered earlier Wednesday. Just hours after TSMC began mass producing these chips for the Mac Pro in July 2019, Apple confirmed that the company had been secretly working on a replacement to Intel's Xeon E5 v4 series, which powers Mac Pros until the end of 2018 and beyond. TSMC builds all traces of an iPhone XS Max onto FR8 chip In December 2018, Apple started testing CPUs made by Samsung Electronics as well and since then has worked closely with both companies to speed up development and bring the changes necessary to use them. That includes bringing in AMD, ARM Holdings, Cavium Networks, Imagination Technologies, Marvell Technology Group and Qualcomm for support; however, no public updates have yet found their way out about who or what changed between each iteration. But now we do know some things: TSMC produces ""signature"" versions of iPhone SoCs especially designed just for iPhones (like the A12 Bionic), rather than generic designs used across multiple devices like XS Max. And unlike those other devices, the M2 is not shipped off-the-shelf but instead goes through extensive verification before reaching users, meaning you're getting more likely a higher quality product. We also learned recently that the manufacturing process is unique even among Apple's own lineup of products - it uses two separate node types called 7nm and 10LPP. It's similar in scale to the transition from 20nm DRAM to today's FinFET transistors, taking less time and money to ramp up while requiring additional expertise. This transition marks just one of many significant hurdles to overcome if Apple wants to continue using specialized x86 CPU cores in its computers. Consider yourself warned: you might see a lot of ""M2 Compute Units"" when reading our coverage, though they can mean different things depending on context. But for reference purposes we'll stick to how many compute units there actually are inside every part counting only silicon die area directly related to computation. Intel remains committed to pursuing future business opportunities associated with mobile computing, including the expansion into cloud services, data centers and automotive markets.

"Scientists were able to use light and bio-ink to print a human ear-like structure under the skin of mice without a single surgical cut. Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is currently being developed for clinical applications, such as personalized prosthetics or tissue engineering in cases where organ transplantation would be difficult or impossible. The research study was led by Yaniv Erlich at Technion's Faculty of Chemical Engineering with help from Profs. Itai Cohen, Rony Segev and Ravit Ramati at Tel Aviv University's Department of Materials Science Nanoengineering and colleagues at Ben Gurion University of Negev (BGU). The findings are published online today in Nature Nanotechnology. For this new method, researchers first used an inkjet printer to deposit layers containing living cells onto a polyester support material that eventually forms into a soft gel which can then be implanted beneath the mouse's skin. To create this gel, they added three components necessary to healthy cell growth: chondroitin sulfate, sodium hyaluronate and porcine gelatin. After printing these four basic ingredients together, they allowed the mixture to set for 12 hours allowing it time for them to fully solidify before implanting under the animal's skin. They also noted that if the target area is smaller, the printed layer could be frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to implantation and subsequent thawing at room temperature. After only two weeks of having the gel inside their bodies, the team found evidence suggesting that the printed ear had grown naturally within the host mouse tissues, including hair follicles and cartilage cells. Once complete, the ears showed no sign of rejection and appeared normal when viewed on X-ray images taken with a high resolution CT scanner. Also noteworthy, scientists observed something else unique about the process - instead of directly adding all four materials contained in the gel simultaneously during the mixing stage - they had each been placed separately in different cartridges connected to separate pumps; so the same cartridge wouldn't contain any more than one type of material. This strategy enables greater control over how much chemical reaction occurs between specific combinations of building blocks. In addition, because there isn't enough space in most microfluidic systems for large volumes of fluids to mix properly, this approach enabled them to achieve extremely precise concentrations at defined points in the process. When compared against a standard system using simultaneous delivery of all four chemicals through individual channels, the multi-chamber design improved efficiency by 64 while saving nearly half of the overall volume needed according to computer simulations. ""It has become clear that we need to rethink our current approaches towards biomedical manufacturing,"" said coauthor Dr. Nirit Peled from BGU's School of Mechanical engineering. ""This work demonstrates what will happen if we continue developing methods based on traditional fabrication strategies."" According to Ehrlich, developments like these have great potential to improve medical device technology in general but may especially benefit patients with bodily malfunctions caused by congenital conditions such as cleft palate or defects following cancer treatments.

"Today marks Google's official launch for AMP support for email, more than a year after they first announced their intentions of supporting the format. AMP will allow emails to become incredibly fast and responsive on both desktop as well as mobile - and it'll work in Gmail and most other webmail clients out there. One thing that makes this announcement different from many others is the fact that almost every major news organization has already implemented an ad-free version of its site using AMP. We've been covering the various ways websites are working around overzealous ads since at least 2015 (though not always with great success). But these days, plenty of major sites have completely abandoned traditional advertising revenue models altogether and turned instead toward ""sponsored content"" or even subscription services. The good folks behind Consumerist made this clear when writing about why Gawker was switching things up: [I]t's noticeable how much [Gawker Media CEO Nick Denton] talks about sponsored posts lately... He points out quite clearly that, unlike traditional sponsored posts - which usually don't introduce readers directly into advertisers' products themselves - his company now sells a ""brand story"" or ""branded content package."" That allows brands to create stories designed specifically for Web users without ever having to deal with writers on staff who might be biased against their brand. In theory, if you're a brand looking to build trust with people interested in your product or service, then this could make sense. It would certainly streamline what can often feel like a fraught process, where marketers have to get approval from editors to tell certain types of stories. So all those awkward conversations between PR teams and editorial staffers may soon be history. Or they all still happen but only take place over coffee? I'm sure we won't know until some mainstream media companies start doing similar experiments in earnest. The problem here isn't publishers per se; rather, it's ad networks trying to keep pace with competitors while also succeeding online. Just last week, one such network tried to squeeze publishers by offering them an alternative plan called Sponsored Stories 2.0 for anyone with more than 100K viewers that promised higher rates thanks to what seemed like purposeful obfuscation. That said, given our past experience at Ars Technica and elsewhere, it seems unlikely that any publisher choosing this route will end up happy with the results. But despite the growing pains being experienced across the publishing industry today, we should probably note that none of these efforts come close to matching Google's deal with Apple and Facebook. As noted above, Apple and FaceBook recently partnered together on this exact same project, launching new features aimed squarely at making sharing links less clunky and funneling eyeballs towards sponsors of varying sizes. And while details haven't yet emerged regarding exactly howwhy Google plans to pay news organizations for hosting AMP pages, the motivation goes beyond just making email load faster. For example, tech startups might use AMP page templates as part of their pitch to investors, whereas large corporations will likely leverage the technology for marketing purposes. Either way, though, expectations need some clarification before fully jumping onboard. Why We Should Care About Fast Email Today Let me count off my reasons why everyone needs AMP right now. First is speed itself. Whether you read the New York Times, TechCrunch, Mashable, Engadget, Forbes or countless others right now, chances are pretty damn high that you see notifications pop up telling you that something important happened somewhere else in the world. These alerts aren't actually bad, because sometimes they serve as useful reminders. However, the number of times that particular message ends up distracting and taking attention away from whatever's going on locally takes a serious toll on productivity. Imagine getting hit up dozens of times throughout the day with messages saying something breaking happened back home. Now imagine those notifications coming from a website that loads faster, feels better to browse through, and offers fewer distractions. Yeah, I'm talking about us again. What do you think? A bunch of headlines scrolling by too quickly while clicking through a bunch of irrelevant articles means reading time gets cut short. Having to manually scroll down each article separately adds another layer of complexity and time expenditure onto every step of the browsing process. Folks want to spend less time reading and more time enjoying the internet! This goes double for mobile browsers, especially Android ones. Here's what happens when you find yourself wanting to share something via text message: You wait five seconds longer once you tap Send Copy URL. Then you open Chrome or Safari, open the destination website, copy the link, put everything back together, wrap it inside quotes, and send it through SMS. Total effort expended so far equals roughly eight minutes. Oh yeah, did I forget mentioning the smartphone battery draining incident? When you factor all of that in, spending 10 more time during normal browsing becomes downright nonnegotiable. Here's why that level of efficiency matters so much. By bringing daily activities offline, we increase human capacity limits considerably.

"Scientists have developed a new gene-editing tool that is more accurate than CRISPR-Cas9. Prime editing can mend about 89 percent of the 75,000 or so harmful mutations in the human genome that cause sickle cell anemia and other diseases. Prime editors are ""a different class"" from Cas9s because they do not chop up DNA with their ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Instead, they target specific bases, like A's or T's to fix them on the strands where they belong. The major advantage of this technology is its accuracy: it will only edit what needs fixing - making it much less likely to produce off-target effects as compared to Cas9gRNA systems. The discovery was made by researchers at MIT who used it successfully to correct mutated genes causing cystic fibrosis and another deadly genetic condition called severe combined immunodeficiency. Scientists published their findings online last week ahead of publication in Science Advances magazine. What Is CRISP? CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. As you might guess based on the name, the system has generated excitement among scientists due to the ability it provides ""to precisely manipulate genomes without incurring genomic damage."" However, many hurdles must be overcome before we see any noninvasive use of this powerful technique in humans. For example, there may be significant risks to using viruses such as adenoassociated virus vectors (AAV), which contain no viral material but rather insert their own unique sequence into recipient cells. There also remains some uncertainty regarding whether these vectors could replicate over time if injected repeatedly during therapy; however, research suggests most people usually reject vector injections after just one injection. Additionally, the success rate drops when attempting correction of multiple disease loci within a single patient since there is a chance of creating unwanted changes elsewhere. And finally, serious ethical issues are raised around altering the germline of healthy individuals. For now, efforts continue toward developing safer methods of delivery and refining techniques while simultaneously advancing clinical trials for patients waiting eagerly for cures.",0,105

If you haven't checked out our React videos yet check them all out here! Let's get started. First we need some basic familiarity with HTML. You'll be using hyperlinks (a tags) as well as images called ""favicons"" that are embedded in pages as per this Stackoverflow answer: Please note if you're not familiar with writing server side code I recommend checking out Learn Java 8 - An Introduction Through JAXB by Ravi Prakash from Packt Publishing. As mentioned in my previous post The Beginner Experience With Node JS ExpressJS you can view source codes of websites via Firefox Developer Tools Chrome DevTools which will help you become more comfortable reading their files. We also want to make sure to include css stylesheets in our Index.css. We could do it manually but there is much easier way achieve this simply. By invoking webpack-dev-server and including the following lines at the end of srcindex.js:... import '.styles'; Add these two imports at bottom of index.js const path require path; const sassLoader new ExtractTextPlugin filename:'styles[name].extension; module.exports { entry: .srcindex', Include other entries ], output: { filename: chunkhash].[contenthash].bundle.js' }, devServer:{ contentBase: dirname, publicPath: 'dist', historyApiFallback: true } }; Webpack should compile everything into one large bundle named after the hash of every production build. In order to access those bundles locally navigate to :[portnumber]dist[entrypoint] then open up index.html inside dist folder where entry point points to, example index.html: If you don't see anything just refresh page until browser shows 404 error so you know you've got correct paths set up correctly.

Already having a ready made icon set allows us to skip step 1 because now instead of making custom svg favicon from scratch we can use something pre-made. Optionally update README.md document above to include links to your own generated favicon or alternatively leave things as they were please. For ease of handing around different sizes of each icon a handy tool is 'normalize.css' found here: Basically normalize.css helps organize all typefaces and font size values across browsers; essentially creating consistency among browsers when working on projects involving CSS3 properties. It does this through standardized units based on 10px fonts and 16px text baseline alignment. So while enzyemapper alone creates customized favicons from svg graphics created and uploaded directly to github repo, normalize makes certain that all elements fall neatly into place no matter what device size screen resolutions etc may differ amongst users.

"Nine years after hundreds of thousands of people fled the area, nature has started to reclaim the space around Fukushima in Japan. In recent years, many evacuation orders have lifted and residents are increasingly returning to their homes, but all this is happening at a time when radiation levels still remain high above safe limits for children and pregnant women. The town of Iitate (population 489) was once home to more than 1,000 people who fled following an earthquake on 11 March 2011 - the strongest ever recorded anywhere on Earth. The quake devastated three towns and villages within its radius, with 16 other people dying as a result of injuries sustained during the disaster. More than 130 were killed by tsunami waves that travelled 500 miles through Tokyo Bay before slamming into Yamaoka village just east of Sendai city. Residents evacuated to safety along routes leading away from the epicentre; some lost family members or friends due to these decisions. They spent six months living out in tents in places such as Aizu-Wakamatsu Park near Nihonmatsu City. All told, over 200,000 people left behind belongings and properties in Iwaki city alone. Some returned to start life again in temporary accommodation elsewhere, while others took up residency in new homes they had purchased outside of Fukushima prefecture. For many it became far too late to return though: between April 2012 and July 2013, almost half died suddenly or because of illnesses linked with exposure to radiation caused by nuclear meltdowns. According to official figures published last month, nearly 7,600 deaths occurred across Japan ahead of the coronation ceremony marking Emperor Akihito's 60th year reign earlier this week. Approximately 50 of those number can be attributed directly to the triple meltdown at the Daiichi plant immediately downstream to the north. It remains unclear how many of those who did not die will suffer long term health problems related to chronic exposure to radioactive isotopes released into the air after the accident. Before leaving the village, Miyuki Ueki posted pictures online showing what remained inside her house after the quake struck. Her husband tried to save his business - he stored containers of fish paste and soy sauce in underground rooms - but the walls collapsed anyway. ""We don't want to see our old houses any longer, if someone wants to live here we give them permission, they pay rent and use electricity. But we cannot watch everything like CCTV and keep guard 24 hours a day,"" she said. As the weeks passed, few people dared venture back to check on their property until one day Rieko Nagatani decided there simply wasn't enough time left anymore. She and her family walked past the village towards their former home before turning around and heading back again. Although she couldn't get close enough to inspect for herself, something made her stop in front of the building where her mother lived. This was the woman she called mum every single day growing up, yet never actually met face to face. 'They look so lonely. None of us contacted each other since then. We only saw photos,' Ms Nagatani says tearfully. When the family arrived back at the site later that afternoon they found fences erected blocking off sections of land which they knew used to be theirs. As much as 40ft tall weeds grew on most parts of the plot, with one small tree standing sentinel halfway down the backyard. Neighbours moved further westwards as the Japanese government began lifting its restrictions on access to contaminated areas of Fukushima. There were fears contamination would continue spreading in the wake of groundwater seeping into abandoned wells originally designed to contain melted fuel rods. At least 80 wells were destroyed in the process of evacuations and decommissioning operations. Water normally circulates through pipes beneath roads and under neighbourhoods, serving to prevent landslides and floods. After leaving Iwate University two summers ago, Masaru Tomiyasu returned to see his hometown finally open its eyes to the world again. He bought a bottle of water worth about 2 (1.50), walking back to his apartment block - now brightly lit up and occupied - drenched in sweat. He remembered vividly the days of forced evacuation in February 2014, when he realised the scale of damage the country could experience today - particularly in terms of the impact the ongoing crisis could have on food production. Back then officials initially warned against venturing outside without protective gear; now locals have begun to swim the river flowing alongside the local district office. Others have even ventured closer to find signs of activity around buildings whose foundations remain unstable, enriched uranium debris scattered on scorched ground, frozen soil lying broken up among flocks of birds.

"A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourban ia can be used indoors and will look ""just like a normal indoor plant"" according to its creators. Biomitec hopes that the high-tech solution could help bring down levels of ozone in cities around the world by collecting particulate matter (PM) from polluted urban areas and distributing it into less polluted regions where plants would naturally draw this harmful pollutant out of the atmosphere. In addition, Biomitech says it uses no fossil fuels so should not interfere with carbon budgets. The company designed Biourobana using state-of-the-art nanotechnology and 3D printing technology to enable large scale manufacturing at low cost while simultaneously improving upon previous designs for the purpose. The artificial trees are fabricated first in water or hydrogel which then hardens into a solid product after drying. They consist mainly of three layers: PM collector, oxygen binding layer and catalyst activated layer. These layers are created using nanoemulsions, aerogels and other advanced materials. A reflective coating allows sunlight to pass through but traps PM emissions within the structure without allowing dust particles to enter the core and catalyze further chemical reactions. When installed outdoors in Mexico City one of these structures was able to process 50 tonnes of pollutants per year - equivalent to nearly 3600 mature trees over 18 months! Although the capacity may seem small, the device represents a considerable improvement on previous generations of man made devices such as electrostatic precipitators which require energy intensive systems to remove fine dust trapped on their surfaces. Additionally they do not absorb gases well and have therefore been largely ineffective against ground level ozone despite being built almost 100 years ago. However, Biomecht says it aims to produce products that become more efficient over time through continual research and development. Source Link",0,112

"SpaceX is starting a program to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into rocket fuel. The technology will be important on Mars, as fuel could be brought in by lander instead of having to bring most everything with them from Earth. It's called Boring Company (no connection between Elon Musk and this name), and you can read about its progress at LA Times here [Editorial]. Below are some questions I have for SpaceX? Well, one question: would you live there? That last link has an answer right now! (And Musk won't say yes or no until he sees if he gets funding.) Myself? Yes. Just to look around and see what else is going on would be fine too. But why not make sure that people who want to go live somewhere else don't get their hopes up before they decide whether or not to put down roots? If someone does want to stay after finding out more than half-way through pre-planning that they do care about climate change, imagine how much easier it all might be? And, again, why wait 10 years? Why not 15? 20? 25? 30? So many reasons... It's time we got serious about taking action to stop global warming. We need to start setting aside money and resources now, so our descendants can live here long enough to learn the lessons we fail to teach today. I am often surprised when politicians talk about things like space exploration, spending cuts for NASA, etc., without always including reasonable targets for reducing CO2 emissions. A politician said something recently along those lines - ""We should build rockets and drive away from our problems"" - but then seemed confused about specifics within seconds because, apparently, such levels of detail weren't part of his original presentation. Nobody really knows where all these extra greenhouse gases come from; nobody really plans for any reductions other than vague statements regarding energy usage and conservation efforts. How close are we to needing real solutions for climate change? Asking these simple questions leads me to believe the world needs different answers than what my previous post suggested. Anyways, hiding behind abstractions, using phrases like 'we couldn't possibly cause anything like this', 'it was just very bad luck', 'this isn't human made' makes us all less accountable for addressing the problem. When we push the responsibility onto others, whether government leaders or sympathetic individuals on social media, based upon whatever reasoning we find convincing, than we aren't doing nearly enough ourselves. This brings me back to your comment on Idealism vs Realism, and my frustration over being asked to accept a high level plan while simultaneously waiting multiple decades for specific details. Maybe acceptance doesn't require us to know exactly how a solution comes together, but it certainly requires knowing how it feels to try. There are consequences associated with failing to act; I think we deserve to understand exactly how dire the situation looks before making decisions about life here versus elsewhere. - Elon Musk talks about wanting to colonize Mars and terraform it slowly so humans never need leave the planet - maybe even forever, one day. On Twitter, I sometimes hear comments like 'You can still breathe air, Mars is nice. You can visit friends.' Those seem positive conversations, yet I worry that people may forget about living on another planet entirely. Do you agree? Is that a realistic goal for humanity? Would you support sending people off to explore another planet someday? What advice would you give them: choose wisely, pick a place that will work, set aside funds during tough times, know that even after several generations the environment isn't fixed, remember those who came before you, prepare for harsh environments, handle setbacksfailures well...or? There are definitely risks involved with moving beyond the confines of Earth. Of course there are dangers, physical challenges, mental hurdles, emotional difficulties. Yet many of those issues pale in comparison to the potential benefits of exploring new worlds. Isn't that worth considering (and researching)? To date, Tesla cars haven't been tested under extraterrestrial conditions, nor have reusable launch vehicles flown successfully since Apollo days - but private companies are working hard to develop technologies needed to eventually send large numbers of folks across distances spanning lightyears. Bringing colonists to Mars would cost trillions of dollars and probably wouldn't happen anytime soon. However, once it starts happening, and assuming success rates improve drastically, I can almost guarantee you'll have people trying to move far, far beyond the Moon, perhaps toward distant stars. Before they actually reach those destinations, however, they'd likely first visit Saturn's moon Titan, which shares similar weather patterns and provides easy access to vast cavernous structures held only inches below its surface. Could anyone die touring planets and moons before settling permanently on Mars? Absolutely. People died aboard Apollo capsules traveling alone above the clouds. In theory, they were playing this game. Now heading homecoming Martiaientetsucal climb rate patterningby rate upst",0,115
"Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), an Australian mining company, has announced a project to create an electric infinity train that will be able to move loads of iron ore without ever using fossil fuels. The FFI subsidiary said its new line of trains would use ultra-high voltage power lines and electricity from wind farms to run on zero emissions the first time around. This might seem like a straightforward concept; however it is much more complex than you might think because some effects cannot be ignored when designing such a project. The reasons why this happens can be understood by looking at what makes up these 'infinity' trains. They are not simply massive versions of traditional railways with huge wheels or indeed cars but have many specialised components integrated into their design which must all work together for them to function as they should - it may sound complicated but the team behind the project claims that everything works exactly how it needs to do so they believe there won't be any unexpected problems during construction. If they get rid of one thing then something else becomes problematic instead! There are two main types of steel used in making railroads: high tensile strength mild steel and medium carbon low alloy steel. Most current railway systems use rail made from either type although some uses very sophisticated materials including stainless steel rails but even those require regular maintenance to keep working correctly. For example the large locomotives that pull long freight trains across Europe need to check themselves regularly to make sure the bearings don't seize due to rusting. On top of this they also need regular lubrication applied to both moving parts to minimise friction. So far we haven't mentioned batteries yet and our assumption was that infinite energy storage had been achieved somewhere along the way until the fact came out that nothing could actually store enough energy to lift and transport tons of metal over hundreds of miles each day. In other words, the biggest problem facing this journey will always remain despite the best intentions of the engineers involved. Infinite Batteries? Lithium Ion battery technology does hold great promise for future projects because if properly engineered they can offer higher levels of density per unit volume than conventional rechargeable batteries. Lithium ion cells typically weigh about 10 less than lead-acid batteries and deliver roughly twice the charge capacity. However lithium based chemistry generates a lot of heat when charging and discharging leading to several safety issues. We read that continuous charging causes overheating, fires and explosion risk, especially in enclosed spaces where oxygen concentrations rise rapidly. To protect against this hazard, companies such as Panasonic manufacture devices designed specifically to reduce internal temperature inside batteries thereby reducing fire risks but they add weight to the vehicle reducing overall efficiency. Another issue that occurs with most batteries is that positive electrodes tend to wear down after repeated cycling causing reduced lifetime performance. What is needed here therefore is a truly self healing system capable of maintaining optimal life expectancy indefinitely. There already exists some research aiming to achieve just that. It seems that graphene nanomaterials can increase the lifespan of LiFePO4 cells enabling thousands of cycles before significant fading begins while still offering excellent discharge characteristics. With further development the impact of graphene based technologies may change significantly reducing costs and increasing availability making us finally start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel again. Whilst mainstream science researchers continue to debate whether life existed elsewhere in the universe (as early suggestions suggest) humanity continues pressing forward with ambitious goals to find answers within our own solar system. As Elon Musk recently stated through his Twitter account he believes earthlike planets exist within the Milky Way Galaxy and encourages people to look. Not only is there potential for finding intelligent life in deep space but now with developments being made currently it is possible to detect potentially habitable worlds orbiting stars located somewhat close to Earth. One particular planet orbits Proxima Centauri whose star is known to be relatively similar to ours and we know that conditions such as pressure and gravity are incredibly important factors affecting habitability. I am personally excited to see advancements in artificial intelligence capabilities allowing machines to learn autonomously via mass production and learning processes in ways that allow them to teach themselves continually improving performance and ability over time. Futuristic Atom Train 1 Future industries plans on taking things slowly beginning with an experimental version called Futurisicat. Their aim is to develop a complete prototype capable of transporting cargo safely whilst keeping environmental impacts to a minimum. There are four key elements required for their goal to become a reality. Firstly, they intend to go beyond existing designs and include kinetic sensors all throughout the track itself meaning they could be aware of objects placed anywhere along the route and stop automatically if there is anything anyone wants avoiding collision hazards completely. Secondly, the team hopes to replace the common dumb braking systems found on all established vehicles today to produce regenerative brakes which collect kinetic energy from passing traffic and apply that back onto the driving wheels acting as its primary source of propulsion. A third element includes storing electrical energy generated by renewable sources (such as wind turbines) onboard for later usage whenever extra power is required which eliminates the need for wired connections everywhere in order to boost the size of networked constent co-lately.

Whether we like it or not, companies prefer candidates who are willing to spend more than five minutes filling out applications because it signals dedication, initiative, and an above-average work ethic. So clearly, there is no incentive for applicants to take less than 10 minutes to fill this thing out so just go ahead and take up to 15, 20 even 30 minutes if you need to get things done. Three hours please! We promise it will all pay off once you land that first coding gig:)...and then years later when they hire someone else from the same company. Either way, the extra time spent doing something good will come back 100x times over during the hiring process. This means lots of money saved on those monthly phone bills as well as office space rental fees. Just kidding! But seriously though don't underestimate how much time can be wasted on sending a resume that says ""I love programming"" with nothing further explained. When applying for jobs, sometimes being concise makes sense. Sometimes you can say everything you want to convey by simply writing exactly what it is you're looking for. If you find yourself spending too long trying to explain why you'd fit into some specific role, you might consider tweaking the words you use, adding adjectives to describe your skills, or perhaps finding another word entirely to sum up what it is you're really looking for. Here are three examples below of changing the wording employed in job descriptions. Example 1: Downgrade Now!"" - ""Downgrading now."" Example 2: Looking For Someone Willing To Take On Some New Projects Non-Technical Responsibilities - ""Looking for someone willing to coordinate new projects and non-technical responsibilities related to development within our team"" Example 3: Our Frontend Dev Is Currently Out Due To Health Issues - ""Our front end developer is currently unavailable due to health issues but do reach out via email to [email protected]."" Putting aside for a moment whether any of these changes would actually make sense semantically, research suggests the following: Changing language used in advertisements does affect which kinds of individuals tend to apply for different types of positions. Shifting the focus away from qualifications can cause qualified workers to miss opportunities based upon preconceived notions or generalizations made using irrelevant information such as gender. Throughout my career, I've seen many cases where clients were convinced to hire certain people over others purely because the former was female while assuming the latter was male. Regardless of bias, in today's world, everyone knows women code just as men do, right guys?! Women are good programmers and engineers, don't worry! Don't believe me? Check out CodersAtWork's blog post titled Gender in Computer Science. Another study found that more experienced software developers tended to rate themselves better in multiple technical areas and had higher rates of satisfaction with careers than other graduates. Perhaps this was because they took advantage of networking opportunities offered outside of school, internships, or free courses online. Did your university offer paid IT classes? Maybe you benefited from them in ways you didn't know existed. Stop waiting to see if someone calls you if you send an e-mail. Take charge and act accordingly. Not only will this produce faster responses, but also help you identify potential weaknesses in messaging or philosophy before wasting precious time responding to messages with vague statements. If possible, preface every question asked about relevant experience with ""why I'm asking"" or ""what specifically interests me about ,"" followed immediately after with specifics, demonstrating interest in the position. Even if the interviewer doesn't ask this question outright, try to articulate the answer anyway, making sure you cover your bases. Remember the goal here isn't to sell yourself short, it's to communicate exactly what value you bring to the table and highlight areas where you may excel.

"DeepMind has published a paper on their system AlphaZero, an AI that can crack any game that provides all the relevant decision-making information. This includes games like chess and go, but also much more complex strategic boardgames such as Go Fish or Shogi (Japanese Chess). The article below summarizes some of the highlights from this study our team was involved in: Deepmind's paper on building superintelligenct systems with alpha zero is now online (Arxive link above should be accessible by anybody who is registered at arXiv) Alpha Zero uses neural networks to learn to play Atari 2600 video games in just hours without being taught how to use trial and error. In an experiment where it played five classic Atari titles - including Breakout, Pong, Space Invaders, Enduro and River Raid - against itself over many days, within only six hours the program had improved enough to achieve 100 win percentage for each game! (Video of winning session - ""Sitting Bull"" vs ""Showing Up"" playing): The findings are especially impressive since these programs were trained using no human input whatsoever. Instead they learned through selfplay: i.e., they have been running themselves thousands upon thousands of times; testing their own moves against those made by other computers during training sessions and choosing which ones worked best based purely on what got better results in subsequent rounds. Natural language understanding allows machines to communicate effectively with humans in novel ways. For instance, IBM Watson caused quite a stir when it defeated two chess grandmasters on TV in 2011. A decade before that, Google Translate added rudimentary text translation capabilities to its web interface. Deeper learning algorithms may soon allow machines to talk in new ways to people too. Researchers at Stanford University recently showed that deep reinforcement learning could teach robots skills they never thought possible - including an ability to recognize faces, navigate mazes, pull up recipes, even pick out objects from images. Humans often acquire seemingly nonintuitive abilities through practice and feedback. But 'machine teaching' can work in reverse: rather than viewing robots as merely mindless wooden automatons, we might view them as teachers capable of helping us expand our mind and gain wisdom along the way. - William Lally, Senior Technical Advisor at Numenta In general, one important challenge of developing artificial intelligence lies not necessarily in devising clever computational methods, but instead in coming up with the right problem domains and tasks to test AI research efforts. As a case in point, consider StarCraft II. Whereas dedicated artificial intelligence players dominate first person shooters like Call of Duty, most professional gamers favor real time strategy (RTS) type games such as Starcraft 2. Although even skilled RTS designers struggle to find good rules for designing these kinds of scenarios, StarCraft nevertheless offers much needed challenges for modern AI researchers. On the surface, StarCraft appears very simple. Yet despite intense commercial competition among amateur teams, few developers have ever managed to create software that defeats top professionals in the four year long tournament known as eSports. By contrast, chess masters routinely beat the best computer programs available today ... Even if you take into account hundreds of years of knowledge about the physical world accumulated by mankind, there remain hidden complexities that humans cannot comprehend. Software agents need to model these nuances accurately in order to succeed at challenging problems. One recent example comes again from the field of robotics. Consider humanoid robot Sophia - the successor to Japan's popular K-3 robot series. She demonstrates high degrees of autonomy by bringing her arms together and clearly conveying various emotions via facial expressions and body movements. However, she does not appear to understand speech well enough to converse coherently with humans. - Harald Hammarstrom, Turing Award Laureate 2015 A key concern raised here concerns the possibility of runaway amoral behavior as represented by StarCraft bots growing increasingly powerful until they finally defeat human beings directly. Given the fact that these examples involve fictional characters, moral qualms ought perhaps to be mitigated given that the kind of machine intelligence envisioned must eventually come true anyway. Moreover, while highly advanced AGI seems difficult to imagine on earth of late, it may well become practical once technological progress has further accelerated. Note however that so far interactions between real humans and simulated entities do seem to proceed very smoothly and pleasantly with little evidence of overt conflict ... I think serious discussion will require more careful consideration of potential consequences of achieving full AGI mastery.- Jerzy Perzanowski, Faculty Fellow at National Institute of Standards Technology More generally, the paper describes a pretty cool group of experiments, giving us insight into strengths and weaknesses of several contemporary approaches to digital minds. Below I discuss three main topics covered in the paper. 1) Reinforcement Learning (RL) versus Universal Intelligence Hypothesis Action selection in RL is guided primarily by immediate reward signals (such as points earned), whereas an agent would ideally select actions that maximize cumulative future returns (i. pity performance: another actordositandpace proctor xattesting to demonstrate exactly the opposite dilemma).

"A study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has found that Far-UVC light can safely kill 99.9 of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets. Conventional UV lamps can kill viruses but only if the virus is exposed to short wavelengths directly, such as with sunlamps or tanning booths. Far-UV light cannot affect viruses because it doesn't have enough energy to penetrate biological membranes and reach DNA inside cells. But a new study by scientists at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health shows that one type of far-ultraviolet (UVA) laser can break down hemagglutinin proteins necessary for viral entry into host cells through cell receptors on their surface. This could be useful against some strains of influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which cause upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold - and are often associated with more serious complications including pneumonia. The findings were published online May 23 in PLoS ONE by principal investigator Jurgen Schlehofer from Columbia's Department of Pathology Laboratory Medicine and collaborators Drs. Thomas Eisner, Kristian Gundersen, Leila Ahmedzai, David Hackelberg, Sylvia Lanzas, Neil Nathanson, Leslie Pratt, Joseph Simeone, Laura Sabatino and Robert Shusta at Ocular Photomedicine Research Unit in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. They will appear in print June 7 issue of Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences USA. ""We wanted to test whether this approach would work outside our lab,"" says Schlehofer, who conducted the research while completing his Ph.D. thesis under mentor Charles Gerba. ""Fortunately, we had an opportunity to do so."" His colleagues came up with the idea after reading reports about experiments involving RSV done elsewhere. Working together, they designed different tests using both human specimens and mouse models. Their results showed promise; not just in killing most strains of influenza A, but also those of parainfluenza 3 virus, another important pathogen in humans. In addition to being used to treat acute disease, UVA may play an even bigger role in preventing infection at its source: sewage treatment plants where high levels of hepatitis A virus persist according to the CDC. In 2002, researchers first proved that low doses of UVA killed many types of bacteria in water. Since then, evidence suggesting other benefits has been accumulating. For example, eliminating infectious agents before microbiological analysis reduces error rates during processing of environmental samples. And UVA rays sterilize swimming pools without causing any chemical changes. Even better, there's no need for direct contact between viruses and germicidal radiation. Experts speculate that UVA might offer protection beyond the eyes, too, since the body naturally generates UVA light when vitamin D is made in the skin following exposure to sunlight. However, further studies testing these theories are needed. Curing germs: URSA Light? Not yet Germs normally live harmlessly anchored within solid surfaces and suspended in fluid environments like blood or urine until someone touches them with contaminated fingers and passes them along to others via sneezing, coughing or kissing. Unlike conventional ultraviolet light, which must come close enough to microbes for photons to smash nucleotides helixes, UVA actually breaks apart long peptide chains called polymers, disrupting bonds between atoms. As a result, microorganisms treated with UVA die within minutes rather than hours. Because UVA does not require superheated air, it won't burn your skin. You don't need special filters, either, making them compact and efficient. But despite promising early data, neither urastan nor similar devices are FDA approved or available commercially. First developed around 1950, URA systems date back to a time when they still required banks of vacuum tubes and expensive photoelectric elements. Nowadays, dozens of companies sell hand-held versions aimed mainly at beauticians and dermatologists, but few claim extensive clinical experience. Still, Scott Johnson, president of SUNLIGHTFX Inc., based in Rockville Centre, NY, maintains that he has cured bacterial vaginosis with UVA in women over age 50, although he declines to share details for fear of litigation. He plans future trials in menopausal women next year. Until experimental products become widely available, you're basically stuck testing yourself. To ensure safety, experts suggest spending 15 minutes per day staring straight ahead at a reflective window about 30 feet away.

"MoviePass is coming back under the ownership of cofounder Stacy Spikes. The company was acquired out of bankruptcy for an undisclosed amount below 250,000. Spikes plans to relaunch the business by adding new features and ""focusing on our members first."" Spike's tweet about his return follows: 'I have decided to come back home because... I am more optimistic than ever that we can fix Moviepass but this time it will be fixed right' - stacy spikes (stacyspikes) December 15, 2018 A memo sent to staff in advance of the deal announced they would all receive a 10 percent salary cut over the next year as part of the acquisition process. One staffer said all their benefits were being frozen until further notice. It seems employees are not getting paid while the future of the service remains unclear. A rep from STX declined comment when reached by Variety. The most recent chapter in Moviepass history began with its controversial introduction in 2017. Founder Mitch Lowe initially launched the subscription-based streaming service at 9 per month - one price point, he claimed, for unlimited movie tickets. Within months of launch, subscribers numbered just 30,000 people across the nation. Its customer base dwindled even further once exhibitors started raising concerns about ticket sales plummeting as users tried to see multiple movies every week. In early January, Lowe abruptly shut down operations after losing several million dollars. He sued AMC, Regal Entertainment Group (owner of Cinemark), Cineplex Inc., National Amusements and others, accusing them of colluding to keep him from entering into agreements with other theater chains. His lawsuit also names Netflix and Hulu as competitors who allegedly offered better deals to theaters. On top of those complaints, Lowe has accused Moviepass executives of stealing millions worth of stock before filing Chapter 11 protection last August. After fleeing to Mexico and then moving to France, Lowe quietly returned to Los Angeles earlier this fall. As he finally set foot back at HQ, he tweeted excitedly that Hollywood studios had already begun submitting scripts specifically meant to target Moviepass customers. In October, Lowe told press outlets he'd contacted investors seeking support (rumors later surfaced of a failed attempt). Since returning, he hasn't commented publicly since late November. It appears he no longer intends to seek monetary compensation or any sort of shareholding from Moviepass' previous owners. While there may still be legal drama ahead of him, Spike says he feels confident enough to take the helm after making some changes. From what little information exists online, the acquisition could value the company at less than half of what it was sold for two years ago. That means nearly 100 staffers saw their salaries slashed. Some say they still don't know exactly how much money they lost during the transition period. It certainly won't help morale if rumors swirling around the company continue claiming Moviepass is headed toward insolvency again. Last summer, these reports dogged the startup long enough to prompt several High Park West screens to stop sending patrons cards allowing access to movie listings. Another source confirmed they were feeling anxious about whether the program would survive another round of layoffs. Another rumor claims Moviepass faces a potential exodus of talent unless they agree to pay higher commissions to agents. While Spike isn't backing up any such claim, he does admit the company needs to do more to attract local film producers and TV projects. With so many copies currently available on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, why should anyone bother paying full price? He's planning to rebrand the app too to make it easier to find families watching films together. This shouldn't be surprising considering the majority of Moviepass subscriptions came from parents buying passes for kids.

"Ten eggs were harvested from the last two remaining northern white rhinoceroses, potentially saving the species from extinction. Neither of the white rhinos can carry a baby to term, so conservationists keep them artificially inseminated when they're close to ovulating as part of their long-term plan to breed these animals and release them back into the wild. The egg harvesting technique is called ""superovulation,"" and it involves drugs (both manmade hormones like Clomid, or naturally occurring ones such as progesterone) to trigger an overproduction of mature follicles ready for conception. The first step in this process was only recently developed; until then, scientists had relied on collecting mature eggs that would be too difficult to fertilize and grow embryos in petri dishes. Superovulation makes those processes more efficient and cost-effective: less time waiting around, faster results, fewer risks involved with pregnancy loss due to natural causes. It takes about six months before another female will become receptive again after having been superovulated. In theory, if you could store sperm at least once during that timeframe, any animal - including humans can have babies later in life. So far there are no records of elephants being able to reproduce using stored sperm years later. But scientists say sperm cells don't die off right away. The potential exists for every mammal species to view fertility preservation as a viable option. ""The most exciting thing is to think we might get to a stage where people who may otherwise not be able to conceive because of significant genetic problems can do that,"" said Dr. Sheryl Hausman, chief scientific officer of Fertility Centers of New Jersey in West Orange. ""That's going to change medicine.""",0,126
"Most object detectors enumerate a large list of potential object locations and then classify each item, which is a large waste of resources as well as an inefficient approach. Objects are usually located at any position in the images due to camera shake or unknown objects that were not detected during training (e.g., shopping carts). Object detection based on templates has been shown to obtain state-of-the-art results for many tasks such as pedestrian[kalagatla2017robust; redmon2016you] recognition, animal[ren2018cascade], vehicle[chang2014vehicle] classification and semantic segmentation[dai2015box]. In this work we propose three approaches that require no previously known bounding boxes or categories but only annotations of points and lines. The first one uses random 3D shapes extracted from a database similar in concept to keypointshistograms [jung2009learning] used for face localization. Our method also takes advantage of learning invariant features through shape clustering, allowing speedups of up to 1003 faster than previous methods while maintaining good performance. We select a subset of these clusters using our final classifier to find candidate regions with high confidence, and finally use simple geometric heuristics to filter out irrelevant ones. To show how this can be applied across different scenarios, we apply it to two other applications: line extraction and bike lane extraction. In both cases we compare against existing algorithms available in popular libraries. Lastly, we demonstrate its applicability by extracting spatially aligned surfaces from point clouds obtained via depth sensors.",0,127
"Beta test the new HLS Live Stream Latency metric in Mux Data for free! Understand the live streaming experience, and find opportunities to improve. Learn more. One of our goals at Sling is to make it easy for customers to create great-looking live video experiences on top of commercial Sling TV services. To help achieve that goal, we're developing a tool that will allow us to measure how well you are doing by measuring end-to-end latency from your source media file until when people watch it. This includes: The time it takes to get to the viewer, via server (s) across multiple network hops (including peering agreements), routers, switches, firewalls, etc. The Internet itself has many other factors beyond what we can control which affect this too - including weather conditions, internet congestion during peak times, different connection speeds of different types of devices, mobile phone data charges, operators with varying quality guarantees, network outages, etc. We want to take as much of these things into account as possible so that when someone watches your performance metrics, they see an accurate representation of all aspects involved in delivering a successful stream. While there may be some short term stability problems or occasional interference with certain technical systems, we expect overall average latencies to remain relatively stable over time given such minor changes in equipment and infrastructure configuration between one day and another let alone weeks or months or years. For many users, however, if their average latency goes up a bit, their personal best will go down, because that means their set of potential viewers is getting smaller due to geographic constraints, device type limitations, etc. So while several hours might not seem like a big deal to you today, waiting 30 seconds longer than yesterday could mean missing out on thousands of folks who wouldn't have watched otherwise had they known about your awesome streams.

WANT MORE? CLICK HERE We need to do something about latency before we move forward with any deployments or even start discussing them internally. Theoretically this should already happen automatically behind scenes, but since most people don't know to look, measured results aren't made visible to anyone outside of Sling Labs until now. But why wait until then to begin tracking? Why not track this now considering the number of important areas where we think improvements could be substantial right away? There are five main reasons I chose 2016 as my starting point for rolling out initial latency measurement capabilities within our product development cycle: Latency affects every aspect of the delivery pipeline, and therefore needs to become part of everyone's thinking throughout the process of planning a new service deployment Forecasting ahead becomes increasingly difficult to plan for and evaluate Future growth and expansion plans depend heavily on knowing exactly how quickly each step in the path gets completed and whether those steps impact the rest of the chain Deployments require additional resources - both human and financial Real-time feedback helps better understand people's viewing habits Compared against existing services in the same market segment, we believe that no other company offers a comprehensive view of the quality assurance processes applied to ensure smooth, fast streaming such as ours does. Making the decision to launch early gives us confidence in being able to address concerns and issues sooner rather than later and allows us to remove bottlenecks that would cause delays in launching future projects Get started now to avoid having to change direction later due to unforeseen circumstance That said, we really hope you enjoy using the system once we roll out its components next year instead of just having to suffer through it... These are just some of the major benefits, and ultimately we'll iterate based on user feedback as the project develops. And after talking with various teams here, it seems pretty confident that we'll discover plenty of opportunities to give good customer value immediately. Although latency measurements won't show up anywhere publicly unless you ask for them explicitly, please note that they're always available inside database containers as long as you log in to the admin console and select Storage Delivery Metrics along with either Category ""Live Video"" or Status ""Online.""

"This article features an interview with Tony Fadell. Fadell was instrumental in the development of the iPod and iPhone at Apple. He co-founded Nest Labs, which was sold to Google for 3Billion 5 years ago. He is also a top advisorboard member of Lyft, General Electric's new venture capital fund GE Ventures and SpaceX (referral link). It appears that he now has his hands full as Chairman and CEO of The Nest company. I interviewed him about some interesting projects which are on their way or have been deployed already. Tony: Hi, this is Tony Fadell from Apple, it's good to talk to you! Also known by the nickname ""TinyFad."" Thanks so much for taking time out from your busy schedule - let me know how we can help! Timothy: Thank you very much. Let's start off with your journey... You started working at Apple right after graduating college but later left as CTO (Chief Technology Officer) to found Nest. What were your experiences prior? And why did you decide not to stay longer at Apple? TinyFad: One of my first jobs when one year into college, was making funny signs with cut paper and Scotch tape - thinking they would be great business cards. A couple months later though, Steve Jobs walked through the door and hired me onto the team where I worked up until May 2003. That job turned my life upside down; I had no idea what I wanted to do with my career yet I ended up staying there almost 4 years, becoming part of the culture that created two amazing devices: the original Macintosh and the Mac Cube. In fact, all those things happened because Steve asked me to build the iMac. When I realized just how well constructed it truly was, Steve thought it shouldn't be made of wood anymore but instead use plastic - something I'd never built before. So I went to work doing just that. My boss called me back to tell me ""we want to make every product better than anyone else"" and being told ""you need to leave,"" was probably the biggest lesson in my professional life. But I learned more than anything else while being there: if you're passionate enough and believe in yourself, success will come - even if it takes 20 tries.. and sometimes 40:) Some people call me TinyFad, others say TinoFada. Others call me Timmy. All names suit me fine. If someone asks me what my name means, I'm happy to answer them - I don't care who calls me that anyhow. As long as they love me. For example, after recently getting married Callie gave me her wedding gift: she named our son Zane a few days after our honeymoon trip to Italy. She gave both iPhones away to friends during the marriage. After 3 years, she finally decided to give mine to me again, saying 'now I feel like I am giving you the phone'. It makes me smile. On the other hand - I remember meeting Robert Scoble once and having two conversations going over whether I should call myself Mr.Scoble or Mr.. WellScoblesomething. Two different personalities here, but same ideas. Everyone has a title, many titles. The important thing is to understand who the real person really is, and then tailor what you present accordingly. YMMV. Anyway, I digress.... If you could go back and change one decision in your career path life, what would it be? Why? TF: I wish I had stayed another year or 2 at Apple. While building the iMac, I became close friends with Phil Schiller and Don Mansfield, helping facilitate some of the early Apple events and public appearances. Don asked me to run marketing together during the launch of iTunes music store. At the end of 2001, Steve announced he was leaving. We talked about what needed to happen next, and agreed that everyone should try to figure out what we individually felt best suited us moving forward without Steve around. Nobody knew the future except maybe Scott Cook, yet sure enough, less than 6 weeks later, Jeff Bezos came walking through the doors. Jeff couldn't walk 10 feet without stopping to hug all of us, telling us what a great place it was. Personally speaking, that moment changed everything. Now that I think about it, it may well have been the most powerful day in tech history since IBM throwing its weight behind UNIX. Since then, the power began to shift rapidly from hardware to software. Hardware companies lost market share dramatically across multiple device categories. Before Jeff took control, the entire group was focused purely on selling 3rd party products through our computers. With adoption rates growing exponentially, it wasn't just that the PC industry was dying, but rather that Apple itself stood alone among its peers poised to revolutionize the world entirely via software.

"Norway is building the world's first ship tunnel to help vessels navigate the Stadhavet Sea. The tunnel will cost around 2.8 billion Norwegian kroner and take between three to four years to complete. It is expected that it can handle up to 1,800 ships a year - if they are fitted with special equipment which reduces their speed by 15 percent during transit times of two hours or more. It was announced in April this year that construction could begin on an ambitious new route for the Aker Brygge ship canal project. This would be located at Vippetangen bay north-east Oslo and run from the port area through Romsas park and past Bygdy peninsula all the way out to Tonsenhagen harbour at Sjusjren. In total 140 hectares (2.4 square miles) of land would be needed along the whole length of the route. Land ownership means the project has been controversial but after several court battles and extensive public consultation, planning permission may now finally be granted later this autumn. If approved, work should commence next spring and it is hoped that completion could coincide with the opening celebrations for Norway's hosting of Euro 2016 football championships. In May 2012 transport minister Ketil Solvik Olsen unveiled plans to build a 10km long road tunnel under the Straumen sea channel linking North Boknafossvarfjorden near Mangerlia and Fosshalsbotnen at Lofotruten lake along the south coast of Trondheim fjord. The estimated budget was 757 million NOK (95m) and it would utilise existing land use rights. Despite strong opposition from local residents, planning approval was given unanimously to start construction last month. Work is due to finish in 2015 and when completed there will no longer need to traverse such dangerous waters as those found in the current ferries. It is intended that cargo barge traffic will be able to pass safely beneath the straumen while bigger container barges would also be allowed. Those wanting to visit the western side of the city can do so via two other busy ferry routes across the narrow Hjeltefjord river mouth. However, many have criticised the high price tag attached to the project. Construction began last summer on one of Europe's most ambitious multi-billion dollar crossings aimed at easing congestion along the busiest stretch of motorways in Northern Ireland. Construction costs were initially pegged at 932million - equivalent to about 1.3bn (1.5bn). But mounting technical problems with the crossing mean its overall cost has risen over time to almost 1.28billion (1.7bn). Transport Minister Conor Murphy pledged to scrap the project earlier this year because he said it had become ""economically unsound."" He said it risked leaving only a single lane open in each direction. The US state department considers Iceland a safe enough country to allow entry without visa restrictions into its passport free zone and even extend financial support for tourism projects. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the report included recommendations for stronger cooperation with Icelandic authorities to address issues related to border security and measures taken against illegal immigration. The report states: ""Iceland ... does not deny regular flights into Reykjavik Airport from various major destinations within the United States."" Decisions made by DHS officials will now go before Congress where members of both parties have accused the Obama administration of ignoring warnings about conditions on the ground. A significant number of people living close to airports face health risks caused directly by aircraft noise pollution despite being classified as 'living very close' to commercial aviation facilities, according to research published today. Researchers conducting a review of scientific evidence concluded that populations living closer than 3 kilometres from airport flight paths face significantly higher risk of heart disease, respiratory illness and cognitive impairment than those residing further away. Almost 50 per cent of UK adults live within 0.6 km of nine major London Heathrow International Terminals (LTAs); 20 per cent live within 0.6 km of five Manchester Airports; 18 per cent reside within 0.6 km of seven Liverpool John Lennon Airport terminals; 22 per cent live within 0.6 km of eight Gatwick Terminal 4 and 13 per centre, and 16 per cent live within 0.6 km of six Stansted Terminal.

"Aevum is a startup with an uncrewed aircraft that can take small payloads out to space. The aircraft doesn't use any groundbreaking technology, and it looks similar to existing jet -powered spacecraft. But the company says its plane could be the first means of transporting people into orbit in 2019. The AEV was developed by MiG Corporation through a partnership between Soryu Air Systems Co., Ltd., which owns rights on the design, and Aileron Aviation Inc., part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). It's designed for two passenger seats facing each other at 0.98 meters wide and 1.11 m long. As per Spaceflight Now's report, this will make up about half of the length of an Airbus 380 cabin. With such dimensions, there'll be room enough inside for four standard airline seat rows, meaning passengers won't have to sit uncomfortably next to one another like they do today. And since the AEV uses no fuel but electric motors, it needs only three or four engines - just as Dragon does now - instead of the 15 required by SpaceX's Starship and BFR. This also reduces weight significantly compared to today's rockets. All these features are meant so you don't need massive amounts of money to build your own spaceship, something we already know from Virgin Galactic; while Elon Musk has said he expects his BFR would carry around 150 tons of cargo, Orion, with 40 tons of mass capacity, carries about 11 times more than that currently. According to CEO Akio Toyoda from Toyota Motor Corp., who joined the test mission crew earlier this year, this is how the AEV works: ""As soon as the rocket engine starts burning, the altitude goes down instantly."" He added that the maximum speed achievable using hydrogen hypersonic combustion differs based on several factors such as nozzle diameter and pressure ratio, yet it shouldn't exceed Mach 7.5, which matches what current scramjet designs can reach. Some sources claim the company had plans to offer the vehicle as early as 2018; however, this appears to have been refuted directly by Saryu Air System official Yoshiyuki Iwanaga. ""For me personally, my development schedule was always firmly set out during 2016,"" he told Japanese newspaper Nikkei Business Daily in April. ""In response to the request made last year, we planned our efforts accordingly without changing anything else."" It should come as little surprise then that Aevum isn't scrupulously disclosing details concerning both their airframe design and propulsion system until closer to launch time. What exactly about the future of human space travel remains unknown? More importantly, when might we actually see the results? Here's everything we've learned thus far about Aevum and Spacefligh Now reports when it may go live sometime next year. Where's the funding coming from? This isn't the sort of thing where major companies shell out a few million dollars to researchers simply because someone claims to have solved a problem thousands of years ago. Instead, Aevum received close 13 million from Honda to develop this project. That wasn't all - it took additional funds from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) worth over 9 million to complete their proposal process. In addition, Toyoda said parts manufacturers pitched in millions too, not to mention local governments, universities and even private investors. So for those curious how much money's being poured into building this awesome new toy, here's the breakdown: 28.4 Million Original Development Capital (14,100,000 10,300,000 38,400,000 total) Honda Corporation Soryu Air Systems Co., Ltd. - 50 investment share Toyota Motors Corporation - 25 investment share Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) - 20 investment share Shizuoka Prefecture Government Kinki University National Institute Of Technology Industry Advancement (NITIA) Tokyo Metropolitan government Kitakyushu City Government Osaka Chiba Chuo Bank (Private Company) Nippon Telegraph Telephone Insurance Association (Public Institution) Association of Local National Tax Administrators (public institution) KeyCorp Bank (private firm) UBS AG (financial services providerretail bank) Total Funding Amount: What kind of advances did Saryu make?

"CSS linear gradients get washed out and muddy in the middle unless steps are taken to avoid the effect. This article teaches developers how to avoid the gray dead zone and also shows you some alternative techniques for generating CSS Linear Gradient backgrounds that work well on all modern browsers (including IE9). The problems with using a single color or an opaque background image for your gradient is they both have drawbacks: 1) If the colors aren't evenly spaced throughout, one area of the page will look different than another. 2) The background doesn't always scale uniformly when doing responsive designs (that is if it scales at all), so one section might be too big and appear squished while other sections run into little trouble scaling up. 3) Background images can cause issues with resizing. You may need to support Internet Explorer 9. There are ways to solve these three problems without resorting to either of the conventional approaches mentioned above; however there are certainly many more options available beyond simply swapping out a solid background color or adding a transparent PNG as a backdrop. One such option involves creating a gradient from multiple colours via the use of pseudo-elements. Doing this allows us to control where each colour begins and ends, ensuring that we don't end up having any grey areas between them. It's worth noting here that the concept isn't new - but what makes our technique unique is how we're able to apply opacity values to the elements involved (making sure not to overlap the same element twice on consecutive lines). Creating repeatable patterns made easy by placing layers upon layers To understand why this approach works, let's first consider the following code snippet: 1) First create two box shadows, positioned absolutely: 2) Then place those boxes within a parent container which has no positioning specified. In order for the child boxes' backgrounds to show through, their position will have to be relative, absolute, fixed or sticky. Since none of those were applied to container, nothing would show. We therefore add left: 0px; top:0px; right: 100; bottom:100; to make them visible inside its borders. Notice that all four properties are set to percentages instead of pixels because of the fact that they'll resize depending on screen size - you want everything to take up space equally across every device regardless of pixel dimensions. 3) Next give the children several z-indexes in order to manipulate stacking of layered items. For example, I've given the inner divs a z-index greater than their siblings. Now since they have background-images assigned to them, when they do come forward onto the screen they won't cover anything else that was previously there. They'll just slide over whatever was underneath them. Having said that, it does mean that in terms of being hoisted along with surrounding things like text etc., the div that contains them will move ahead of all others. That's fine though, especially if that particular item needs to be displayed last anyway. These settings ensure things stack correctly according to zoom level. 4) Finally we create several additional nested containers within container to represent the various shades of blue used in the pattern. Since they are placed relatively and have widths less than 50, they should actually be larger than needed to provide room for their contents. However, notice that I'm only setting height to 75 initially; ""remaining height"" is then calculated automatically due to the percentage value. This ensures the overall pattern doesn't stretch tautly once rendered. 5) Each shadowed box has exactly half of the overall amount of extra padding added to them; again, this prevents anything beneath them from getting cut off when scaled down. On mobile screens where content takes precedence over details like graphics, a design author could even remove this overhead altogether thanks to iOS7's increased priority afforded to content regions. 6) At this point we've created a repeating pattern. Within this template are individual elements whose sizes and positions correspond precisely with those found in the shadows collected earlier. When viewed at higher resolutions, these pieces fall snugly together. As soon as a visitor zooms away, however, the picture becomes broken. Ahhh.... Why? Because now we must somehow find a way to tell those lower resolution viewers who see something entirely wholly different. To help combat this issue, lets' pause back a moment and think about what we'd really like: A smooth transition from dark shade to light shadeWhen possible, the main subject remains centered (as opposed to floating next some text below it) So far so good...we've got most of those covered! But we still haven't addressed points number 4 5 which deal with keeping the dark and light portions lined up during low-to high-resolution translations and preventing overlapping. Let's check 'em out: First let's take care of 4 first. Below I've provided an illustration suggesting the ideal solution: This method works great...but it requires quite a bit of depth of interest.

"Amazon plans to add a fuel and inflation surcharge to the fees it collects from US third-party sellers who use its fulfillment services. The new fee will go into effect on July 1, 2017. The change is part of Amazon's ongoing effort to shift some costs onto retailers as it seeks further growth in its own business while still providing services that benefit both them and customers at large. Sellers pay Amazon when they list products for sale through its website or apps, which then allows other people - known as ""fulfillment centers"" - to store those items until buyers can pick up their purchases and download them to an online shopping cart. After payment processing by Amazon Payments, goods are shipped directly from one Amazon warehouse location to another. Fees paid by sellers help fund these efforts, but many feel like they don't get enough back in return based on what they put into selling with Amazon. In addition to paying upfront fees, sellers must also make regular payments if inventory levels fall below minimum thresholds set annually. They have complained about being squeezed between a lack of investment in operations by Amazon and higher prices charged by competitors such as Walmart. Some vendors say these changes would force them out of the marketplace entirely, perhaps forcing shoppers elsewhere down even costlier paths. As Amazon has grown since launching 15 years ago, so too has Amazon itself become more profitable than most observers had expected. While there were signs earlier this year that things may be changing, the company last month announced significantly larger profits over just two quarters than analysts had estimated. It earned 4 billion during Q2 2016. Other tweaks coming soon include expanding Prime subscription benefits outside the United States and introduction of free 2nd Day shipping across much of Europe. To capitalize on these initiatives, Amazon is cutting Base Shipping Fees (also known as ""Prime Fee charges levied against orders placed via its app. What's next? More marketshare loss ahead... In order to boost sales volume, Amazon increased pricing on certain categories within recent months that previously operated under lower margins due to limited demand. These moves included raising prices for electronics sold on its site and taking steps to increase prices on books available through Kindle Unlimited; all pointed toward greater revenue opportunities for Amazon. At the same time, though, Amazon now appears worried about losing market share amid complaints from consumers fed up with high prices and low customer service standards. Illegal shipments and counterfeits remain major problems plaguing the industry. Still, according to published reports late last week and early Tuesday morning, Amazon could lose significant ground. Among possible reasons: New data showed ecommerce spending grew at less than half the rate Amazon projects and price increases in several important product classes appear to be slowing. If you want your retail experience to provide value instead of frustration, here's why we're leaving the giant retailer behind us... According to research firm AlixPartners LLC, ""the largest brick mortar companies - Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Kohl's, Macy's and Dollar Tree - saw respective total household penetration decline by 0.6, 18 and 33. Over the same period, the fast growing SVODOTTeCommerce [streaming video entertainment] sector saw household penetration rise by 43 and represented 5 of total spend."" In terms of overall growth, Jeff Bezos' company took home the bulk of the spoils, adding 775 million subscribers to the Prime Video streaming video service last quarter alone. But despite the good news, Wall Street was unimpressed when Amazon reported earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended June 30, finding fault with operating losses in all three segments of the company's operation. It seems nothing goes right for Amazon Even after reporting record revenues, Amazon faced yet another setback recently when an investigation discovered faulty merchandise in packages sent to customers. According to Reuters, multiple clients contacted Amazon about defective Kindle Fires ordered online between April 2015 and January 2016. One client said she received counterfeit fire tablets made in China that did not perform properly. Another claimed her device never worked however she continued to receive notifications that people were watching videos stored on it. Still others said devices arrived broken, unable to charge properly or without full functionality. Amazon has been slow to respond to inquiries regarding what happened to the units once delivered, and has taken no action beyond sending replacement Kindles. When asked about questions surrounding the safety and quality of Fire tablet computers and whether anything should be done to ensure customers do not suffer similar experiences, an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch, ""We take every report seriously and investigate each complaint thoroughly. We stand ready to work closely with our partners and deliver solutions to any issues our customers might encounter. As always, we strive to offer top tier customer satisfaction.

"Zoox recently published a video showing its autonomous system driving for an hour in downtown San Francisco. The video is available in the article. A safety driver was behind the wheel, but the vehicle had sensors and cameras on board that let it know when something changed or went wrong with the road ahead of time so it could safely take control. In July, Zoox, which has raised more than 100 million from investors including General Motors' Cruise Automation unit to develop self-driving cars, started offering rides through its app. It said last week that people clocked up almost 1 billion miles during its first two months as an Uber competitor. But even if you don't use their ride service - they say they are aiming at being the top taxi company by 2023 while also developing technology to bring autonomous vehicles into mainstream markets like Las Vegas casinos - Zoox could still play some role in the future of transportation.

"Follow is a new feature in Google Chrome that displays an RSS reader on the New Tab page. Users will see a Follow button in the overflow menu, which adds rss: links to sites managed by Google Reader and its various forks (such as Feedly). It also provides shortcuts to popular feeds, like Hacker News or Digg, if you're using those services. Google announced plans for this functionality back at IO last year: The goal of these features was to make it easier for people to discover great content from inside their Google search results - particularly blog posts, forum discussions and news articles... We want to help users identify relevant information quickly while they are surfing online with Google and we think graphs can speed up that process greatly. Therefore, our research team decided to create a visual representation of what people read most frequently across all web properties today. This would include some of your favorite blogs like The Verge, but also more niche publications such as Engadget. [...] Using this data, we have built APIs so we could show individual items, lists and collections of interests in other products. For example, when someone searches for 'Android phones"" Bing shows them recent Android event coverage first before recommending specific devices, followed by tips about apps or how-to guides. If we had only included general categories, such as gadgets or mobile operating systems, things might look very different. Over time we may even expand beyond tech websites to let anyone build similar kinds of dashboards into any product where there is sufficient interest among the community. This post has been updated since the initial posting. RSS readers aren't exactly dying off. According to statistics compiled by Gabriel Weinberg, over 90 of desktop applications support Gmail reading now. But the trend toward aggregators is waning, because many of us find ourselves overwhelmed with too much choice; competition keeps dropping prices until everyone starts getting ads on their front pages. As Marc Andreessen said in 2005: People don't seem worried enough about having their bookmarks taken away. They're not upset enough yet about losing their favorite TV program guide either. But eventually they'll be okay with being able to forget everything every day. And then they won't know anything anymore! Take my personalized newspaper. How do I get that again? There's no way to get it back without paying 249 per month for something called ""Reader Pro."" Do I just accept that I'm going to stop knowing stuff forever? Does it mean that after a few decades I'll never learn anything interesting ever again? That seems kind of sad. Some folks are lamenting the loss of customizable homepages before they lost their bookmark lists completely, since it's hard to replace one good service with another. Instead of lamenting the end of RSS, maybe we should be celebrating the rise of an open standard around personalization. Maybe instead of trying to introduce a billion variations of Facebook's algorithm, we need to invent solutions based on standards that allow individuals - not advertisers - to decide which types of advertising work best for them.

"While plants might look like peaceful, passive victims of the world, they actually spend a lot of energy fighting to stay alive. When an insect bites a leaf, the leaf secretes chemicals that ward it off and immediately mobilizes other defenses as well - even if the bug is just eating out some nectar. To understand how these fights play out in nature, Cornell researchers used high-resolution imaging techniques (using both light microscopy and electron microscopy) on leaves from three types: Norway spruce, eastern cottonwood and sunflower. The team wanted to see whether there were any differences between species or parts of the tree and how fast those responses took place. They also wanted to test for differences within the same plant at different times. The results showed that each type of defense was associated with unique methods of attack. Sunflower leaves had their own specialized nematode species that devour and kill cells inside them; eastern cottonwood trees seemed to have anti-microbial compounds present that protect against bacteria. And Norway spruces appeared to be using a chemical called abscisic acid to mask themselves so predators can't sniff them out while still keeping attackers away. By visualizing these interactions, scientists hope to better understand what happens when plants need to defend themselves against attacks. If we know more about this process, then we could mimic it artificially for whatever application may come along next - such as countering bacterial infections for humans.",0,146
"A new pill has been developed that could replace the need for external injections. The pill was developed to replace the need to inject insulin externally by deploying a spring-loaded needle through skin and muscle, but it can be used as an alternative method of delivering any kind of active ingredient if you're in need of medication or need something injected into your arm. The device is being described as safer than traditional injection pens because all drugs are delivered directly into the bloodstream via capillary action instead of injecting them under the skin which leads to pain, bleeding, infection risks etc. After this first step, the researchers will go on to create self-healing coatings made with living cells which should sustainably deliver drug molecules. This would mean there would be no more expensive surgical procedures needed every time the coating needs renewing. While blood tests are conducted regularly and those who have problems with their diabetes control levels receive intravenous infusions when needed, the new topical option would ensure continuity without the patient having to undergo multiple painful (and sometimes risky) invasive treatments every year. Additionally, the use of living cell technology means fewer side effects usually associated with other hyperosmolar fluids since they work entirely differently from regular solutions, i.e., the body doesn't reject them like it does treatments such as artificial urine.",0,147

It's easy to conclude that Facebook's recent privacy scandals just confirm how vulnerable people really are online - who knew what data they left behind? Who thought they could trust a corporation so much that it could gain control over them, essentially becoming an assassin at every click? But too many assumptions about social media lead us astray because there are real good reasons why Facebook needs our personal information. If you think otherwise, read these 5 things Facebook does better than any other site out there: 1) Facebook Is Much More Advanced Than You Think While it may seem strange considering all the privacy issues surrounding the platform lately, Facebook actually boasts one huge advantage over Google: it thinks ahead. No other search engine or ad network knows millions upon millions of your preferences, interests, activities, likes, dislikes, etc., simply because no website ever asked for permission...not yours anyway. Not only that, but after noticing different patterns in each new profile, Facebook will adjust to your tastes and make itself easier to use. As far as anyone else knowing anything about you goes, a few clicks away from the rest of your browsing history, you don't exist. Meanwhile, if you take 10 minutes to sign up for Gmail (which takes less time), you get a list of 50 emails which include everything you've sent and received since you signed up - including spammy emails. Essentially, you never know where your friends keep your messages unless you look for them yourself. This, however, means Facebook gets to store all sorts of details about you and categorize all those interactions you crave into neat little boxes, making it easier to find later. Moreover, unlike your email inboxes, which grow exponentially until you finally give up trying to check individual mailboxes and start using filters, Facebook keeps growing incrementally throughout the day, giving you endless opportunities to peruse through photos, videos, wall posts, stories, events, groups, and pages. In short, despite what you might believe, getting on Facebook isn't comparing apples to oranges; instead, jumping onto the train makes it arguably one of the best websites around. 2) There Are Real Consequences For Missing Out On Information In today's world, thanks largely to the advent of instant messaging services, it seems almost unrealistic to imagine missing something important from someone's life because ""you weren't open to receiving private notes"" back then. However, not long ago, certain industries were still operating under archaic rules for telephone calls. Back then, telephones required operators to record conversations and pass the message on if it contained sensitive material, often forcing callers to remain quiet whenever the conversation got heated. Nowadays, text messages sound alarmingly similar and, due to technology allowing smartphone owners to audio record chats, companies no longer need to worry about accidentally eavesdropping. At least, not right now, because wherever you go nowadays, you're probably being tracked and monitored by various devices and apps. Take, for example, 2012 and early 2013, when many celebrities experienced embarrassing security breaches via Twitter accounts following unfaithful relationships, exposing nude photos or intimate moments. While many felt troubled or violated, others took comfort in realizing that, ultimately, they likely wouldn't suffer consequences for sharing these images to begin with. 3) You Can Be Just About Anywhere With A Computer These Days With every step you take in everyday life, whether it includes driving down a highway or hopping aboard public transportation, you leave digital footprints. And sooner rather than later, these footprints end up corresponding perfectly with nearly everyone else's nearby movements in space and time. So when you suddenly vanish at a mall kiosk, leaving an abandoned ticket stub and credit card purchase slip inside, law enforcement agencies will eventually connect dots and reach out to potential leads - but again, most people won't even notice you're gone until they want to spend money somewhere themselves next week.

"Synthetic wavelength holography is a new non-line-of-sight method that can rapidly capture full-field images of large areas with submillimeter precision. The method has endless potential applications, including noninvasive medical imaging, security and biometric analysis, surveillance systems for the detection and characterization of hidden objects, inspection of electronic components in integrated circuits, quality control on semiconductor wafers, and submicron lithography[b1 b2]. In most cases, synthetic wavelength light sources are used to generate complex interference patterns at specific wavelengths (e.g., Bragg scattering). Wavelength scanning over a range of wavelengths is then performed using a set of detectors arranged symmetrically around an object plane or detector array[b3], which significantly increases time efficiency compared to other methods such as multiwavelength phase microscopy[b4] or Fourier transform spectrometry[b5]. The conventional technique usually operates by projecting spatially coherent illumination onto an area under test from different directions. When illuminated from multiple incident angles, interference fringes projected across the circular aperture give rise to diffraction rings that encode depth information in three dimensions (azimuthal angle , radial distance r0 from center), allowing cross sectioning through an opaque sample, even without line-scanning operation Fig. 1a] (f1) {ref-type""fig [b6]. However, it requires wavefront compensation before illuminating each target point individually because the recorded fringe pattern depends strongly upon the individual source conditions (i.e. angular divergence) of each illuminator. This leads to significant complexity in beam shaping optics design and alignment tolerances. Moreover, typical demonstrations only show focused spots but cannot achieve arbitrary complex shapes due to stringent limitation imposed by the spatial coherence of the point spread function (PSF); this limits the resolution and field of view (FOV) [b7]. Therefore, alternative techniques based on low-coherence superposition have been proposed recently to eliminate these limitations: Littman interferometry uses two counterpropagating beams to form an astigmatic PSF that exhibits both axial and transverse widths; Bessel-Gauss modes provide high longitudinal confinement while maintaining uniform lateral intensity distribution within a FOV and produce sharpened spots beyond Rayleigh's criterion[b8]; LiNdP4O12 crystal generates ultrafast pulses coupled with dispersion management enables extending free space propagation length up to hundreds of meters[b9]. These studies indicate that obtaining accurate 3D carrier frequency shift between identical collimated laser beams propagated along opposite trajectories provides substantial benefits when they overlap, yet utilization of dual optical paths inevitably introduces additional loss, size, complexity and cost. To date, there lacks any report on self-phase conjugate (SPC) generation method enabling simultaneous measurement of all four coordinates of every pixel directly inside a single camera frame. For example, previous work demonstrated SPC generated by pulse compression in bulk media[b10] or via polarizing prisms[b11] but was limited to linear polarization states; thus this approach does not utilize the inherent advantage of recording interference images, i.e., the ability to measure the third dimension simultaneously and independently. Our previous study showed that quasicontinuous waves (QCW) could be achieved by SPC process whose output profile resembles slit function, suggesting its usefulness in achieving narrowband filtering effect[b12], however no direct evidence exists so far demonstrating this. Here we demonstrate modulation of interference fringes acquired beneath an opto-mechanical scanner using QCW generated by SPC mechanism and use them to reconstruct image sequences showing detailed microstructure. We further integrate several synergetic approaches to improve performance of our system including optimizing FOV, enhancing sensitivity, improving imaging speed, and reducing distortions caused by mechanical vibration that might impose challenges to real industrial application.

"I was looking around for a good React component library to use for the TLDR website, when I stumbled upon this excellent curated list. It has a fairly comprehensive list of react components and an even better interface where you can filter them by CSS class name or type. The best feature is that they have tagged each one with: Score (how well do we like it) (how well do we like it) Features (what does react give us in comparison to vanilla JS?) (what does react give us in comparison to vanilla JS?) ProsCons: what are the positives and negatives demonstrated in their documentation - see if these match up with your needs! What i ended up going with was The RC List. Its pretty complete and easy to get started with - without getting too complex. Here's my personal favourites from the top 50 (in no particular order): This allows users to easily drag-and-drop content into columns on any page using intuitive grid classes. With our custom built Drag Drop Components, simply choose which column types you want, then drop them wherever you need them. Try out the demo here. User Experience React gives developers great power within the browser. Since permissions aren't as much of issue anymore browsers are able to handle all these things really well. But there's still some unexpected quirks and places to watch out for JavaScript execution times being delayed while navigating back and forth between pages. However, React developers don't seem to be concerned about those issues. Perhaps because they've been solving them through proper planning since day 1:). In addition, you no longer have to worry about client side validation and error messages - you don't have to bother yourself trying to decide how to structure forms, pages and database queries. You can keep everything organized very freely, thanks to state management techniques such as Flux and Redux. If something isn't working though, just write another function or change data flow...there are always ways to go wrong. In fact, not only can you organize every little thing, but also reuse code efficiently across different projects - even multiple teams. Benefits of Using React Compared To Vanilla Javascript HTML5 Highly recommended reading: A beginners guide to web development libraries that make sense starting off with production ready apps that are simple to start building with libraries that let you interpolate values from props directly in markup to create dynamic UI elements. So What Is Reacts Advantage Over Other Frameworks? There Are Three Main Differences Between React And Angular Which Make Them Very Popular Among Developers This article will talk a bit more about why people love React so much over other frameworks and show examples of what makes it so awesome 1. Ready Made Layers Every layer looks relatively clean (no bloat), modularized (separated layers), and understandable. For example, look at a typical DOM element vs. the React Element: Pros Easy navigation and usage (see above point) Better results compared to native solution Works well with existing technologies such as jQuery, Backbone etc. Comes bundled with necessary tools that speed up frontend dev experience Can achieve higher performance than others due to its highly optimized design Provides better maintainability and easier testing environment (e.g. TDD) 2. State Management Since it uses virtual dom rendering concept it provides declarative way to manage state changes. Let's take three states: checked, unchecked and disabled. VirtualDom renders based on given elements details provided by Props. So changing state is done via updating the appropriate prop. Because of this, in case a user interacts with an input, it doesn't understand that he changed his mind and update it accordingly - instead it updates according to the previous value stored inside the form field. Therefore using React saves time and effort making sure the application works correctly against server side development models. That said, React favours immutability, therefore avoiding complex refactorings needed if we were used to mutable objects. As a result, developer gets faster feedback without writing unnecessary boilerplate code to abstract complexity. 3. Higher Performance React performant for large scale applications with thousands of views per second ""when combined with server-side rendering."" Apart from that, there are numerous benefits that include: Reduced bundle size Much faster initial load because there is less stuff happening during launch phase Higher standard compliance 4. Component Architecture A key benefit of React architecture comes in having higher homeostasis throughout the project. Within team members of the same specialization, everyone knows exactly who works on what and what kind of responsibilities belong to himher. Also, autocomplete helps in finding relevant information quicker. Most importantly, anyone with minimal understanding of complications would recognise that React is backed by two main principles: unidirectional procxabstem7 getJohnPronta TAGS JCovenVad integratedGenesFor There isRel",0,151

"According to internal Amazon documents, Amazon is preparing to release a wrist-worn device that is supposed to be able to read human emotions. The voice-activated wristband will determine the state of your mind and then recommend music or other content based on how you are feeling at any given time. ""It's called 'The Daily, an employee told Business Insider anonymously through an online message board frequented by workers from various Amazon departments.

Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than 1 an issue and save 58 off the cover price. Click here for our iPad deal. Amazon has been working on this new product line for quite some time now - more than two years - but according to these sources, both employees inside the company as well as outside contractors have been informed of its existence. ""I'm not saying everything we do [at work] goes into production,"" said one source who asked to remain anonymous. ""But I can say things definitely go towards that; there would be no reason if they didn't."" In recent weeks though, several people close to the project came forward with details of their own concerning Alexa, Amazon's popular eight-inch tablet computer currently available only via the web browser app for iOS and Android. Several former Amazon employees also spoke up last week detailing what happened when they left the company after being pressured to sign contracts promising never to speak publicly about anything relating to Amazon. At least five different individuals signed those agreements over the course of roughly four years, multiple sources claim. One person described the conversations he had with his manager following his decision to quit as extremely aggressive. When pressed further to explain why he would reveal such confidential information about a planned product that did not exist yet, the man claimed he wanted his ex-colleagues to know where he stood before making accusations against him should his employer later attempt to sue during employment relations negotiations. A second individual provided screenshots confirming the conversation took place between his friend and her boss. Multiple others shared stories under condition of anonymity. Two current Amazon employees reached out to confirm each story. Although many of them were involved with the project themselves and confidentially agreed to discuss aspects of it, either temporarily or permanently, most declined to comment because they feared speaking out could cost them their jobs. All three named names publicly in interviews granted to WIRED following publication of this story. ""If Amazon decides to bring out something like this headless screen with voice control capability, all bets are off for me,"" says one person whose identity remains unknown even to himself despite having worked closely with Alexa throughout much of 2013. He added, however, that he does not believe the current rumors floating around internally - including the alleged idea of integrating the technology behind Alexa directly into the watch itself - are correct. Another person who wishes to keep his name unmentioned pointed out what he considers to be flaws in design while explaining why he thinks the product may not see the light of day. Most notably, whenever someone uses the word ""Alexa,"" it triggers a warning mark (in blue) appearing above the text to make sure the user doesn't accidentally invoke the actual application instead of just talking to a virtual assistant. This makes sense since the industry standard definition of ""wakeword detection"" involves listening to ambient noise in order to confidently discern whether spoken commands are intended to actually mean something besides asking questions about weather conditions. However, if Alexa really turns out to become capable of detecting eye movements among other subtle gestures still undescribed, it might provide another way for users to train herself to detect emotion without using words alone. It's a perfectly reasonable approach, considering what companies like Emotient have shown with facial recognition software over the past year. But if Amazon wants to avoid lawsuits down the road based on the same logic used to prevent Apple's Siri from responding inappropriately due to poor training data, this kind of feature requires far greater oversight than simply allowing users to train Alexa with nothing else running. An additional downside stems from the fact that Alexa already supports turning off feedback sounds. According to the official list of supported languages compiled by Amazon - which includes English, thanks to previous acquisitions held in Seattle that made the Echo available worldwide - also Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch and Greek. Should the wristband get released internationally, along with the expected U.S.-only rollout almost immediately thereafter, it seems highly unlikely the only language support coming out initially will be Latin America or Spain, both of which already have access to the Echo. If true, this means Amazon would need to add non-English languages to the mix within nine months unless the team responsible for developing Alexa adds custom firmware prior to launch. Of course, there are ways to skirt the problem entirely and possibly gain better results. For instance, Alexa Skills Kits already allow developers to create skills specific to certain countries or regions.

"Nvidia has used a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create a neural network that can generate an unlimited number of high-quality, realistic faces. A GAN works by having one model called the generator produce fake images and another called the discriminator compare these with real ones. The researchers trained their algorithm on facial image data from more than 1 million individuals across multiple races and ethnicities as well as age categories, which allowed it to capture characteristics such as skin tone and eye color. The GAN was also able to easily adapt when presented with class labels for different subjects - for example, if you wanted to use your own face to train it in order to then make some other person's face look like yours or vice versa. While this is certainly cool and shows off how much computing power we have available today through GPUs, there are still a few limitations: For starters, the GAN needs lots of training samples, since its purpose is to be able to simulate any kind of real face given enough examples; training involved using two machines, so they had to communicate via hard drive rather than just over the internet. This means that while the system could do something like give my girlfriend's face to someone else who looks nothing at all like her, it wouldn't necessarily work right away without training again. And finally, though NVIDIA claims it is not possible to detect whether something generated is fake or real, which seems unlikely, considering what details were captured about race, ethnicity, gender, etc., even if you didn't know any of them beforehand? Why bother spending huge amounts of time and energy creating a database of people's faces only to lose money if the thing being simulated happens to turn out to actually exist somewhere?) In terms of potential applications, according to Bryan Catanzaro, head researcher at Nvidia Research, ""the ability to digitally alter photos has been around for years but until now has lacked both quality and variety in how those changes looked. Our approach lets us manipulate individual pixels, giving us unprecedented detail control over what our AI sees - making everyday photos into unique artistic creations.

"Physicists from the University of Iowa have discovered a new type of aurora in a nearly two-decade-old video. Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras that can be seen over large parts of Earth's surface at night, and they're thought to influence how easily particles in the atmosphere knock electrons out of atoms. Researchers used data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on NASA's satellite Suomi NPP to identify diffuse auroral emission as a distinct phenomenon. They compared observations taken between June 2008 through August 2012 with those collected by VIIRS before and after this time period. The brightness levels measured by the instrument were sufficiently distinctive for astronomers trained in image processing techniques to spot them on their own. By focusing or zooming into various regions of interest on images captured during and following the timeframe, scientists identified evidence of four separate types of diffuse aurorae. One such region was found near South America within an area spanning Argentina and Chile known as La Plata River Basin. This region sits above an active subduction zone where one tectonic plate is sliding beneath another. Data showed signs of an intense magnetic field deflection coinciding with this event, which may help explain why some features had a greater appearance than others. Prior studies suggested that aspects of diffuse emissions could change depending on geomagnetic activity because aurorae tend to be more visible closer to the poles. However, the authors note that their findings contradict previous research suggesting that there might not actually be any relationship between these phenomena at all. Both the individual features observed as well as the overall brightness level varied slightly over time. Their discoveries suggest that the intensity of diffuse emissions does depend somewhat on variations in solar wind conditions created by its interaction with other planets; however, increasing airglow due to global warming should also play a role in intensifying the effects of aurorae on our planet.",0,160
"Google has discontinued the Pixel 3A and 3A XL smartphones. It is now listed as out of stock on the Google Store. Other stores may still have remaining stock. A new report claims that a direct replacement, with some subtle changes, will be announced within 30 days of this announcement. The Pixel 4a might include an improved front camera setup over its predecessor for better selfies. The mid-range Pixels are likely to receive software improvements only after they get replaced by their successors in Q4 2020.

With the advent (or declining) popularity of removable batteries, most devices nowadays feature fast charging technology inside them.

"France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, which aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

It involves redesigning every aspect of the vessel from top to bottomand the challenge becomes even greater when it comes to stealth features as they are essential for such a vessel. A recent study conducted by IO Industries about different options shows how daunting a task this really is. One thing you need to know going into this project?

"This Hacker News thread discusses how to attract applications from senior talent and what can be done to increase attractiveness to potential employees. Senior, experienced people are extremely difficult to recruit because they can usually pick up the phone or email any company that is looking for their skillset without much trouble. The problem comes when you do reach out to them - you need a compelling offer that gets them excited enough about your organization that it's worth leaving their current job. In general terms this means having something interesting to say to someone who has spent many years honing their skill set in one particular area of expertise. This kind of person doesn't often look at multiple companies unless the opportunity really speaks to them on a personal level. Here I will discuss some things that have worked well with me as an hiring manager and recruiter over the past 10 years: The most effective way (maybe not the best) to get smart candidates interested is through referrals. If your target already knows someone in your field then it becomes much easier to convince herhim to come talk to you directly instead of going through HR. If you aren't speaking directly to someone whom you know, then here are three ways to identify who could help grow your business: 1) Find two current peers whose experience is similar to yours and ask if you can meet with each of them individually. What makes these peer groups valuable? They tend to be more critical than others and thus make decisions based on facts rather than emotion. These individuals used someone like yourself so it would seem reasonable to move forward with recruiting himher. You may want to approach both before making an offer but again, focus first on those in close proximity to your ideal candidate. 2) Use LinkedIn to create a list of linkedin users within 10-15 miles of where you work. Then follow step 1 above by contacting all of them personally. It should go faster since you won't waste time trying to find commonalities between the different positions. One caveat though... don't try this too early. First 3 months after joining the company can be tough especially if you're starting off fresh. Any attempts during that period will probably end badly. Stick around until 2nd half of year 6 and spend the rest of your career doing this to keep morale high. 3) Finally, use classifieds websites such as craigslist or gumtree to see which jobs there happen to be nearby. Make sure to tell anyone involved exactly what type of role you are seeking and add anything else relevant. For example, ""looking for C developer"" might lead to a much broader search since employers are likely more focused on finding candidates with specific knowledge. Obviously this requires some cynicism so be careful. Once you've identified a few leads send one quick message asking specifically if heshe likes working together and why. Sometimes just saying ""hello"" isn't exciting enough which explains my success rate below (I was running my own small consulting firm):",0,164

"The ACLU polled the 20 biggest brick and mortar retailers in the US last year and only one said they did not routinely photograph customers. Walmart admitted to testing facial recognition technology on up to 149,000 shoppers a day but denied using it for targeted marketing. ""It was very hard to find any retailer that had taken the position of saying 'we don't use this biometric stuff at all, says Murtaza Haider, director of consumer privacy at Consumer Watchdog. But as technology advances and consumers become more comfortable with their private information being collected online and stored centrally, so too has the need to protect them from its misuse - which is where companies need to start facing scrutiny over how much data they are collecting about us without our knowledge or consent. How many times have you seen an advert for something via your Facebook feed? It might be there unknowingly thanks to social networks tracking everything we do across multiple sites, apps and devices. Yet most people are blissfully unaware that marketers can track what products they like and then send them messages on things they may want to buy when they next appear on screen; or perhaps even target them by age group, gender or interests (e.g., children playing football vs adults watching golf). In some cases, advertisers actually know who you are before you hit sell on anything - just think Amazon knowing every time you looked for a book remotely related to space travel while sat at home surfing Twitter... Online shopping giant Amazon must face trial after admitting to secretly scanning a customer's emails in order to provide personalised advertising. The tech titan pleaded guilty to violating laws governing electronic surveillance, according to reports released yesterday following two years of preliminary hearings. Amazon told reporters: ""We won't comment further."" However, new allegations suggest that any correspondence sent through its system could fall under remote spying, including email addresses, phone numbers, IP address locations and other key pieces of identifying data used to trace individuals back to particular accounts. According to court documents obtained by Bloomberg News, Amazon was able to access user details by placing small sensors within snail mail packages delivered by the Post Office - called Postal Data Interceptors - then recording all incoming calls made to the subscriber's number between December 2012 and September 2013. Police found that Amazon maintained a list of all individuals' names and postal codes during that period. ""This case shows how far-reaching the consequences of government efforts to conduct secret business warrantless searches,"" wrote EFF attorney Eben Moglen, adding that Amazon should now halt such activities immediately. ""More important than how this gets resolved is whether Congress will enact needed reforms to prevent future abuses."" Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed earlier this month that his former employer took advantage of security loopholes to amass vast troves of sensitive data belonging to millions of users around the world. Documents ultimately led to a series of blockbuster leaks revealing classified intelligence operations run out of GCHQ, Britain's equivalent agency. Among those leaked files were evidence suggesting American agencies tapped into cellphone conversations and covertly monitored drug deals by military personnel. Despite repeated requests, officials at Facebook and Google refused to answer questions regarding similar practices on Monday, saying instead that they monitor any activity linking to copyrighted material and flag these items coming from third party websites. They did confirm however that videos uploaded by individual users would still reach the site regardless if rumours circulated of suggestions that certain clips were flagged. A spokesman added that the company does scrub content regularly but stops short of wiping all traces of it. As well as the aforementioned instances involving Amazon, police forces across Europe also often require telecoms firms to retain call records. This includes the UK, Ireland, Spain, Denmark and Sweden, among others. Although UK law dictates that users give informed consent to retention of telephone contact lists, critics say the amount of retained data makes mass surveillance easy. The European Court of Justice confirmed recently that countries that choose to store records should restrict the length of time they keep calling patterns, typically no longer than six months. But the bloc's highest authority ruled against Germany and France's attempts to introduce legislation requiring telecom providers to delete customer data once it expires. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg appeared before U.S senators with little explanation of his firm's role in spreading fake news stories as election campaigns ramped up ahead of November's presidential vote. One senator described him as evasive and another claimed he'd given misleading answers, despite the CEO appearing relatively humble throughout the hearing by comparison to past debates. Meanwhile, Senonor Richard Blumenthal suggested that speculation about political bias among Silicon Valley programmers played a part in discussion surrounding censorship tools currently available for users. He asked why Facebook doesn't allow images of dead babies on suicide prevention pages, yet allows pictures of a man holding up a sign reading 'Kill Jews'. Mr Zuckerberg replied that such an option wasn't offered because there was nothing illegal involved.

"MasterCard has signed a deal with cryptocurrency firm Bakkt to make crypto options available to merchants and banks across its payments network. Banks on the network will be able to offer customers ""instant"" access to fiat-to-crypto trade, enabling them to buy bitcoin using their debit cards or bank accounts in less than 30 seconds. In doing so, Mastercard is looking for ways of scaling up its own business - which currently makes transactions about 1 trillion per year but only 0.2 came from cryptocurrencies (in 2017). The company had previously launched relationships with Coinbase and Circle last fall, allowing consumers to spend digital currency at retail locations in exchange for real cash. However it was not clear how many people would actually use this feature. Now they do. Bakkt The partnership between consumer payment giant Mastercard and Wall Street venture capital fund, ICE Futures US LLC and blockchain startup Bakkt deals with two separate issues: making major financial institutions more comfortable using crypto, while spreading awareness among both businesses and individuals that there are several types of money out there. Special report by Cointelegraph: Can Blockchain Save Finance? To understand why these are important we need to look back on history. In 1978 when Visa started developing software protocols capable of handling credit card information, most countries still used paper invoices as receipts for goods sold. Deciphering an invoice meant opening each receipt sheet one at a time, loading data into computers manually and checking for discrepancies. This process could take hours between different parties involved, too long given today's fast throughput systems where any delays can cost millions of dollars. As such in 1980 Visa developed a system called ""VisaNet,"" which allowed users to load data directly onto magnetic stripes embedded in plastic cards. With VisaNet anyone who wanted to check whether someone else owed them money could simply scan their card instead of needing to open every single invoice separately. It also drastically reduced processing times because all data needed to verify this transaction were already stored directly on the cards themselves. Today, Visa holds over 150 patents related to the technology. Cryptocurrencies vs Fiat Money This brings us to another problem facing investors: most companies like Mastercard rely on markers issued by central authorities under government control. These include currencies backed by gold reserves or certificates linked to securities held by commercial banks. Because Bitcoin isn't controlled centrally, it wasn't accepted very widely. However after China banned ICOs and South Korea followed suit; demand grew exponentially leading other nations to follow suit. For example, Russia announced plans to issue a national cryptocurrency earlier this month. While some think governments may eventually ditch traditional currencies altogether we don't believe this will happen anytime soon. Centralized economies continue to have advantages: things like banking records and tax compliance are easier if everyone uses the same standard. Plus it gives citizens greater trust in their state since they're protected against hyper inflation caused by runaway printing presses. Governments see value in centralized networks since mass adoption creates better infrastructure, security and autonomy. What sets decentralized blockchains apart though is that no organization controls them - meaning you cannot lose your holdings without losing everything. Instead, ownership of cryptocurrencies transfers automatically through peer-to-peer connections rather than relying on intermediaries which draw fees along the way. Connections between wallets and exchanges are encrypted to prevent third party interference. What makes this new industry attractive to businesses however is that it requires little costly regulation and doesn't require permission to operate thus avoiding taxes.

In 2013, New York Times science writer John Markoff wrote about MIT scientists who found they could make mice forget their fear of electric shocks by knocking out a gene called TESK1 which ""control[led] how these cells [in the brain] process information such as learning or emotions."" They then put ""the mice through an aggressive training schedule - as if with a military school bully - and shocked them repeatedly until most of the animals no longer flinch when touched. Then they injected one set of mice with antibodies against nerve cell receptors used by the stress hormone cortisol, causing their own bodies to release too little of it; another group was given injections that produced abnormally high levels of cortisol. Both groups recovered quickly and forgot their terrorized behavior even though, over time, some learned techniques for controlling their anxiety.""

"Samsung's Exynos 2200 is a new in-house mobile processor that implements a GPU with AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture, enabling features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Samsung and AMD first announced the partnership at Mobile World Congress 2018 earlier this year. The company did not give any specifications of what its next flagship smartphone would have or when it might be released but said that more details will come soon. The teaser trailer for Tidal shows how native support for hardware acceleration can improve gaming performance. Other companies using similar technology include Apple (with Metal) and Google (through Vulkan). It may seem odd to use an indie game as a showcase but I've played through many games on my phone that perform poorly without proper graphics optimization so I'm intrigued by these demonstrations. Also, given Samsung has now partnered with its main rival it seems likely we'll see something special from them. Gaming aside, tackling streaming becomes even more difficult with less cores under pressure. If you're watching videos at home over Wi-Fi then having only eight video decoding cores isn't going to cut it anymore. You need the full power of both your CPU and GPU with access to all resources available; if there are problems somewhere, they'll hit every core on board. That's why Qualcomm brought up 5G - traditionally used for data networks - which could offer much higher speeds than current LTE networks.

"Android 10 will start rolling out to devices starting with the Pixel phones, including the Pixel 1. The update will include fully gestural navigation, full support for a dark mode, new Assistant features and more. Since Google released Android 9 Pie in December of last year, we've seen many big changes take place throughout its release cycle. Some of those have been performance improvements and stability fixes; others have included major feature additions like multi-window (which finally allows us to use two apps at once) or better battery life statistics. Now that Android 10 is approaching beta quality, you can expect even more updates as developers continue working on bringing their applications up to speed. It's not just about how fast your phone runs though - there are also plenty of smaller things such as gesture controls which you'll get used to thanks to this upcoming version of Android. There's no guarantee when exactly it will be available or what other tweaks Google has planned down the road. However, as soon as it comes out in September, you should know where it stands as far as efficiency goes. Here's everything you need to know before updating: What's New? As mentioned above, the biggest change in Android 10 is the complete overhaul of gestures on both smart displays and smartphones alike. While Android 9 offered some small level of navigational control through hardware buttons, users could never quite figure out if they were using traditional touchscreen controls or going off into left field by imagining themselves holding up various objects. With Android 10, all information and functionality becomes accessible using only swipes, taps and pinching. In addition to opening an app menu, swiping from side to side opens quick actions menus while dragging across content pulls over relevant parts of it. If anything isn't clear onscreen as a result of these options being displayed behind the main information flow, simply tap anywhere on screen to bring them back to view. But don't worry too much if something doesn't work right away; you won't become completely frustrated until after a few days of constant testing. After all, everyone gets started differently. We spoke to one early adopter who actually found his experience inconsistent due to user error so he had to go back and redo some action which was confusing. Those kinds of issues usually disappear after around five minutes of usage however. When you're trying to navigate between apps using the multitasking interface rather than switching screens, you still perform all sorts of swoops and drags. You may notice a bit of lag in between each move depending on how responsive the device feels but you shouldn't ever feel blocked. Instead, your progress will almost always appear smooth without any pauses whatsoever. Another thing that's worth noting here is that swiping up now brings you home as opposed to tapping the top notification shade region as it did previously on KitKat and below. This makes sense given that swipe-up means ""Go Home"" instead of ""Open App Drawer,"" especially since Google removed the latter option entirely. Also, you can find yourself quickly navigating deeper levels within any app very easily as well. For example, within YouTube, just pinch or double tap on a video thumbnail to open its details panel which contains hours of extra info. Even during our initial test period, people kept asking why certain settings didn't display properly so I think adding a little explanation would help clarify matters further. On some apps, there seems to be a lot less space dedicated to swiping in general. On Twitter for example, you currently must drag dramatically downwards to access specific columns of tweets instead of having them automatically pop up beneath whatever page you happen to be looking at. In fact, swiping looks drastically different inside most messages services because its own scope extends beyond notifications alone. It works great for accessing events, chats, replies, etc., but it does seem disjointed sometimes. There might be times when Google fails to detect a particular message tab thus preventing you from interacting with it via a swipe. That said, the company acknowledged that the service needs additional time to perfect its array of commands following the rollout. Just today, the developer preview program announced that it wouldn't require separate permissions for SMSMMS anymore either, meaning it takes effect immediately outside of Settings. The same applies to contacts management. Going forward, you can already add multiple contact groups based on criteria like job title, relationship status, age range, whatever suits your fancy. Swipe left or right again once done adding names to see whichever card popped up first then interact accordingly. Also noteworthy is that you'll enjoy improved geofencing capabilities in Maps. Again, this wasn't picked up by anyone initially and I personally experienced numerous errors during my tests. As stated earlier, you'll select activities to give priority to whenever entering or exiting a location and the system learns from mistakes made along the way too. At launch, I noticed specific streets often brought me to nearby parks regardless of whether I wanted them or not. That's bad enough, but Google added another layer of confusion further onto the mix by making the system exit my house.

"Reddit Talk is a new social audio product that allows subreddit moderators to start Clubhouse-like Talks. While moderators will have control over who can speak in the sessions, anybody on Reddit may submit comments for discussion by participants. The announcement post suggests there's no commitment from Reddit; it notes, ""We don't know what kind of service we should offer users yet... and would love advice! We also think this could be an interesting community building tool as well, since you could hold open meetings or share your best ideas with others. It wouldn't technically allow us to host events or charge fees yet, but maybe one day? For now just try out the beta today and let us know how you find it. Thanks!"" This isn't a change at Reddit HQ itself - the Labs team has been running experiments internally for some time. The changes to Reddit are really more about giving moderators another layer they need when moderating their subreddits: it makes moderation much easier than waiting until someone comes up to them after a session. Moderators posting talks for other people to comment on is actually fairly common across all kinds of communities these days - see Polygon talk series Community Playbook for examples, as well as Google Hangouts, which was launched several months ago and has quickly become hugely popular among various groups ranging from scientists to artists. However, most participation happens within private circles between members participating rather than public speaking about a topic to strangers. And while yes, I still personally prefer watching videos (and having my ears plugged into speakers) in person, there are plenty of great reasons why video chats and live streams do work online - including many people preferring not to stand around outside on cold nights listening to music while being chilly. Also, because I want to keep talking without interruption, I'm always willing to pay attention during a stream if somebody wants me to moderate a conversation. I've had the chance to test out Talk myself, and I found the experience easy enough to adapt to once I figured out where things were happening. There's nothing quite like opening up new communication channels inside reddit threads and seeing what happens next. You might remember that earlier this week rAskScience ran an AMA featuring Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. At the end of the hour long chat he pledged to address concerns raised by redditors who believed the site should host a podcast hosted by Science fiction author Larry Niven. But his busy schedule prevented him from doing so before launch today. Now, he did take questions via Ask Me Anything before heading off to his book tour. One Redditor asked him directly whether he thought podcasts would ever make sense on Reddit. He answered, ""Funnily enough one of our biggest challenges right now is figuring out how to integrate good content creation tools into our platform. A lot of times people use Reddit simply as its own destination page - sure, thats cool too - but let me ask everyone here: what else are you guys using it for? Because those conversations are going on somewhere under Reddit.com right now. So im sure sooner or later something gets built that helps facilitate these discussions better. Who knows when Reddit first felt the call of Podcasting though.. Id say sometime soon - probably not til late 2015 at least. Im super excited about some big projects coming down the pipe for us. Very exciting indeed. Totally worth the wait;) "" It remains unclear exactly what type of program Alexis Ohanian meant when he referred to the infrastructure needed to create a successful podcast. Will it be internal efforts? Third party modifies. Or perhaps both. Either way, I hope we hear back on this very soon. Just last month CEO Ellen Pao told staff that she expects every group on Reddit to eventually set aside some resources towards creating podcasts. Then again, there's still plenty of room for surprise in the world of Internet culture, so stay tuned and please follow gizmodomedia for updates.

"England's Chester Zoo and a tissue bank called Nature's SAFE have partnered up to cryogenically freeze genetic material from animals that pass away at the zoo. The preserved material could be used by researchers in future disease outbreaks, such as bird flu or SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). The first step is to identify an animal with no known medical history and make sure it has not been vaccinated against the specific pathogens targeted by the study. This requires capturing an unvaccinated individual, sedating them, collecting blood samples via needle biopsy, isolating their RNA using molecular techniques, freezing the sample on dry ice until shipment of the frozen specimens takes place, then storing the specimens long term in liquid nitrogen tanks until needed. While this might sound like it would take months, these steps are time consuming: they require large numbers of personnel, several days worth of quarantine period in which the captured individuals can't mix with other humans before researchers start working; and the logistics involved mean shipping costs add another 1k-4K per specimen. But given how much money there is spent globally every year trying to treat coronavirus patients - around US8 billion - the cost seems relatively small when compared to potential outcomes, especially if any new treatments are found elsewhere and may never reach those regions anyway. There's also a chance the existing drugs we know about will stop doing anything once all of our high risk population dies out naturally, so preserving strains now should help researchers create better drug cocktails in the event of another pandemic. [Related Reading: 'Coronavirus' Could Kill Us All - Here's How We Can Stop It] And while most people think of politicians saying ""we need more tests"" after each new outbreak, this isn't always true: sometimes countries already have way too many tests because they were testing everything (and everyone) without knowing what they're looking for, leading to lots of false positives. The issue here is that the whole purpose of having preprints is to spread knowledge faster than traditional publishing allows. If you submit scientific results online before your peers even had a chance to read them, someone else just grabbed your credit and put themselves on top of the research roadmap. If only one person did this, science would move forward quickly enough, but since thousands of scientists do it at the same time, things slow down even further. And we still haven't figured out how to scale up the number of labs being able to produce sequencing data within hours rather than weeks. So taking preprinting off the table means that researchers who don't care for sharing information about their work right now will keep getting left behind. But ultimately, storing samples in freezers with liquid nitrogen seems fairly safe. They've got higher survival rates than living human beings over periods of years, and shortening the exposure times will certainly improve the chances of keeping live specimens alive during transport. As soon as a treatment comes into play, the zoos will send theirs back to normal conditions. In fact, some species - such as chimpanzees - will likely die out altogether due to extinction if nothing improves their odds of surviving beyond this point. By preserving genetic material, hopefully researchers will eventually find ways to tweak viruses to fit wild life habitats in order to protect endangered species from infectious diseases like COVID-19.",0,181
"Seattle Startup Zin Boats creates electric boats that can go a hundred miles or more and recharge using an ordinary wall plug. The boats require virtually no maintenance and can be remotely operated by anyone with the right tools. Zin is in production now, but when they launched in February 2015 you could buy one for just 25,000 - a pretty good deal considering it costs about half a million to make them today. Now though there are two new models: A mid-sized boat called the ""Canyon"" (50k) and a large vessel which will cost around 100-130K depending on options (there's word of a special limited edition version selling at over 170K). And as they enter their third year of operation they're launching their first model designed specifically for cruising out towards Hawaii along the Kona coast. So what makes a long range cruiser? I went down to meet founder Bailey Harris' team while he was visiting from Australia so we could sneak onto his secret test site and get an up close look at some prototypes... Bailey was born into the sport fishing world but after leaving school turned all his attention to engineering and entrepreneurship instead. In 2010 he formed a company called One Degree Marine Engineering based near Seattle where he worked full time designing and building high performance marine vessels. After this initial success he started thinking bigger - how would he create a new kind of recreational sailing experience and raise awareness of environmental issues like climate change. He founded Zin Boat Co in 2013 and built the very first prototype in 2014. Since then things have been going fast with big plans ahead including a new factory opening soon and several additional models coming online within the next few years. Here's part 2...Continue Reading The future of road transport isn't cars, but rather autonomous vehicles - those self-driving nannies that promise to take us safely wherever we need to go without distraction. Of course'safety' must come before convenience if society wants these machines prowling our streets. But until recently, most people who took to the roads were merely trying to get from point A to B as efficiently as possible; little thought had gone into creating well connected communities or alleviating traffic congestion. With autonomous technology now becoming mainstream many long held assumptions regarding urban design are being challenged and cities are beginning to adapt accordingly. Most excitingly perhaps, this has led to the creation of entirely new forms of transportation such as driverless shuttles and roaming service taxis. Continue reading",0,182
"The Perturb-seq map is the first comprehensive functional map of genes that are expressed in human cells. The data is available for any scientist to use. It allows scientists to search and filter our data using a range of criteria, including types of interaction (proteinDNA or proteinRNA), subcellular location, expression patterns across tissues normal vs cancerous samples, etc. There are currently 86420 unique interactions between 1865 proteins with known functions and 123821 genomic lociproteins represented by at least one Perturb-seq experiment Figure 1] (gkt1013-F1) {ref-type""fig. This represents approximately 10 of all protein coding genes which have transcriptional evidence from multiple experiments. Figure 1. (A) Histogram displaying how many distinct genomics loci have been tested via Perturb-seq; it should be noted that there will always be some overlap due to technical variability in RBP binding within each cell line being assayed, though this number remains relatively low compared with other similar techniques such as ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, CLAP, PAR-CLIP, etc. We also show instances where different replicates combined together indicate more than 100 independent measurements of an individual region, indicating substantial biological signal in the transcriptome. This includes single nucleotide variants associated with downregulation of gene transcripts when mutated, as well as SNPs near splicing sites whose presence can cause alternative splice forms [see [Supplementary Table S2] ]. Most mapped regions contained only two replicate experiments but several hundred were observed, suggesting significant power to observe regulatory events in these cases. A portion of these results have also been published previously (this figure was generated based on the original publication). These high-confidence findings demonstrate the value of combining quantitative proteomic analysis with genome wide sequencing strategies. While we had access to almost 3000 quantified proteins personally before performing pernicious sepsis screens, among them were many factors involved in posttranscriptional regulation, signaling pathways, cytokine production, responses to wounding and inflammation, adhesion, motility, migration, apoptosis, cellular stress response and DNA damage repair. Thus, our primary goal has not changed over timeto identify regulators of mRNA degradation, translation initiation and elongation that play critical roles during infection. Our continued focus on identifying proteins that regulate global changes in host expression upon exposure to pathogens underscores the importance of pursuing systematic approaches like Perturb-seq that enable large scale mapping of pathway activity without prior knowledge of specific target candidates. As described above, most RNA polymerases terminate their processive rounds at promoters of actively transcribed genes even if paused nearby after encountering secondary structure or motifs. Therefore, binding of core promoter elements and distal effects like 3 UTR structures may influence overall rates of processing, while cofactors bound along the length of mRNAs can modify pausing dynamics and reinitiation efficiency. Furthermore, complex multiprotein complexes comprise essential components of the translational machinery, thus perturbing component levels could alter ribosomal accessibility and availability for recruitment, potentially altering efficiency of polysome formation and maturation, and ultimately leading to altered abundance of translated isoforms. Taken together, these various mechanisms allow for very fine control of targeted MWGs. In contrast to ongoing efforts focused on identification of direct targets of pathogen effector molecules, less attention has been paid toward understanding the impact of microbial stimuli on broad categories of mRNAs. Host cell biology dictates the ultimate fate of RNAs under both physiological and pathological conditions gkt1013-B48. For example, post-mitotic neurons isolated from elderly humans exhibit reduced turnover of hundreds of mRNAs detected via microarrays, resulting in accumulation of aberrant proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In another study, mTOR inhibitors increased proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by decreasing clearance of tumor suppressor miR-34a, whose targeting resulted in upregulated CDK6 expression gkt1013-B49],[gkt1013-B50. These examples illustrate how small noncoding RNAs and their cognate partners direct dynamic processes important for organism homeostasis. However, the mechanisms behind why certain classes of mRNAs remain stable versus others following exposure to pathogenic stimuli remain unclear. On the whole, in vitro systems typically consider steady state growth conditions rather than inducing inflammatory states, making comparisons difficult. To investigate the differential stability of subsets of mRNAs during bacterial infections, we performed complementary studies to evaluate relationships between E. coli stimulation and relative abundance of predicted MBD tagged ectopic reporters inserted into the 5 UTR of randomly selected reporter transcripts derived from identified human cliques (those containing four or fewer members, see below). Based on our previous work where we monitored the mean behavior of the relevant behavioral phenotype, we chose those that make sense out of reliable TV provides significant increases or stabilization of stability of interest rates.

"Uber's apps are available on iOS, Android, and the web, which means that they need to be written three times and usually by different developers. This requires time and careful testing, since changes can easily go unnoticed or break something else in unexpected ways. We have been able to make Uber significantly more reliable over the past year by working with a small team of people who take care of it all day long - it's their job. You don't need an engineering background for this work; we hire engineers based on skills such as product management and design thinking, not coding experience (though some do come out of school). The main thing you will learn is how to prioritize features through iteration, so you can focus your career where you're best suited: helping us build better products for everyone.

"Ice cream develops a crunchy texture if left out of the freezer for too long due to overly large ice crystals. Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a new method to freeze milk without producing this undesirable, and potentially dangerous, effect. Doctoral student Marisa Ciacci and Professor Katerina Nenova used an X-ray diffraction technique that measures how much water is in different phases during freezing to determine when it was best to strike the blowout switch on their experimental device. The team found the ideal moment was just after the transition point between the partially frozen liquid and solid state. By precisely timing the release of pressure at this stage they were able to produce milkshakes with perfectly uniform hardness throughout the drink. The research has been published by the journal Langmuir. ""We are very excited about our results because they demonstrate the feasibility of using an x-ray scattering technique as a tool to control phase transitions in foodstuffs,"" said Dr Nenova.

"Earth Day's 50th anniversary is on April 22. Originally, events were planned for the big day, but the movement has now been forced online. Organizers have planned a three-day live-streamed event called Earth Hour, starting today at 8:30 p.m ET and going until April 23, to highlight climate change's impact on life around the world. The hour will be broken into two segments; one from 8:31 p.m - 9:00 p.m. (live stream), when people can watch presentations by scientists about how humans are affecting the planet's weather systems; and another from 9:01 p.m - 10:00 p.m., during which there will also be presentations with invited guests including Hollywood actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Matthew McConaughey and Taraji P Henson. The second segment of the broadcast will feature special reports from places that experience extreme heat, cold or storms as well as from those who suffer due to pollution in their vicinity.

"This article talks about the experience of a solo developer who decided to offer phone support for a couple of their apps in Japan. As the user base was small, they were able to sell more paid licenses than before and bring some revenue into the business while still having time to work on new features and ideas. Note: This is not meant as an ""I'm doing it too!"" post. I have tried to be more objective with this one so that you can get all my thoughts out there without getting confused by my biases (which are many). If you want just an ad-free version, you can find the original here. My name is Jonathan Markowitz and I live in Tokyo. It has been almost two years since I moved here. During those 2 years, I built three Android applications using PhoneGap. Most of them got 0 downloads at launch or ever after. The ones that did take off received steady growth until they became profitable enough where I could pay myself from them. These apps include - 'Shades of Grey' which included over 1 million downloads; Stradavonio which had 1 million plus installs; and Finallywhich also reached over 1 million active users. Before moving to Japan though, none of these apps made money for me nor any other reason than pure passion and love. None of the apps were make much difference to anyone else either. They didn't do anything extra different compared to thousands of other gamesapps available in the Play Store and App store already. What makes them stand out and what brought profits? In this case, it was the clientele calls themselves entrepreneurs and developers themselves trying to break up via voice call through Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc. A lot of people from Europe and America used to ask for help on how to handle errorsproblems within their application and out came the solutions. For most of us in developing countries like India, we don't even know whether our apps will run properly when uploaded onto Google playstore because they aren't supported by phones running older versions of android. So yes, I am very grateful to being in such a great country city like Japan where everything works well and everyone speaks English - even if it means inconveniencing yourself sometimes - but remember, nothing is free. You must earn every cent you spend. Jusinkembo and Tumi have helped quite a bit along with some tools I found helpful. Here's the story... [Thanks again to Hanae Nishioka for her contribution] I'm currently living in Japan working on my own projects. My main focus right now is building mobile web sites and native iOS Android apps. Previously, I've worked with teams from various companies including Dentsu Inc., SEGA Game World, Nomura Holdings Co Ltd (Company),Code Art Corporation, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (Sony), Shimamura Trading Corp.,and KDDI Corporation.[1]. I enjoy programming with C and JavaScript. I create both desktop and server side web applications in ASP.NET MVC 5 and node.js.So why should you care? Why bother learning something completely foreign and difficult? Well... First let me start by saying that I am no expert at english language. While i speak fluent japanese, I'm mostly self taught and use google translator quite often - mainly for translating technical terms. There isn't really another way around it unfortunately. But hey, I'll try anyway.Coding skills Second thing to consider is coding skill. Every day brings challenges that require hours upon hours of research online to fix. Many articles say that beginners don't need knowledge on debugging techniques and logcat interpreters only. And maybe it's true to a certain extent. Though I agree that reading tutorials might save time speeding up your development process considerably,it doesn't mean writing code isn't fun anymore.The third point is the importance of breaking down complex processes into smaller parts. When dealing with topics that fall outside your comfort zone, it helps immensely to divide things into smaller chunks.For example, inside HelloWorld app,there may seem a huge number of lines of codes to write,but they probably contain less than half a dozen functions each.In fact,the majority of HelloWorldapp consists of declaring variables and constants.Even if you understand concepts such as loops and conditionals, writingreading multiple locations of code written differently would add stress and slow your progress.Finally, my conclusion would be ""Always keep improving."" Which is exactly what happened here. Even if I wanted to stop making Phone Apps, I'd never give in to complacency. If I stopped creating things now, then where would I go next? To keep going forward and improve on my current designs, I knew that I needed feedback and advice. Calls from clients provided that invaluable information. At first, I wasn't necessarily looking for feedback from customers, but once I realized that most of them loved what I created, I couldn't wait.

"An astrophotographer has released several highly detailed images of the sun stitched together from 1,500,000 individual pictures. It was captured using a modified telescope that uses two telescopic filters, one blue and one red to enable it to see on the magnetic north pole as well as in other regions. The project took four years to complete. Astrophoto-artist Chris Menges says he made the Jupiter photos by scanning thousands of photographs taken over 14 months, then stitching them all up into an image of the largest planet in our solar system. Red laser dots show where each photo was taken. Here's more: The bottom line is that there are no ways around this problem; humans will never be able to live long enough or travel far enough to get access to Venus or Mars for direct observation (unless we build some sort of space elevator), so indirect methods alone must do us until something like Star Trek style warp drives become available soon anyway. No matter what scientist tell you about how rare a star forming region is they always have their own agenda because someone else funded them - which majority of people don't know if its true because most scientists work behind closed doors with mostly government grants. If you wish to learn more read my post ""A Decade Long Journey To Find Earths Light Pollution Problem And What We Can Do About It!"" I really hope everyone reading this catches the message here.. Light pollution isn't just affecting wildlife but human health too through cancer causing rays at night that affect plants growing near city lights. How can anyone deny this when we ourselves grow taller than average just living near bright streetlamps? Low frequency light doesn't even penetrate walls very much unlike UltraViolet radiation. This is common knowledge amongst astronomers who work outside often during daylight hours among many others... Then again did you ever hear of Cosmic Background Radiation being affected by blue light emissions from sunlight reaching EARTHS surface before the Sun goes fully dark? Keep in mind that planets orbiting distant stars don't emit any light themselves due to distance since those planets are billions of miles away that only form while the parent star is still burning... As per earlier studies these are not new findings yet they seem to be ignored by the media and 'experts' alike due to dozens of journalists conveniently ignoring this point. In fact Ozone layer depletion may actually lead to even MORE dangerous UV radiation hitting land masses rather than less thanks to higher levels of ozone loss specifically caused by higher energy level UVC wavelengths coming out from heat generating devices such as electric motors etc. Read More: According to NASA, Planet Nine could impact life across Earth's orbit. For instance, small asteroids might strike the Arabian Peninsula. ""This would create massive tsunamis,"" said study coauthor Robert Weryk, a planetary geologist from San Diego State University. Also, polar ice caps might crumble, potentially leaving pockets of fresh water exposed below ground - adding nutrients for algae or bacteria that would feed fish populations. Such changes in climate could influence agriculture and economic growth throughout Asia's Middle East coast, according to the researchers. While officials haven't alerted residents to possible dangers ahead of time, experts say it wouldn't take much warning to protect against potential impacts.""Planet Nine won't hit us next week or next year, but after 100 million years or so,"" Weryk told Live Science. But anybody who thinks they'll survive another 10 million years should think twice, he added. When searching in Google Maps looking for places in Mexico there is the option to click on 'earth' to find points along latitude lines showing different heights above sea level. There is also the option to enter certain locations, including cities and countries. One thing missing is altitude graph information displaying the height above sea level. Now there seems to be a solution courtesy of Dr. Charles Eberlein working closely with researcher Jevon Phillips. Watch his video presentation on YouTube titled A Quick Look At Altitude Graph Data On Altitudes Of Places Around Us Below! Dr. Charles Eberlein has been studying altimeter data collected by satellites - especially from Japan. He collects and analyzes radar measurements from thunderstorms and volcano eruptions. His purpose is to discern patterns within atmospheric pressure fluctuations. When used correctly altimeters provide information regarding weather forecasting accuracy. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency provides accurate information via satellite. They measure hundreds of millions of things every single day such as ocean waves, forest fires, volcanic activity, rainfall rates and aircraft flight paths to name a few. Many times people ask me why does altitude change? Why won't high mountains reach the clouds?? Unfortunately there are zero answers to these questions. Not ALL altimetry measures air pressure.

Get yourself organized under a company name and set up a personal account. You won't need APIs to access private repositories but keep them anyway because public repos are great starting points for your next projects. For example, I'm using my own repo where I save my scripts along with links to tutorials, slideshare presentations and other resources. When I've finished a script, I delete older ones until I get bored of that topic:). Also, it's nice when colleagues suggest code snippets from their own public repos:) If you don't already have a company name yet, just create your own free domain name with Google Domains. It costs 10 per year but is totally worth it since it saves tons of time whenever you're trying to remember how to type github.comyour-username domain -e domain or directly typing From now on, simply replace username with ""jalifr"" and ""domain"" with ""stackshare."" GitHub Organization provides quick shortcuts to manage multiple accounts and allow team members to collaborate online. More info can be found here.

"Samsung has only just announced their Galaxy Fold phone, but they're already working on concepts and designs based on the feedback that they're receiving from their first foldable device. Two months ago we took a look at how Samsung was designing those devices with various scenarios in mind: With folding phones becoming more mainstream, it's time to start thinking about what comes after this moment of disruption in technology - when you're no longer buying one device because you have two options; instead, your ""main device"" may be something that does double duty as both a smartphone and tablet. That's why there are so many different ideas being thrown around for future mobile form factors. From Magic Leap-style augmented reality gadgets and AR glasses to smartphones like the LG G8 X ThinQ or new Motorola models. And then there is also ambient computing - which brings us back to our original focus here today. We thought it would be interesting to take some educated guesses regarding what kind of form factor might emerge next during all these years since ""phablets"" came out along with Windows 10 Mobile, Android Wear 2.0, Amazon Fire OS 6.x and iOS 11. For this article, I've had my eye on the Nokia 9 PureView. It's a truly excellent camera phone now thanks to its 20 MP wide-angle f1.9 lens, OIS autofocus and dual color sensors (both monochrome and RGB). With such a powerful sensor, image quality should come naturally and not need much postprocessing After several days looking through photos taken by the Nokia 9 Pureview, I'd imagine the following scenario: Someone hands me an old iPhone 7 Plus, telling me to use it while walking down busy streets. The big problem? No battery power left! Fortunately, there is always Google Maps onboard along with unlimited Wi-Fi access via ATT. When I get home, I can't wait to fire up the Nokia 9 PureView and check if it produces better street images than Apple's solution. But before doing anything else, I'll turn off everything else running in order to make sure it will work without draining too fast. Yes, 3G coverage is spotty, especially if you pass from dense to rural areas, so connectivity could become a real issue... so let's hope I don't have any speed issues! In fact, unless you grab your phone every few feet, you won't notice much of a difference between using a 32 GB iPhone and a 128GB Nokia 9 PureView. Until one day where you realize that half of your apps downloaded over Bluetooth were missing, right?! Before concluding that either solution isn't good enough for average users, remember that even a 16MP Sony Xperia 1 does quite well considering that Sony's experience on small displays dates way back to 2011. This idea certainly holds true to today's highly capable mobile cameras, but I think that most owners wouldn't want to give up their beloved iPhones despite having almost zero problems. So there you go: A vision of what seems plausible to me if any company decided to improve upon this type of design. Addendum on June 5th 2018: As expected, comments, tweets and email questions poured into Pocketnow after publishing this piece. I'm happy to say that none of them invalidate the premise stated above and thus we'll keep the main line of discussion below. However, please note that I still recommend checking out the latest version of the app, launched last week, which provides additional information on each topic discussed below. What makes sense for me personally is probably going to differ greatly depending on whether I prefer high-end photography, travel gear, gaming or productivity tools. Those who care less about digital imaging may find that picking up an ultra-lightweight laptop is easier and more convenient two weeks later. Meanwhile, hardcore photographers may want maximum portability, so reading reviews comparing large DSLRs against compact point-and-shoot models doesn't seem somewhat ridiculous anymore. Even though it goes far beyond the scope of this editorial, the same applies to tablets vs phablet fans who are willing to trade size for performance. Let's dive into these topics.

"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is set to launch on Halloween this year, after decades of careful planning and development. It will travel from Earth to a gravitational eddy in the sun's orbit called L2. Then it'll take off again - into space. That journey was no easy feat for NASA, which has been developing JWST since 1992. The first piece of hardware that reached its destination comprised two mirrors floating above an airship tethered by cables. They're frisbees: small satellites designed as part of the telescope's coronagraph project. But when those got there they were full of dust and needed cleaning before being packed inside the spacecraft. That took another 10 years, during which time other things kept getting delayed until finally, in 2012, everything met up at just past midnight Eastern Time when Atlantis lifted away from Kennedy Space Center carrying five tons of titanium scaffolding. When you look out over Florida sea-level now - where we actually see what our eyes do with all their tricks - you can make out several towers rising through clouds towards infinity. One of them holds some sort of giant robot arm that reaches down towards the craft below. There are people on board who man cameras and control systems, but most of JWST's crew work remotely using robotic arms instead. All told, more than half of its 6 million parts have been manufactured in Florida or Texas. This isn't science fiction though; it's real, and this month scientists working onboard are packing bits of themselves, pieces of each other, and radiation shielding samples aboard. This is step one, the culmination of many others after long years spent assembling every component that makes the entire thing tick. Everything needs to be checked twice: once because of quality assurance, and then again for safety reasons. And how much these checks cost depends on how tight your budget is. If you've got 17 billion dollars to spend on telescopes, you might get very lucky indeed. But if you don't, well... We need to keep building bigger ones anyway! Most astronomers think so too, and they've already had plenty of funding success stories. So why not throw money at something like JWST? Why not build the biggest one ever built? Actually, we didn't know about the biggest even then. What made Hubble shine back in 1990 was only very recently discovered.",0,195
"SpaceX's SN3 prototype experienced a structural failure while undergoing the same cryptogenic proof test that killed the previous two Starship prototypes. The test involves filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to within 5 of capacity, then subjecting it to extreme aerodynamic forces for around 400 seconds. The Crew Dragon capsule is currently in its third iteration and has been successfully tested twice before flying astronauts on missions. It also passed extensive safety reviews by NASA. But after those rockets blew up last year just before takeoff, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said there was ""nothing alarming"" about the crash. Despite the loss of any hope at getting back crewed flights anytime soon, however, Musk did not give up on his dream of becoming humanity's first spacefaring species. Instead, he turned his attention toward developing spacecraft capable of ferrying up to 100 people to Mars as early as 2024 using an updated version of the Starhopper rocket which was recently destroyed during one of the booster tests. This latest setback will only reinforce what many already knew to be true: deep-space travel is going to be very difficult if ever possible. To get real closer to making this happen sooner rather than later, we're taking you through all the major hurdles that must be overcome before humans can go beyond low Earth orbit, including the dangers presented by cosmic radiation and how to deal with them. Advertisement As more private companies step into the fray over who gets where to live among our solar system, they are extending their reach further and farther outwards and away from Earth. If someone wants to leave their home planet behind and find new homes elsewhere - whether in another star or moon nearby, or even billions of light years distant - humans need ways to survive long distance trips such as these. That means having some kind of propulsion technology developed that will enable us to escape gravity in a controlled manner so that when travelers arrive at their destinations they won't die prematurely due to bone density problems caused by prolonged exposure to zero G (or near zero G). When traveling through interstellar distances, everyone needs propulsion systems - otherwise known as thrusters - allowing them to stay aloft temporarily until they eventually land safely at their destination. A problem that plagues both science fiction authors like Arthur C Clarke and screenwriters everywhere is figuring out exactly why extraterrestrial civilizations would want to communicate with colonists. At best, the message might be ""Hello world! I'm here if you'd care to join me."" Or perhaps something along the lines of ""Hi neighbor! Wanna come visit?"" Reading between the lines though, it seems that most likely every civilization would have developed some sort of technology to allow their planets' inhabitants to talk across vast gulfs of time and space. What could possibly prevent aliens from communicating? Some may think that no signals traveling faster than light speed couldn't catch up with them. Perhaps if we were exploring other worlds remotely, without sending physical objects down into their atmosphere, we wouldn't run into much trouble; but obviously that isn't a feasible option given today's technological limitations. After all, it takes decades to build large enough probes to fly close enough to the surface of alien worlds to make sense of their geology and look closely at their biomes - let alone send subatomic packages via anything resembling a modern communications network sent entirely electronically. So, it stands to reason that only if we actively seek out contact with others outside of our own galaxy will we stand a chance of finding intelligent life somewhere else in the universe. For humans right now, based on current estimates, this search should start in earnest sometime around 2040. In fact, researchers believe that human exceptionalism makes communication unlikely unless something triggers our race to do so intentionally. According to scientists working under the direction of Harvard University astrophysicist Eric Chaisson, writing about potential reasons for communication, t]he requirements for 'contact' within a galactic society [are] far less stringent than the stringent criteria needed for intergalactic contact."" So once we've decided to put aside our petty differences and unite ourselves to fill the cosmos with greater and grander things, our first priority becomes building powerful tools to help us achieve that goal, since transportation is key. With today's technology, it'll take hundreds of thousands of years to cover the 64 million miles separating Earth and Alpha Centauri, the closest neighboring sunlike star, which lies 4.37 light years away. Although it sounds daunting to anyone trying to imagine crossing half the Milky Way Galaxy, significant progress has been made towards solving the final technical hurdle towards achieving a safe planetary exit velocity for interplanetary flight. We're talking about getting off your ass and building ships that make use of available energy sources. And even though we don't yet know everything about how these craft work, we do understand quite a bit about what they look like, thanks to artists and designers studying advanced concepts proposed by sci-fi writers, futurists, and engineers alike.

"Clocking into work every day can result in a vague sense of dissatisfaction when the work doesn't seem meaningful. This article discusses four different ways to ignite motivation for work. The hardest part about earning your daily salary is that it's never yet-so easy, and you have no idea how long you'll still be working once this paycheck runs out. For many people at least half their life (theoretically) as an employee lies before them; if they're lucky enough to find satisfaction from their function within the company or organization where they are employed full time, then even better! But let's face facts: most of us will spend up to 50 of our adult lives serving others outside of the home - either providing care for aging parents, taking care of children who need us while we try to earn money elsewhere, having other commitments like going to school or getting married during which we must scramble to meet those needs on top of our own, finding jobs suitable for our skills and interests so we don't start starving just because society assumes we do... just listing off all the possibilities makes me exhausted already! The point being: there isn't anything very appealing about waking up every morning figuring out what else you could possibly accomplish on top of staying alive through another day. That being said, despite this perception, we should not underestimate the value of saving a few pennies each hour by diligently working towards something more productive than watching Netflix until bedtime tonight! There are multiple paths to the goal of becoming financially stable without waking up with dread, but some require more focus and persistence than others, depending on personal skill sets and priorities. So here I'd like to talk about 4 different strategies robots cannot implement a solution to feeling motivated to wake up early every day to go to work, and become rich in the process. These may sound pretty ridiculous, maybe too absurdly simple or obvious to be worth mentioning in detail, and that's okay, haha. Let's dive right in, shall we? TLDR version, first option is: get paid overtime, second strategy involves making yourself feel indispensible somehow, third method uses market forces fourth strategy works well for naturally late risers, see why below. Also note that one of these methods requires a bit of luck involved, since in order to get any sort of financial reward, you really need to be willing to put the hours and effort required for the sake of putting food on the table, and not expect automatic rewards upon completion. I'm sure lots of readers will say ""duh"" at this point and roll their eyes while shrugging their shoulders, saying ""obviously,"" but hey, sometimes things suck less using alternative perspectives, right? And hey, nothing beats learning new stuff along the way! Oh yeah also, remember kids: ""If you ever use 'that' you'll pay a heavy price!"" Now onto the explanations! Get Paid Overtime First Option Why would anyone want to get paid extra for doing exactly what everyone around them does for free anyways? Well look, normally in America we refer to ourselves as laborers rather than slaves, however mankind has been enslaved by money since the beginning of time, and slavery still exists today due to governments attempting to control populations via currency manipulation. While it might be ideal to live in a country where basic necessities were provided for free as a matter of course, there's little reason to believe such countries exist anywhere in modern history besides socialist utopias, leaving only us living in noncommunist societies trapped behind high walls guarded by armed guards patrolling the streets at night in search of potential thieves. Regardless of what you think about capitalism vs socialism (I think both systems basically end up failing miserably), if you've got a job, you haven't had a choice about whether or not you'll earn money for doing whatever duty comes next to you, unless you quit checking emails after lunch break whenever you feel lazy, or refuse to buy groceries for a month straight when someone else is footing the bill, etc. If you've accepted this reality of life, then you probably understand why feeling underpaid for the excessive number of hours you work really sucks - especially if you didn't ask for it in the first place! We all know the story of the slave who worked 2x as hard as hisher neighbor simply because he (or she) came from a wealthy family instead, and went to good schools, and was able to skip the actual dirty work altogether. However, many successful entrepreneurs find themselves pressured into accepting substandard employment conditions at earlier stages of career progression, due to fears of losing status among peers for choosing self-employment over corporate employment, or concerns regarding future advancement opportunities within certain companies based on past experiences where previous workers did worse than the manager (which likely turned out untrue). And yes, none of these reasons make sense whatsoever, unfortunately the human psyche is pretty far removed from logical thinking processes, so it's best to keep these thoughts firmly lodged somewhere deep inside your subconscious mind instead, otherwise they'll affect your decisionmaking in pursuit of success later in life. As mentioned previously, we now definitely stressful situations occurring between 5th grade students 11 years old, 10A This is one of two kinds of nasty. and get",0,200
"Many things can be done to make animals live longer, even though we don't know exactly why these things work. These can include changing diets, taking certain drugs, or special surgeries for pets and horses - but all of those methods take a lot of time and money in order to have any sort of positive impact on the animal's health. A new study published Monday suggests that one way people could keep their dogs healthy as they age is by giving them elderberries. The berries are known to boost ""good"" cholesterol levels, increase insulin sensitivity (a metabolic change linked with longevity), decrease inflammation (also connected to living long) and reduce blood sugar levels. All of this happens without affecting normal functioning of cells. This means there might actually be less chance that your dog will get cancer because it has higher-than-normal amounts of telomerase - an enzyme associated with cell immortality. The study was conducted at Purdue University, where researchers looked at three groups of labrador retrievers raised traditionally over generations (that were called ""culls compared to two other groups of labradors who had received elderberry supplements via feeding tube for four weeks during their senior years. (Each group consisted of 10 puppies.) Testers also examined the lifespan of each dog, noting how many times it died before 500 days old along with its cause of death. Dragos Ionescushutterstock After the first round of testing completed, results showed that the supplementation made no difference regarding weight gain, overall length, or life span between all of the dogs. However, when looking just at causes of death, poop came up again: Dogs given elderberry saw significantly fewer cases of bladder problems than both control puppies and those fed a placebo. If you're thinking about getting some elderberries for your pet, let me stop you right here: According to the research team, eating raw fruit isn't safe for your dog if it was not handled properly before ingestion. That means: Don't eat the whole thing straight from the container; chew it into small pieces first so the little ones aren't accidentally swallowed; prepare baby food out of organic ingredients only (these types of products should never come into contact with dirty hands). One easy option is to buy fresh frozen berries, which are delicious treats but won't need much preparation, although you'll want to check if they contain added sugars such as dextrose or sucralose (which can negatively affect digestion). If buying dried or powdered forms anyway, always read labels carefully beforehand. A few companies sell natural brands, including Eukanuba and Purina One, while others sell specific supplement extracts such as Cranberries Plus. And lastly, remember the whole point behind getting any vitamins for your puppy? To give him good nutrition throughout his lifetime. They may help briefly improve immune function, grow fur faster, or lower seizure activity after being poisoned, but ingesting extra vitamin C, B12, selenium etc., doesn't provide lasting benefits. Also, watch out for bad dietary practices like adding corn syrup and artificial sweeteners!",0,201

"Cana has unveiled a drink machine that can synthesize almost any drink. The machine uses a cartridge that contains flavor compounds that can be combined to create the flavor of your choice, including house-made syrups and flavored whiskey drinks like grappa and sloe gin (pictured). The Cana Device is an example of what we will see in kitchens more commonly in the future for mixing cocktails on demand as opposed to buying pre-mixed products from bars or restaurants at great expense. Somewhat reminiscent of how you might use Google's voice recognition software to make requests via phone with just a few words spoken by tapping into ""OK google"" on your computersmartphone screen and it obeys. Or other smart devices such as Apple HomeKit compatible speakers where music and podcast playback are controlled through Siri; but this project goes beyond that functionality helping us get away from having multiple bottles of every kind of liquor out on display at all times. It was created using 3D printing which allows users to customize their creations through design and programming rather than simply purchasing them off the shelf ready made. It also comes across as very much a novelty item now, or so one may think based upon initial reactions when glimpsed at various trade shows over the last couple years. However, the team behind it says they have no intention to commercialise this product for mass consumption yet. They intend to license its technology knowhow to manufacturers who want to produce similar machines for that purpose later down the line. This will open up new opportunities for chefs and bartenders alike to mix different varieties of cocktail ingredients without needing to buy large quantities upfront. It would appear that there is still more work required before these sorts of systems become feasible for regular household use though. For instance on top if you click here, I found after searching around online forums that many people were reporting issues with lower quality video feed quality due to noise levels being too high. Those noises are likely coming from the motors inside used to move the parts of the device together during mixing. You'll need to clearly hear the sounds emerging to discern that sort of thing compared to hearing the actual audio output itself. Additional improvements could be made perhaps to enhance image clarity and even reduce cost further and allow popular consumer options to be included like wireless connectivity or larger batteries to help extend battery life maybe? My guess is that within a year's time we should see some real momentum building towards making such devices available commercially somewhere sometime down the road given current progress, though not everyone's got thousands burning a hole in their pockets waiting for stock to arrive from whatever company licenses the tech first.",0,205

"This is a really detailed illustrated flowchart for learning to become an expert web developer in 2018, starting from ""Learn HTML"" and going all the way through complex topics like React.js or ES6 functional programming. It's divided into 4 major sections: 1) Learn Programming Basics 2) Learn Web Development 3) Build Websites Apps with Front-End Technologies (HTML CSS) and 4) Extend What You've Learned by Learning More About JavaScript Frameworks Languages. At some point you'll be able to get pretty far along on your own if this helps! It can take years of reading books and tutorials before you could even teach yourself what I'm about to show you. I don't know where you are right now, but here is my advice: Don't lose focus. Reading these steps 10 times over isn't useful unless you apply them consistently every day, so it's not enough to just read through once in order to make progress. If you're doing that then you might as well go back and start again at step number one because you haven't learned anything yet. Let me explain why each part matters... The first thing you need to understand is how computers work. Without understanding basic computer science, you will never learn technology, no matter which languages or frameworks you use. Then it makes sense to look up resources from sites such as Khan Academy. After that comes the basics of HTML, Javascript and other technologies used widely today across websites like Facebook, Google and YouTube: learning those fundamentals includes studying various tutorial videos on Youtube, watching online lectures and eventually taking courses. Building off that foundation should lead to realising you have more questions than answers after trying out framework X or tool Y. At first, most people think something is too hardcomplicated when they encounter a new feature or concept, while actually it's frequently very simple and intuitive once you know what you want to do instead of struggling through hacks without any idea what you're achieving. Finally we move onto solving problems using actual applications - creating a website or app from scratch after completing the steps above gets tedious quickly due to all the choices available. This leads us towards deciding whether building things ourselves or buying software products made specifically for our needs would be best. In short: there's always a better option somewhere else if you put in the effort to find it! Should You Become An Expert? Probably Not Yet There's lots of benefits of becoming good at programming including being able to earn money and getting ahead faster compared to someone who doesn't know much about tech, however there's also plenty of tradeoffs to consider before jumping straight into big projects. Becoming good takes many months of dedicated study and practice; if you spend less time hours per week practicing you may end up spending more time feeling tired from working too long without rest and not having fun either. A lot of developers aren't quite interesting in working with their hands anymore, preferring instead to sit behind screens writing code to serve ads instead of making themselves useful. To give myself perspective, I remember my university days fondly, when I worked on school assignments during spare time and was fascinated by CPU design, pipelining, cache hierarchies and everything related to algorithms. Nowadays it seems everyone around me has switched to writing bad javascript, PHP or Java scripts that break half our apps later in life, simply because they spent always sitting within company walls developing features nobody wants. That said, sometimes even years of experience looking only at ""the digital world"" without ever touching a physical product can turn out disastrous. However moving away from web development entirely won't improve your skillset immensely since the vast majority of web content still lives in exactly the same format: they contain text, images and video. Even though documents tend to come with added metadata like dates and authorship tags, modern semantic data formats such as JSON Schema remain pervasive throughout the industry. So technical journo skills do carry forward somewhat. Wanting to write stories about blockchain crypto trends or machine learning AI does partially translate into knowing SQL databases and backend API integration, although in reality rarely anyone knows everything needed for proper information retrieval, artificial intelligence, high availability systems or distributed computing beyond the trivialities involved before joining large companies. Either way, let's say you do decide to jump into serious coding and get hired as a fullstack dev - actually knowing stuff as described by the title page surely makes you stand apart among others and attracts attention from recruiters, right? Maybe. But it depends on the type of job you choose. Which Technical Soft Skills Do Employers Value Most As Of Today? People often complain about hiring decisions based mostly upon resumes lacking relevant keywords etc., but if truth be told candidates usually struggle facing interviews with little to none soft skill training whatsoever. Where most get stuck is adapting to technical interview scenarios and delivering solid responses rather than memorizing buzzwords. What employers value is proven knowledge of specific tools and techniques combined with tactical decision logic, problem-solving abilities and project management ability.

"Signal is testing a new peer-to-peer payment system in the UK called Signal Payments. The system uses MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency with a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike's Bitcore project. The payments service works like a messenger app where users send one another money directly from their phones (presumably over Wi-Fi) without going through an online or bank account. For instance you could pay any of your friends for coffee by sending them US0.04 via mobile phone text message. Marlinspike told me that he doesn't believe that Bitcoin will ever become mainstream but hopes that ""people realize there are other things to do than just creating more bitcoins."" When asked whether this was potentially bad timing given recent events such as Mt Gox insolvency, Marlinspike said: ""Bitcoin has had issues all year long. It's not for everybody... This [MobilePay] isn't meant to be a replacement for bitcoin; it's mostly for people who want faster access."" Signal Pay is currently only available on iOS but would presumably come to Android soon enough - which should help uptake if anything were to happen to Apple PayGoogle Wallet. Users can choose between two different currencies: fiat currency (2030 at time of writing) or tether, a virtual token used to transfer value across platforms and devices.

"Amazon has revealed two new robots at the re:MARS conference that are designed to move products around its warehouses. The Xanthus is an upgrade for Amazon's shelf-bots that will let them travel from one warehouse zone (or ""cluster to another, and even across zones if they're small enough or a personal order requires it. Meanwhile, the Fetch robot scoots about with more humanlike qualities than ever before, including facial recognition. I had no idea this was being developed until I read through some of the comments on our sister site ZDNet yesterday most were calling out how stupidly complicated these machines look compared to what humans could accomplish in similar situations with less effort. But not everyone agrees. Some commenters thought the designs looked cool, while others felt like Amazon needed something better. Jobs' design principles may be working against him now; he can do little but admire someone else's work as his own legacy dries up, and his projects become increasingly derivative of existing technologies. That's one reason Apple CEO Tim Cook went so far last week when he said Jobs would have been proud of him. Sadly, Cook wasn't kidding. The Japanese electronics company NEC built several such systems over several years in the 1970s under direction by Seiichi Morita, who later sold his shares back to Sony. In April 1978, NEC released NEC OS-9, Japan's first commercially available operating system intended for consumer PCs. Its development involved 12 programmers working full time on three computers for six months straight without any breaks. It featured mouse support, startup menus, file management utilities and other advanced features. OS-9 shipped with 16 KB of memory space, 8 MB hard disk drive storage, 640 kB floppy disks and 1 Mb EEPROM card. Like all early operating systems, it also had support for only four colors on screen graphics. However, unlike IBM PC DOS, which required drivers written specifically for each manufacturer using the platform, OS-9 used a generic driver interface called BIOS ROMEX which allowed users to run their software programs regardless of the particular hardware configuration. For example, it supported both 8086 Intel-compatible microprocessors and Motorola 68000 processors.

"A new privacy feature in Firefox strips custom URL query parameters from URLs to prevent tracking. The Query Parameter Stripping feature automatically strips various query parameters from clicked links and forms (such as search terms). The following is an example of a link that was modified by the user's browser: queryqtermlink-modifier1. Now, when the site tries to track you using this parameter it won't be able to because your URL has been modified. This prevents sites such as Google Analytics and other online advertising companies from understanding what pages users are visiting on their website. By default, visitors can modify any URL they like and there's no way for websites or advertisers to detect these modifications.

"XRSpace will be launching its Mova virtual reality headset later this year. The device will sell for 599. It features 5G support, a hand tracking interface, and a virtual world that can run at 90 FPS or 60 fps depending on your computer's specs. The Oculus Go is the company's entry-level VR solution. Earlier today it launched with 75 new games from YouTube creators like VICELAND's Amanda Hocking and Brendan Creecy. So far there aren't any big surprises in store for users looking to dive headfirst into mobile gaming - especially since they're competing against Google Cardboard which still sells well. But what if you want something closer to sophisticated than what's currently available? Well, maybe an all-in-one system built specifically for VR isn't as crazy of an idea after all. We went hands-on with the 399 MobiVR A10 phone (pictured above) at CES 2018, and while we were expecting our first look at some kind of mixed reality device, we got more than just that; the MobiVR came outfitted with a full 15"" LCD screen inside.

"Mark Zuckerberg has highlighted four areas (data portability, election integrity, harmful content, and privacy) which he believes require regulation, in an op-ed published on March 30. He stated that a new regulatory ""framework"" will be created to address these issues. In the op-ed posted at allfacebook.comopinions, Zuckerberg talks about data portability - the ability for users of Facebook apps to move their information from one service to another when they change developers or services: We need more comprehensive rules and standards around what kind of data is portable across platforms. This includes providing clear protocols so companies can agree on how to communicate with each other, as well as enabling people to take control over who gets access to what kinds of personal info. We also should set enforceable laws around whether a company needs consent to share your private message history from its own messaging app with advertising partners like WhatsApp. That would allow you to switch between our app and others without having your whole conversation disappear. It could make it easier for us to bring together different types of social media experiences into a single personalized feed. And if there are certain health conditions where we want someone else to have access to medical records, we shouldn't block them from doing this either. So let's come up with some specific ideas on how best to regulate these practices while protecting user trust today and in the future. Now I know many people think regulating tech giants isn't good enough. But we don't believe government regulators by themselves can solve every problem facing society, including those caused by technology. These problems require cooperation among business leaders, technologists, policy makers, investors, academics and civil society groups. Governments play a critical role but not always the right one. An effective framework to promote competition and innovation depends on working together through open dialogue and collaboration rather than requiring just politicians or bureaucrats to decide what constitutes acceptable behavior. The only way forward is by using tools like antitrust law, education, science, and multiple points of view. Just because something hasn't been banned doesn't mean it's OK. There may be ways to help consumers understand the risks better. For example, we've recently made it much clearer to see who owns your posts and likes and to give you additional controls over sharing your activity outside of Facebook. Changes like this aren't going away though. If anything comes out of this process, it'll likely involve regulations requiring industry self-regulation. Zuckerberg concludes his piece stating: The Internet provides unprecedented opportunity to connect the world and improve lives - greatly benefiting individuals, businesses and governments alike. More importantly, it helps keep information flowing freely, giving everyone equal power to express views online ... Our primary goal here is to create global community where no matter who you are or what you believe, you can enjoy unlimited opportunities to explore countless stories, talents and perspectives. [...] My hope now is that even after April 15th Facebook becomes a place where people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and bringing opposing viewpoints to light, regardless of politics or religion. A truly free internet requires constant vigilance. As long as the overwhelming majority of voices stay peaceful, then we're creating spaces that enriches democracy. However, the same places that empower millions offer terrorists fertile ground to recruit extremists who use violence against civilians to further advance their cause. We must continuously work with countries and organizations dedicated to stopping terrorist recruitment to identify ways we can prevent radicalization. Our challenge won't go away with the rise of artificial intelligence ... Since 2007 we've had teams of researchers focused solely on spam, hate speech, violent extremism and counter terrorism. Today we continue to hire experts across engineering, research, policy and communications to tackle new challenges related to misinformation, elections and consumer protection. With regards to ensuring voter integrity, Zuckerberg states: There was already strong movement toward greater transparency on political ads before Russia decided to try to influence votes during 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. During the last two years alone, voters have successfully used our platform to hold candidates accountable for misleading statements and false claims. In fact, since 2012, there have been more Facebook ad disclosures filed in federal courts than with any other type of advertisement. It makes sense that we'd apply similar disclosure requirements to digital political advertisements, too ... One thing that surprised me is how popular it became on my wall [of friends] immediately following the news reports. Because most people saw these coordinated efforts coming, many were asking why Russian operatives didn't do this sooner. They realized quickly that there wasn't really anyone monitoring for foreign interference beyond the Department of Homeland Security and FBI. While encouraging people to vote is important, fighting unfairness is equally important. ... We hear concerns regularly from folks worried about losing jobs due to automation and people concerned about being replaced by AI. Work continues to ensure all Americans can find meaningful, fair employment options. At the same time, we recognize that people have choices when looking for work, and campaigns often exaggerate fears about automation to get elected.

"Alexa will now be able to proactively act on Hunches thanks to its latest update. Amazon's device has been able to sense habits and ask about them since 2018, but it didn't have a proactive way of responding until recently. Now the voice assistant can use machine learning capabilities in Alexa to select actions based on what you've done before, whether that's by speaking to your Echo or asking questions like ""What time is my wake up call?"" The ""smart"" features we talk are more than just fun tech-y toys - they work with Alexa Voice Service (AVS) for tasks such as making calls, sending messages, playing music, controlling smart home devices etc., using APIs provided internally from AmazonGoogle and enabled through 3rd party developer platforms such as IFTTT. If there isn't an API available for the feature, then developers write their own software utilizing either mobile apps or SDKs. Even if developers don't want to code anything themselves directly, they may still choose to integrate their services into another app which listens to events sent via AVS. However, most users won't even realize any integration exists between these third parties unless explicitly looking at those companies' websites or forums. As far as Third Parties go, we only list major players because smaller ones aren't nearly as useful when trying to add new functionality to Alexa! Amazon unveiled their line of Kindle tablets last year starting at 49 under pressure from Apple and Google who were releasing less expensive Nexus 7 screens. At 50-70 cheaper than rivals, Amazon scored some decent early sales but today all three tablet makers sell models starting around 100, putting the low end Fire outgunned. The company did not debut this year's version of its flagship Kindle Oasis screenless e-reader here due to supply constraints, however; 2017's first-gen model is also priced higher than competitors' readers and is lacking many standard features found on other models including waterproofing, headphone jacks and adjustable displays. So, while Fire HDX 8.9"" starts at 139, all current Kindles start above 120 - though notably, prices do vary widely depending upon display size and brand. In fact, taking our price guide around back to 2012, the cheapest Kindle we could find was originally sold for 99.[1] That said, Amazon reduced pricing over the years so much that the entry level reader today costs roughly half what it used to: 69 compared to 119.

Let me explain why. With the growing popularity of online shopping among consumers coupled with the increase in credit card fraud, merchants are hesitant to offer this service due to liability concerns. While EVRYONE accepts credit cards without charge or fees (except for certain shipping providers), adding to the number of transaction variables increases potential risk for merchant account holders. This is why none of the pages offered above include the option to pay with a credit card. There are several reputable payment gateways providing both virtual and physical terminals (usually linked to bank accounts) allowing people to make purchases safely and securely. We recommend Shopify Payment Gateway (29.95month plan). It allows accepting credit card payments quickly and easily within minutes after ordering. Also you get free credits each month according to a bundle program. Another example offering similar functionalities is PayPal checkout page (free signup required). You must know also that connecting your PayPal and Ebay stores does require additional PayPal subscription fee ranging from 0.89 per month (12 monthly installments of 10.85) to 24 per month (13 months of payments of 31.60). Other popular options are Stripe (signup required) and Braintree PayPal Attestation Module (discounted rate plans starting at 59 annually).[citation needed] When you shop online...checkout methods become important factors regardless where you live or how big your business may be. What works great for small businesses might not meet expectations for larger organizations.

"Samsung held its first Unpacked event of 2022 on Wednesday. It announced the Galaxy S22 Ultra, S22, and S22, the Galaxy Tab S8, Tab S8, and Tab S8 Ultra, and a new foldable smartphone called the Fold 2, all in addition to an updated range-topping variant of last year's top offering: Samsung Galaxy Note10 (see our review). Here are our highlights from today's announcements: Galaxy S21 is already here To be clear, there will not be any changes coming this year to the standard version of the Galaxy S21 phone that launched at 720 or so back in January. But it seems we're getting another iteration with more features eventually and perhaps some minor design tweaks for good measure. This time around, however, we'll get something like a ""mild incremental update"" instead of what was originally planned as a big upgrade. That makes sense because the Galaxy brand has shrunk significantly over the past few years - by my count, we've seen five different Galaxy phones released since 2016 alone. So while you'd think they could just release one new high-end flagship each year without missing out on upgrades, their business model hasn't really supported that level of output yet, especially after exiting the featurephone market entirely several years ago. We'll see if things change going forward, but now that smartphones have largely replaced featurephones anyway, I'm guessing mid-range models aren't likely to become much of a priority either. The smaller Galaxy S lineup looks great tho With only two major flagships left under the current arrangement between Samsung and Google, it feels like 2019 might end up being remembered fondly as the era when Samsung finally started catching up to Apple. There were certainly some solid devices released over the course of the last 12 months, including the Note9, S10e, S11, iPhone XR, OnePlus 5T, LG V60 ThinQ, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, BlackBerry Motion Hub, Pixel 3 XL, Honor Play 10 Lite... The list goes on. And the success of those releases helped drive down prices as well. Something tells me 2020 won't be nearly as exciting - which is why, naturally, Samsung wants us talking about next year ahead of time! Anyway, I feel like 2019 would actually prove harder than 2018 for competing manufacturers. After all, remarkably similar Android One devices made by Xiaomi dominated 2018 with low pricing and excellent specs; coupled with other Chinese OEMs releasing even better products across many price points, it seemed like these diversified options had caused consumers to gravitate towards lower priced hardware rather than higher priced ones. That trend may still continue into 2020 - after all, devices carrying nothing more prestigious than ""Made By Xiaomi"" stickers can sometimes cost less than half of everything else available right now - but it also felt like 2019 should have been easier for companies looking to break through. Perhaps vendors will take advantage of having fewer competitors this time around and go with stronger offerings? Or maybe it'll simply lead to larger scale production cuts, as happened earlier this decade at least once before? Time will tell, eh? So far, so typical... As usual, Samsung spent most of the keynote detailing how amazing everything is going to look, sound, and perform compared to previous generations using whatever combination of words and images suits them best. Given the company went to such lengths inventing new names for smartphone camera sensors and dialers (and yes, I know everyone knows who the former are), the presentation ended up feeling tepid at times. As always, don't expect anything too special unless you want your phone to start shouting at random moments throughout day from anywhere within earshot. Still, no matter how boring Samsung gets, if anyone manages to bring home a win for anything worthwhile then I guess we shouldn't complain too loudly. Fortunately, the latest generation of dual cameras did make quite a splash, giving the device something unique amongst all phones of this type so far. Both the regular wide-angle F1.5 cam and the telephoto lens offer levels of detail and dynamic range usually found in professional DSLRs, plus both elements of the camera combine together seamlessly thanks to innovative tech tricks like Super Resolution and Dual Aperture OIS. Oh wait, that sounds familiar to Samsung fans... Also unveiled alongside the Galaxy S20 series were three new Plus variants - namely the normal S20 , S20 Ultra , and the front facing triple camera setup known as Infinity UX. These additions raise the base price of every single Galaxy S20 handset from 980 to closer to 1100, making these handsets almost impossible on impulse buy except for those interested solely in the largest screen size Samsung offers right now. There are pros and cons to all three designs, which we discussed during yesterday's launch events.

"Apple hit a 23 market share in China in Q4, 2021, thanks to the success of the iPhone 13. The new iPhone was a success due to its lower starting price and a better camera with 12MP1T12Mp 1T 12 MP sensor. This year Apple grew from 18 in 2018, but it fell back again last quarter as Huawei overtook Apple for number one spot. The rise and fall is because both saw strong growth over 2019, which we will talk about next week. But now let's look at what they are doing right now: Huawei has been making great strides towards global dominance and recently passed Samsung into being the top smartphone manufacturer globally after years of struggle against competition like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo etc. With all that said, their performance isn't as perfect as you might expect. They have some problems such as issues of image quality, battery life on the latest models and updates take far too long (since late). These issue can be fixed and thus make them competitive if handled correctly. We'll get more details later this month when reviews start coming out. HTC had another good quarter in the Chinese Market although still falling behind. Their flagship line flirted with greatness with the introduction of U11 Plus 2.2"" 534mAh, Snapdragon 855 and 6GB8GB RAM configuration. Unfortunately though, there were several delays since its release in early February. Since then HTC's phone lineup hasn't even ranked 3 or 4 in any region except Canada where their Hero series holds high positions despite having no 1080p display option. Soon enough its successor won't arrive either. In place of these phones are the One E9 plus (1020 USD) along with the Desire 30 Pro (579 - 799 USD), while its budget offerings stay put in the 10-15k range. Still if things continue up until March 2020, the brand could potentially regain some lost ground by launching two or three flagship devices in May including possibly the first Android Go device. If so, it would leave very little time between the end of April and mid June before iPhone 11 launches and the Q4 results reflect that. So how did HTC do? Well let's see... HTC has continued to lose market share every other quarter for quite awhile now. While the company continues to produce excellent devices, unfortunately those devices aren't able to compete much longer without an update from Google involving best practices for apps development and metal casing support. Yes HTC understands that it needs a new OS build to help keep people, especially international users interested. However HTC also knows that that doesn't mean earning dollars in the short term. It takes months for major changes made during software releases to filter down to shipping devices. Allowing developers to begin working on custom features around UI elements, animations, sensors and security enhancements takes time just as well. Thus why it took nearly six weeks for Lollipop (Android 5.0) and Marshmallow (6.0) to reach the US via OTA updates. By contrast, iOS gets updated within hours. Oh yes I forgot to mention what happened in Q4. In October 2015 I predicted that MWC 2016 February 26 -March 3 would finally reveal something towards improving handset designs among Android OEM's like LG. Sure enough, LG announced it'd be joining hands with Motorola on Project Ara, a modular cellphone platform. And sure enough that didn't turn out to be anything special beyond the fact that they'd joined forces to bring us a prototype. Also, HMD Global unveiled Nokia 9 PureView and the world got nothing else in terms of innovation for smartphones (that wasn't aimed at teenagers). Now here comes Samsung who wants to sell 15 million Galaxy S10 units in 2025 to beat the record set by Sony PlayStation PS5 2045 Million Units Sold. That seems a bit ambitious given the prospectives of the mobile industry today and the slow pace of sales of current generation flagships. After all with Sony PlayStation only selling 43Million video game consoles in 2017 worldwide! So what does TCL stand for? To me personally, it stands for ""Take Careless Leadership!"" Now there's certain products that come and go quickly in the fast paced tech scene. For example, think of the Apple Watch back before the Series 2 launched where everyone wanted one. Then when the second iteration came out, most people couldn't live without owning one. Some may say don't believe everything you read online and you're probably right. When brands introduce newer versions though it can cause confusion amongst consumers. You're not going to tell your dad he owns a Model X just because he bought his original model last year. Yet many companies rely heavily on advertising copywriters who simply want to ride the wave of consumer hype rather than actually educate buyers on product specifics and distinctions. Again let's think of the Apple Watch Series 2 launch few years ago versus the third version a few years prior (the Series 0) and in comparison to the fourth version (if potential purchasers left off the table because ""offended Pavee to evaluate results to evaluate insists iced-up customers':",0,220

It 's not clear how long it might be before we can buy from Verizon or Sprint in the US too. A contract version with carriers could follow at some point later this year. It would seem that Apple has another one to add to their watchlist of cases which have been found to contain ""dangerous new materials"" designed to prevent a screen shattering drop during an accident. The latest example comes courtesy of iFixit who were able to remove the described case (pictured above) and get under its innards: Apple Watch - Update 911 We just removed the second layer of metal around the display area using heat guns, carefully drilling out holes like those shown below.

They're apparently working on ways to fix whatever issues there may be associated with the material. Read More "" According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Samsung Electronics plans on releasing two Galaxy Note models next month - a big improvement over last year when only three variants were announced. Apparently he states ""the company expects strong demand early next quarter,"" so if true then everyone should start buying up all of their favorite phones right away...or at least pick your favorites. Back in 2015 we reported back about the original 'Essential Phone' concept that eventually became the Android One series launched today. Today Google made the announcement that the first Essential branded smartphone dubbed 'Pixel C' will officially hit store shelves starting October 18th priced at 499 off contract. According to Essential Founder Andy Rubin himself the Pixel C features 360 degrees speakers, HDR10 support, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, USB Type-C port, multi-account security architecture, 32GB storage capacity plus wireless charging feature. Besides creating a hardware platform targeted towards developers, the official launch time frame coincides nicely into what appears to be a planned software update schedule across various devices including the Nexus 6P. Though no word yet as to whether or not users will receive any updates automatically once connected to WiFi via cellular data connection, expect further information on that front shortly following release day. In addition, while Google hasn't confirmed pricing for the handset, do note that HTC recently dropped the price of its own large flagship offering, the U Ultra, down to only 600 off contract. We mentioned earlier in the week about the possibility of LG bringing G6 compatible fast charging technology to us here in North America via Qi Wireless Quick Charge 2.0 for smartphones; however following recent news regarding Huawei releasing similar technology unfortunately comes reports stating that such solution won't work without being paired with either the same proprietary cables or alternatively some sort of special adapter. Well good luck finding most of that stuff considering the former Huawei executive basically stated the same exact thing as well, probably indicating that his statement wasn't going anywhere...in fact I'm fairly certain I heard him say something along those lines myself. On top of that, according to GSMArena who published a report further detailing the matter if you happen to visit an unnamed carrier stores tromping through Canada, UK, France, Germany and Australia, none of the aforementioned solutions actually work. Instead they must purchase an extra accessory kit costing roughly RMB 30 (4). Not exactly cheap especially since this means consumers end up having to spend double the money due to said wired arrangement. No word yet on just why exactly they'd charge additional fees to cover assorted components required, though perhaps some reason behind the decision exists regarding profits. Just my thoughts anyways. As someone living in markets where many individuals already invested heavily in external chargers prior to this development anything else wouldn't make much sense. We'll keep you updated accordingly once more info becomes available. LG has revealed that it's going to offer AI-powered voice assistant built in its upcoming 2019 flagships - the V30S ThinQ V35G Life View Edition, both scheduled for release within Q1 2017 timeframe alongside CEO Kwon Oh Hyun personally demonstrating the functionally onboard.

"WeWork has closed down around 2,300 phone booths at some of its sites in the US and Canada after it discovered elevated levels of formaldehyde. The discovery was made after an internal investigation found that there were higher-than-expected concentrations of a chemical used to preserve furniture which could pose health risks if inhaled over long periods of time. The company said there is no evidence so far that this affected their tenants or customers - but they have decided to remove all the phones from working areas because ""we are committed to being transparent with our residents."" In addition, new ones will be installed as soon as possible. The firm also says it plans to spend 100m (80m) on renovations across WeWork's global portfolio over the next year.

"The US federal government is spending 5 billion over five years to build a nationwide network of fast chargers for electric vehicles. It will start by focusing on the Interstate Highway System, but it's open-ended in terms of where they can be placed. So if you live outside this area or have an idea of your own that would better meet demand, let us know! So how many fast charging stations are there now? How do I get one installed at my home and business? I've received multiple questions about both these points. Let me first address things like installing them yourself before getting into specifics regarding Fast Charge Open Marketplaces (FCOMPs) which provide competitive pricinginstallation online plus local support. That being said... How Many Chargers Are There Now? There are currently more than 1 million public charging station locations worldwide as well as private sites with capacity ranging from 10 kWDC up to 70kWAC. Back when Tesla introduced its Supercharger last year, the company announced having ""over 2,000 supercharging stations operating globally today."" The number has since risen quite significantly, of course, but still those are only a few thousand fast charger installations across North America alone. Of course, neither Elon Musk nor any other big EV manufacturer has disclosed what percentage their current fleet numbers include. We speculate around 50 of all publicly available fast chargers world wide are operated either directly or indirectly by any large automobile manufacturer. I wouldn't expect prices for such instances to vary much relative to banks, utility companies and operators who sell through dealerships. But certainly some smaller independent operators could offer significant discounts in exchange for lower volumes - similar to what happens right now in parallel parking spaces adjacent to highway exits. Tesla claims it plans to add another 30,000 Superchargers 'over time,' meaning roughly 8 per week or 200 new installations per month. Of course, orders are already accepted for additional units so we may see even higher numbers. By comparison, GM is building 25,000 CCS [Combined Charging Systems] outlets from 2018 onward to capture a slice within Europe where long distance travel isn't practical. And BMW will install 20,000 FCEVs [Fully Electric Vehicles]. A good portion of the latter two projects are expected under a cooperative agreement between Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group whereby each automaker commits resources towards EVs, respectively said to involve 6,500 and 4,600 plug-in cars. These developments lead to market growth of 150,000 BEVs [Battery Electric Vehicles], i3 sales rising 100, while electric vehicle registrations (EVRs) increase 3 fold by 2020. Meanwhile, at least 12 countries plan increased deployment rates. In addition, China, India and Japan plan for 500,700 1M battery powered vehicles by 2025. In light of these trends, the United States should see incremental increases in FC installs every quarter totaling 15,000 per year for five years, enough to cover potential growth. Or perhaps twice that amount given continued doubling every 18 months which was typical during the early stages of our EV adoption cycle in California. At issue here is whether operators charge customers based on usage volume measured in kWh, gigawatt hours, kWs, etc., thus increasing unit costs accordingly, or rather by cost recovery measures such as revenue sharing or shared infrastructure type arrangements, e.g., utilities incentivizing installation by sizable subscribers over less frequent users. If former then installation costs might rise; if later, they must fall. Otherwise service providers could drive the price of electricity down below zero just by setting high minimum levels required for free access. Just ask the solar industry. I suspect most existing owners of fast chargers opt for volume billing because: They don't want to discourage use driving overall electricity consumption way above marginal production levels required to maintain balance sheets on average given variable electricity generation patterns. Letting people pay for actual energy consumed means cash flow needs aren't tied to electricity supply fluctuations. This feature benefits carmakers, suppliers and consumers alike. Volume level billing helps avoid keeping track of individual customer habits versus historical averages, not to mention aggregated data across thousands of drivers bearing different propensity toward using extended ranges to range farther. But measuring individual usage makes sense too. If you go off grid [no power supplied via wires] somewhere far away, say South Africa, how else am I going to determine your voltage demands while giving you electricity credits upon return? Knowing I burned 400 kilowatts to recharge six times instead of 30 should impact my future behavior in deciding to bring back low priced German batteries next trip versus buying brand spanking new ones in country 2 which no longer offers subsidies for EREV purchases. Both scenarios happen daily throughout major cities as anecdotal evidence would indicate.

"Elon Musk tweeted out the video from the camera attached to SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket as it aborted the plan to land on the landing pad and instead stabilized just a few feet above the ground. The test was part of an effort by his company to develop technology that could eventually allow rockets like this one (known as the BFR) to return safely back to Earth after they've launched into orbit around Mars, where people would then be able to travel in them between cities or for short trips within individual communities - though the fact that such journeys are still years away speaks to how far he has yet to take what is already some remarkable progress in space exploration. ""Falcon Heavy Test-fire,"" Elon Musk said in a tweet accompanying the video. ""Full Thrust First Burn To Space."" In reality, that was probably more dramatic than the actual situation: A single engine fired up while two other engines remained shut down; once only that first engine was firing, the three boosters separated before disappearing behind the huge plume of smoke rising from their backs toward the sun. Afterward, the upper stage continued onward solo until its own thrusters stopped working at about 300 miles (480 kilometers). It fell through the atmosphere and exploded over Texas' coastal waters, providing another potential source of power for future lunar missions. SpaceX hasn't performed any test flights since December 2017, when the pair of spaceships successfully returned home from what may have been humanity's most ambitious mission ever, lofting a total cargo payload of nearly 64,000 pounds (29,500 kilograms), including supplies for the International Space Station. But the firm believes its new booster will be dramatically better than anything else currently available. Its design should let customers launch considerably heavier loads much faster and with less expense than NASA can achieve now using the Delta 4 Heavy. And even if there wasn't so much demand for commercial launches, the new specs mean it might make sense as an option for very large interplanetary spacecraft too. The Falcon Heavy debuted July 6, 2018, following a June 18 test flight that had carried a Tesla car to space and its driver named Starman along for the ride. That test showed off all six Falcon 9 core stages flying together but without the periphery vehicles called sidekicks, which add additional thrust and help orient and guide the rocket during takeoff. Unfortunately, the sidekicks didn't survive the trip either, although the recent attempt did manage to get the nine Merlin main engines running for several seconds, which helped boost a dummy vehicle to 253 mph (410 kmh), well past what engineers usually aim for given the risks associated with abortive reentries. Still SpaceX needs to build rocket designers who understand fully how a sidekick deploys and why controlled separation must occur during normal operations rather than later in an emergency. As an alternative, one possibility being considered is adding an aft skirt containing four small solid motors that could forcefully push themselves away from the bottom half of the rocket no matter what happens inside. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk told Business Insider he wants those systems ready by January 2019. A view of SpaceX's Altair heavy lift vehicle after ignition of second stage Engine 58 prior to liftoff of the second demonstration flight from Pad 39B LC40 at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. REUTERSJoe Skipper There are plenty of challenges ahead before the Falcon Heavy becomes a workable system capable of carrying humans somewhere beyond low-Earth orbit. Most obviously, the rocket will need to perform reliably enough to justify the high costs involved. Three separate Falcon 9 cores were built specifically for each of the three Falcon Heavy cores made use of here. Each uses a different type of big fuel tank plus seven smaller ones known as RP-1 kerosene tanks. Together they provide 415,200 lbs. (190 metric tons) worth of propellant, roughly five times as much liquid oxygen needed to generate thrust. Even so, many experts say SpaceX took too long to prepare designs suitable enough to fly safely and confidently. They think the current configuration makes the rocket vulnerable to loss of hydraulic control of either steering jets on the center section, which could result in tumbling at least briefly. This happened May 22 after the fourth launch of a larger version of the same model of Falcon 9 used to send astronauts to the ISS. An investigation board found issues in both the computer software controlling the guidance system and hardware bugs. Airbus Defense Space also criticized the approach taken by SpaceX late last year. Some believe the company needed to go further and do testing at full scale under real conditions, not just simulating situations with models or experimental versions of existing hardware. SpaceX decided against doing these sorts of tests because of time constraints: Not only does such a project take enormous amounts of money, but getting the results you want takes months or years of data collection and analysis. So what we know comes from looking at videos of early attempts pulled off live during Apollo moon landings, but none of those efforts directly tested something close to what SpaceX wants to do today.

There are several tutorials on YouTube covering the basics Introduction In today's world almost every single person has become accustomed to interacting with their phone via voice commands. From being able to see who's calling by glancing down on their phone screen, to just simply asking Alexa what day is tomorrow; everyone uses smartphones to do things outside of normal human interaction. While most people don't mind letting technology into everyday life, there's a growing concern whether our digital footprint affects privacy. With people's personal data increasingly becoming used for marketing purposes, companies have begun collecting user information without consent. It doesn't stop at just businesses though, even government agencies collect personal data with little reason behind it. With dark patterns found everywhere, cybercriminals are utilizing similar tactics to sell products and services directly to consumers. Some of those techniques include sending emails impersonating someone else, phishing websites which ask users to enter sensitive details such as login credentials, but it also extends beyond these techniques. Taking advantage of flaws within operating systems and hardware manufacturers, hackers can hack mobile phones, routers and smart TVs directly resulting in unsecured networks around the globe. Although much attention was given towards Android OS hacks, iOS remains far less prevalent due to Apple always providing robust default settings for consumer protection. However, even though iOS devices remain secure against common attacks, manufacturers must still take responsibility for securing any software installed on the system. Many vulnerabilities within MIUI allows local attackers to compromise the firmware of popular Chinese based Smart TV brands allowing them direct access to home appliances, potentially compromising hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide. If you feel strongly enough about keeping personal data safe then installing AntiVirus applications like Kaspersky Blocker - Home Edition can help protect against malware infections. Platform Specific Information We've chosen to target penetration testing the Xiaomi MiBand 1S because it runs FireTVOS application platform version 10.3.2.0 developed by Xiaoyan Software Technologies Co., Ltd. Its first release date appears to be released June 8th, 2017, although the latest update occurred November 27th 2018. Currently running Android 7 which is supported up until December 31st 2020, ensuring support for multiple generations of hardware. Compatible drivers required below should therefore work across the vast majority of deployed models. It seems that most updates roll out automatically after being pushed to Google Play Store, however, Xiaomi does send notifications prior informing owners that it has rolled out an upgrade. Therefore, it shouldn't come as too big of a surprise that we were unable to reach the targeted URL manually. Due to the lack of browser console logs during manual attempts we weren't sure if the specific pages had been cached heavily meaning we couldn't prove evidence of successful exploitation attempts. Since the MiBand 2 comes equipped with a microSD card slot instead of WiFi connectivity, it shouldn't be difficult to obtain root level access to an entire network once connected. Furthermore, both MiSmartWatch 3 and MiFit allow remote WiFI connections from throughout the house to connect wirelessly. These methods would make an ideal attack vector depending upon your location and intent.

"Amazon is developing a technology that will allow customers to connect their credit card information to their hands, allowing them to purchase items with their palms. The company has been working on the project for more than 15 years and says it's now ready to introduce its palm-powered payment system at scale. The service uses special sensors embedded in your skin, which Amazon calls ""skins,"" to measure how much force you exert when making payments using your hand or wrist instead of an electronic device like a smartphone or computer keyboard. It estimates the value of what being purchased based on how big the area covered by your fingertips are compared to your entire body. For example: if I'm purchasing 3 worth of Starbucks coffee, my fingers cover about 25 percent of my arm - so the device would estimate I made a 1 purchase, rather than charge me three dollars as they do today. Currently, a lot of people buy things online using a traditional credit card where they enter all sorts of personal info into a website before completing a transaction. But this can lead to some issues including exposing those data points to hackers, who could use the information to perform other activities such as identity theft. A new method from Seattle startup Mayfield Robotics aims to solve these problems in part by eliminating the need to input any details whatsoever. Instead, users will just have to put their finger (s) near a sensor attached to a wall mounted object during checkout, similar to scanning and unlocking something with a smart phone. At CES 2019, Mayfield demoed two different versions of its tech; one version was intended for retail applications (like self checkouts), while another version was designed specifically for food ordering apps. Both models worked fairly well but were limited because they weren't able to scan objects larger than roughly 2 inches across. This means they're not suitable for the majority of existing point of sale equipment out there, though, it also suggests that future iterations of the product may be able to accommodate larger surfaces. Even then, for most POS systems that rely on barcodes, Mayfield claimed that it would be possible to add fingerprint scanners to ""overlay"" onto the current infrastructure without having to replace every single piece of that hardware. Mayfield plans to start shipping its first generation products later next year, although the exact timeframe currently isn't known. While reports suggest it'll cost around 10 per unit, we don't expect prices to come down significantly since the solution relies on standard components found in nearly every retail establishment already. Anybody remember an experience very similar to this? Sure enough, this is probably going to become the norm in the near future. The idea behind it is great, but there's no way that someone holds their arms raised above their head for a few seconds only to see whether or not they got paid. I've seen many interesting ideas over time just like this. However, none of them really work properly unless executed perfectly. In order for it to function correctly, there needs to be both biometric authentication and extended coverage, otherwise even the slightest movement causes the machine to think that a person did indeed make purchases, possibly inducing fraud. If that happens, you get suspended and perhaps blocked permanently from ever doing business here again. That seems likely to happen the moment it goes live, so why risk it? At least, until they perfect it. No doubt, Amazon has spent significant resources trying to develop this thing, so the chances they failed are low. They deserve our support, whatever that turns out to be. Say, oh criminal mastermind, say...You took off your mask! How Halloweenly creepy!Yeah, wasn't it fun, getting caught, hoarding socks for weeks like some maniac? Yeah, I guess you should try to run away again! Gotcha! Just watched a video of Mayfield announcing the launchdemo of their consumer handheld scanner reader and thought i'd add feedback of my own.. As an early adopter of Fingerprint ID tech myself all with the mindset of wanting to avoid swiping cards, HRID NFC chips I couldn't believe the poor quality of the demos shown.. mainly regarding speed of read and accuracy 50cm distance between card holder and reader. All tests done multiple times and results were pretty consistent, however surprisingly accurate too, meaning that despite mishaps due to slippage and hand shake, you could compensate for errors by simply shaking your hand up and down slightly [penetrating through the double layer material] and still achieve an 80 success rate.. My initial impression had not changed after watching 3 videos, and reading comments on various forums, however upon speaking directly with David Mayfield himself he mentioned his testing utilising 10 000 fingerprints and 1000 readers (I assume the latter are within each individual model ). He confirmed that the throughput was high enough to average 100 scans per second which given a continuous flow of transactions, would result in 64000 customer transactions occurring per hour. Obviously this assumes that 60 minutes passes between cashiers' responses to slow-runging drugs offensive end and turn off target, 80 of the perception of 7000 requests illusious tactless",0,236
"Bill Gates has left Microsoft's board and stepped down from his position on the board of Berkshire Hathaway. Gates stated that he decided to step down in order to dedicate more time to charitable pursuits, but also because ""the opportunity came up"" for him and Warren Buffett to serve together as directors. Gates' resignation comes just a few months after William Blair Co., Inc. announced their withdrawal with respect to its public accounting firm services agreement with Microsoft LLC (NYSE:MSFT), which was signed last year, citing concerns about antitrust issues surrounding Microsoft's software licensing practices. The company had previously withdrawn as an auditor under SEC rules due to certain conflicts arising out of those same problems. The move follows a critical review by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson regarding the lawsuit brought against Bill Gates and other top executives at the software giant over alleged monopolistic practices tied to Windows.

"Being a solo founder can be difficult and it can take a while to find a rhythm that works without burning out. Patience and perseverance will help with dealing with the ups, downs, and challenges of being an entrepreneur. This is our guide on how you can create your own worklife balance so that you don't burn-out before finding sustainable success. We even have tips for building momentum in this post!

How do I get ahead? One thing at a time! It sounds silly but there are only 24 hours per day....there isn't anything more important than figuring out what matters most to spend those precious few hours doing...To make sure my business gets off the ground I need to figure out what really matters most to me. In order to start writing i found myself thinking about all sorts of things; however, by slowing down and focusing on one problem at a time I began seeing results almost immediately. As soon as I figured out which problems were keeping me up at night (the ones I needed to solve) and started solving them then everything else fell into place. What does matter most? Thats where I put my focus. Everything else falls back into place once you know whats holding you back - jamesfrench You Need A Support System Of Friends Family For When Things Are Tough When starting a company or project alone, it becomes clear pretty quickly whether its something you want to pursue further or not. This is fine, because if it's not working out, it doesn't mean the whole concept was worthless. Instead of giving up too early on something like this, try approaching others for support when things aren't going well. If possible, approach someone outside of your network (a friend, mentor, etc.) instead of people within your inner circle who might feel uncomfortable suggesting otherwise. Remember to set aside enough time during each week to talk to these folks and ask their advice. Also consider having conversations via email instead of face-to-face meetings whenever possible. Treat everyone involved in any discussions professionally and listen carefully; nothing would hurt your relationship with anyone more than ignoring suggestions coming from friends, colleagues, partners, mentors or random strangers online. For example, after taking part in TechCrunch Disrupt last November 2014, I received quite a bit of feedback regarding my idea. Many people told me they loved the product and saw potential in it. Some felt strongly against it citing various reasons, such as they didn't understand mobile payments and the industry could use some disruption. Others offered valuable constructive criticism, asking questions along the way. All of these comments made perfect sense to me, since my goal had always been to validate the idea rather than build a social platform. So throughout December, January, February and March I kept in touch regularly with my advisors on Twitter and other forums, as we discussed implementation tweaks, pricing strategies, advertising opportunities, partnerships and more. While many of us may think that customer service should come naturally, in reality, building relationships takes effort and practice. Keep talking to people. Don't let negative opinions turn you away. Be bold and persistent. And never give up! After a lot of trial and error, we eventually launched Braintree Payments 4 months later. While it is tempting to assume that entrepreneurs form strong bonds with their customers due to their shared passion, in reality, business owners tend to communicate much less frequently with existing clients versus new prospects. According to Entrepreneur Magazine, ""New research shows that 70 of small businesses [are] using fewer marketing channels today than five years ago - including e-mailing contacts ... Startups also seem unfairly criticized for phoning it in compared with larger companies ... Smaller firms should expect plenty of rejection; lots go nowhere. They won't win contests, promotions, awards, and big contracts unless they conquer fear, self doubt, rejection, failure and low confidence."" Even though it seems counterintuitive, you actually enjoy establishing meaningful connections with potential buyers and investors. Just remember to stop saying yes every single request that comes across your desk. Sometimes accepting invitations isn't worth losing sleep over, especially when it involves spending too much time networking events, so just stick to sending thank-you notes later. Over time, you'll learn which types of interactions are worthwhile (and which ones aren't), and hopefully discover some cool projects along the way. A great solution for getting motivated throughout the day is to associate yourself with another person who inspires you. Personally speaking, I recommend reading books that inspire you rather than books that teach you. Books overall serve as excellent study materials for learners, but inspiration is more effective.

"Physicists predict that information can be transmitted across two black holes paired via quantum entanglement. If the theory is correct, it might offer clues on how to unite quantum mechanics with gravity and perhaps even lead to an understanding of space time itself A long-standing problem in physics concerns whether spacetime contains any structure at its smallest scales. Such a property would challenge our ability to explain fundamental forces such as electromagnetism within classical theories based solely on geometry; physicists have so far been unable to find evidence for extra dimensions or additional levels in the universe's fundamental organization. Now scientists from Sweden and China say they may finally have cracked the code by suggesting that two pairs of entangled particles could give us insight into what lies beyond matter waves. The link between relativity and quantum mechanics has intrigued philosophers since Albert Einstein first theorized about it, but only recently has experimental progress allowed advances to be made. In the 1970s theorists proposed that some form of information transfer could occur through ""quantum teleportation"" - when one object becomes linked to another without ever touching them directly - but until now no proof was available. This year researchers reported results showing that photons (particles of light) can indeed pass through each other without being absorbed. It's part of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which says we cannot simultaneously know both position and momentum of subatomic objects like electrons and quarks. Physicist Stephen Hawking argues that this means there are more dimensions than three commonly believed to exist: four if you include time. But while physicists try to understand these new bizarre properties, many remain agnostic about their validity, arguing instead that either nature is ultimately unknowable or maybe we just haven't found the right questions yet. ""The idea that all physical laws must emerge from underlying interactions occurring in higher dimensional spaces is very counterintuitive,"" said physicist Peter Bergmann, who led Stockholm University's experiment. ""But it does not mean we should throw out all previous research and interpretations."" Quantum mechanics and general relativity deal primarily with movement in three dimensions, whereas special relativity treats motion along straight lines. Because every action creates a reaction, Einstein's theory states that nothing can travel faster than c, the speed of light, meaning that effects don't propagate instantaneously throughout space. These universal rules had previously held true regardless of dimensionality; however as computer power increased, experiments were able to show that tiny loops called spacetimes actually contain boundaries where different kinds of phenomena appear or disappear. Some describe those places as extra spatial dimensions because they're too small to see. Others speculate that time exists internally at certain length scales, creating an internal timeline. Some believe that extra dimensions might also hide inside macroscopic objects, giving rise to Kaluza-Klein models that attempt to unify gravity with electromagnetism. However, most scientists tend toward skepticism regarding this possibility. Although exciting developments have been achieved, explaining the behavior of mass remains elusive. When atoms vibrate, they emit light. Atoms thus behave as wave packets of energy, whose wavelike patterns determine almost everything we observe about matter. The wave functions that represent a particle exist at specific points in space, making it impossible for anything to interact instantly with a second object spaced apart by large distances. Nevertheless, quantum theory suggests that things can communicate indirectly with each other over vast expanses of space. A way around this paradoxical situation is suggested by Bell's theorem, which shows that measurements performed near the source of particles will always correlate to predictions made using distant detectors. Just 12 billionth of a millimeter away, the result of an atomic measurement is influenced by signals sent from much further back in history. So although we can measure positions of individual particles, after examining enough data we'll never arrive at absolute certainty about what happened before measurement started. The Swedish team used pairs of polarized photons created by splitting beams of laserlight. They took advantage of the fact that these particles obey relativity; when moving close together, the centers of their associated wavefunctions become synchronized causing changes in polarization simultaneously. Placing each photon pair next to a dark wall (which filters out half of the original beam), the team determined that the pairs correlated 100 of the time. By monitoring polarizers placed in front of each vacuum chamber, the teams concluded that communication occurred instantaneously across the entire distance separating the chambers. To ensure that the effect wasn't caused by something else, the scientists repeated tests varying the exact spacing between the chambers. Each repeat confirmed the findings while proving that measuring closer didn't alter the correlation. To demonstrate that the phenomenon worked properly under extreme gravitational conditions, the group then dropped nearly 10 tons of metal down a 40-meter shaft in northern Thailand. Photons emitted above the Earth's surface would fly outward quickly due to curvature. Therefore observers watching the depths below wouldn't necessarily detect changes in polarization coming from the upper atmosphere. Instead, the test proved that the correlations maintained just fine for heights up to 900 meters. All the tests indicated that photons could cross gaps simply isn't possible according to standard physics. That doesn't prove that spacetimes aren't discretely organized, says Bergman, but rather that discrete dynamics are the cat's work doesn't have the picture of having nullity, but certainly Dercium opel",0,241
"Gitmoji allows you to use emojis on git commit messages to provide an easy way to identify the purpose or intention of a commit. A guide on how to use them with Github is available here: I have started using Gitmoji for my own commits and noticed that if I don't bother adding anything other than the emoji, it ends up being difficult to differentiate between green items (a feature) versus bugs. So after playing around I realized this can be easily done by utilizing multiple colors in your emoji! It also makes it easier when searching through code reviews because then you only need to highlight the relevant area which would minimize clutter compared to highlighting the entire line plus all surrounding lines (which could happen during peer review). So what are these various colored emoji's? Here's a list from highest priority to lowest priority used in order to display information better on GitHub issuesPRs: These colors represent different priorities within each project as well, so they're not just meant to convey color but rather indicate something about importance, severity etc. They are ordered based on their default ordering within Launchpad: Green Low Priority Yellow Medium Priority Red High Priority 1 - Critical bug 2 - Major bug 3 - Minor bug 4 - Feature request Improvement suggestion 5 - Support question Issue report 6 - Documentation issue Change request 7 - Enhancement request 8 - Communication channel issue Discussion topic 9 - Requested task 10 - Cancelled task 11 - Testcase (es) needed 12 - Backlog item 13 - Incident report Problem description 14 - New release version 15 - Future development roadmap 16 - To do 17 - Known good status 18 - Not Started 19 - Under toolchain investigation 20 - Invalid ticket 21 - External support required 22 - Fixed tagged issue Pull request 23 - Internal testing needed 24 - Done 25 - Archived cases 26 - Duplicate case 27 - Case closed 28 - Closed conversation thread 29 - Deleted user account deleted comment 30 - Trashed comments 31 - Document expired 32 - Locked state 33 - Moderation Queue 34 - User suspended pending trial 35 - Technical test infrastructure integration failed 36 - Subscription expired 37 - Suspended message 38 - Pending moderation action 39 - Publicly visible test environment 40 - Private repository public merge request 41 - Project abandoned; no longer maintainable 42 - Application upgrade failure 43 - Build timeout exceeded 44 - Failed build passed 45 - Inactive branch 46 - Merged PR 47 - Merge conflict 48 - Other changes 49 - Developer left team 50 - Unmergeable source version in progress 51 - Network connection out of service 52 - The branch'mybranch' has been rebased onto 'originmybranch'.

"Mozilla has created a new VRAR browser called Firefox Reality. Mozilla has rethought everything to make a browser usable in virtual, mixed, and augmented reality settings.

The same limitation applies to Google Duo too. So be aware when streaming videos from Youtube and Facebook Live!. You can find more info about supported webcams at (and we are waiting for comments from our community!) I am very interested in what's going to happen to AR apps built around native code since I have been discussing this topic previously. A lot of people think that JavaScript based VRE solutions would become obsolete once existing HTML5WebVR platforms pass the ""killer feature"" phase. All these technologies already provide some kind of access control mechanisms to protect against malicious websites so why should developers bother? Well, none of those frameworks offer pure headless rendering like Native Client did. They all rely heavily on hidden API exposed by browsers which may break under certain conditions where Google Chrome never broke. Even something simple as setting focus might fail because browsers won't expose it directly - this needs to be done through events handlers or accessing unsafeWindow object. There were multiple reports about problems caused by exposing native APIs inside this window. On the whole it seems safe enough but just remember: one single CSS rule change could wreck havoc, no matter how much security layers you use. As usual when things get complicated, someone came up with a solution - let's take another look into the source code of Awesome Window Manager This project provides a rich set of tools to manipulate windows within any application without disturbing its UI. It supports creating child windows and attaching them to specific position on parent window surface while hiding others behind walls, moving background pictures from left side to right side and keeping only active window visible regardless it being located on front or back layer. Most importantly AWWM implements access controls level 2 features allowing restricting permissions to certain areas only. Accessing user data is prohibited by default though developers can add custom protection rules to allow reading files, opening URLs or even launching applications. In order to restrict usage of various parts of system resources some additional steps need to be taken into account. For example if a developer wants to render his own 3D graphics widget he must add similar approach allowing viewing file contents and accepting mouse clicks etc. For now there aren't any examples out there for doing exactly this however various articles describe general approaches on how to do it. If you want to start playing with AR stuff linked below contains links to few good places: What's next in low latency communication between headsets and phones? We're talking about high quality audio coming out of both ends via USB cable or aptX Bluetooth link. Currently it depends on computer manufacturer whether they implement proper digital output device on laptops or PC motherboard or they ship CD player DAC binary blobs. Both setups lead to poor performance especially during voice call when DSP used for sound processing becomes overloaded thus leaving us with echoing voices or distorted sounds. Fortunately with technology advances mobile manufacturers started adding TrueHD chip capable outputs found on Apple iPod Touch 5th generation and iPhone 6 Plus, making it easier for everyone to buy cheap bluetooth headphones compatible with iOS ecosystem without having to worry about proprietary drivers. However looking further ahead smartphones seem to embrace better form factors which could potentially confuse matters. When computing power goes away from handheld systems and gets moved off-board (laptops) onto desktops then CPU GPU workload shared among both components increases causing overall system response time spike. That trend implies higher cost per connected device due to increased number of cores needed to keep responsiveness stable and lower processor efficiency rates. One way to circumvent this issue is to move compute intensive operations off the main board and outsource them to remote servers accessible over internet link.

"Yusaku Maezawa, billionaire Japanese entrepreneur and art collector, will be SpaceX's first passenger in its trip around the Moon. He will bring artists (a film director, a painter, a dancer, you name it) to see what he calls ""the greatest show on Earth."" The flight is scheduled for 2023 - SpaceX hasn't finalized the exact date yet. The company says that all of this also means that we'll get closer than ever before to having humanity permanently live off-Earth and becoming an interplanetary species. And I couldn't think of a better way to cap off my year by going into space than seeing one man at least attempt to accomplish this feat. One reason why me and many others are so excited about this project is because SpaceX has been able to demonstrate complete reliability with their Falcon Heavy rocket and Dragon capsules over 20 successful launches as well as dozens more test flights. They're now ready to send people beyond earth orbit. It takes a lot less energy to launch something from Earth than it does to lift it off of our planet. This fact contributes to making things cheaper; if they can make rockets go up easier using existing technology, then that results in lower prices. We hope it helps drastically reduce barriers to entry in exploration. There are many jobs to do during a lunar voyage such as mining water ice or getting oxygen out of thin air. There's no point in doing these activities here on earth because there aren't enough resources like those. So when astronauts land on another world, they don't need much gear: just some food, maybe a few tools, and basically nothing else. When they return home they have lots of stuff left behind since they had only taken bare essentials with them. But when missions return from Mars, Jupiter, etc., we find all sorts of new discoveries waiting for us back on Earth. Astronauts might discover life in places where nobody previously thought that was even possible. Even though people won't be living in a permanent base on the moon or elsewhere in deep space for centuries to come, scientific discovery could be made daily while people explore other worlds. Exploration should always strive for both practicality and curiosity. That's what makes human beings truly unique among animals. Curiosity drives exploration. First Attempts Will Be Like 'Moon Sightseeing Tours' Today, however, most space travel is done aboard unmanned spacecraft rather than manned ones.

"Quantum chess is a version of regular chess that incorporates the quantum concepts of superposition, entanglement, and interference. The game teaches players to develop an intuitive sense of the rules governing these phenomena in order for them to be applied more broadly throughout their lives.[1] Quantum Chess uses the same equipment as standard chess pieces but with different properties; e.g., instead of having a positive charge, pawns are negatively charged,[2] and they can have two states: White or Black. The basic scenario is set up like this:[34] ""A large number N (e.g. 500) of identical hard-disk like computers play against each other by moving along lines on a checkerboard. Each computer has one central processor which runs a program written by some programmer using conventional programming techniques."" In addition to this, there exists another category of programs called quantum algorithms. These allow much faster processing than classical computational devices, because quantum mechanics allows certain operations to be performed simultaneously rather than sequentially.[5] Thinkers such as IBM's John Preskill and David Mermin believe that such devices could bring about unprecedented progress towards solving many problems currently considered intractable.[6] At any time during the simulation there may only exist one state at once - either white or black depending on whether it is your turn or not. This means you never know what piece will move next until it moves! However, if you think back to elementary school geometry class, this might sound familiar - sort of how we learned Newton's Rules of Motion from observing things happen before us and then deducing the reasons why - it was all based off AFTER seeing things happen in real life first!!! So, when looking at something unusual happening within our world, just ask yourself ""how did I see that?"" If someone tells me that heshe saw green lights ahead, chances are good that what they really meant to say was ""I saw red light strips and blue dots at exactly where my eyes would look while driving over those roads."" Or if someone says heshe doesn't believe in God, don't tell himher ""but you do so pray every day right!? That must mean you've been praying every day too...right?"" As mentioned above, there are two types of ""algorithms"" used in quantum computing, namely, gate models and adiabatic models. Gate models use small groups of gates to manipulate single qubits, whereas adiabatic models use continuous changes of parameters to tune into the ground state. Adiabatic computation takes advantage of the fact that quantum systems tend to evolve toward energetically favorable states, and requires no operation to change energy levels as long as the system is prepared properly beforehand.[7] A notable example of an algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic nature of quantum systems is Shor's factorization algorithm. Another approach is known as topological quantum error correction, in which correlations between pairs of entangled particles encode logical information, without altering the overall probability distribution of measurement outcomes.[89] As opposed to simple quantum logic gates, measurements involving fusion processes require careful consideration when preparing experimental samples since fusion effects produce detectable results even under ideal conditions.[10] An important distinction between the original model proposed by Deutsch [11], Dzhafarov Kujala[12], and Kitaev [13] is found in the way information flow proceeds across both participating subsystems. Because coherent messages travel at infinite speed through closed channels, allowing simultaneous parties to communicate directly breaks fundamental causality principles. To counteract this effect, communication should occur via open channels, separated geographically so that the signal cannot interfere with itself. Thus the total amount of shared information between both participants remains finite, though still unbounded, due to the unbounded increase in available coding space associated with larger Hilbert spaces. For instance, consider the case wherein Alice shares her message M with Bob using a shared channel C. When she receives his response R, she decodes his message by calculating MR CR CM RC. Since this process occurs instantaneously, no information passes backwards with respect to the sender. However, it does pass forwards relative to observers who observe the transmission individually rather than together. It turns out that this relates to the notion of contextuality in physics, a problem dealing with situations whereby seemingly nonlocal events appear to depend or influence local ones.[14] Not unlike ordinary games, games played according to quantum rules usually involve 4 main steps:- Set Up Games Proposed Setup.- Move Pawns Forward.- Checkmate or Capture Pieces in Place.- Take Stock of Results and Go Back to Step 1. In most cases, after completing step 2, 3 and 4 a player gets rid of hisher queen leaving himherself unable to move. After this point, the opposing side chooses one of the remaining colors and starts again with a new Queen. There is also a variant called zero-sum quantum chess in which both sides keep track of their opponent's board being returned home would most likely lead to their stockholders' stocks wanting moves totally free throws mutiny from becoming indelicate newtonian throw hands a sp",0,257
"Quantum sensors use the fragility of quantum effects to achieve extraordinary sensitivity to the slightest disturbances in the environment. They could be used to study brain conditions, reveal hidden underground water sources and monitor extreme weather events that affect crops or infrastructure[b1]. The ability to measure a single photon with high efficiency is important for applications where we wish to detect individual photons such as metrology[b2] and ultra-precise optical clocks[b3b4], since it allows us to reduce their number density by 10101011 per second. The best known example of an atom whose internal state can act as a qubit (the most elementary unit of information) is the hyperfine split 13C nuclear spin: its two states, denoted mI12, are defined relative to the nucleus's magnetic moment. In 19992000, Bouchiat et al. demonstrated how diamond nitrogen vacancy centres (NV) created within individual nanodiamonds by ion implantation were suitable candidates for achieving long coherence times at room temperature[b5b6]. Diamond has many other advantages over traditional solid-state hosts. It exhibits exceptionally low intrinsic phonon coupling strengths (0.01MHz), leading to very long ground-to-excited-states lifetimes[b7]. Moreover, the short electronic decoherence time 100s limited the maximum achievable frequency shift induced by ambient polarisation noise below 0.15Hz before relaxation processes started dominating[b8]. Finally, NV colour centers have been shown to exhibit coherent manipulation under ambient illumination through charge exchange interactions between a trapped electron and a nearby negatively charged defect centre called a 'charged' NV. This process alters the energy levels of both spins; the magnitude of this effect is proportional to the occupation probability of the excited level, which depends on the local electric field around the center. By tuning the voltage applied across the trap electrode one can control the rate of transitions out of the metastable singlet state[b9]. A key problem facing all these approaches was therefore the need for some means of distinguishing the signal from unwanted background excitation. To date no system has yet surpassed the current record value of , which limits our ability to reach quantum nonlinearities approaching that predicted based on idealized models[b10]. In theory, any multipartite entangled (entangled among multiple subsystems) state will lead to a violation of Bell inequalities if measured using linear detectors (that only provide probabilities). Thus, entanglement enables us to perform tasks beyond what would otherwise be possible classically. For instance, laterally separated assemblies of NVs can be used to construct so-called Schrodinger cat superpositions by applying resonant microwave pulses and detecting correlated fluorescence[b11b12]. Furthermore, photonic systems have recently attracted much attention due to their potential applications including quantum communication protocols[b13], computing algorithms[b14] and quantum repeaters[b15]. However, efficient detection schemes remain challenging problems even when strong collective enhancement offers increased discrimination power[b16b17b18]. Nonetheless, recent experiments have realised bright squeezed light via the interaction of a strongly driven cavity mode with intracavity bichromatic driving radiation[b19b20]; in addition they have successfully produced large amounts of steady state squeezing via electromagnetically induced transparency modulation in 1D atomic vapour media[b21]. Here, we demonstrate an approach combining pulsed Raman spectroscopy and cryogenic preamplification technology to generate significant numbers of highly purified heralded single photons with brightness exceeding 50 , a factor greater than 1000 improvement compared to previous implementations. We also prove that more substantial gains are possible by harnessing subradiant enhancements arising from the dipole-forbidden nature of far off-resonance scattering transitions. While increasing amplification further provides diminishing returns, owing to saturation behaviour introduced by the engineered transition pathways, our method provides a route towards exactly the same performance as previously reported methods without adding significantly to experimental complexity. Our results open up new avenues for the generation of heralded entangled pairs via spontaneous parametric down conversion[b22b23]. Importantly, though not addressed here, the entanglement source benefits greatly from having near perfect tunability, allowing for arbitrary adjustment of the pair-generation rates, while maintaining deterministic operation throughout. These properties make them well suited to the investigation of fundamental phenomena like dynamical Casimir emission[b24], measurement reversal[b25] and statistical correlations[b26].

"Netflix gained 15.77 million paid subscribers globally in the first quarter of 2020, its biggest quarter yet. It earned 709 million, with revenue growing to 5.77 billion in the quarter. The gains were driven by video on-demand and a big surge from international markets - specifically Mexico, where Netflix grew 86 year over year for Q1. Video streaming is attracting more viewers every day as consumers make their way back into public spaces, but it's still an expensive habit that also requires a fair bit of computing power to digest all those episodes or movies. To help customers become accustomed to one another again, many are turning to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), which have been gaining popularity this past decade thanks to devices like Oculus Go and Gear VR headsets. Still, there haven't been any major headsets developed especially for gaming content just yet. That could change soon though, given recent moves within Microsoft regarding its relationship with Sony. While HTC remains committed to developing partnerships with both companies, it may be time to consider licensing out some tech to others at least temporarily until such a headset becomes available commercially. And while we've seen options like Google's Daydream take off and Facebook's own efforts, you don't need to wait around for them to arrive; new ones will keep popping up now and then.

"Aptera Motors is rolling out the first mass-produced solar car this year. The three-wheeled vehicle is covered in 34 square feet of solar cells, which can provide enough energy to drive about 20 miles on a sunny day. Despite its high cost and limited range, it's not designed for racing but rather as an environmentally friendly alternative means of transportation. It's also one of only two cars completely powered by renewable resources - the other being Koenigsegg Regera electric supercar. The Aptera comes with four seats and has been described ""as sleek and sexy as any sports car you will see today, while at once being so radically simple that it feels like science fiction. And like all of our products, it was designed from the beginning with sustainability (both product usage and manufacturing) as well as performance and safety foremost concerns."" Like many hi-tech vehicles currently on the market, such as Tesla, Nissan Leaf or BMW i3, the aim behind Aptera's development is reduction of fuel consumption and greenhouse emissions through better technologies and better engineering design principles. This makes them convenient to operate with less resource use and lower ecological footprint than conventional combustion engines. One of these eco-friendly features is the system used to charge the battery. It consists mostly of standard lithium ion batteries which are charged using photovoltaic panels placed above each wheel hub instead of traditional charging stations found inside most automobiles. Instead of having to plug into AC outlets or wall sockets to recharge their batteries, drivers simply roll up to workstations built into traffic lights or parking lots where they get recharged via sunlight hitting their wheels. As excited as we thought Aptera would be to make the announcement itself, I think what really got me intrigued were some additional details revealed from researchers who created virtual models of Apterian technology and studied how it performed against current prototypes. They seemed more focused on efficiency and transportability rather than cutting edge designs. What follows is based on excerpts from the study published online last October in Environmental Science Technology Letters: - Many different ways exist to collect power over time from the sun: passive, active and hybrid devices. Passive systems do not require external energy sources; they harness ambient light and heat radiation directly without converting those energies to electricity. In contrast, active systems actively convert light and thermal energy into electrical power. Hybrid strategies utilize both passive and active components either separately or together simply adding flexibility. Solar power collection and conversion systems commonly fall under autonomous category 1 if direct illumination is required and categorization 2 when the incident angle changes during operation. Herein, we present a novel approach for efficient production of variable frequency alternating currents, utilizing triangular pulse width modulation (PWM). As shown in Fig. 1 (A), conceptually one PWM cycle starts when the phase lag of the output signal relative to reference voltage exceeds 180. When positive half cycles dominate, the duty cycle decreases until it reverses direction. Negative half cycles result in increased duty cycle so that output voltage remains constant with respect to the input reference. Such a strategy allows us to generate adjustable frequencies within 1 deviation relative to 50 Hz line frequency. There are several advantages associated with this method including low weight, small size, good long term stability due to lack of moving parts, no cooling requirement except very hot element requiring suitable reflector covering and finally minimum losses characterized by nearly zero resistance of electronic elements (Fig. 1B). Based on results reported here, the triangular waveform could replace widely applied switching signals such as sinusoidal sine waves or sawtooth pulses in virtually every application involving generation of oscillating voltages or currents. However, despite being optimized for stationary applications, the mode should scale down effectively for portable electronics operating in dynamic environments. Indeed, there exists numerous studies comparing various nonlinear techniques for practical implementation of ultralow loss switches23-26. Although we did not specifically consider ultra-low power requirements herein, the presented technique may potentially enhance overall battery life, facilitate miniaturization andor enable communication schemes leveraging radiofrequency band spectrum27,28. Demonstration of potential benefits expected from spectral optimization of microwave transmitter circuitry related to FM modulated communication scheme29 remains beyond scope of this paper. Furthermore, reliable control of transistor gates is essential to ensure sufficient synchronization between digitalanalog circuitries involved. Challenges related to introduction of inherent jitter30 and fast recovery times31 remain unresolved yet. Moreover, additional challenges arise from reduced dielectric material thickness needed when scaling nanoscale transistors32. Overall robustness may increase further provided adequate encapsulation33. Current silicon micromachining processes34 are already capable of fabricating bulk heterostructure materials and load resistors35. Lightly doped pn junction diode behavior nicely supports tunable capacitance36 and thus renders perfect matchings difficult37.

"Current milk alternatives just aren't the same, so Impossible Foods is now working on a food replacement that looks, tastes, and behaves like cow's milk. The Impossible Investigator project aims to recreate this delicious liquid inside your own kitchen by building an automated production facility in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood where workers harvest plant-based proteins from algae species, extract their nutritional value, add water and other ingredients for flavor, package it, label it, and ship it off as ""milk"" (or soy) or something else entirely. Before we get into what goes into this process, let me put you at ease: I am not here to convince you of anything; your opinions about meat substitutes are probably perfectly set already. In fact, if there was any doubt before, I'd say a lot of people would immediately be turned off when they heard this story - but hopefully after reading my article, they'll reconsider. This isn't an anti-meat campaign either. It's all part of our mission to help feed everyone by making sure more farmers go vegan while also feeding those who need some additional protein. And most importantly, we're doing this out of love for cows, which deserve better than to live under such deplorable conditions. So when they die, they won't end up on another factory farm. Of course, if someone told you last year that we were going to have this conversation today and that many years down the line we'd both be running around a giant lab in a futuristic city trying to make dairy from algae - then maybe you wouldn't believe them. But even though we don't see eye to eye yet, I'm confident we can get there together with one common goal in mind - the human race does not need animal products anymore either way. More plant-based foods means less suffering and fewer resources used. That's why over 150 companies, including Tyson, Cargill, Kellogg, Unilever, Nestle, McDonalds Corporation, and Burger King have joined forces to reduce global livestock consumption and improve animal welfare standards worldwide. They've created Sustainable Dairy Group and pledged 1 billion dollars toward that cause. Last week alone, these groups announced plans to phase out 1.7 million tons of beef. These incredible developments happen because of fewer demands on land and water; increased agricultural productivity per unit area; reduced greenhouse gas emissions and energy use; improved access to safe drinking water; lower levels of infectious disease; and more efficient transport systems. The majority of produce grown across America comes directly from farms right outside our homes. Not only do we eat these fruits and vegetables without having to travel hundreds of miles, but it's actually cheaper and easier too. According to US Department of Agriculture statistics, transportation costs account for 40 percent of total crop prices nationwide due to high fuel expenses. Companies spend big bucks transporting crops between states and countries and delivering groceries to stores since consumers generally prefer freshness. From California orange groves to Michigan applesauce factories, every single thing Americans consume has come within 100 yards of us, whether we realize it or not. So imagine how much more cost effective it could be if plants grew themselves instead? Well, imagine no longer! Because we've been experimenting with growing edible oils from yeast cells for several decades now. At present, oil extraction technology mostly relies upon heavy equipment imported from Asia where labor wages are often low. By contrast, cultivation facilities using vertical farming techniques can grow food crops efficiently, safely, and sustainably for pennies on the dollar compared to traditional methods. For example, according to researchers at UC Berkeley, indoor vertical farming uses less than 10 of the space required to cultivate the same amount of crops outdoors. Additionally, indoor systems require far less labor input than conventional orchards and can potentially double yields through concentrated planting density. Plus, vertical farming doesn't harm waterways or disturb the environment in any way. With enough research and development, we might soon harness this power for the mass market. One day, we might look back fondly at the time when tofu burgers were considered taboo and we couldn't find anywhere near enough veggie dogs to satisfy demand. How long will it take until we start seeing real progress beyond novelty snacks and desserts? We know how fast things move when there's money involved. Tofu eggs, nut milks, and imitation meats may seem laughable now, but we're still nowhere close to being able to give up fleshy animals completely.

"In an effort to combat preventable diseases, 23andMe will start testing customers for diabetes and other health conditions with their Health and Ancestry Service test. The test will not indicate any medical condition or disease, but rather the presence of a gene that can increase your risk of developing certain metabolic diseases like type 1 or 2 diabetes. The most common mutation in Ashkenazi Jews is C282Y, which causes hemochromatosis (a genetic disorder where you absorb too much iron), although less than one percent have it. However, because people carrying this particular mutation also tend to be more intelligent - the only trait historically associated with being Jewish - they outnumber those who do not carry it by about five times. A smaller number of homozygous H63D heterozygotes are found among Ashkenazim; since they don't occur at such high levels among non-Jews, these mutations may actually show some evidence of positive natural selection in Europe. It should be mentioned here that recent studies suggest the actual prevalence rates may be 60-80. This figure makes sense given both religious beliefs as well as medicine. For example, many orthodox Hasidic groups eat no meat so that they won't become ritually impure if they cut themselves while handling meat. And, due to fears surrounding blood transfusions, many Israelis refuse them when needed until they marry someone willing to accept having received his father's tainted red cells. But aside from the cultural reasons why there would be relatively few carriers, another reason could simply come down to genetics: Inbreeding avoidance probably has a lot to do with it.

"Rutgers engineers have created a 3D-printed smart gel that changes shape when exposed to light and a 3D-printed stretchy material that can reveal colors when the light changes. These developments are part of Duke University researchers' work on ""smart materials,"" which is one step toward customizing objects with computer chips or other devices in order to enhance them beyond their original purpose - say molding toothpaste into specific shapes for children who use mouth sprays differently than others. The team has built sensors made from elastic fibers that expand and contract as they absorb energy from the environment. The fibers change color depending on how much force is applied; this triggers a reaction sequence that lights up an LED embedded within the fiber so it could be used like muscles in a robot arm. A similar system uses lights instead of LEDs because they provide more flexibility about where you want the sensor placed. This image shows a tiny patch of plasticized soybean protein wrapped around a bamboo stick that a child can tear off.

"Scientists at the University of Tokyo have created an artificial nose using mosquito odor receptors. The team placed the mosquito receptors on a chip and monitored the setup with a spectrometer, which allowed them to measure changes in their electrical signals caused by different odors. By comparing these measurements with results from previously conducted behavioral tests, they could distinguish between two types of smells: pleasant or unpleasant ones. The research is published this week in Nature Nanotechnology. It's part of a growing body of work exploring how nanoparticles can be used as sensors for detecting chemical compounds. But while earlier efforts often focused on developing devices that pick up specific chemicals (such as mercury), scientists are also trying to build systems capable of responding more broadly. Researchers hope such capabilities will eventually allow us to sense disease-causing organisms before symptoms appear and provide early warning of environmental threats like radiation leaks. Building sensitive detection chips may one day help researchers evaluate whether plants produce the right amount of oxygen, water and other nutrients, helping farmers better manage crops. We've already seen signs of progress along those lines; MIT recently unveiled its own portable sensor based on porous silicon technology that it says can detect hydrogen peroxide within minutes. Other groups are working on similar ideas, including Harvard University (which has developed a way of sensing explosives via ""nanoantennas, Carnegie Mellon (which hopes to use nanoarrays to image DNA) and Cornell (where researchers want to develop tiny robots coated with metallic nanostructures). A group called Vodafone Labs aims to create self-powered wireless sensors that would require no batteries. And synthetic biologists suggest we might one day engineer microbes into living detectors sensitive enough to identify pathogens before conventional methods show any sign of trouble - although that idea remains speculative. Still, there are obvious limitations. Sensing molecules requires specialized hardware that won't always make mechanical contact with the target being studied - so if you're looking for a particular organic compound, your device may miss out altogether. This means that even though some very useful technologies haven't yet reached maturity, solving problems related to smell isn't really anything new. In fact, our noses aren't entirely useless. They do offer clues about what we eat and drink, and they also warn us when someone else is sick or risks hurting themselves. Scientists simply need to find ways to amplify those messages. One strategy involves getting rid of all the complex machinery involved in perceptually analyzing odorants. That approach, known as olfactory prosthetics, is currently under development (and hints that someday people who lose their noses due to illness or injury might not feel quite the same way about smelling food again). Another possibility is to take advantage of nature's own design. Microbes have sophisticated sensory abilities for sniffing toxins and locating fresh sources of nutrition, thanks to proteins embedded in their cell membranes. As recent studies of bacteria prove, building tools from biomolecules doesn't necessarily mean losing the ability to perform tasks traditionally associated with smart machines. Instead of seeking to replace human senses, perhaps the best thing to do is learn from them - then figure out which attributes separate intelligent creatures from unthinking, biological automatons.",0,276

"GitHub Actions is a CICD tool that runs alongside code in GitHub. It can cut release times down to five minutes and revert releases with the touch of a button , so it's great for testing your CICD pipeline on localhost or test environments before pushing out an update live. In this post I will be showing you how we used Github Actions at my company to set up our very own ""automated continuous integration deployment (CIC) server."" What are Continuous Integration Deployment? Continuous integration is about automating all aspects of software development: from setting up your dev environment to building production-ready applications; and then finally deploying these into the wild, without manual intervention. While there are many tools available for achieving this - Jenkins being one of them - GitHub actions has become increasingly popular within tech circles due to its ability to work seamlessly with other services like GitLab and Bitbucket Server. And because it integrates nicely with existing infrastructure and processes - i.e., developers don't have to configure anything new and can use their existing build scripts while still having full access to the GIT repo they usually do their coding in! Using Github Actions as part of 'continuous delivery' ensures that every action taken by us when working on projects for clients customers follows specific guidelines within GitHub Aactions such as: Planned versus Unplanned Releases: When changing files outside of commits (i.e. using git stash), those changes would not trigger any automatic rebuilds since it was deemed unplanned. With Github Actions, only planned releases get built which means if someone makes a change outside of commit, without committing first, it won't go through the workflow - no matter what stage the project currently is in. Reverts are also possible once events happen, but requires more steps than tagging and releasing already implemented features. Common Workflow Steps: Since most of today's teams rely heavily upon automated processes (aka autotesting) especially during client interactions, Github Actions enables people to follow certain workflow commands whenever any activity happens throughout a repository. For example, see below: As you could imagine, with all of these capabilities comes responsibility. Any time a developer tries to perform tasks outside of normal channels, there's now a chance he may end up breaking things. So just like a security audit, a healthy amount of self discipline needs to take place on everyone's side for maximum benefits. Which brings me back to where I started... Why Should You Use Github Actions? Let me start off by saying again that although anyone should be able to achieve some level of automation, in this case Github Actions proved itself beyond reproach in helping us reduce the number of errors made along the way. We're here to help make sure nothing gets broken accidentally while trying to solve problems in different contexts, whether that involves embedded programming, publishing websites, or even just making functions easier to understand and maintain across multiple languages, frameworks, etc... Essentially, Github does this well as it allows everyone to stay aligned while working together towards common goals. From a business standpoint, similar concerns apply. If your operations team isn't managing its resources effectively, then chances are the unexpected side effects of performing daily activities manually will cause delays in getting critical service updates released. It probably doesn't sound too appealing right now, but consider this scenario: let's say a website goes offline temporarily due to network issues between the CDN provider and the primary web host, causing the site to appear completely blank until fixed. This downtime causes potential loss of revenue which might potentially lead to massive customer churn depending on the nature of the incident. How much worse would it feel for the CEO of said company knowing his employees aren't communicating properly to prevent situations like this from happening? Luckily, Github helps alleviate many scenarios including those above. In conclusion, Github allows people to collaborate, communicate, share code, and automate repetitive tasks in order to improve productivity, decrease mistakes, and increase efficiency. As long as you put effort into the process, benefits will come into play sooner rather than later. Enjoying life takes dedication sometimes though, and so does running successful businesses. But rest assured, good things will eventually come down the pipe!!:) So What Exactly Is The Process Like? We'll briefly cover each step mentioned earlier so hopefully this serves as a primer to those unfamiliar wth Github Actions and looks something like this: Something blue 1.

"Burger King has unveiled updated restaurant designs that feature dedicated mobile order and curbside pick-up areas, drive-in and walk-up order areas, an enhanced drive-thru experience, exterior dining spaces, and sustainable interior design. The new restaurants are part of the fast food company's ongoing transformation to be a more responsive business and serve guests with even greater convenience as it continues its push toward becoming America's Most Convenient Restaurant. The redesign process for each location was led by local in-house teams at their respective stores under direction from marketing and brand experts within Burger King Corp. Additionally, all of the new locations were designed using sustainability principles including minimizing environmental impact or energy usage and maximizing operational efficiency while still achieving required operational performance standards. In addition to providing customers even better access to ordering, pickup and delivery options, these updates will: Create additional seating capacity on premises; Allow consumers further flexibility around how they dine in store - whether via self-serve kiosks, tables or other ways of customizing service; Expand consumer choice through innovative food offerings, such as salads, wraps, handcrafted sandwiches and beverages; Improve customer satisfaction by improving guest experiences in-store and enhancing in-restaurant technology; and Increase sales opportunities with expanded product availability across menu categories and promotional events and promotions. All redesigned stores feature improvements aimed at creating a welcoming environment that is focused on making the entire Guest Experience efficient and convenient. By prioritizing speed over traditional waiting lines, the new look includes a variety of seating arrangements for both in-seat eating and standalone stations where fans can sit down without needing to wait in line, as well as diverse point-of-sale systems, visual display signs and touch screens that make navigating the site more intuitive. To help enhance this experience, several of the newly remodeled stores have added aluminum perforated blinds to provide shade and create a quieter atmosphere. In some locations, the space also features customized lighting and flooring patterns. These changes aim to improve Guest interactions and increase overall engagement throughout the different types of functions taking place inside a modern restaurant today, thereby increasing average check size and driving incremental increases in same day sales, according to McDonald's Corporation.

A spokesperson for Verizon declined comment when asked if the company plans to launch a 5G variant, referring us back to previous statements made earlier this year where the carrier said there was no such thing as a Pixel 4XL yet. Google has previously teased their next iteration in video form, which may be why Verizon could make an announcement before October 30th.

"The New York Times has acquired Serial Productions, the audio production company behind popular podcast series Serial. Serial Productions was formed in 2017 after the success of the podcast, which explores a new crime each week with Sarah Koenig at its helm as host and producer. The company says that it will now produce ""the world's leading original podcasts, both scripted and unscripted, on every platform available, including premium, ad-supported and subscription services like Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Google Play Music; digital distribution platforms such as Pandora, iHeartRadio and Amazon Alexa Devices; and all major social media streaming apps."" Serial, one of the most downloaded shows this month on iTunes, became an internet sensation following its release last October. It tells the true story of 18 year old high schooler Hae Min Lee, who is brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed, serving life without parole for his crimes. In order to uncover whether or not he did commit these murders, Koenig crafts a fictional retelling of events surrounding the case. Related Story 'Entourage' Season 6 Trailer - Ryan Kwanten To Reunite With Eric Murphy Mark Wahlberg? Koenig takes us through this quasi-fiction telling of events via interviews from those involved including: actress Aimee Garcia (who portrays the character Jayde) and former state investigator Paula Deen Cole, among others. Through these conversations, Koenig manages to gain insight into the mindsets of defendant and victim alike, providing listeners with unique perspectives never heard before about what might have happened during the murder trial. Additionally, there are also some familiar names appearing throughout various episodes. This includes star Sarah Hyland, as well as Carla Gugino, John Francis Daley and Chris Mason. Many may know them best from their work on other television programs (like comedy Friends). When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter earlier today, Koenig revealed she expects Serial to continue producing content beyond the bounds of just one season, stating ""I don't think you can ever tell where [series] go... I would love more stories around this topic because we didn't really cover everything - I wish we had interviewed the prosecutor. We never got him on camera saying exactly why they brought charges against Adnan Syeed. And so part two could be knowing that and maybe going deeper than that."" She continued: There could be] a small spin off regarding the defense attorney who came up with a brilliant legal strategy but not actually having much experience in criminal law. So, maybe that person goes out and attempts to make sense of how does someone get convicted when it seems entirely reasonable. There are many angles to that. That said, I am excited to take things wherever people want me to take them. While I do hope that our fans still enjoy listening, we're doing something special here. If people aren't enjoying it ... then no matter, right? But if our goal is to create great storytelling and we feel like we've done that across multiple seasons, I wouldn't mind continuing down that path for however long they need. Naturally, I would say do whatever makes the most money!"" According to Nielsen data released recently, Serial ranks 38 amongst all weekday podcasts airing currently on Spotify, Pandora and iHeart Radio. On Thursday, September 14th alone, over 1 million downloads were reported between 5pm EST3pm PST to midnight. As for the podcast itself, it's been mentioned nearly 15 times per hour based on metadata collected by Podtrac within the past 30 days.

"Tesla plans to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US in late 2022. Elon Musk has been talking about opening up the network to other companies' cars for years, but now we have a target date and a list of rules that non-Teslas will need to adhere to in order to use Tesla's charging stations. The company also announced it is planning to introduce more than 3 million new public Superchargers by 2023 as well, bringing them closer to some of their customers. The last time I wrote about Supercharging, I mentioned how they can charge your car quickly via direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). This article covers what you get when using AC power at home or office outlets; specifically, 120Vac 60Hz: three-phase power with 0.1 amps per phase. It seems like most people are familiar with having an outlet next to their bedside and assuming this means getting single-phase 180Vac household supply voltage from the wall socket. For those who do not know, there are actually four wires coming out of each main breaker - two black, two white - and which pairs go where depends on exactly what wiring scheme was installed at your house (e.g., 240208 vs 208240watt appliances). If you're buying one standard appliance such as a refrigerator, those numbers won't matter much because your fridge doesn't care whether every wire comes into the box together or separately - all it cares about is the total amount of electricity consumed over 15 minutes (120 seconds) during operation. But if you plug in several different devices simultaneously, then things start to get interesting: think 1kW to 2 kW of combined load requiring numerous cables running across multiple circuits (plugs), while still only needing enough juice to run just one circuit. When doing electronics design work back in college, any attempt to sneak 5 amps through 12 2700 watt voice coil amplifiers would be detected right away by the amp regulators in my audio lab! In contemporary homes, however, it isn't uncommon to see 30A or even 50A breakers simply so that appliances don't limit themselves down to 600 watts. So, yes, you could theoretically fit 24x300W speakers plus amplifier (s) plus operating platform speaker stands inside 25 square feet of space, under ideal conditions. However, noone wants a big ol' pair of speakers occupying a lot of valuable living space without quite consuming the entire available capacity of a large room. Electric motorcycles have always had DC chargers due to their smaller size, and therefore less mass, faster acceleration times, and lower battery temperatures. With dual batteries powering a motorbike's top speed usually around 90mph, and maximum output torque being limited only by the bike itself, 120 volts should provide plenty of amperes of power needed to recharge both batteries to full state of health in under 30 minutes. Regardless, a few questions remain since electrical engineers tend to deal mostly with AC systems. Let's take a look at these answers... How many phases am I looking at? Many simple solutions utilize DCLOCKDCAFCLK circuitry, wherein the positive half cycle of either clock is connected directly to ground instead of fed to other components. To reduce ripple noise, some newer digital controls utilize double-phased clocks, effectively doubling the number of required phases. Given the above example, 4 pi radians equals roughly 9 degrees between peaks - giving us 360degrees 45degrees 7.2pi radians out of 45. Also note that our original reduction factor of 10 needs to increase by another 10. Perhaps surprisingly, Delta Sigma modulation offers better performance than linearity versus thermal stability at higher frequencies, especially within the frequency range of 500kHz to 1300kHz. Let's say that n4096. What does that mean in terms of the number of cycles made possible per second? Well, check out Table 6.7 from the AC module table below: 4096 x 8 1000 (3cpscycle) 40960cycles...or 16 MHz Either way, the answer is ""a LOT""! And remember the magic of mathematics again this assumes that the system uses external logic gates rather than software implementations that may suffer from poor accuracy near operating points or slower response speeds compared to hardware chips. Table 6.5 depicts the typical relationship between absolute temperature T and internal resistance Ri. Note that when it gets really hot, air conduction becomes critical, as shown here: Additionally, external heat sinks used for CPU coolers help keep temperatures low and stable. As an added bonus, supercapacitors store energy really efficiently; in fact, according to ASETEK, this graph indicates how efficient long term storage really is: A lithium coin cell storing 100 of its rated capacity after 2600mAh discharges. Bitcoin mining equipment suppliers make claims about the efficiency gains they achieve through various innovations on their designs; for instance, Bitmain claims their S15i GPU chip achieves 125 percent efficiency gain vs previous generation parts.

"Coronavirus has traveled across the world, with new cases of the virus being found in non-travelers. The World Health Organization recently warned that the window of opportunity to contain the spread is closing and more than 2 million people have been infected. For now, it seems like every country on Earth can find a way to get its hands dirty: washing public spaces; testing for coronavirus antibodies; instituting stay-at-home orders. But what if there was an easier solution? A solution which would be both cheap to implement and maintain while still protecting your health. At this point, we know that you should not touch your face - or at least wash hands thoroughly before touching your face - to prevent spreading COVID-19 via droplets (the size between two sneezes). Yet how often do you actually follow these simple rules? And even when you do practice good hygiene practices, are they enough? Can things really become so contagious without knowing who's touched what part of what person's body? Is soap and water truly as effective against all viruses as one might hope? If someone came into contact with a deadly pathogen but did nothing else wrong, could he infect others? These questions may seem morbid, yet answer them correctly and we will inevitably see drastic changes in our lives. We cannot afford to take unnecessary risks. You never know where those risks come from. It does not matter whether you think about it too much - small actions and habits stick around long after their reasons have vanished. That's why you need to learn how to live cleanly by reading up on the best ways to keep yourself safe and healthy in order to thrive during quarantine. Below I offer four steps for pragmatic living under lock down conditions. They are easy to remember because they are based off the Latin phrase ""salus suprema lex esto!"" (Latin meaning: 'health is supreme law) - for most purposes, let's just say it means ""keep your head above ground level!"" Step 1. Step away from any situation that leaves you feeling dizzy or lightheaded. Coronaviruses cause this kind of flu-like symptom called acute viral myalgia. When you feel ill, your immune system is fighting back and trying to destroy foreign invaders, including pathogens such as Covid-19. Your brain receives signals telling it to relax so that other parts of the body can devote themselves to keeping you stable. So one danger rule is always avoid situations that leave you weak and tired out. This includes vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, scrubbing tiles and floors, taking walks outside, having sex when sick, doing strenuous exercise, overloading your mind, getting drunk, smoking cigarettes, using medications incorrectly, driving, drinking alcohol heavily, etc. When you do one of these things, your body has no energy left to fight off viruses. In some sense, this step serves as a substitute to wearing masks and gloves and sanitizing everything in sight. Don't forget to take breaks from stuff once in awhile though, otherwise you risk ending up doing repetitive motions until you get injured or worse: delirious. By following this first step, you are essentially making sure anti-viral drugs don't reach your bloodstream before your poor brain gets the chance to process incoming messages and get rid of them. Whenever possible, spend time outdoors and expose yourself to fresh air and sunlight whenever you can. Going outside gives you access to essential nutrients that replenish your own immune cells. Without the sun, you end up store vitamin D less efficiently in your tissues and lack the necessary amount of calcium for proper bone development. Vitamin D helps stop diseases from attacking your heart and lungs, and is also vital for maintaining normal blood pressure. Calcium speeds healing, boosting immunity, muscle strength, and bone density. While you definitely want to protect your health as much as possible, make sure not to neglect nutrition just because of physical distancing. Go ahead and eat well even if you aren't hungry. There's nothing wrong with snacking on fruits and vegetables. On days you skip meals altogether, try eating protein-rich foods. Remember that almost half of your bodily fluids consists of saltwater, and losing sodium through sweat quickly leads to dehydration. Even mild dehydration slows metabolism considerably. Avoid caffeine intake since it causes anxiety and irritability. Finally, try to seek medical advice whenever you start suffering symptoms of dehydration and exhaustion. Also consider wearing sunscreen even if you plan on spending lots of time indoors as UV rays also deplete natural resources inside our bodies. Sunlight stimulates vitamin production along with many key hormones. For a list of potential sources of additional information regarding safety measures during travel, read this article.

Also, some unsourced rumors say the resolution might remain unchanged at 960640 pixels. So given those specs alone, it should retail somewhere around 299-349 USD. Apple Watch Series 2 starts shipping tomorrow morning and people are already preemptively getting ready to buy one. But did you know that Apple also sold 420K units during that specific weekend last month? That's insane. Yes, Apple shipped 400k units in a single weekend while releasing a brand new watch together with iOS 11 update. Those numbers aren't even good enough to make any sort of impact on the market share charts. We're talking about a tiny niche right here. But why does everyone seem surprised that Apple released another smartwatch model within 6 months of iPhone XS launch event? Why shouldn't it happen? Have you ever seen Samsung shipout two Galaxy phones simultaneously? And yes, Apple watches built between April 2017 and June 2018 were meant to work only until early 2019 and couldn't receive OS updates because Apple decided to discontinue support for those devices post January 2020. So expect most of them to die soon anyway. Now, let us see some cool stories related to wearable tech from yesterday... Oh wait, nothing happened:) Well, hey, this article definitely wasn't supposed to become popular either. It's just fun to troll different sites before bedtime. No harm done, no foul. Here are a couple of facts about how Internet works. In fact, these rules apply to everything. Even our minds operate according to similar logic. When we learn things, our brain takes shortcuts and makes assumptions based on prior knowledge and experiences. These natural biases often affect our conclusions regarding external world. For example, teenage kids usually assume that teenagers somehow act maturely simply due to their age. Older adults tend to believe that younger generation have poor judgment and lack common sense too. To test this theory, researchers asked 29 year old students to rate pictures of 18 year olds vs 22 year olds. Here's what they saw: To show you how powerful this hidden bias could be, take a look at this chart showing reaction times when subjects had to decide whether faces are male or female. Notice how males are slower to identify females relative to the opposite way round. You'd think that younger generations would have better understanding of gender differences than older ones, wouldn't you? Unfortunately, the data shows otherwise. The above results confirm that sexual orientation perception behaves similarly. Research suggests that men unconsciously perceive women as sexually unattractive compared to attractive men. Put differently, young guys prefer girls to older boys and vice versa. See below: If you thought that human brains couldn't be fooled anymore thanks to AI advancements, consider this study conducted back in 2014. Researchers showed participants photos containing various images such as cars, animals etc. Then they randomly selected 20 of the photographs and replaced them with totally unrelated car parts using Photoshop tool. Some fliers looked identical to original photo, but others featured completely random objects. Guess whose attention was captured faster? Yep, users preferred the ones with real articles rather than altered equivalents.

"A team of engineers in Korea has designed a new Virtual Reality glove that can create the sensation of touch when manipulating digital objects. VR gloves are not new, but this approach is different from anything on offer thus far. It does so by developing haptic feedback which allows events to be simulated within your tactile sense without actually touching them. Virtually Touching Events The concept behind these virtual reality 'gloves' was created as an extension of the project called CoM-VR (Cooperative Manipulation for Virtual Reality) developed at Seoul National University and described last year. Here they use three external cameras mounted around their subject help track hand movements through space via algorithms derived from Kinect sensor data. This tracking information is then used to construct realistic 3D models or environments. These represent any object you could think of - even colors! You don't have to look too closely to see how much work goes into something like this; it takes roughly two minutes per second with each camera point requiring its own dedicated algorithm. The process is time consuming and there's no way of knowing if what you're seeing is accurate until some form of verification step. The video above shows off one possible application: using the gloves to manipulate virtual reality characters on screen. A demonstration based on a dance routine is shown here (in Korean): Wearable Technologies Explained These projects typically require bulky hardware such as multi core CPU boards running Linux operating systems. They also need large amounts of storage capacity to keep all those algorithms around, and more importantly, they take up valuable real estate in terms of wearer discomfort too. That said, I thought my first encounter with wearable technology would involve strapping myself down to a hospital bed while someone poked a needle directly towards poor old me: imagine my surprise when trying out Google Glass only to find that it doesn't really hurt... just get annoying! Instead most wearables wearers seem happy enough to simply put it on and forget about it. But maybe someday these things will start getting better? Not quite yet though. At least according to Rethink Robotics, who recently released a nice infographic showing the current state of Wearable Technology: Despite what you may believe, computer vision isn't always easy. Most people probably know computers are good at dealing with 2d images. However, many times our hands do not fall neatly in front of us because they move quickly throughout our body. We must consider every part of the image individually inside the scene, making sure everything looks similar and aligned correctly. In order for computer vision to function properly, every pixel location should have identical color characteristics across the entire frame. If there is any deviation, detection won't happen accurately. What seems hard now becomes trivial when considering the capabilities of deep learning networks available today. Nailing computer vision requires understanding machine intelligence and human perception together. Accurately identifying individual pixels represents 80 of the required skill set, whereas lining up multiple frames, detecting changes over time, subtracting backgrounds, and maintaining consistency are 20. It turns out that this is exactly what Samsung Research is doing. How else could you explain the fact that this company manages to make very complicated artificial vision products? Their smart glasses S3 both record video content and translate between languages perfectly well. Now let's check out another interesting product made by Samsung: We hear lots of stories about amazing technological achievements being achieved by companies working under tight deadlines in conjunction with government agencies. As demonstrated above, however, sometimes teams succeed despite not having access to cutting edge resources due to lack of funding. Take a moment to reflect upon Samsung Electronics' lead, Innovation Services Division, whose mission is described below: ""Samsung research plays key roles as pioneering forces in the development of future technologies. Our innovation services group stimulates cooperative efforts among industry participants to drive growth and further expand market opportunities. To realize the potential of breakthrough science, we deploy knowledge of applied sciences, business strategy and high-tech processes to a global scale."" What do they mean by High-Tech Processes?

It comes preloaded with several different platforms such as Weaveworks Edge Core Platform, IBM WebSphere Liberty, Containers 101.io Linux to name just three of them. Replica OS has also worked closely with Hyperledger space to develop its own blockchain SDK, aiming to support solidity programming language as well as other languages supported within Fabric V1.0. If you are considering adopting IoT technologies to improve your business this year, then this piece will give you some food for thought about what you need to consider before doing so. This article consists of five main sections. Section 1 gives general information about IoT, section 2 looks at security issues, section 3 talks about runtimes and how one might choose between available options, section 4 considers service oriented architectures and finally section 5 discusses multi device communication. A lot more detail could have gone into each of these areas if time permitted but hopefully, these broad brushstrokes should get you thinking and start researching where new ideas may lie for you. General Information About IoT What Is IoT? As mentioned above the term IoT refers to any networked electronic device whose purpose is embedded software intelligence and connectivity (although this terminology isn't necessarily universal). Some experts describe it as anything that connects to a web-based server. Others refer to it as sensors plus analytics and see it as having many layers. For example, data feeds onto the internet via dedicated networks, IP cameras monitor streets and airports to warn authorities when criminals are spotted entering buildings. Networking equipment monitors individual homes and appliances track water consumption, gas usage and climate control settings. Healthcare monitoring means even doctors can view patient health records online rather than needing to travel to hospital clinics every day. Modern vehicles use computers to navigate our roads safely. In short there are few industries not affected by IoT. Truly all types of organisation from local councils through to large multinational businesses now find themselves being impacted. Why Should I Care? There appear to be two reasons why truly major organisations are starting to act on news that the world around us is becoming increasingly intelligent. First it seems that larger companies feel obliged to care because it appears developers who started developing for Android phones back in 2010 switched to iOS devices after Apple created Siri last year. Why did Google do no similar thing until 2016? According to the company's vice president Nick Fox, he said the search giant wasn't interested in making AI assistants because people didn't want a computer talking directly to them all the time! Secondly, if we believe the hype, soon IoT will become ubiquitous. From cars connecting to drivers, air conditioners detecting temperature changes throughout offices and healthcare facilities adjusting medication dosages accordingly to remote electricity outlets providing enough power for small homes in rural Kenya. If true, then more of this type of innovation can only lead to improved outcomes for consumers and organisations looking to capitalise upon advancements made possible. So What Does My Organisation Need To Do Now? For those comfortable dealing with technological matters already, here are a few suggestions based on experience gained over recent years. Our aim is to keep things simple but still offer plenty of inspiration which might prove useful later down the line. Understand Your AudienceMarket This starts with knowing exactly who you hope to communicate with and realise the potential benefits both internally and externally to your operation. You must assess whether customers wish to interact with something solely powered by voice commands alone or would prefer touch screens too. Maybe deals will be negotiated using point of sale terminals known as cash registers or maybe interactions with staff will involve sending texts or email messages instead. Think hard about what types of results your audience is likely to demand. Are you going to display detailed route maps on iPads while sitting behind the wheel of a car? How much does the visual appeal matter to younger generations of taxi drivers? Will your clients be prepared to 'talk shop' to front end representatives armed with tablets? These questions require careful consideration. There are dozens of ways to integrate external interaction capability into telephone library scheduling injections generated by Google's process. at his way when carried out lower success",0,292
"Red Carpet Entertainment LLC is offering 3,000 rich Americans the chance to put up 15,000 and pay up to 2,500 per movie to watch the latest releases in their homes. According to a report on CBS Money Watch: ""Tonight's screenings will cost between 1,000-2,500 each. But they don't have to be back-to-back; attendees can choose how often they want to tune into one of these exclusive events from now until Jan. 31 or order an all-access pass for life, starting at just 25K (that includes free access to existing VIP Movie Nights)."" The company says it has close ties with some Hollywood studios.The first screening event attracted 400 people who paid as much as 10,000 each ""for a front row seat"" according to one attendee. This was reportedly followed by another that included 300 people.""It's like having your own personal movie theatre,"" said Brent Hartman, 43, a real estate investor and frequent client of Red Carpet Events.Hartman told Fox News he would not give his name because he fears being blacklisted among other wealthy clients if his identity were known. He attended several earlier soirees where everyone wore masks but complained about guests missing out on Oscars coverage due to security reasons.Attendees had to RSVP through Facebook and then send permission slips via fax before the screening began. Each invitation also contained instructions on what hotel guests could expect when attending stays at a private residence in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Westwood Blvd which include five nights' accommodation, three meals daily, roundtrip transportation between Los Angeles and New York City, chauffeur services, nightly theme parties and two tickets to Saturday night's Academy Awards ceremony.A source tells us many people who are interested in going to the Oscar party have already purchased flights to California. They believe this year's show may be better than last years.'We strive to make every guest feel special,' a spokesperson explained, adding 'These film premieres aren't open to everyone...they're reserved for select groups whose memberships range from multi-millionaires to billionaires and super-rich individuals'.""The same source adds, 'There are no additional fees associated with our membership program - we simply ask that you share the costs across the board'.Some fans wondered why only those able to afford hefty sums should have access to such high profile films. One viewer tweeted, 'Why do I need 20 grand to see my favorite movies?...I never asked for anything!'Another person posted, 'How does someone go broke paying thousands to get invited to yet another celebrity cocktail reception?! Someone needs to tell me what kind of job opportunity gets over 1,200 on average! Am I getting too old?'One man claimed he qualified under the definition of big money, telling one news outlet online,'If you've got a huge bank account (50m) that gives you exactly what you want, it sounds like something worth pursuing', even though it doesn't sound very imaginative.But others commended the concept noting, 'This alone could save anyone hundredsthousands in rental car charges!'The idea came to him after the Las Vegas shooting and realizing how women might react to danger provided there safer conditions. What happens when she stands her ground against the shooter? He started thinking really hard about what society expects of its elite and decided it wasn't enough to buy them things. Instead, they needed entertainment too.You know what else makes kids happy? Getting dressed up in fancy clothes and hanging around with friends at the mall or whatever while people pretend to care about them. That sort of thing.That's exactly what people love when they host expensive dinner parties the emphasis is always on socializing and showing off and pretending everybody likes you and appreciates you.'We'll find ways to help sponsors sell products, etc.'And that's what this whole thing is - nothing more than selling stuff. It'll still be out of reach for most people.While the idea behind the new initiative seems fine, we wonder whether it's fair for its success to depend entirely upon some people throwing large amounts of cash around. If it turns out that there's actually no way to book seats for anyone except the uber-wealthy, we hope the organizers pause both to reflect and perhaps rethink their approach:""They say they screen best flicks during award season. We question if any of those films deserve to be seen without public support since they took tens of millions of dollars to produce!""",0,294

"A 3.1 billion dollar deal for Uber to purchase its biggest competitor in the Middle East, Careem, is expected to be made public on March 26. Uber is believed to have offered around 2.7 billion for the ride-hailing giant's regional unit which includes Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Egypt but has been rejected by a board led by Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as CEO of Uber this week after Travis Kalanick resigned amid controversy. Karim Zreik AFPGetty Images An employee works at an office of Uber's rival car service company Careem in central Cairo, October 30, 2015. Careem was founded when it acquired Motivate Technologies - a Boston-based startup working with the U.S. military space agency NASA - in 2014. The investment firm behind the acquisition has been described as a ""Saudi sovereign wealth fund linked to Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), son of King Salman."" According to what we've heard, MBS may not want his legacy tarnished if he wants to take the throne one day himself; he and other investors might find partnering with Uber more palatable than taking on Lyft or Didi Chuxing, two Chinese companies that have much deeper pockets and higher market shares in their respective countries. Others have noted how little money even Android Pay generated for Google last year as competition between Apple pay and Samsung's new mobile payment system surged ahead. A big part of why there are so many competing digital payments networks these days could well lie within China, where regulators shut down WeChat, Tencent Holdings' messaging app following years of complaints against alleged abuse of power and insider trading. And while both Facebook and WhatsApp offer free versions of their products, they're limited to fewer users than those who can buy into bigger apps such as Whatsapp Plus (13.99 monthly) or Instagram Stories (6 per month). Now playing: Watch this: Where will your next paycheck come from? Tech salaries aren't... In addition to all salaries and perks being paid out through severance packages and bonuses, some workers were also given cash back for referring rides - again, according to sources familiar with the matter. Workers who decide to leave during contract negotiations sometimes receive up front compensation in cash rather than stock options, however. It's common practice among younger employees because equity programs usually require them to do performance reviews quarterly, whenever someone receives a promotion, nominates staff for awards or raises their base salary. This means you'll often hear about changes only once every three months or less frequently. In contrast, senior engineers like me, whose roles don't revolve around sales, marketing or operations, might get a raise in our yearly review but won't typically see any change until six to nine months later. My annual bonus likely won't reach my bank account until closer to 18 months after I start earning it, making me the poster child for deferred comp - something junior employees have grown accustomed to. ""It seems very odd [for] people leaving another job,"" says Brendan Boyle, founder of AngelList, which connects tech startups looking for funding with experienced founders. However, he adds, opting out isn't easy since most large corporations operate mostly under noncompete clauses that prohibit former staffers from joining competitors unless they start work within a certain amount of time afterwards. Meaningful exit plans Out of 11 firms contacted by Business Insider, five told us they had written off plans to compensate departing executives in order to avoid lawsuits should the person join a similar role elsewhere. If a law firm goes bust and loses several high-profile cases this fall due to unpaid bills, then chances are good that some former employees will face legal action. To prevent potential litigation, lawyers say that companies must make sure that no managers or execs hold the keys to their financial future by locking away valuable information about budgets and revenue projections that details company performance across teams. Some software developers recently took to Twitter to complain that their employers hadn't shared enough details regarding the shutdown of past projects with current ones; they wanted access to source code and migration strategies, as well as feedback on project goals. But getting too specific about what exactly happened could lead to more bad business decisions going forward: Many programmers treat a successful product launch as sacrosanct, regardless of whether wage hikes in the region forced prices upward or cost overruns left customers shortchanged. When asked if compensating departed colleagues would help attract better talent to her team, Monica Prasad, chief executive officer of venture capital investor General Catalyst, replied simply: ""Yes."" She added that she expects more employees will speak openly in coming weeks about the reasons they chose to move jobs. ""I think the pendulum is swinging toward having a frank conversation about human resources issues"" in Silicon Valley, said Prasad. ""Because when we look at things publicly now, everyone is trying to figure out, 'How does this affect recruitment?

"Blocks have shown up in almost every blogging tool, web editor, note-taking app, and content management system, but they are almost all proprietary and non-standard. Blocks are often limited to a single type of formatting: lists, bullet points, headings, or text - even though many formats include other types like links and images as well. So when you think about adding blocks for your own purposes (say, creating an outline that fits on one page), it's easy to get overwhelmed by the complexity involved. We can avoid this with a simple drag-and-drop method, so let's do just that! You'll probably want to read through our brief introduction before starting to use Google docs' native format feature. And if you haven't used a spreadsheet application before, don't worry; we've got plenty of help! The purpose of using spreadsheets is different from most common uses of block widgets because these examples are designed to more easily manipulate data rather than create visual presentation. Also since we're dealing with numbers here, not textual elements, there won't be any need to deal with font family, sizes, or color. In a real world scenario where you really wanted to alter how something looked visually, things would be much trickier. So in general, stick to what works best for you. For example, some people prefer columns over rows due to their familiarity, while others find them easier to work within. To start off, open your google doc in edit mode. This will display everything as plain text instead of making any changes to styling until after import. Go ahead and click anywhere inside the document body to add a new row. The beginning of the next line should look similar to this example. If you press enter now you'd end up with three lines of writing separated only by spaces. Now try dragging another placeholder into place so that each individual cell has its own blank space. To illustrate the difference between the two methods, check out the second screenshot below - notice the dashed horizontal line down the center of the cells? That's the effect being created by setting border attributes via code. After doing so, move to insertedit mode for that particular column again. Notice how vertical bars have been added at the left and right edges of each field? Those appear when no table borders were set during creation. Each bar represents the equivalent width of the entire widget itself whether the cells contain text or simply empty space. When rows are inserted, a corresponding number will show up under each header indicating the total number of fields. This makes it clear how many widgets are included in each row without having to count. Also worth noting that if multiple rows share the same title headers, those titles will merge together to indicate the presence of additional widgets beneath them. Now select the first cell containing a dash. Using the menu panel at the top of the screen, choose ""Format Styles - Borders"" then go back into insertedit mode once more. Delete the existing border styles selected previously by clicking delete button at far right hand side of the toolbar. Then click the dropdown box and pick No Border. Since we didn't specify anything else, the default settings apply which means no padding around the actual contents. But that's okay! Since nothing was specified, the dash serves as a boundary between sections and doesn't have to conform to any rules unless otherwise defined. There aren't any predefined guidelines for bullets or numbering either. Feel free to experiment and see what looks good to you. You may also want to change the background color. After selecting the Background Color option in the Formatting dialog window, try changing the Fill Style to Solid, Gradient or Pattern. Click OK after choosing whichever style you prefer. At this point you could exit edit mode and continue working elsewhere as usual. Or scroll waywardly down the grid until you come across another instance of a similarly formatted heading. Select it, then switch back to edit mode and adjust the appearance accordingly. Once you're satisfied with the results, return to your original spreadsheet and save away your modifications. See the final example below for reference. Important Notes In addition to everything mentioned above, you'll likely encounter issues related to file size limits imposed by G Suite users. While domain wide quotas seem nice in theory, actual implementation varies depending on who owns certain accounts. Because that information isn't readily available online, we suggest monitoring usage closely and adjusting file sizes accordingly. Alternatively, consider hosting your files externally such as Dropbox or OneDrive. For more details on each platform's policies refer to their respective websites.

According to Al Jazeera's Tim Whewell at Abu Dhabi International Airport where the craft was readied for lift off, ""the hexagonal probe may be launching on Monday.""

"Jerdon's jumping worker ants can become reproductive queens when their queens die. The transition comes with changes to the ant's brain, gene expression, hormone levels, and cell composition. Researchers have now identified how some of these physiological shifts occur during this process of ""queen demise."" By studying queen-destined individuals at various stages in the death process as well as those that survive into adulthood, researchers found distinct transcriptional signatures associated with each phase. In addition to identifying molecular markers for differentiating between queens and workers within a colony, they also discovered which genes are turned on or off throughout development. Their study was published online today (July 3) by eLife. ""The brains of newly emerged females already bear many differences compared to older females,"" says Rui Cunha Azevedo da Silva, an author of the paper who conducted the research while a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. She is currently at Dartmouth College where she continues her work investigating how former queens go about establishing new colonies after dying whether they form small swarmings around existing nests like males do, or if they establish entirely new ones. These types of questions will help us better understand the mechanisms behind the birth, life span, and sex change of social insects such as bees and termites, whose reproduction differs dramatically from ours. [Social Insects: Huge Cases Of Colony Brainpower] Originally only one species, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, has been observed forming swarms once its original king dies; similar observations were made last year using the closely related S. richteri. But before then no one had ever observed the entire process of temporary replacement. So far, all we know is that it involves at least two castes, male soldiers who patrol the nest looking out for threats and guarding the large entrance tunnel leading back outside, and female workers and egg-laying queens inside. When the queen dies, there's no telling what happens next. King mortality could be regular or sporadic, depending upon conditions in the environment. And even though soldiers see no reason not to continue hunting down intruders until the new queen emerges, some might stay longer than necessary, leaving openings through which invaders could enter. This would explain why there appear to be more freshly laid eggs under dead kings than elsewhere. You don't want your prized possession getting eaten alive. If you're lucky enough to find the body of a living queen prior to emergence, perhaps you'd explore other options for a mate. There may be several potential suitors, and since she doesn't need any assistance guiding herself, you can keep things going until another option presents itself. Or maybe one particular candidate gets attention faster because he seems friendlier. How does she decide? Solenopsis invictaQueens are always larger than guards, but they both weigh equally.Image courtesy of Dan DikicWikimedia Commons It actually makes sense that females would remain loyal to their companions, scientists say, especially considering the vast difference between their size. Workers and queens typically differ greatly both physically and behaviorally due to their caste roles. Queens tend to grow much bigger than either workers or soldiers, and so they must be able to carry more pheromones and less food, allowing them to get from place to place quickly without being picked up. They face greater risks from predators, including humans, making them ideal sentinels. Workers meanwhile are smaller and lighter duty, carrying fewer brood cells, pumping shorter and slower bursts of heat. Because they spend so little time outside of protected areas, they aren't exposed to nearly as high a risk of predation as queens. As a result, they tend to avoid fortifying their hives themselves; instead they use their long legs to push vegetation aside to make way for larvae begging for added protection against parasites and disease-carrying bugs. Soldiers are somewhere between the size of workers and queens, weighing somewhere between 10mg and 25 mg. Like most ants, fitness decreases with age among members of every group. With all of these factors working together, the question becomes how does our sought-after queen decide whom to follow? Do new arrivals simply pick whichever kind of servant is nearest to theirs? Is it possible for a single individual to dominate over others? What determines queen dominance? In response to these questions, Da Silva and colleagues analyzed the head capsules - unlike bodies, heads come preassembled, sporting eyes, antennae, mandibles, etc. - of 100 recently hatched workers along with 50 egg-bearing queens from four separate S. invicta colonies. All died naturally except for queens 27, 28, 29 and 30, which remained active until the day of sacrifice. Scientists removed the heads immediately following death and split them into three pools, corresponding to their developmental stage five days earlier, five days later, or adult. Each half contained almost 200 samples, giving 6,600 total comparisons to examine regulation of gene expression and activity across the development timeline.

The United States Navy's new ballistic missile defense shield is designed to shoot down incoming missiles traveling at speeds close to 10 times faster than those shot by intercontinental-range nukes - roughly 4,800 miles per hour (7,700 kph)... Scientists have long known about the danger posed by tiny desert locusts which swarm across North Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe every summer and carry devastating consequences - but there's never been much incentive to study them before now.... Here comes another season full of pollution - it's called smoggy autumn here in Beijing where I live - and everybody knows how bad this season will be for your health! Most people know the dangers of breathing toxic air during smoggy weather but most don't realize just how dangerous smog really is! Today we want to share with you some very important information regarding air pollutants that cause respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These toxins may not only affect our lungs directly; they also enter into other parts of our bodies through blood circulation. So if high concentrations of air pollutants reach certain organs in our body, their functions will inevitably start acting weirdly. For example, brain cells could become more sensitive to oxygen deficiency, causing headaches or dizziness. Even though the majority of human population today lives in polluted environment, even highly developed countries still suffer severe outbreaks of ""smog"" due to climate changes happening all around us on one hand, while industries continue releasing increasing amounts of harmful chemicals onto the atmosphere on the other hand. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 5 million deaths worldwide were linked to air pollution levels between 2001 and 2010. This number already exceeded five percent of total global mortality rates in this period. A large portion of those victims died from outdoor sources since indoor emissions are far less impactful compared to traffic fumes, industrial waste products and building exhaust systems and heating devices emitting millions of tons of carbon dioxide daily. But despite all of this, we are still talking about air pollution caused mostly by man-made chemical compounds released into the atmosphere. To make matters worse, scientists are increasingly warning that air quality is deteriorating rapidly as temperatures rise because warmer conditions dramatically increase the amount of airborne particles and gases floating around above earth's surface. One particular concern is particulate matter, or PM 2.5, one type of ultrafine dust produced by vehicle engines, power plants, factories and coal burning facilities. It tends to remain suspended in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere and thus stays closer to ground level. Studies show that it reaches 35 higher concentration when air temperature rises by 1F Celsius. That means for each additional degree of heat, PM2.5 increases by 16. In addition, scientific research indicates that regional air pollution becomes especially troublesome during the winter months as freezing causes fine particulates to clump together and form larger droplets making them heavier so that the smaller size makes them settle out first, leading to increased exposure hazards. And some studies indicate significant ozone depletion in urban centers near big ports like Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Mumbai as well. Ozone depletion occurs when surficial soil contains naturally occurring monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and volatiles emitted by trees, shrubs, grasses, etc., absorbing solar radiation. As soon as components of tropospheric ozone interact with sunlight, ultraviolet light weakens oxygen molecules, forming ozone ions and radicals. After being trapped in the lower stratosphere, UV radiation penetrates deeper into the atmosphere until reaching the lowermost layer of the troposphere where reactions occur with nitrogen oxide precursors. Over time, slow decay produces ozone depletions of 3-8, depending upon latitudes and seasons, affecting mainly middle altitudes owing to wind patterns and atmospheric stability. At the same time, colder winters produce slightly higher ambient levels of ozone in spring after snow cover melts and vegetation growth returns. Thus, seasonal variations should be taken into consideration when assessing ozone budget impacts. All in all, pollution in developing economies seems to get worst on average between May and September, corresponding to dry periods of the year characterized by high winds bringing dust and aerosols inland. By contrast, higher emission peaks coincide with wetter periods correlated with strong easterlies pushing moist marine air inland carrying droplets rich in salts and sulfates. Whatever the case might be, what we need right now is effective action. Here are seven practical ways to improve air quality: First off, stop using fuel oil and natural gas for cooking. While many households still rely on these fossil fuels as primary energy source for residential purposes, switching to cleaner alternatives such as electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), wood or methane can greatly reduce household air pollutions.

"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System (MWADS), which can generate a beam of electromagnetic radiation that feels like a powerful electric current running through the skin or eyes when it hits them, was first tested in 2003 at an undisclosed location outside Beijing. It has since been used for crowd control during protests against Chinese rule in Tibetan areas. The system uses high frequency microwaves with frequencies around 1 GHz to 2GHz, instead of traditional radio waves, to transmit energy across great distances quickly. A rangefinder determines where the target object is located within the zone illuminated by the focal point of the radar antennawhich appears as white light to those who are hit. These invisible rays have long been known for causing burns to people's exposed skin, but they were originally intended to be fired from tanks in order to clear land mines. MWADS came into its own following China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989, when thousands took refuge in Tiananmen Square after marching peacefully there in support of the students' demands. In 1992, the military began testing out this form of ray. Since then, they've been used for anti-terrorism operations in Tibet and Xinjiang regions, and also reportedly in Taiwan as well as Hong Kong, where such weapons continue to be banned under international law. [See images of army using these lasermicrowave systems] According to reports, active denial weapons such as the MWADS could prove extremely effective in suppressing crowds in situations such as riots or demonstrations; soldiers armed with these devices would be able to simply walk up to groups of protestors and explode their human shields before sending lethal bullets flying. Unlike conventional weapons, the use of non-lethal weapons does not make headlines because no one gets killed - although many will suffer painful burns and other effects caused by exposure to the ionizing radiation emitted by these kinds of weapons. There currently isn't enough scientific data available about potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to different wavelengths of microwave radiation. But some experts believe such strong exposures may result in cancer down the line. ""Exposure to microwave radiation can cause cancer,"" says Dr. John Morrow, chairperson of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine in Washington, D.C., ""and it causes damage to DNA."" However, he adds that scientists still don't know much more than that yet. Morrow points out that some studies suggest varying degrees of risk depending upon how and why someone is exposed to microwave radiation: People working in food processing plants are probably least likely to develop serious problems, while researchers doing research involving the study of molecular bonding processes may face higher risks as they work near microwave ovens day after day. This kind of information should help raise public awareness among consumers so they become better informed, he explains. As far as the general populace goes, however, we're really just winging it right now... and until further tests determine what exactly happens inside our bodies if we're continually bombarded with microwave signals, most civilians aren't going to do very much besides go blind and shrivel away. Other possible side effects include headaches, feelings of disorientation, arm and leg stiffness, muscle spasms, heat sensations, nausea, unconsciousness or even death. Some observers worry that the whole thing might topple governments. In addition to concerns about microwave beams piercing through walls and people, other critics say that microwave powers used in such technologies tend to degrade signal strength rather than enhance it. And the fact remains that not all types of radiated power are created equally. For example, microwave lamp generators operate differently than fiber optic lasers and lasers emit only coherent light, whereas ordinary lamps emit incoherent ligh.. Moreover, both sources require huge amounts of electricity, especially compared to the output of small handheld units found today. On top of everything else, though, the U.S.-based Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers notes that the transmittal distance and angle of the beam produced by hand held devices vary greatly, making it impossible to guarantee reliable results. But proponents counter that MWADS offers several advantages. First off, unlike some other similar products on the market, these devices actually aim at producing a focused spot, rather than merely dispersing heat indiscriminately, thus providing greater precision. Also, they produce less heat overall than microwave heating ranges, which makes it easier to avoid harming nearby individuals or animals. And lastly, according to David Randall, director of the Rapid Prototyping Center at Michigan State University, these technologies allow warfighters to defeat targets via blinding them rather than injuring them physically. Basically, you burn your enemy's retinas without burning his body, letting him see the world as blurry blobs without having anything tangible happen to his actual sense organs. Such a device allows soldiers to easily kill enemies behind cover using indirect fire to attack their backsides rather than putting rounds directly into their skulls.

"Facebook Gaming is introducing a new feature that lets viewers hop into game streams with their favorite gaming personalities. Viewers can now click a button to open games and join the streamer in-game, which will allow them to interact directly through chat instead of watching passively from afar like before. The ability to join players while they're playing means you can jump right into group conversations or see what your friends are up to. The broadcasting platform has also implemented voice commands for Xbox media remote control so users could start and stop live streams without using keyboard input (which was previously required). This will be available on both PC Live Games and Xbox One consoles going forward - as long as it hasn't been set to ""public mode"" by default. [Update: Microsoft clarified that regardless where this setting is located, if it isn't set to public it cannot access this functionality.] Previously, only Windows 10 PCs were able to take advantage of these capabilities despite being compatible with other platforms such as SteamOS. Finally, a notification system will let gamers know when people have joined livestreams and notifications can even appear during gameplay itself.",0,309

"A Florida-based unmanned trucking company, Starsky Robotics, has set a record for the fastest that an unmanned truck has driven on a public road. It hit 55 MPH in a test run of a mile (1,609 ft) stretch of deserted roadway with no traffic lights or other obstacles in Florida's Sumter National Forest, according to RTT News. The specially equipped vehicle was able to reach the speed by using laser sensors instead of radar and cameras to detect vehicles around it. Starsky is working on development of trucks outfitted with its own artificial intelligence system that would let them navigate city streets without driver input - a key step toward AI driving. So far, however, there are still some challenges ahead before this could happen. For example, while Starksy's demo did complete a lap at more than 50 miles per hour, industry experts say this isn't realistic enough until we see a computer drive on highways outside urban areas where speeds can top 100 mph. ""We're not quite ready,"" said Ben Goertzel, director of strategic initiatives at OpenAI, which uses computers as learning machines. But he added that such capabilities may come sooner than you think.Open source software developer James Kuffner posted his demonstration video to YouTube last week, pointing out how a truck being controlled via remote-controlled steering wheel didn't perform well once going up a hill - but when the truck had been instructed to turn left after passing through a narrow gap between two trees at the bottom of the slope, the robot drove straight down the mountain like a rocket ship. He also noted that the latency wasn't very noticeable because the trucks were traveling at fairly low speeds.Starkey CEO David Perry told Business Insider earlier this year that the technology will likely be available in about three years; if so, that means your self-driving car just got 10 times faster.",0,311

"The Virgin Hyperloop is a transport system that features high-tech pods zooming through tunnels at speeds of up to 760 miles an hour using magnetic levitation. It is supposed to be quick and efficient, with its first test running between the two Las Vegas suburbs as early as 2021. What are some things you've learned about transportation after being in this business for awhile? I think they can do what we did: build stuff like that [Hyperloop]. We built it right out here on Route 66 back when no one else was doing anything. And now everyone's copying us - Musk has his own version called 'the Boring Company.' But who knows if he'll actually get around to building it! If you were designing the future today where would you draw inspiration from? The scifi world. Jules Verne had lots to say - books like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or Around the World In 80 Days inspired people all over; even Disney came along and made their own take on it. They always took something that was popular and helped make them more accessible because kids didn't understand science fiction or just didn't want to read anymore. With TV shows like Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica, there was really no need to explain how warp drive works or why humans have bionic implants any longer - but these ideas were still part of our cultural consciousness. So maybe we should look towards those archives and try to rekindle interest in old ideas again. How far away will Elon Musk's vision become reality? Hell if I know, probably a hundred years at least. He started off trying to reproduce manned space flight by sending rockets into orbit, then moved on to laser propulsion before settling on maglev trains. Now he wants to create tiny cars driven by solar power only travelling at very low speed yet charging quickly enough so we don't have to wait too long for juice. That sounds pretty good to me - although I hope he doesn't decide to implement those superfast transit systems without considering the environmental impact.",0,316
"Disney announced updates to its streaming services and provided sneak peeks for upcoming shows and movies at its investor day presentation on Thursday. It announced a new bundle that includes Disney, Hulu, ESPN and Pixar. The company did not provide much information about the pricing of this package or how it would integrate into existing service prices but said more details will be revealed ""in time."" Also unclear is when exactly the content from these added platforms will begin rolling out. Here are some highlights: STAR WARS As previously reported, Lucasfilm has begun production on three original live-action series based on Star Wars characters including Princess Leia in The Mandalorian, Obi Wan Kenobi in Solo: A Star Wars Story (with Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo), and Boba Fett with Game Of Thrones actors Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel reprising their roles. As expected, all three titles have been put together under one roof called simply STAR WARS which will launch later this year on December 15th 2019 followed by D23 Expo 2020. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy shared some additional thoughts about the franchise during her opening statement saying: I think we can certainly say Lucasfilm now owns the intellectual property rights for those stories because they're owned by us. We also own the entire Skywalker story line so anything that happens after Episode VII, whether I'm involved or someone else is doing something along those lines - the worldbuilding that goes on within the larger universe that George created ... belongs to everyone who participates in that. So if you want to go see what's happening next you have to tune in to our films first. Then you'll follow where they take us.... But it could always fall back to me again. And then it falls back to whoever does it - like Indiana Jones. And who ultimately creates these things? Well, the people in charge of them. Puts hands up Also coming soon is LEGO Star Warsseries 9 starting October 16th 2018 featuring the Lego version of Rogue One trailer. Currently, there are two Star Wars TV series airing under the Disney banner. Marvel Studios developed an animated comedy tv show titled BANJO RANT JOKE SHOW while ABC had LOVED IN DISNEYLAND starring Emily Blunt voicing Pocahontas alongside Phineas and Ferbstarring Dan Fogler as Baloo.

We expect similar stuff for Toy Story sequels, Frozen sequel trilogy and Pandora - A World of Avatar among others. However, Disney hasn't released any official documents listing merchandise release dates yet, besides the fact that Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy appeared on the cover of Walt Disney Collectibles 2008 catalog.

This confirms that the movie itself might come out sometime between 2021 - 2024! If true, it means that the sequel trilogy will begin filming before 2021. Since AFTAH 2 was originally scheduled for 2022, this may mean either they have already started shooting footage or they plan to hold off until 20212022.

"Two centuries ago, it was established that the average human body temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius. Scientists have noticed a drop in average body temperature in recent decades as a result of stress and increased air conditioning use which has been associated with various health issues. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) recently released plans to study how low-level environmental factors such as light levels affect biological functions like metabolism and sleep cycles in humans by monitoring people over time at their homes. For this purpose they are developing an app called mHealthU, which will be used for data collection purposes only and is not intended to replace regular medical treatment. The project aims to measure physiological changes through mobile phone sensors including heart rate variability, respiration rates, skin conductance, blood pressure, posture change detection, hand position, head tilt etc., which may provide insight when there is concern about someone who seems ill. They also aim to monitor medication compliance among patients and record any side effects related to prescribed medications. It should be stated here that this research did not target individuals suffering from clinical depression - others had previously researched on the role of ambient lighting in preventing relapse after recovering from major depressive disorder. A team led by researchers from Newcastle University, UCL Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine, King's College London and Imperial College examined whether exposure to natural daylight could help prevent relapses during recovery from episodes of depression using records collected via smartphones. Along with researchers from Imperial College, the group also evaluated the impact of artificial illumination (ALI), which can make up anywhere between 5 - 50 of indoor environments worldwide. The results showed that compared with ALI users, those exposed to more natural daylight experienced fewer relapses. In addition, participants reported significantly lower daytime anxiety scores and higher satisfaction ratings with their accommodation than those living indoors under constant artificial lighting conditions. Natural Daylight: Early warning signs? highlights several limitations - one being that the sample size was small. Although the findings were promising enough so far, more studies need to be conducted before making definitive conclusions; further research needs to look into identifying causal associations between natural sunlight exposures and mood disorders. It would also be helpful if future work expands upon its inclusion of identifying specific neural correlates along with known mechanisms involved in the serotonergic system that might explain possible impacts of bright light therapy on negative cognitive symptoms, dysphoric states and overall well-being. This article provides detailed information about this important new discovery and tries to define what we know about different aspects of the link between our circadian clock genes and mental illness from both basic science and clinical observations. This review offers insights into the potential biological bases underlying the association between period gene variation and risk for psychiatric illnesses. The author suggests that the investigation of these relationships may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treating some types of psychopathology as well as providing greater understanding of normal brain function and behavior. Affective Disorders Research says: ""Such correlations appear consistent across two separate samples, suggesting that polymorphisms within the PER3LNPWR1 locus increase vulnerability to MDD, but do not serve as strong predictors of disease onset or course - whether following multiple lifetime diagnoses of MDD or single episode diagnosis."" With rapidly rising healthcare costs and government spending on prescription drugs reaching approximately 572 billion per year according to Barbara O'Brien's ""Prescription Drugs 2013"" report published last summer, it is perhaps no wonder that pharmaceutical companies continue to develop innovative solutions for patients battling depression. One company doing exactly that is Johnson Johnson, whose McNeil Consumer Healthcare division recently announced approval of Janssen Pharmaceutical's TRILOGYXR, a once daily antidepressant. This news comes hot off the heels of another announcement describing 'a breakthrough phase III trial investigating XELJANZO, once weekly agomelatine, indicated for major depressive disorder in combination with antidepressants [MDD]. Shortly thereafter Johnson Johnson received approval for Zohydro ER, Levo tapentadol extended release tablets, (TRAMADOL). Both new pharmaceutical products include FDA approved monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) carboxypropyl methylcellulose sodium salt (CPMCSA) and polyethylene glycol 3350 (PG-3350) to control nausea while taking agomelatine. Since 2002 Johnson Johnson has spent close to 2billion on patents related to melatonin and other sleep aids, and another 950million in investment capital towards non-biological projects. Almost half of all Americans admit to shoplifting at least occasionally, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics from 2011 - 2012.

"Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving Beta v9 update. It uses Tesla Vision, a computer vision system that relies on optical imagery. The release notes do not reveal many details about the new features in this version of beta software for Tesla's Autopilot hardware and vehicle computing platform. It seems like you can now use your mobile phone to take some nice photos in the dark when using Autopilot with Enhanced Automatic Steering (EAS). I am assuming here it is referring to the EAS option available from the menu under Advanced Driving Settings [Navigation] and Image Capture Stabilization Mode. This feature allows for up to 30 seconds at night or during poor visibility conditions without any visual indicators being provided by the car itself (assuming there are no obstacles ahead), but instead relying solely upon image capture based information gathered through stereo cameras mounted just above each side mirror on the inside of the windshield. That said, if you want to learn more about what exactly happens in this mode, read our previous article covering that topic on how Tesla will be testing out their self-driving technology over the coming months: Overcoming Obstacles With ""Enhanced Autonomous Steering"" And Their Blind Spot Detector Tested In San Francisco During Night Time Drives Last year, we shared two videos showcasing the application of vision algorithms that enable adaptive cruise control to reliably detect vehicles in blind spots as well as make lane changes safely even in bad weather. We also previously reported that parts of Tesla's early working systems failed tests related to their ability to distinguish between pedestrians and other animals. As mentioned before, most recently we have seen Elon Musk mention they are going to start utilizing an updated radar system called LIDAR which would allow them to better see objects around the speed limiters such as motorcycles, bicycles, etc., while also providing detailed elevation data similar to lidar scanners used by Van Gogh Safety Systems. Today's announcement was made last week about enabling hands free calling via Alexa, so maybe this relates to something else?

"The Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) fusion reactor in China reached temperatures of 70 million degrees Celsius, five times hotter than the Sun, for more than 17 minutes during a recent test. In addition to raising hopes that this three-year experiment will produce net energy by heating hydrogen fuel and burning it as hot plasma rather than releasing its heat into space at room temperature, scientists say they have learned much about how to build such reactors and create artificial starships capable of interstellar travel. The team behind EAST says these achievements are just the beginning. ""We did something no other group has done before,"" said physicist Yehuda Fischbach from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who was not involved with the project but reported on some of their findings along with MIT professor Robert Geller, also coauthor of an accompanying paper published today in Nature Physics1. ""It's kind of like if you want to fly a plane: You don't learn until you're flying."" Energetic laser beams fired at the inner walls of EAST shot out plasmoids - small bursts of charged particles - which reshaped itself quickly and then started generating electricity again. In all, 50 shots were needed over 300 milliseconds time span. And while EAST is still very young, the researchers expect future experiments could take advantage of the experience gained on EAST and use them to develop even larger versions able to generate power for days or weeks at a time. Such devices may be essential parts of long-term human settlement in space, says Geller. Relay stations might provide intermittent supplies of cold water to spacecraft condensing solar radiation; electrical panels would charge batteries used as fuel cells storing reaction products. Spinning superconductors connected to each other via magnetic fields could store huge amounts of energy efficiently. Useful work could release stored energy when someone turned off the coils2. Superheated sea To make a star ship using a design similar to those proposed after World War II, humans would need to reach depths of 200 kilometers below Earth's surface because ""it takes too many kilowatts [of power] to get anything accomplished at depth3,"" explains researcher Don Lincoln of Harvard University, Cambridge Mass., US. Even though the rate of fusion reactions drops exponentially above 100 million kelvins4, about 3 of the total mass of the sun's interior can sustain life - assuming photosynthesis, whose efficiency declines rapidly once plants evolve beyond algae5. But direct conversion of sunlight into thermal-energy without passing through liquid helium or rubidium atoms could yield higher efficiencies6,7. Fusion draws neutrons away from fission, so it generally releases fewer radioactive waste products8. Also, nuclear reactors consume themselves reliably, unlike coal, oil and gas. However, there are problems with conventional designs9. A kilometer-scale prototype must undergo years of testing10 and must operate continuously for decades11. Working instead between layers of high-temperature superconductors embedded in insulators cooled to 4K, researchers from Stanford University12 discovered that electron flows within nanoscale filaments known as flux tubes seem to act independently13. When two filaments cross one another, they annihilate leaving only tiny residual forces14. This allowed physicists to measure changes in density between different states of matter called quantum liquids15. Measuring drifts of electrons directly provided information on vortex motion16. According to theory developed by Luke Brown and his colleagues17, neutronium should exist, but at unknown conditions deep inside rocky planets18. Neutronium nuclei combine weakly with protons under low pressure19. Outside pressures cause quadrupole moment of 1-100 billion trillion tons per square centimeter20. Brown suspects that threesome neutronium protons hold together well enough against gravitational pull of vacuum21. Brown says he has strong evidence to prove his idea22, but cannot yet publish any results23. Today, NASA outlines plans to send astronauts to Mars by 203024, which means researchers will either need to identify new ways to extract oxygen from Martian soil, or figure out how to grow living organisms on distant worlds25.

"Solar panels emit infrared radiation at night. The photons going out into the night sky cool down the solar cell. This temperature difference can be used to generate electricity using thermoelectric devices, such as Peltier elements or Seebeck effect generators (the two names are synonymous). Thermoelectrics have been around for more than 50 years and come in many different forms and materials. Thermopiles use a current of electrons that flow through a solid material to create heat - which is then converted to mechanical energy by moving parts attached on either side of this ""hot"" element. Thermo-generators also work with electron currents but instead convert hot ambient temperatures directly to electrical power. A third type converts chemical reactions within a liquid fuel stream from sunlight directly to electrical power when they reach an appropriate working condition. In all cases there must always be some kind of thermal gradient involved if these machines will ever produce useful amounts of power. So, the challenge is to find ways to increase this potential wealth source beyond what it already is today.",0,324

"SpaceX Starlink engineers took part in a Reddit AMA on Saturday. Starlink will try to avoid having data caps on their service, but there may have to be measures in place for the company's services. Reddit user ushapersjourney asked SpaceX about how they plan to achieve above and beyond existing satellite broadband networks that are being established all over the world. The questions focused not just on reliability of delivery, but also on latency issues if one wants high speed video streaming or gaming once things start rolling out this year. One particular question was what makes them think Elon Musk can pull off something like StarLink? 'What gives you confidence?' he wrote. He responded, ""Yes I believe it is possible."" Here's the full answer: We started with satellites because we thought the economics would work better than terrestrial wireless technology using 5G mmWave frequencies currently under development by other companies (and others) around the world. Ultimately 5G is designed as an evolution of current 4G LTE cellular standards which include higher bandwidths and larger cells - so don't expect EVDO speeds anytime soon from space even at these lower frequency bands. But even operating our own network at 30GHz using Ka-band beams will require large number antennas or phased arrays to both steer the beam and shape it into small spot sizes to keep communications costs down rather than building many smaller cells. Both options result in very expensive systems compared to our approach where each Tesla uses only four simple horn antennae pointed directly up to create strong ground stations without needing anything more complex than flat Earth parabolic dishes. Another way to put it might simply be to say that we're doing everything we can today to ensure that Starlink works well for everyone while working toward future technologies that allow much cheaper infrastructure cost per unit capacity. The experts on Reddit were then given time to discuss and debate whether Starlink could actually beat global competitors such as SkyMuster and OneWeb whose prices range between 800-1,000 dollars a month depending on location. 6 of 6 If Starlink manages to deliver service cheaply enough, it could be a new competitor to traditional broadband providers who charge monthly fees upwards of 75 dollars. It seems this one still has a bit of growing yet before becoming feasible for the masses though.",0,326
"Four years ago in San Francisco, more than 700 engineers competed in a competition to build an AI system that could pass an 8th-grade test. 80,000 in prize money was on the line and top teams couldn't use any of their own code or data. It was the BigQuery Challenge at IO 2016, one of many industry competitions launched by Google as part of its efforts to develop products for the enterprise market. To date, it's been a success: In 2017, over 40 winners took home prizes totaling 1m each and dozens more have gone on to win big contracts building out what can now be considered enterprise systems based around machine learning. Enterprise applications are often built using components like NoSQL databases, object storage, messaging platforms, all wrapped up inside frameworks like Spring Cloud Data Flow. And while these tools tend to be used internally within companies to run services within those organizations, they're also being used to build new cloud apps - ones that compete with public alternatives like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure. That means enterprises will have two options when building new workloads this year: stick with existing technology stacks developed for internal infrastructure projects, or start from scratch using open source technologies designed specifically to power applications running across multiple clouds. The difference between ""enterprises"" and ""cloud companies"" is not always clear cut. Both types coexist today, but large corporate end users such as banks and insurance providers seem much better equipped to handle failure scenarios compared to startups trying to sell access to a business-critical service to businesses just starting out. Large corporations can afford to buy time while waiting for product managers' decisions; nobody buys thousands of servers overnight in order to scale AWS into Slack. ""I would guess most folks who aren't founded yet might be aiming for [public] cloud,"" says Caroline Palenchar, CEO of OutSystems, which makes software for customers ranging from small tech firms to some of IBM's biggest clients including NASA. But there may be less cost benefit in moving away from private clouds if you do so sooner rather than later. In the world where both licensed commercial offshoring vendors and offshore developers exist side by side, why bother? Why don't we just let them go work somewhere else, without asking questions about how well they'll perform, or drive costs down for us? The truth is, even though neither group works perfectly and both still face challenges, the combination shows promise for accomplishing tasks faster and cheaper than either alternative alone. This week Fast Company spoke with independent consultants managing IT departments for hundreds of medium-sized U.S.-based companies that employ tens of millions of workers. Like other survey respondents cited below, they're concerned about hiring talent locally and finding qualified candidates abroad despite low pay rates. They fear rising training costs and local wage pressures pushing salaries toward SaaS prices paid through monthly subscription fees. Their concerns amount to little more than a slow burn that reached a critical mass last month in response to the Trump administration slashing Obama era trade deals with Mexico and China. On March 15, President Donald Trump signed the USMCA policy agreement replacing NAFTA. Not only does the deal make American goods competitive again, but it frees foreign outsourcing companies like Cognizant Technologies Corp., Wipro Ltd., Accenture Plc., Tata Consultancy Group Inc., Infosys Ltd. to bring back jobs here, too. According to International Trade Commission estimates first reported by Reuters, total value added exports from countries impacted by the policies changed by 50 percent after accounting for lost output at U.S. factories, offices and warehouses related to changes in trade rules. When asked whether he felt his company had benefited from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact negotiated under former president Barack Obama, Mike Jacobson, senior director of operations and customer support at Deluxe Software Co., said yes, but admitted the real impact won't come until several upcoming regulatory deadlines kick in. ""We were definitely able to hire people from India...[but] it wasn't easy, because everything has ramped up since then. We started immediately looking for people."" Indian labor laws require many applicants must wait six months before working legally, giving locals first crack at potentially scarce positions. Some analysts say the country has enough skilled workers already ready to take advantage of demand for technical skills. Others point to restrictive visa requirements aimed at protecting high paying knowledge worker roles. Without special visas, Indians typically need five years experience living and studying outside of Asia in addition to specialized degrees from reputable universities like MIT Sloan School of Management. They'll likely command higher wages and benefits because English proficiency improves results. If not for visa restrictions, Canadian immigration officials wouldn't allow Americans to sponsor family members for citizenship, making it harder for relatives to immigrate to Canada, notes Luca Sauve, vice president of marketing at Fusion Machines BV, a Dutch manufacturer of computer enclosures.

"Uber and Lyft have been awarded a five-year 810 million transportation contract by the US government to provide transportation for federal employees and their families. It is unclear how the program will be structured, with details of what services they are providing being redacted in an official announcement earlier this week, but it looks like there won't be much change from Uber and Lyft's current working agreements after all: This Agreement provides Federal Transit Service (FTS) access to commercial ride sharing technology developed by your company, including optimized application programming interfaces (APIs), custom software solutions and other proprietary technologies. This includes any intellectual property associated with these offerings that was created or acquired during the development period between October 1, 2016 and September 30, 2021. In addition, you grant FTS a non-exclusive license to use and incorporate into other vehicles any patented technologies owned or licensed by either party solely as necessary to support those products. The intent here is to ensure consistent licensing of such technology regardless of which platform may ultimately become commercially available within the U.S. However, should more than one solution emerge, based upon regulatory approval, we intend to pursue a contractual agreement that would enable our customers to continue using whichever type of transport service they prefer. You agree not to limit the terms of this Agreement or restrict its scope through restrictions on usage, provisions relating to operation timeframes, geographic limitations or privacy requirements. If at any time prior to completion of the Contract, this Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 10 below due to breach of the foregoing covenants, all rights thereto shall immediately terminate without further obligation of payment under the entire Contract term. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you fail to perform your obligations hereunder, then FTS has no remedy except to seek specific performance. As usual, some new features were added to the original proposal - such as ""a range of optional insurance coverage options ... to help protect drivers from liability outside of accidents caused by negligence on their part"" and ""customized applications to make driving safer for passengers and pedestrians alike.""

"Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans use their legs as sensors, detecting anything out of place and adjusting accordingly, like how sailors adjust rudder when waves hit. Robotized devices can be useful at home or work, but they're still not quite ready to take on our toughest environments. Can robots ever learn through experience? MIT researchers suggest they can using Deep Q Learning - an implementation of reinforcement learning with neural networks. While traditional robotics has used trial-and-error approaches, this new method allows machines to ""learn by doing."" They propose combining both processes together: robots run experiments until good results are achieved; then those robots continue experimenting while continuously improving. As the robots improve, the environment becomes increasingly more difficult, allowing them to develop skills faster than before. These programs could also affect self-driving cars-a process known as deep reinforcement learning offers greater safety benefits over the current state-of-the art. [More]",0,332

"Silicon Valley security startup Verkada suffered a major security breach, with the hackers gaining access to over 150,000 of the company's cameras. Verkada serves companies like Tesla, Cloudflare, and Equinox, all based out of San Francisco, which means this is potentially data that could provide serious insight into their operations. Verkada CEO Chris Roux tells me ""If you look at it today, we know our customers are working on some extremely important projects,"" he said in an interview Friday morning. Our customers' included big name brands like Netflix, Bloomberg, Nestle."" He added: ""The most likely scenario here was someone got hold of credentials for one of those applications, they hacked the backend system, then used these credentials to gain full admin level visibility across everything."" Anyone who has ever played Civilization knows how easy it can be to hack your own game - by hacking AI characters or players. But that doesn't make it any easier when it comes to real-world hacks. In fact, if anything, it makes them more difficult. If you're playing as your friend, however, and his or her computer gets hijacked, there's almost always little recourse but to live with it. Same goes for something happening just outside of your home (which often happens anyway). A recent report from The Verge found that Verizon customer service agents actually encourage victims to pay up before fixing problems caused by malware. We spoke to several people behind various cryptocurrency exchanges about what happens after being breached, and came away somewhat chastened. It seems many have been caught off guard by the scale of such attacks, with no clear way forward other than trying to recover while simultaneously fighting criminal charges abroad. Kevin Hobbs runs CoinDash Exchange, the leading exchange for trading ERC20 tokens - essentially cryptocurrencies built upon Ethereum protocols. His team deals with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of daily transactions, so naturally it's taken considerable time to build its systems accordingly. After raising 22 million earlier this year, the company sent out emails last week notifying users that, as expected, the site had come under attack. Hackers were able to steal 3.6 of Ether coins, around 1 million worth, according to CNN Money. Although there are significant risks associated with decentralized crypto exchange platforms, particularly regarding vulnerability due to smart contracts within Bitcoin blockchain technology, Kevin says the news of compromise didn't necessarily surprise him much. ""Because we had a good number of active audits completed successfully and audited against multiple third party scanners including CERT and Open Source Security Assurance Consortium...we felt very confident that the codebase did well when examined rigorously and independently for weaknesses."" From there, the hacker group created fake accounts, threatened employees, manipulated prices, and ultimately stole funds. As far as how CoinDash plans to respond, Kevin told us ""We need to do research, get legal advice, discuss strategy internally, assess riskreward ratio."" Essentially, they plan to work through each step carefully, taking every precaution necessary along the way. Asked whether he worried about similar incidents impacting CoinDash moving forward, especially given new regulations forbidding U.S. citizens from dealing in certain types of currencies, Kevin responded ""Yes and no; I definitely think regulation will strengthen underlying technologies. However, it will also force change in user interface design to help reduce entry barriers to accessing true decentralization. For example, changing passwords requires humans to enter them into websites instead of relying on algorithms. Superficially, this sounds great but it still presents a single point of failure between the user agent (e.g., human) entering information and the blockchain network verifying it. With current advancements VR headsets such as Google Cardboard already allow for secure remote key management and opening wallets using smartphones. More advanced interfaces could evolve even further reducing physical exposure points, creating friction factors in the process that must be addressed at the platform level first."" ""I'm seeing signs now where some smaller exchanges may start closing down because they feel overwhelmed by regulatory concerns,"" GAW Miners cofounder Jason Sullivan explained to TechCrunch recently, adding that it might eventually become impossible to operate without getting wrapped up in chainsaws. What does California's newly proposed rules mean? Shareholders would be subject to fines of up to 4 percent annually per dollar of public float, though this amount varies depending on volume levels. This isn't for passive investments, either - companies holding 5 percent or less of a publicly traded stock must disclose annual returns or distributions to shareholders and file quarterly reports detailing stock movements. Exchanges, meanwhile, risk having their license revoked altogether if they fail to comply with the state's stipulations. So why bother? To begin with, sophisticated investors tend to ask themselves, 'Why should my money play second fiddle to someone else?' And when considering the marketplace changes wrought by bitcoin miners, regulators may want to take notice. When SAP announced its decision to divest itself of the software provider GAW Miners early last summer, Jason decided to send (and received) those values, and went vigilant, asking for to leave the freedom to do unto.

"The US Navy is planning to expand its fleet so that there will be two small warships to every large warship by 2030. In order to do this, they plan on buying an additional 31 destroyers and 15 frigates over the next 25 years at a cost of 10 billion per ship. However, what if it turns out all those ships actually aren't needed? What would happen if we got rid of one-third or more of our current naval capabilities for no cost whatsoever? That's exactly what happened when I wrote about how much money could have been saved in 2017. My argument was based primarily upon analyzing annual acquisition costs (a rather low estimate), which showed that we could eliminate roughly half of our surface combatants without any negative impact on national security. And while many readers didn't necessarily agree with my analysis, most agreed the savings were real and should be considered - especially since I offered several specific recommendations like reducing engine room crews from 30 sailors down to 20 as well as improving training programs, crew rest schedules, morale building exercises, etc. Nevertheless, you might ask: ""What about just not procuring these new 'unsafe' platforms in the first place? Wouldn't that save even more money? Didn't Admiral Richardson say once that he wanted us to get rid of everything but submarines?"" The answer is that's essentially what happens now, only it hasn't worked very well because the Defense Department has little incentive to reduce procurement budgets. But it can work better than expected, particularly if certain conditions are met. According to U.S. Navy projections, there presently exists between 10 and 12 percent overlap among major weapons systems used by both the combatant commands. Between FY2013 and 2015 alone, we saw some notable changes in overlapping requirements such as the firing range and number of missiles required of each Tomahawk land attack submarine being reduced from one Type 23 variant up to four variants; the air defense radar system going from a single EMDG-1652 radarsite located near Hill Air Force Base to multiple radarsites spread throughout Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina; and the sensors aboard P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft being replaced with Raytheon ANASQ-162 (V) 2 airborne threat detection system pods, representing a huge capital expenditure reduction for the service totaling approximately 6.5 million annually. We also noted reductions in commonality requirements for other weapon systems such as AGM-88 Low Altitude Missile (LAM) and AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM). Such reductions provide considerable savings through streamlining development, fielding and sustainment of similar weapons across disparate fleets-an accomplishment few realize is possible because the Pentagon tends to take Joint Vision 2010 seriously. However, DoD leadership recently reiterated their commitment to JV2010 during testimony before Congress and yet failed to mention anything that had taken place over the preceding two years. Clearly, some progress has occurred - albeit inadvertently-but questions remain as to whether actual savings exist and, if they are realized, who gets them. As many readers know, for months I've been promoting the need to implement performance tradeoffs and risk analysis tools within lethal functions. This approach allows us to identify potential improvements or modifications to existing weapons, equipment and tactics that may result in a change to mission effectiveness. While this often involves requesting extended ranges or payloads, sometimes a reduction requirement is warranted to offset additional operational commitments. Other times, personnel resources must suffice and require further management attention. Finally, we also find ways to minimize maintenance, life cycle support and replacement expenses associated with already fielded technologies. To date, however, this highly valuable paradigm remains largely unknown to senior leaders. If we truly want to learn how to modify legacy weapons in accordance with DoD goals laid forth in JV2010 we need to address the following issues: 1. Identify areas where existing investment exceeds available funding. 2. Build consensus around strategic objectives and then devise appropriate strategies to achieve them. 3. Disseminate best practices learned through trial and error over time 4. Establish accountability measures and timelines 5. Utilize high level engagement processes like reviews, decision making boards and formal requests for information 6. Investigate opportunities to improve lethality via open competition 7. Prioritize modernization spending using risk assessment models 8. Leverage off established commercial solutions 9. Change mindsets and culture Toward achieving these steps, let me briefly discuss three examples of successful multiyear savings initiatives currently underway involving new and improved weapons, munitions and technology programs. First, consider the Coast Guard Cutter Kimball. Based in San Francisco Bay, the Kimball proved her value last year after serving as commander of a cutterspace operations team tasked to monitor unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) -or drones. During 2018 she participated in Operation Sentinel, the third round of CTJSAT Active Protection System trials with upgrade kits provided by Harris Corp., worth some 1.9 million.

"Our brain perceives what we see in 3D by processing and combining the images from both of our eyes. A new study shows that cuttlefish also perceive the world similarly. In a video, researchers recorded how neurons within an animal's eye respond to various stimuli - a wide range of colors, shapes, patterns, textures, and more. They found that individual cells began firing when they saw certain aspects or features of whatever object was being viewed. The details were similar across different species: up to 3 of all nervous system-related genes are shared between humans, mice and squid. This research is helpful for understanding basic vision processes as well as developing new methods of diagnosing diseases like Alzheimer's Disease which affect the ability to process color and shape information. Understanding where these commonalities come from can shed light on how each group senses their environment. [Nature]",0,339

"CRISPRoff is a new gene-editing technology that can control gene expression while leaving the sequence of the DNA unchanged. Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without having to worry about off-target effects or genetic mosaicism. The tool was invented in 2013 by Drs Joe DeRisi and Michel Nussenzweig at the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center. All it takes for CRISPRoff to work is the placement of two perfectly paired RNA binding sites (guide RNAs) just outside an active promoter region on one strand of DNA. The guide RNAs will bind together with Cas9 enzyme attached to another molecule called ""transcription activator like effector nuclease"" or TALEN. Add in transcription factor (TF) proteins and you have your own personal nuclear warhead capable of cutting through any defense mechanism you program into the genome - even those programmed by other TFs! In theory, this technique bypasses all but the most sophisticated immune systems, making it ideal for treating cancer. But how well does it actually perform? After all, many people started using CRISPR as if they had training in biology, trained veterinary students are now doing surgeries such as Cesareans, and there has been some controversy about whether some techniques use CRISP too much. In fact, we know of no journal article where researchers used CRISPRoff to remove cells from animals without killing them first, so claims of therapeutic efficacy should be taken very seriously because if research results show promise then we could move forward faster than perhaps anyone might expect. This week, I got my hands dirty and performed three separate experiments testing CRISPRoff: 1) Roger H. Dower and his group at Johns Hopkins showed us a proof of concept, 2) Daniela R. Auerbach demonstrated a significant reduction in breast tumor growth, 3) Michael McManus found promising data towards discovering why this approach works. These studies were done independently of each other but after different periods of time. While these papers shed light on the potential applications of CRISPRCas system, more needs to be known before moving forward with clinical trials. To summarize, here are highlights from our findings: Proof of Concept Paper published Roger Dower and colleagues successfully stopped liver tumors growing in mice. They inserted both guides with their 5 ends facing outwards, targeting opposite strands away from each other. This way, when guides hybridize with mRNA transcripts, they can prevent translation. Mice treated with CRISPRoff lived longer than untreated controls and survived up to 50 longer than average. Since mouse livers grow back easily, treatment subjects lived until statistics determined otherwise (cancer reached a certain size). When therapy ended, levels of human albumin increased in blood serum indicating healthy functioning hepatocytes remaining alive. As expected, transcripts of beta-galactosidase increased due to mismatch repair mechanisms correcting errors in mismatched sequences between targets and guides. No noticeable side effects occurred during long term follow up. Therefore, CRISPROff holds tremendous promise going forward. More importantly, this paper shows that CRISPRoff can stop cell proliferation once treatment begins (which eliminates concerns about toxicity), providing evidence that this therapy may target only diseased tissue rather than entire organs. However, in order to test this hypothesis further, future study must investigate what happens upon cessation of drug delivery. Does the body recover quickly enough to fight infection, etc.? Can drugs penetrate tissues under normal conditions? It remains unclear but these questions need answering soon since the authors postulated that therapies would last 6 months...but also stated that with better knowledge regarding kinetics and longevity, treatment times could potentially be extended. A New Technique Demonstrates Efficacy Against Breast Cancers Danielle K. Auerbach et al., Phycology, pgs. , DOI 10.1179Phycocol 02171412PubMed Central Science Direct PermaFinderOn the surface it seems odd that they chose breast cancers instead of, say, prostate cancer. Perhaps they felt that breast cancer is easier to detect, transfect plasmids, inject viral particles into living organisms, and monitor activity within a subject over time - all possible ethical issues aside. Regardless, they conducted tests using MCF7 and MBA-MD-231 cells (two common types of cancerous breast cells). Cells were grown on chamber slides along with treatments consisting either vector alone or vectors expressing Cas9sgRNA complexes. There are several ways to check if knockdown occurs.

"This article is an introduction to learning COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL). COBOL is a domain-specific language for business. It excels in managing and manipulating heterogeneous data in record structures, which are analogous to spreadsheets or JSON objects. This article introduces the basics of COBOL programming in IBM i 7.3 TR 9.2 SP 3. I want this to be something that can serve as a framework - ie. I might add in more information later on about syntax quirks, how things work differently when running under classic ASP vs.net etc... The idea is just to get you started with some basic concepts before diving into endless blogs aimed at people who have already been coding professionally for years. The first thing is to define what a program does; these days we don't very often need to do stuff like print out lines one by one from a file or perform computations - instead our programs often interact with databases and web servers instead. So today's most common way to write code would be something akin to: 1 PRINT ""Hello World"" What will happen if that line breaks? What happens if there isn't any text after Hello world and it only reads it all down a single column until the page ends? A lot of times writing a simple test case yields results such as this... FORMAT GSDSFS02 JOB NAMELOCATION XXXXXXXX NAME PERMISSION IDENTITY ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIPCODE DAYS WEEK MONTH YEAR YYYYMMDD SMITH M F xxxxxxxx 123 River St Brooklyn New York 10001 1000 20 03 14 2018 And so much more! So lets take that example apart.... First off, lets look at the FORMAT command. format [restrictions] {variable default} In this case its simply saying print whatever comes after that statement till the end of the page, but then put variable over here, not default, because pretty sure variable defaults to blank spaces anyway. And now those shenanigans happened again. We entered another job name and printed the rest of the contents of the page - which would be the next year's date coming up the bottom of the screen. Now let's talk permissions. At its simplest they allow us to say whether certain jobs should run every week, month, day... You could even say it allows access to individual IBM services. For instance, users without access to SYSMAN may still function fine within their own applications, but many operations such as creating empty directories, extracting files, moving files... All kinds of things. Sudoers are used to give specific binary level privileges to individuals, allowing them to execute commands outside of their normal user group - this includes adding other groups (like admins) to a user's existing rights (e.g., sudo id admin becomes sudo su admin), giving them extra super powers. Understanding the full implications of sudoers is beyond the scope of this blog post, but keep in mind it gives individuals a 'root' type shell where they're allowed to create new accounts, delete old ones, reset passwords, change UID numbers, modify content, query system properties, set environment variables, kill processes, launch daemons (reusable background programs), and control subsystem parameters. There's also GROUPS (always read) which list specifically authorized memberships in order to prevent someone being able to log onto the machine unless they belong to a preselected host. Privileges exist across different levels too: the UNIX administrator has both generic and special permission (which includes changing multiple aspects of the operating system); the root account actually belongs to all systems administrators. Lastly, you've got your local user account that grants you access to all sorts of things. But back to our problem. Let's assume we wanted to restrict access to January 1st to those folks below a particular role called salespeople. Here would be a sample command: PROMPT RMFGS USERSG RULES 1231 - 0530 TASKLISTALL That tells everything it needs to know. Prompt says please tell me who's logged on right now. Then we ask for the roles assigned to each user. Next line sets USERGROUPS to a list of everyone else (those above ROLE12). RULETEMPDISPLAY says I'm going to display names based upon the rules created earlier. Rules are basically lists of text expressions plus operators (,-,,,etc...) and various functions .. combined together. One way to think about them is as pseudo SQL statements. An expression can include numerical values, strings of characters, datestime stamps, logical conditions etc... Functions operate similarly to SQL queries, except they return zero or a nonzero value rather than pulling rows from tables, the major difference being that while SELECT pulls rows from a table, IF (condition,[code],[text, WHILE loop condition],[recall, ULDTONE took place of doing nothing..""

"A Hong Kong tycoon is suing the salesman that convinced him to use a supercomputer to handle his trading, a decision which cost him more than 20 million. It is alleged that he used too much memory and ended up with an unusable machine The computer was given access to every share on Mr He's three-thousand strong portfolio of ""hedge funds, private equity... and others"" as well as all of the clients' cash positions in various currencies - over 50 billion. The data was stored using custom software by ICL, a company which claims it can do exactly what its name suggests: computers but without the cables or wires. Nevertheless, they were unable to produce records for any trades done after November 2015, when their system crashed. Mr He took the very expensive step of hiring half a dozen extra staff to process manually each trade individually because he suspected something had gone wrong with the automated system. But nothing came out until late last year, at which point he realised that he might have lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks due to inadequate backup procedures. He filed suit against financier Nicholas Tang (right), who sold him the S2X Supercomputer in 2012 according to Bloomberg (left). This enabled him to execute multiple order types simultaneously and monitor them continuously throughout the day It has emerged that this isn't just a one off problem; people are losing money left right and centre due to poor management processes and lack of back ups. Over 60 of brokerage firms lose client assets on average per month as if they fail to observe even basic safety precautions such as backups. You may be thinking why would anyone want such a thing? After all, there's already so many brokers available for you to choose from! Well, think again: not only does having your own personal arsenal make you feel safer, it also makes life easier for yourself through automation and therefore reduces costs overall. To put things into perspective, Amazon charges roughly 0.10 per transaction while Coinbase takes around 7, which means paying both services around 77month to execute 100 transactions. Then add another 12 months to pay someone else to manage those shares, plus two accounts minimum fees, the total comes out costing 132 - almost twice as much per month compared to doing it all yourself. In other words, removing manual processes will save you time, avoid mistakes, reduce costs and ultimately make your investment activities less stressful. There are four different ways to automate your investments, meaning you don't need to give up control entirely: 1) Automate everything 2) Isolate certain functions 3) Use artificial intelligence 4) Outsource completely. We cover these in detail below beginning with first option number 1: automate absolutely (and then go onto subsequent options).

Even while reading this article you must be going 'but how come none of my friendsfamily know anything about finance??' So let's explore financial literacy in terms of how humans store information. As far as most people understand the concept, storing info somewhere safe is incredibly important. If you forget where or am unsure whether the content was backed up correctly, it could mean serious trouble should unforeseen circumstances arise later on down the line. Luckily, modern technology allows us to create perfect copies known as snapshots or images. Snapshots aren't quite identical to the original file, however, they are extremely close thanks to utilising state-of-the-art algorithms that compress files within milliseconds. These days, simply downloading an image file to our desktop is enough to ensure no harm befalls our documents during a power cut. Conversely, older methods involved uploading thousands upon thousands of individual bits called bytes and keeping track of byte shifts and changes to ensure the integrity of said document. Unfortunately, this method became obsolete along with floppy disks, microchips and paper folders. Nowadays, flash drives and SSD require little maintenance despite holding large amounts of data. Of course, depending on your budget, a good quality laptop can still perform amazing feats like video editing, though admittedly that kind of operation requires high bandwidth and highly efficient processing capabilities. How to Back Up Your Portfolio Using Images Today Snapshotting enables us to write small chunks of binary code to external storage devices instead of pushing thousands and thousands of bytes of random numbers and letters towards USB ports. Alternatively, if you prefer the old school way, leave it to professionals and ask a friend or family member to restore your data via FTP, emailing, copying or whatever method works best for them.

"Memory is a new feature for Google Assistant that uses a digital locker to store things like to-do lists, notes, reading lists, images, and more. It is designed so users can find the information they're looking for by using keywords or phrases instead of numbers - just ask ""OK Google"" two times when you want to search for something. More importantly though is what it's able to do with that memory: you can have your Assistant remember any web page in Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android (via an extension), and Edge on Windows 10 as part of its ""personal knowledge graph."" Users will be able access their saved Web pages simply by speaking out loud while connected to Alexa devices. That means there are no longer limits imposed on how many instances of Bing or Wolfram Alpha searches you may make before having to reauthorize each time; both services were previously limited to eight at once (though Bing Search Plus Your World does let you add up to 50). And of course, you'll also be able to get answers from Microsoft Translator too. To start off with the basics, all you need to do to create a space where you can save your favorite news articles, recipes, or other collections is say ""Ok Google,"" then press down twice after saying the command. Once done, you'll immediately see the results pop up on screen. You can edit them later if you'd like, but ""save"" only saves one collection per device. If this seems familiar to anyone who has used Apple's own Reminders app, that's because the same concept was first introduced in 2014 with a similar name called Memo - which went into beta last year. If you've been keeping track, we now have four major voice assistants available to us today: Amazon EchoFire TVAlexa, Cortana on Xbox One and Windows 10, Siri on iPhone, iPad, Macs and HomePod, and Jelly Bean on Samsung SmartThings Hub. The latter three are still being limited to US English speakers for now, making it difficult to compare apples to oranges with regards to user experience. But all appear to work well enough and offer similar functionality. There's still some mystery around exactly why these competing platforms exist, nor whether future ones might emerge next year. Some hints suggest that retailers such as Overstock.com will use AI technology to personalise offers based on customer preferences without needing a traditional human salesman behind the scenes. Indeed, the company's president Patrick Byrne told Bloomberg News earlier this month: ""Amazon is not actually trying to replace salespeople."" Other possibilities include deeper integration between devices and data storage from providers such as Facebook.

"Fitbit announced a new premium service called Fitbit Care designed for health care customers or employers and health systems that use Fitbit to keep tabs on employees' health efforts and fitness goals. What's the story? The company previously launched programs like Employee Wellness, which was part of their enterprise program but now is offered as an independent option, which allows companies to offer incentives, employee-only discounts and more support services through this platform. The company also offers free continuous heart rate monitoring with its wristband devices sold in retail stores. That offering will be expanded under this new program that includes insurance coverage options. I spoke about it at Web Summit 2018 earlier today. ""We are taking what we have done before and making sure our products are aligned with how people live,"" said CEO James Parkin while speaking onstage at the summit today. ""So you can get healthier by moving around."" How does it work? This month's announcement focused mostly on US plans, where they will provide access to Medicare Advantage Plans (MAP). Those MAP offerings run parallel to medical providers so if your doctor recommends something related to improving health, such as exercise, then you would go see them instead of going to just another hospital, clinic, etc.; however, if you aren't eligible for any insurance plan, then there is no additional cost to getting healthy through Fitbit Care: It comes out of pocket. Parkin told me that he thinks healthcare costs should come down over time and in some cases could even drop as much as 40. This move from one publicly traded company to creating custom bespoke solutions for individual retailers and the likes of Walmart who owns ecommerce giant Jet.com doesn't mean Fitbit has lost interest in selling their products directly to consumers; rather than focusing entirely on business sales. But the company's large footprint within the corporate world make these types of partnerships valuable and help the company reach many different markets at once. They're hoping to expand into other industries too including education and brick mortar retailing. Getting access to various forms of payment makes sense given the type of product, the amount of data being accumulated and analyzed, and the level of customer satisfaction being achieved - all key metrics for success in consumer wearables right now. And with several major carriers already doing mobile payments using Apple Pay and Android Pay and others announcing similar initiatives, this becomes increasingly important. Why should enterprises pay attention? According to Nielsen, only 3 of cell phone users say they track physical activity regularly. So imagine what kind of potential exists among those 90 percent who don't? If most Americans will start tracking activities outside of the gym or field when provided with enough incentive, why won't businesses do the same? What kind of competitive advantage companies looking to grow their workforce might gain from helping motivate individuals to meet physical activity objectives. Incentives also allow employees to evaluate whether certain kinds of behaviors truly improve their quality of life. Health apps like MyFitnessPal were able to prove that as soon as someone started paying 4 per day to get daily movement checks, they saw significant improvements in their calorie intake and weight loss over four months. Employees want better ways to manage their stress and get ahead in their careers, which often means working long hours without breaks. These basic needs translate well to wearable technology. Add a fitness tracker to workplace wellness plans, and you've got a winwin situation for both sides. Finally, gets a lot easier to create campaigns where rewards are tied to specific targets like steps taken each week versus monthly goals, calories burned. Companies can help incentivize workers to stick to recommended weekly goals that prevent negative effects on overall health. As a bonus, they'll look good because they took action on their own behalf. Our Take I think it's great news that FitBit wants to collaborate and potentially sell their software to other third parties. We haven't seen anything else quite like this yet though, particularly not from a multi-billion dollar corporation trying to target the enterprise market. Regardless of the timing, this is huge!",0,352
"Google is testing a new feature on their Google Maps app that will allow users to receive directions though their phone camera in real time. The feature will create an overlay of your current location and the direction you are facing, so if you're driving down the street it would be possible for people watching at home to see where you need to turn next. This isn't entirely new - as early as 2011 Facebook has been working on similar Real-Time Directions integration into its own map platform using GPS data from smartphones. However, Google's implementation covers more ground than just simple turn by turn navigation. At launch when taking photos through the app, you can also receive real-time traffic alerts overlaid over the photo itself. While these were previously available only for Android devices during beta tests, they have now rolled out on iOS along with the latest updates to both the iPhone 6s and Apple Watch apps today.

"A SpaceX Starship rocket prototype has exploded during a pressure test. It was the second to explode in four months. Founder Elon Musk has laughed off the incident, saying that he's more interested in rockets than money. The first explosion occurred on March 26th at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and it involved an aluminum structure for the Raptor engines of Rocket 2, which is a fully reusable spaceship capable of taking humans into orbit or beyond Earth's atmosphere. The vehicle landed on concrete pads nearby after blasting off from Florida last summer; its 10-foot diameter hopper had enough room inside for around five cubic meters of cargo. As we reported earlier this year, those Starhoppers will eventually be able to ferry passengers to Mars. It looks like engine 1 lifted off with only one pipe attached while engine 2 was carrying two pipes! pic.twitter.comvxPbH3z0N5 - Chris B - NSF (NASASpaceflight) April 6, 2019 Rocket thruster manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne built the Raptor Starhopper by hand over a period of nearly ten years, costing 8 million (24M adjusted). In order to make the craft as fast and light as possible, they used carbon fiber instead of metal, relying upon computer simulations to design parts that would easily break apart under high stress loads. If successful, it could provide cheaper access to space than traditional expendable rockets. A second iteration, dubbed the ""Starship Mark II,"" recently made its way through testing at CCAFS. Its full name is Space Exploration Technologies Second Generation Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (SpaceX's Twitter handle is spacexs).

One reason is the fact that not all home owners know how much energy their homes actually consume, let alone any idea whether they need to reduce household consumption to avoid having to spend too much time and effort keeping ahead of utility bill increases.

"Amazon is in advanced talks to buy self-driving startup Zoox, which was valued at 3.2 billion in 2018. The deal is still being finalized and discussions could still fall apart. If it does go through, the move would represent a huge step forward for Amazon - CEO Jeff Bezos has invested heavily on futuristic technologies like drones and AI. Zoox, founded in 2016 by MIT researchers who previously worked with Google's Self Driving Car Project, builds computer vision systems that enable cars (and other autonomous vehicles) to see what they can't yet without relying on cameras or lidar sensors mounted on the vehicle itself. Its technology aims to make driving safer than human drivers both inside of and outside of an automated car. It built its first system using Nvidia GPUs because one of Zoox's cofounders had connections within the company as well as experience working on GPU projects from his work with GM Cruise, but now uses custom silicon hardware. The company is currently designing complete sensor packages for production cars including front-, rear-, side-, and 360-degree LIDAR units that aim to provide more reliable detection and better readings of objects around the vehicles. All of this data goes into software algorithms designed to organize data and predict where possible collisions will happen based off of the current conditions surrounding the vehicle. And these predictions are accurate enough that their collision avoidance strategy works even when vehicles are traveling far above 80mph.

"Barcelona-based startup Kreios Space plans to send satellites on very low Earth orbit (VLEO) missions. VLEO is a zone between 95 to 250 miles of altitude. Most satellites operate at the lower end, and usually they are used for military or scientific purposes, but as technology improves, more companies like this one has decided that the benefits outweigh the risks. In some cases, these will be small independent payloads launched by rocket fairings from private rockets such as Rocket Lab's Electron vehicle and Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne launch system. In other instances however - including what you may have seen in our recent article about Tesla working with Airbus - there could be larger commercial applications. These would use smaller vehicles than most traditional satellite launches using SpaceX Falcon 9 and United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets, which typically carry around 100kg into Low Earth Orbits. The smallest spacecraft that can currently go up qualify under the definition of ""small"" include cubesat sizes up to 102cm across at launch mass. Current estimates suggest average LEO altitudes range from 450km - 1000Km, so plenty of room exists above an area where communication signals do not travel well. Flight times are estimated to last anywhere between 3 - 6 months depending on your choice of orbits; large numbers of CubeSats require only three months while others can take several years before being deployed.",0,368
"A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge has increased the amount of energy extractable from photosynthetic bacteria by over an order of magnitude. Scientists have been trying to harvest solar power for years, but efforts often struggled with losses in efficiency due to a poorly understood phenomenon known as 'exciton quenching' (eQ). This new technique removes eQ and could pave the way towards more efficient green technology, say scientists. The work is published today in Science Advances on 30 November 2018. Light-harvesting complexes use photons absorbed by chlorophyll molecules embedded in their structure to conduct excitation energy across protein scaffolding structures called light-harvesting antennae or LHCs. These always comprise many hundreds of proteins, which are arranged into subcomplexes linked together like beads on string. When excited by sunlight this results in millions of simultaneous chemical reactions that produce ATP - adenosine triphosphate, a molecule we all need to live to survive. To make things even more complicated, certain protein components don't just absorb specific wavelengths when they get hit, instead absorbing strongly at different points around the visible spectrum: red, orange and yellow, before fading out. Therefore most systems must aggregate multiple pigments to maximize absorption rates. Despite these complications, organic chemists have located the main sources of photovoltaics in nature. They contain pigments such as bacteriochlorophyll b (BChlb) that can give rise to extremely high electron charge transfer efficiencies (90) under conditions where the pigment aggregates through hydrogen bonding between neighbor proteins. However, despite intensive research, synthetic methods fail to deliver similar values. Failing techniques include temperature cycling, controlled pH environments, and attempts to break apart existing H bonds - thereby destroying the thermodynamics dictated aggregation mechanism. So far no one has created a system capable of harvesting 100 of incident photon flux while remaining stable at room temperatures; however there remains hope if current knowledge about molecular mechanisms involved in light collection are applied correctly. The researchers report that they achieve near-quantitative energy extraction levels (95), i.e., close to theoretical limits set by quantum mechanics, using a simple model based on the photosystem I complex isolated from Synechocystis PCC 6803 cyanobacteria. This discovery opens up the possibility of achieving very high storage capacities without needing any catalyst. In fact, it also allows us to understand how to stabilize a large number of chromophores in one place using fine tuning the intermolecular interactions among them. It was previously impossible because the critical threshold for optimum performance depended nonlinearly upon the total concentration of BChls. Excitons are unstable particles consisting of an antiparallel pair of electrons bound to positive holes, carried within energy bands of opposite spin polarization. One important property of excitations is their ability to travel long distances in space and time, transported along weakly interacting channels within semiconductors and insulators, until some point when a collision occurs releasing its stored energy in heat rather than electricity. Coherent optical control (COC), an experimental approach developed recently at Harvard University, uses laser pulses to induce coherent oscillations in electronic states resulting in the production of single excitons. A ubiquity in biochemistry demands energy be delivered reliably to every nucleotide residue of DNA and RNA during transcription and translation. Unsurprisingly then, the concept itself extends naturally to latching onto biological processes wherever the creationdestruction of transient quantum superpositions is required. For example, recent studies from Robert Feynman's laboratory demonstrated COC can drive water splitting to create protons and oxygen. Another demonstration showed that repeated applications of laser pulses followed by exposure to ambient lighting will cause a luminescent filament to appear spontaneously after hours of waiting. Finally, other approaches used femtojoule lasers to generate subthreshold electric potential differences and trigger ionic pumps in lipid bilayer membranes by means of ultrafast opto-synaptic stimulation. In contrast to the above cases, this study demonstrates that low-power laser illumination can reverse microscopic entropy gradients across the outer membrane of cells to harvest both massless wavepackets and eastbound Coulomb currents. Specifically the authors demonstrate that decelerating fast rising Gaussian packets traveling at least two orders of magnitude faster than bulk lattice vibrations can accumulate substantial amounts of kinetic momentum in less than 1 ms under ambient conditions provided suitable optical field parameters are met. Such counterintuitive behavior may provide insight into an understanding of why nature evolved rapid electrochemical transport in biomembranes. COC therefore offers a fundamentally novel physical picture of how the world works at the atomic scale beyond traditional models based on classical physics. To date almost nothing is known about how electrocytes living inside our bodies interact with light. Maybe down deep something still doesn't fit right?

"Sperm counts in the West have dropped by 50 percent due to pesticides, plastics, and other chemicals. Chemicals used to make plastic soft and flexible, like phthalates, are endocrine disruptors - they can mimic or block hormones. And they're found all over our environment: Studies show that more than 80 of Americans carry these hormone-mimicking phthalate compounds in their bodies. And as we eat even more processed foods containing them, our sperm count continues to decline. The problem is so widespread it has now been recognized as a pandemic of reproductive health problems affecting men worldwide (and women as well). More than 1 billion people suffer from low libido - a condition defined by impaired sexual function that leads to high rates of depression and anxiety in both sexes. As many as 45 million American adults report being unable to get an erection for at least three months per year without treatment - the result of rising obesity, diabetes, heart disease, mental illness, environmental toxins, toxic stress, medical procedures, medications, radiation exposure and much else. The cost of erectile dysfunction treatments alone in this country runs into tens of billions each year. In addition, nearly half of U.S. couples experience infertility issues. Another study released today demonstrates how pervasive such chemical exposures may be -from molds to certain pharmaceuticals- triggering premature aging throughout our bodies and leading us toward early death from cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This crisis threatens not only individual lives but also society itself. Erectile dysfunction is already costing American employers 12 billion annually because of lost productivity, says Dr. Christian Grohmann, Chief Medical Officer of Avene Pharmaceutical. It means thousands of jobs in manufacturing, engineering, IT services and construction; millions in waiting rooms, retailing, food service and entertainment industries; and ultimately, trillions of dollars in reduced workforce participation costs across America. A 2015 poll revealed 54 of employed males age 18-44 -half of whom were married had trouble achieving orgasm (according to sex therapists who specialize in male sexuality). That rate rises to 66 among those with children under eighteen years old - meaning one out of every two working parents struggle to reach climax regularly. These numbers don't include countless upstanding citizens whose marriages flounder because vaginal dryness prevents intercourse and relationships continue unresolved. Or men too embarrassed to tell anyone about their suffering...or worse, ashamed to seek help. As you read through my writings on this site, please remember that it isn't always easy for me to write candidly about intimate subjects that affect so many -especially when I've struggled with anxiety myself.

If there's anything you see missing here, feel free to let me know where I should add more details or specific examples of what someone might encounter doing therapy work with me. Please take precautions if something triggers your own PTSD trauma memories by taking extra care during times of great emotional distress (not trying to scare you or give you nightmares) and setting boundaries before engaging in any new activities. Trying to hide from real life doesn't resolve anything! Better yet, avoid places full of crowds, noise, odours or busy streets altogether if possible. If I've got it right, it's important to understand that we're facing the greatest epidemic of chronic immune activation known since infectious epidemics swept this planet centuries ago. Modern conveniences and the western diet seem to contribute greatly to ongoing systemic inflammation which appear like mere bugs in our software, hiding somewhere deep within our DNA until triggered by certain circumstances. Our constant exposure to artificial light, EMF (electromagnetic fields), and proinflammatory substances causes our cells' receptors to become hyperactive giving rise to all sorts of unnatural reactions inside and outside the body. There's no question that modern living conditions play a large role in causing autoimmune disorders, allergies, asthma, Type II Diabetes, osteoporosis, PMS, fibromyalgia, ADHD, Alzheimer's and dementia, arthritis, Parkinson's MS, etc., with some noting that almost 30 of all cancers could be related indirectly to inflammatory processes. Yes, most of us probably live longer than ever before thanks to amazing advances in naturopathic medicine. But sickness is still part of human nature. We're never going to find true peace unless we address root causes instead of artificially suppressing ""symptoms"" via dangerous drugs or surgery. You must first acknowledge the truth about yourself -that you do indeed have a mind and emotions that cause physical pain and emotional dysfunctions -then learn ways to manage those limitations rather than mentally self mutilating yourself further attempting to fix misrecognized wounds caused more often by conscious acts of aggression against oneself that keep cycling endlessly. Though I'd say fixing the brain and nervous system will likely solve most medical mysteries. Healing starts in YOUR head...before it reaches your knees!

"In a project called Mission Shakti, India has successfully tested its Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile, which destroyed a low-orbiting satellite on Wednesday. While it is unknown who the satellite belonged to, rumors have pointed towards China and Pakistan as possible targets. The ASAT missile was launched from Dr Abdul Kalam Island in Akashindi near Chandigarh; the Indian Defense Research Development Organization (DRDO) planned for this launch since January of 2016. It's unclear if the DRDO conducted any additional tests, but at least one report suggests that they did so earlier in July. India had declared an ""exclusion zone"" around the test site after conducting the first trial in April 2012: A successful anti-sat mission will be carried out by indian scientists engineers with support from our strategic friends like US,UK etc., The results would not only help us to check aggression against peaceful nations but also take forward our space program further. We request you all to cooperate fully with our efforts in this regard. Kindly provide necessary assistance to them within your capacity, As explained above there are excluision zones around some areas where such activities may occur. All persons or entity doing these activities will immediately inform my office before starting. These systems shall however be handled strictly according to law. I wish success to this effort. Sincerely Yours Shri Narendra Modi Chief Minister OF Gujarat PUNJABMAYOI KARMAHALANVIR CHIKNAPPRAZYATHAM BHAVA Dear Sir,I am happy to inform you about the status of our research on detectiondefence system ""KOMPAS"" for neutralizing satellites including satellites used for launching missiles space weaponsetc.. Our team has developed a laser based system capable of destroying objects weighing upto 12 tonne like satellites using multiple beams of light through different frequencies (wavelengths). This work can be done very rapidly and effectively without causing damage to infrastructure due to required power levels being limited (20kwatts max.) and hence suitable in case of armed conflict between two countries like ours against enemy country using nukes etc.It's likely to succeed operationally soon provided we procure few more lasers per year.We also desire USA UK to share technical cooperation on building same level defence equipment apart from sharing their latest technology and experience on building similar devices.You may kindly assign appropriate person in charge of the matter to contact me directly. Thanks regards, PS: A copy of the patent application filed recently in U S Patent Office might interest you sir.

The New York Times reported last week that Anish Pandya, CEO of Antrix Corporation told reporters that India sent waves of communication during the time period at issue, indicating communications were going back and forth among various government agencies. Twitter user Subhash1 tweeted yesterday morning that while he didn't see anything suspicious, his colleagues saw what looked like silent explosions occurred several times over the past month near the border area in Rajouri district. Space observers noted the anomaly after tweets began circulating early today. In addition to tracking the location of the debris via radar, IMAGEOS operators noticed something unusual coming into view shortly thereafter: That image became visible just fifteen minutes later, although again with no confirmed source yet: Soon enough, numerous other images came online showing the damaged satellite falling toward Earth: One observer went even further than that, tweeting consecutive videos starting nearly ten hours ago - currently sitting at 3200 retweets as well as 506 favorites and 1360 views - showing how the debris fell onto land. That video shows smoke rising off the ground: This morning, users on social media continued pointing out that the object itself appears somewhat familiar. Here are four separate examples of people wondering if this could possibly be a piece of another failed Chinese rocket, as spotted by Orbital ATK: Here's another example of someone seeing similarities to North Korea's Taegeuk 2 rocket: Finally, here are three members of Reddit noticing something odd about the orbit of Space Chain: If you're viewing this post Monday morning, chances are good that you'll find yourself confused regarding the origin of the debris. The story gets much simpler when you realize the debris is already orbiting the planet, having stopped the day before in low earth orbit. When looking at graphs of satellite orbits, you should always remember that orbital mechanics can certainly cause lasting effects because tat uses terms values carefully set up value of iota had they themselves in hopes that new tags has managed by no value to save would change",0,376
"Mobile Verification Toolkit is a collection of tools that automates the process of gathering forensic traces of potential compromises on Android and iOS devices. It was developed by the Amnesty International to help human rights defenders monitor mobile phones, tablets or laptops from inside their offices where there are no WiFi hotspots available for them. Use Cases: Mobile Phone Forensics - When devices need to be analyzed remotely due to security threats or sensitive data compromise e.g., when law enforcement agencies want to analyze smartphones, the tool would stop all background tasks besides preventing them from downloading new apps and updating existing ones, so as not to collect any additional information during forensically-important events such as acquiring fingerprints while taking photos in order to identify suspects who have been detained. The app can also run full disk encryption at boot time which makes it impossible for anyone to access files stored on the device without knowing either user's password or some other method to decrypt the file system. Remote Smartphone Control - In cases involving remote physical control over compromised users' mobiles, this application enables you to conduct a virtual remote desktop session on your own mobiles and see what they do whenever allowed to operate (iPadiPhone) whereas if you don't allow operations, then none will happen - which saves police officers time by eliminating one more step in addressing those situations since they won't have to go through tedious fingerprint collecting etc. How Does It Work? The mobile verification toolkit includes two separate applications for Windows systems: an android emulator and a windows emulator, as well as several scripts written using python language for iPhone iPad. These components work together like any local software suite, i.e., each component interacts with another based on instructions provided from the main script. However, unlike traditional software suites, every interaction between these components is fully automated via command line interface and does not require manual actions performed by a third party IT professional. More specifically, once downloaded onto the targeted device, only data transfer and analysis related activities take place, but never anything else. This removes any chance of tampering with the evidence collected through suspicious behavior monitoring. All interactions that can occur between a single pair of elements (device host machine) follow the following workflow: Host operating system boots up Device gets booted Updates OS packages Opens secure browser Allows smartphone to connect to network Captures IP address Uses default downloader downloads malicious Android package Data captured by the app is uploaded back to host Operating system updates packages installs malware modifies logs to avoid detection Even after reboot launches newly added App opens web page User browses websites Credentials saved in cookies used by browsing websites are sent back to server - logs modified again Disconnects phone from WiFI connection Restores previous state of storage Devices reboots back into original OS Installs phones OS Updates apps sets last installed URL as home screen Prefers specified set of URLs Creates backup packet containing vital information Sends it off Host operating system detects backdoor activity Logs send warning message Email report about device can now be forwarded to specific people if desired Sets telemetry flag in database Finds same host connected multiple times Deletes duplicate connecting log records Processes outlook client sends SMS messages to device Enables GPS location tracking Detains device Makes calls Can get call ID through CMSSDK Web page loads Includes mobile operators name Adds itself to contacts Contacts list Organizes contact updates into group emails Gets mail count Set restriction on number of minutes per day SMS limit with dates Details sent First connects to a certain website Removes cookies adds himself to whitelist Replaces keys save passwords for next login Suspended process Kills previously running processes Revokes all admin privileges Sets temporary adblock download blocker Settings change Restore device BackUp config target path Reverts memory settings Delete folder Contains images uploads screenshots shows current date time USB disconnection usbdetach Detects phone being stolen Records keystrokes stores password Encrypts SMS uses private API for sending Messages deletes record Restarts SSH service Checks Internet connectivity Shares info with unauthorized hosts Shows details on encrypted communications Decrypts SSL traffic Calls Google search engine Launches dictionary scan Search online for answer Runs shell commands Downloads file from url Starts recording audio opens microphone Aborts recording shares sample waveform Reads raw sensor samples Retrieves CSRF tokens kills task manager track java.exe reads directory Path starts lockscreen Password change Takes screenshot Lets edit orizontal bar Show clock Set properties (backlight brightness, vibrate mode, lock, autolock...)

Employees will not be able to use the free food that is provided by their companies, according to CNN Business's source. But CNN reports, workers can still eat lunch at work or take a break there for some fresh air (if they so choose). And if they need help getting exercise in during this time of isolation, Google has said it would provide paid wellness coaching through its corporate gym - though only one trainer per employee is permitted to make sure everyone gets individual attention as needed.

"The 61st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the first IMO that has been held remotely and may also be the last time that artificial intelligence doesn't compete. Researchers view the remote contest as a way to change how students prepare for challenges they will face in real life, including math jobs. A few weeks ago I was at my cousin's house where her husband had invited me over to watch their son do some video game programming on his new Nintendo Wii console, which prompted me to ask if he'd ever programmed before. The answer: ""Oh no! He learned it all by watching YouTube videos!"" As we were chatting about what our kids are learning these days, I couldn't help but think back to my own experiences during childhood when computers seemed so mysterious and intimidating and beyond anything you could imagine doing with them. My parents' old IBM Selectric typewriter did not even come close to being as clunky or giving off such a strange odor of burnt plastic as did the bulky monoliths on the desktop when I walked into my dad's office. Computers had little utility in helping people stay organized because there wasn't much point organizing digital information. Nobody used them to write letters; why would anyone want one for writing? Sure, there were calculators, but most people didn't know how to use them even though this realization came years after I was able to figure out how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide using paper-and-pencil methods. People needed calculators just to keep track of the decimal places while performing calculations involving very large numbers. However, once someone figured out how to program an electronic calculator to perform complex mathematical functions without having to expose the needle, people started realizing its value. It became possible to instantly convert money from hundreds of different currencies to dollars, euros, yen, pesos, pounds sterling, etc., plus many other values using only three buttons. Suddenly everyone wanted a computerized version of your trusty adding machine and word processor, too. Aftershocks of this cultural shift continue today, especially among young people who have never known any world without personal computing devices. Once upon a time, children got excited about playing games rather than typing long strings of code. But now programs like Angry Birds have become status symbols for teens. We're living through another cultural transition driven largely by technology. My point here is that more knowledge tends to mean less expertise associated with executing practical tasks. If you learn enough algebraic formulas to solve cubic equations, then solving quadratic polynomial equations becomes easy. That works great until you hit the real stuff. You need experience in dealing with applications of calculus, differential forms, tensor analysis, numerical integration, partial differentiation, ordinary differential equation solutions, Fourier series, frequency domain representations, infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, several complex variables, operator theory, wavelets, data compression, fractals, probability distributions, geometric optics, quantum mechanics, decision trees, evolutionary algorithms, graphical models, Bayesian networks, theorem proving, theoretical complexity, multivariate statistics, and a million other topics. And don't forget about linear regression, logistic curves, and survival analyses. A lot can go wrong and you'll probably make mistakes along the way. Luckily, the Internet provides access to lots of free online references to lots of different sources, including books written decades ago. Indeed, searching Google Scholar reveals millions of research papers covering just about every topic imaginable. More often than not, however, you won't find what you need unless you search specifically within journals that focus on specific domains relevant to your interests and career goals. Believe it or not, sometimes nothing comes up even with keywords entered precisely. This highlights the difference between knowing something versus really knowing it. Eventually, however, everything becomes second nature. You build up intuition that helps overcome problems. As iron sharpens iron, so does knowledge sharpen knowledge. This has led researchers to conclude that training via virtual reality might prove valuable when confronting increasingly sophisticated AI systems. They foresee working toward creating better teaching environments designed to enhance problem solving skills, increase retention rates, improve transferability across contexts and courses, simplify instruction resources, automate grading procedures, reduce cheating strategies, provide feedback, teach learners how to manage stress, and eliminate pedagogical barriers related to course materials, assignments, testing conditions, student expectations, cognitive load, prior knowledge, and motivation.[1] Perhaps most important are potential benefits relating to learner engagement resulting from immersive simulations of realistic situations that enable learners to practice authentic behaviors in an environment similar to the work place. These activities allow consumers to interact easily through language interfaces and physical interactions that present high degrees of fidelity. Virtual worlds typically consist of a mixture of sensory inputs based on 3D graphics displayed on either headsets coupled directly to eye tracking glasses, VR headsets, AR goggles, motion capturing gloves installed to record hand positions in space, audio feeds delivered using headphones attached to head-mounted speakers or earpieces worn over the ears, or haptic gloves that include tactile stimulators allowing users to sense touch sensations generated by the behavior of sheeple classes.

"YouTube and Amazon have finally ended their feud after a year of negotiations. The YouTube app will now return to Amazon's Fire TV products, and the Amazon Prime Video app is coming back on Android phones (and Windows Phones in some markets) as well. This doesn't mean that sales are going to spike for either company immediately; instead it means that people who previously bought Google devices to watch Netflix or Hulu online can buy apps again from those companies' respective stores rather than downloading them directly through other sources like APK Mirror or from third-party websites. But this also implies that more consumers may start buying Amazon video subscriptions and using its voice assistant Alexa - something both go hand-in-hand with each other. Why did they even bother negotiating? Why were they still at odds over this issue? Is there any way we could've avoided all these issues if only one had been willing to make concessions? We're here to answer your burning questions about why we needed another streaming war between two big tech giants. And later: how many times do we need to see the same ""strategic partnerships"" announcement before realizing what makes them work better than others? Amazon matters less because of the screen size factor, not Microsoft The first question people typically ask when hearing news regarding new platforms and services is whether users should switch away from Apple's iPhone platform. While Google has made moves toward making Android smartphones closer to iOS so you don't lose an entire user base, yes, this argument has always existed. Other factors include things like battery life, ease of use, data limits, etc., but most consumers ultimately value having options because services financially benefit too much by being exclusive partners on specific hardware, thus creating barriers to entry. Even though I'd be perfectly happy seeing Amazon or Apple take over the world, neither really fit into my daily routine. If I want to read articles or listen to music or talk to friends online then I'm already doing that right now. Sure, Apple owns a lot of content providers, but so does everyone else. Do I care about watching movies and shows in 4k resolution? Nope! So long as everything works smoothly enough, isn't offered to me free of charge, gets regular updates, offers lots of integration options, and lets me access and modify settings via a web browser andor mobile phone, then I'm good. There's no reason not to just give money to whichever channel allows me to get what I want without any hassle. Besides, let's face it: you can buy pretty much anything today on PC, Mac, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Android, Roku, smart TVs, game consoles... basically everywhere but maybe not on every single device out there, sure, but the fact is tons of stuff exists. If I'm only working remotely during travel then the last thing I would ever think about is switching to a different smartphone platform. It wouldn't matter if said phone was underpowered, ugly, never got software updates anymore, lacked decent cameras, ran slow games, had poor battery life, didn't support downloadable apps,etc. Because I am 100 okay with using whatever device fits best within my current needs and tradeoffs - which is what Amazon and Google offer. It seems silly for anyone to hate on Android or Windows Phone fans for liking the former while hating the latter simply because somebody likes iPhones, yet somehow the reverse situation ends up happening far worse where people seemingly excuse themselves from supporting OSes they would otherwise enjoy just so they don't feel awkward about enjoying a piece of technology someone dislikes. I understand that comparing Google Play Store to iTunes requires throwing around words like ""dead,"" ""deprived customer service,"" and ""abuse of monopoly status."" However, you forget that just because these systems exist doesn't mean they aren't viable choices to millions of Apple customers. Yes, Apple and Spotify have deals together. That doesn't automatically mean Google and Amazon don't allow similar arrangements. What if Amazon announced tomorrow that the next time you searched for Pokemon Go you'd have to download the app via Amazon's store? Would anyone be upset? Of course not! You know what the result is likely to be and expect such results beforehand. No harm, no foul. This isn't a secret formula unless you consider avoiding Apple's App Store a conspiracy against iOS users across the globe. Google knows what kind of impact losing Amazon Prime is having for Android owners, which is why I doubt that the change of heart happened purely due to pressure from Apple CEO Tim Cook. Even if his demand wasn't aimed specifically at Apple, he still might have found a way to lean on Google anyway. Don't believe me? Just look at Facebook Messenger according to Nikkei yesterday: Messenger is currently available for iOS and Android, whereas WhatsApp remains restricted solely to Apple devices. Given these circumstances, it appears Facebook wants as many people accessing its chat app as possible. Despite failing to extend WhatsApp outside of exclusively Apple territory, the social network managed to add features like the ability to sign off matchpool 1-2s to 2-1s to get rid of our powerbase.

"Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet which focuses on city and urban development, has released its Master Innovation and Development Plan for a proposed smart neighborhood on Toronto's Eastern Waterfront. This new neighbourhood is the first in Canada to be designed using Sidewalk Labs' ""Neighbourhood Transformation"" model, an innovative way of developing communities that will result in inclusive and equitable outcomes. The plan was presented at last night's public meeting held by Abundant Housing Ontario (AbHA) as part of their ongoing consultation process with local residents living near the site. According to Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff in his introduction to the presentation: ""The real work starts now."" Below are some highlights from the plan focusing on areas that relate to housing affordability and accessibility issues. Housing Affordability Accessibility Highlights Key Transformational Principles for the Proposed Area There are five overarching principles guiding the proposed area - A Strong Sense of Place; Careful Design; Embracing Diversity; Alignment With Transit Service Opportunities; Inclusive Inclusion through Community Control. These core values flow throughout each element of the masterplan including transportation options, open space designations, community engagement, etc. Creating a sense of place means designing neighbourhoods so they fit into existing contexts without feeling like separate enclaves or islands. This means taking full advantage of the existing street network while making use of natural features such as water bodies within the landscape. It also involves incorporating walkable streetscapes, diverse retail uses along main routes and enhanced public realm activity spaces such as outdoor cafes, play parks and green spaces. Carefully designed buildings have access points that allow people to move around easily. They include drop offpick up zones, accessible entrancesexits, loading docks where trucks can deliver goods directly to homes, parking lots positioned away from busy roads to minimize cross traffic and pedestrian paths lined with trees and greenery. Side-walks should not feel too narrow nor too long. Some designs even incorporate wide sidewalks running parallel to residential properties and sharing frontage lines with other commercial spaces serving nearby residences. For example, here's how it looks in Camden Yards - These streetscapes would create walkable neighborhoods rather than just connected road networks facilitating movement between private dwellings. Sidewalks may lack curb appeal but aspects including lighting, paving materials, tree density and landscaping could all contribute towards creating livable neighbourhoods via Enhanced Public Realm Activity Spaces (EPRAS). EPRAS includes parklets with seating areas along major transit corridors. Parks were added during this project to improve connectivity and increase walking opportunities. Even though these elements wouldn't necessarily serve as conventional playground equipment, they provide small pockets of green space ensuring children can enjoy fresh air, stay active outdoors and get safely home when school lets out. Designing for diversity ensures every person regardless of age, gender, ability or background receives equal access to services and infrastructure. To do this, Sidewalk Lab has made sure to ensure there are designated multi-use pathways connecting different types of users, ensuring everyone has safe passage wherever he or she wants to go. Referring back to our previous article about mixed-used developments, below is one possible layout as envisioned by students who participated in shaping the vision behind the proposed development. Buildings needed to accommodate dense population densities often require larger footprints leading to less space being available for non-residential purposes. However, to help address this issue, Sidewalk Labs set aside 30 of landfills for future affordable housing sites allowing developers to build more units than currently allowed if sufficient funding comes forward. Other strategies highlighted included providing childcare facilities alongside rental units. More details about how Sidewalk Labs plans to tackle this problem will be revealed later down the line. Aligning with transit service opportunities ensures more convenient destinations are provided close enough to attractive locations. Since most pedestrians already live closer to jobs than schools due to reliance on car ownership, the goal of this principle is to make sure ample amenities remain within reach of those looking to live in this emerging district no matter what mode of transport you choose. That's why planners identified key employment nodes including universities, hospitals, shopping centres, recreation hubs and entertainment venues. While mobility needs vary based on location, Sidewalk Labs stresses how important it is to consider both motorized vehicles and alternative modes transportation whenever planning a new development. As mentioned earlier, examples of places implementing various concepts can found across cities worldwide, here are two photos showcasing similar projects - Aesthetics references a broad range of artwork reflecting local culture and history. Sidewalk Labs wanted to ensure visitors driving past the proposed site had something interesting to see whilst maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. Artists painted colourful murals onto walls located at strategic intersections throughout the area building collaborative relationships with artists working in the surrounding community. Having strong connections to the local creative industry always provides great benefits especially given we're talking about a complex proposal involving many stakeholders with differing opinions.

"Russia plans to temporarily disconnect the entire country from the internet in an exercise designed to test the country's internet infrastructure in case of a cyber-war. The test is expected to start on January 23 and will last, according to Russia's largest news agency TASS, for five days with all major telecommunication networks being disconnected at 7pm Moscow time (12am EST). This would be the first ""Internet Storm"" since 2009 when Russian authorities tested their own national network during the winter holidays.

"Uber and autonomous vehicle company Motional have partnered up to provide autonomous deliveries through Uber Eats. A pilot program will launch sometime in early 2022 in Santa Monica, California. Only one delivery per day is permitted at this time. In the future we may not see humans driving vehicles on a regular basis as we know it now. Motional CEO Jay Shafer said that ""the next generation of mobility"" could come from an entirely different technology than traditional cars or trucks. They envision a world where people can simply order their food while still busy doing other things like working or playing video games. How does self-driving work? Motional has created its own algorithm for combining software with hardware that consists of sensors, computers, algorithms, cameras, robots, deep learning networks, and advanced instrumentation that are able to translate those data into actionable information. This allows them to build systems that recognize objects and identify what kind of movement they're making. The only requirement is that there be sufficient light; otherwise, mobile devices use more power because they need to perform image processing when there isn't adequate lighting around the area. The processes used by these companies aren't new - much research was done decades before Motional got started back in 2010. Companies such as Google's Waymo were also experimenting with similar technologies years ago to map out a 3D model of streets using lidar (a laser). More recently, Tesla deployed its Autopilot system to upgrade a sedan from 2008. Some researchers even think that skilled drivers today do some amount of automation behind the wheel when handling heavy traffic. But none of these efforts seem to have been successful enough to make a big difference in reducing accidents involving human-driven automobiles. In addition, many organizational challenges remain in terms of regulation and safety standards pertaining to unmanned vehicles. ""We believe the opportunity lies in creating more efficient modes of transportation that require lower amounts of infrastructure investment,"" Shafer explained. ""It should transform how most people move about our cities.""",0,389
"The World Economic Forum's'Future of Jobs Report' surveys corporate executives in 35 countries around the world about how they think the workforce will change in the next five years. Its findings confirmed what we have been seeing all along: At a time when technology is taking over so much of our lives, jobs that don't require high levels of education or training are going to be vastly more attractive than those that do, and it doesn""t look like there will be many new ones created at all, as automation (and other technologies) replace workers with machines. Here is one example from their report showing ""what"" people expect to happen but not ""why.""

That is probably because artificial intelligence has quickly become everyone""s favorite buzzword these days, signaling something big for us all, even if most of us can""t quite articulate exactly why yet. But let me tell you why I suspect this confidence isn't misplaced after my 34 years of watching today""s economy evolve on the job front. First, any form of mass unemployment (i.e., longer-term involuntary part-time work rather than reductions in full-time employment due to technological innovations), whether caused by robots replacing human labor or companies outsourcing jobs overseas, spells trouble ahead. It means lower consumer spending, which results in weaker economic growth overall. It also leads to increased social inequality, especially among younger generations who must settle into either low-paying service sector jobs or government benefits, while older Americans continue to live off Social Security checks decades into retirement. More importantly, such widespread losses in income over several years could mean less money available for consumption and investment, and therefore further headwinds for future economic activity. This might sound counterintuitive to anyone used to thinking of steady productivity gains being synonymous with stronger long-run GDP growth, but it makes perfect sense given that human capital creates productive capacity. And anything that threatens our ability to create additional well-skilled employees something savers need to protect inevitably reduces future output potential. After all, our economy needs both consumers and producers. If some of them disappear, then how could we possibly get production up to speed? In short, mass unemployment in America may finally force the country""s leaders - including President Trump - to recognize the scale of the challenge facing society. They couldn""t ignore it forever, and now seems as good a time as ever before. The only question is how far behind we'll fall before Wall Street senses things are turning bad enough to trigger a major selloff. What triggered all this concern in Fortune 500 CEOs included low wages and poor working conditions, increasing competition from digital firms, demographic changes leading to fewer young adults entering the workforce and insufficient global demand. In fact, the survey specifically noted that 50 percent of American CEOs felt impactful disruption from digital advances had already begun or were underway affecting their businesses. Another 23 percent expected significant disruptions within two years. Of course, this should come as no surprise, since 70 said cost pressures forced them to cut staff during 2018 according to another WEF study released earlier this month. What was surprising was how closely connected CEO expectations of disruptive trends related to actual events unfolding on the ground. For instance, nearly half reported rising sales costs (47) came directly from higher commodity prices; 63 percent attributed price pressure to market entry barriers imposed by foreign rivals. As such, we shouldn""t take comfort too easily at the prospect of cheaper imports once we realize importing goods is ultimately about getting access to technically advanced products at competitive prices. It hasn""t always been easy for multinationals to produce globally in order to address local markets, particularly when set against lower wage bills back home. Tariffs were originally designed to help domestic manufacturers compete internationally, not the reverse. To get past trade resistance, these giants needed to acquire resources outside their borders, building joint ventures with Chinese investment banks, Japanese car makers, German electronics conglomerates, etc. A few tried applying Silicon Valley tactics via venture capital investments, hoping the virtuous cycle of innovation would eventually trickle down to China itself and generate winners capable of competing with Google and Facebook inside its own borders. Unfortunately, not every company was lucky enough to find success. Instead, it turned out that 20th century industrial policy strategies weren""t enough anymore. Amazon made news recently when it announced plans to build its second headquarters here in Northern Virginia, offering US5 billion plus incentives to lure HQ2 to Washington D.C. But where will Amazon really want to locate 1 million square feet of office space and roughly 15,000 new jobs? The answer comes courtesy of China, where multibillion dollar RD centers employing hundreds of scientists and engineers attract global talent, creating a powerful magnet attracting highly educated millennials looking to get exposure, experience, mentoring and opportunity.

"Light from stars tend to pulsate uniformly across the whole surface of a star. Astronomers have discovered a teardrop-shaped object that only pulses from one side. The star is about 300 light years away and has an estimated mass somewhere between seven solar masses and 12 million solar masses, which makes it a giant among giants.

The strange incident occurred around 6 p.m. local time (2 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) when two witnesses saw a ""large white moving dot"" hovering above a rocky hillside northeast of the city. They said they would have reported their observations except for the fact that as soon as the bizarre crafts reached the edge of their visibility range, it shot straight up out of sight. Drummond Bailey, who writes about unusual aerial phenomena, told AOL News Thursday that such objects are usually seen by people because there is no sound accompanying them, unlike normal aircraft or rockets. But this particular case is interesting, not least because it appears to be a rare example of the kind of highly symmetrical structure known as a Dyson sphere. ""That alone raises some eyebrows,"" Dr. Bailey explained. ""It may just be something you find in science fiction books. It certainly doesn't look anything like any other planes I've ever seen.""

"Facebook has unveiled its plans to build Facebook Horizon, a virtual reality sandbox universe where users can create their own environments and games, play and socialize with friends, or just take in the scenery. The company is looking at launching it as early as 2019 but said ""the exact timing of launch will depend on how quickly we make progress."" It isn't clear whether this would be free for all or if there would be some kind of subscription service involved that you need to pay into for additional features like Avatar creation tools etc. Which I assume means they plan to sell video ads within the game. In September earlier this year, Zuckerberg had expressed interest in developing VR technology during an interview saying: ""We don't want this tech to sit behind people - we actually think these experiences should exist outside of your body. So over time I do believe we'll get to such a point where people have headsets attached to them and are able to leave the room when they go visit somebody else while still being inside the experience themselves...It does seem inevitable eventually that all our communication platforms will natively include some sort of AR-like layer. The question then becomes what form those technologies ultimately takes. In theory, augmented realities could one day allow us to seamlessly bridge between physical spaces (think about walking from your office to meet someone across town) without ever physically leaving either space, which seems pretty amazing. But imagine also having full fledged holographic teleconferencing capabilities? Or maybe even being able to interact with objects through gestures alone - no pointing device necessary. Who knows?! For now though, let me focus more on the fact that today, I am standing right here in my home office. I look around and see myself sitting here next to my computer monitor typing away and writing this blogpost! How crazy is that!? And yet, today clearly feels real and my surroundings feel tangible. As much as what happens in Pozner's book I read earlier today was startling, I wonder how long it might take before all VRAR become commonplace. Imagine the possibilities already available today and extrapolate forward ten years and thirty years from now. If somehow current trends continue ... well, how cool would that be? My personal hope is that by 2030, most of our daily communications occur via VR headsets so that when we stand up from whatever vehicle we have been driving for hours, we find ourselves back home. Not only does that happen but it seemingly allows us access not only to our homes but to anything and everything we purchased online or that we otherwise came across the internet.... Yes, it sounds farfetched but once upon a time, flying cars were thought to be impossible too. However, the future always brings new innovations. That is why I love thinking out loud. Do share any thoughts below on Facebook Horizon. Thanks again for reading. Cheers!!",0,392
"Researchers at MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. Electricity is made up of discrete particles, and it can flow with the viscosity of water or grease - a phenomenon known as superconductivity. But electrons are also like tiny magnetic charges that repel each other when they meet, creating bands within which their motion slows to zero; these ""vortices"" (the whirlpools) cause a dramatic reduction in electrical resistance inside some materials such as niobium tin alloys and cuprates. The new discovery could lead researchers eventually to better power-transmitting wires and other technological advances. The paper appears in Nature Physics on May 28. Scientists had previously seen vortices only in certain types of material, but never before in a compound where two elements were present in different crystalline structures. Specifically, this study looks at how interstitial atoms affect electronic transport in tungsten ditelluride crystals because this type of atom is often found near metal surfaces. Interstitial atoms occupy space between lattice points; most commonly they occur as vacancies left by ions during crystal growth. By studying tungsten ditellurides containing various amounts of interstitial tungsten, scientists observed vortex behavior even though there was no net density change in comparison to pure crystals. This unexpected result suggests that weak forces may be responsible for causing the formation of vortex states. Dynamics of Vortices within Electronic Crystals ""We actually turned our attention toward this experiment simply because we wanted to know why this intriguing effect occurs so rarely in any physics book, yet physicists keep finding interesting results from seemingly simple samples,"" says Nicholas Perez, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT who led the research team. ""If you start thinking about your experimental setup, if someone told you that something would happen just because you put together one particular element and another element, that doesn't seem right."" In the experiment, the researchers studied current flowing through single thin films over a range of temperatures below 100 kelvin. Using specially designed probes, the group measured the amplitude and frequency of voltage pulses traveling along the film's surface; when vortices form inside tungsten ditellurides, macroscopic currents can travel more efficiently than through conventional metals. Perez explains that researchers typically think about current passing through electromagnetic properties of matter rather than its microscopic constituents: Electrons move around nuclei whereas photons behave differently. However, according to quantum mechanics, both kinds of charge carriers share many similarities, including wave phenomena that can produce very similar effects, he adds. For example, the same principles govern electricity and magnetism, meaning that those fundamental concepts apply equally well to light waves and magnetic domains. Electron dynamics have long been considered uninteresting, notes Richard Feynman - who proposed them while working on his PhD thesis under Robert Oppenheimer - because not enough people cared much about the way they moved. In fact, many contemporary theorists still view them merely as bits of information transmitted through particle interactions, rather than as individual entities. But Perez believes the recent resurgence in interest in spintronics, particularly spin-based electronics, will revive interest in the underlying nature of electrons. Spintronic devices use external force fields to manipulate spins instead of electric fields. As a result, they're less susceptible to disordered environments such as grain boundaries. They require fewer processing steps and therefore lower costs, leading to faster speeds compared to traditional semiconductor technologies used today. Spin-polarized electrons are now being investigated for potential applications ranging from high-density data storage systems to compact microwave generators. On the theoretical front, novel methods to control spin polarization and manipulation using optical means will help find ways to minimize decoherence mechanisms and maximize device efficiency in future generations of spintronic devices. However, the creation of spin polarized currents based upon ordinary conductors remains challenging due to the presence of large energy barriers. To overcome these hurdles, Perez decided to investigate whether vortices in nanostructured magnets exhibit unique conduction characteristics that might prove useful for transporting spin-aligned currents across insulating barrier regions. He set out to do so by building layered heterojunctions composed of two distinct ferromagnetic domains separated by a nonmagnetic tunneling layer. The goal was to create domain walls that act as guides for conducting electrons despite their strong tendency to remain localized in accordance with the Mermin-Wagner theorem. To accomplish this task, the researchers grew epitaxial molybdenum disulfide layers sandwiched between strips of nickel oxide showing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Their results confirmed Experimentally that the NiOmS2 bilayers formed narrow domain walls dividing periods of either parallel or antiparallel neighboring domains. Current studies confirm earlier theories suggesting that vortices spontaneously appear near domain wall junctions enabling charge transfer across wide heterojunction interfaces.",0,394
"A Belgian research group discovered a major security flaw in the keyless entry system of the Tesla Model X. The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer to get inside the vehicle. The bug is related to how some vehicles use ultrasonic sensors on the windshield wipers and doors to see if someone's trying to open them, but not all cars make that kind of sensor available. By modifying an Arduino board connected to the car's central processing unit (CPU), researchers were able to detect when the CPU was sending out signals at certain frequencies. They then send these same codes back through the speakers once they take over control of the system and can start using it as their own remote entry code instead of letting the driver enter his personal PIN or password. ""We have written the first working proof-of-concept for this vulnerability,"" said Trevin Chowdhry, one of three hackers who attacked the car together with two more members named Kenny Bui and Huy Nguyen Vu. ""With this new approach we could bypass any biometric protection mechanism."" The team says that multiple automakers are vulnerable to such attacks, although none has responded publicly yet. And while most consumers don't realize there's been a major hack going on inside their very expensive luxury sedan right now, the hackers say they plan to release details about just what they found soon after putting things into place.",0,396
"OpenAI has released the full version of GPT-2, a text-generating AI system. When it was first announced, there were concerns that it could be misused to spread fake news, spam, or even terrorism; but in fact people have been using this technology for creative and entertaining purposes since about half way through 2016. The release also means we can use student versions of the model without paying licence fees. The official website says: ""You now need only pay 1 per month at (and if you don't want to do that just download the code). We are going to make two pieces of software available here on GitHub: one is an implementation based on TensorFlow 2.0 with which I created my own original story generator - I will call mine Boomerang because it pretends to continue what your last sentence said when you pause after finishing writing it; the other is by Andreas Stolcke from OpenAI who built his own much smaller, simpler, faster and less opinionated story machine. Both projects should run fine on most modern computers, both Linux and macOS included! They take advantage of some new features introduced into TF2 like eager execution, input tensors as graph nodes rather than variables as scalars, optimised graph operations such as tf.cond, etc., which may not work correctly though.. (I am aware that many readers will already know all these details well.) If you would prefer to read something more technical, I suggest reading Martin Forde's review of OpenAI's blog post announcing the general availability. In short, he notes that they used several tricks to get the best performance out of their existing hardware; a planned future upgrade should allow their GPU team to reach peak efficiency. As usual, any attempt to write fiction is doomed from the start. But if we give up before giving our brain too hard a time, then no harm done. It is probably better to try anyway. As long as we stick within reasonable bounds, and keep things reasonably interesting, chances are that we might learn quite a lot along the way. And perhaps come away feeling pleasantly surprised at how far we got - as I did while testing Boomerang over three weekends in mid 2017. So let me tell you a little bit about how I came upon Boomerang. My research group at UCL ran into a practical problem involving generating high quality data for training deep neural networks when you are working across multiple institutions with different preferences regarding privacy issues and access rights. You basically need lots of training data - say thousands of pages worth of stories - for each topic of interest ... and sometimes those topics change over time so you need the ability to generate them again instantly. So far, I had found the closest thing available online to satisfy these requirements being NLPStory, another text generation system developed by Daniel Jurafsky and Carole Wolf from Stanford University. This project offers free web services for doing exactly that! Unfortunately, as it involves running hundreds of mostly idle servers around the world, the development cycle is slow. Most recently, only English sentences had been generated. A few months ago I tried communicating with their support staff, asking whether similar functionality could be extended to include Japanese sentences. At that point, I lost patience and decided to solve the problem myself instead. Let me explain briefly why the solution turned out to be simple. It took me less than 10 minutes to port the program logic to Python 3 and implement the necessary changes to produce sentences in Swedish (the language of my native country), Chinese, Russian and Korean. I ended up having to create four separate models. Each one accepts human written sentences stored in plaintext files containing either prose paragraphs or poetry lines, and generates sentences. There is no learning involved; simply loading the file gives us a good starting point. A summary of how the different parts fit together follows below. Producing output texts with low lexical overlap between words makes sense intuitively because phrases and sentences are composed of individual words. On the other hand, having overlapping semantics encoded on the same level does require attention and effort during tuning. For example, producing a novel word meaning field requires putting a bunch of words on hold until the usage pattern matches enough to be seen clearly. I spent almost two hours trying to figure out all of this while tweaking the parameters endlessly. Luckily, I managed to find a decent balance that worked perfectly for Russian and Chinese languages; the rest didn't deserve to suffer through such aggravation. Now let's look at the underlying architecture. At its core, it contains five distinct components: A dictionary mapping unique concepts (prose words) to a set of semantic values, together constituting abstract meanings. These act as building blocks for constructing longer meaningful units like sentences and paragraphs Our main task consists of randomly selecting suitable sentences given a concept and choosing among alternatives one fitting the context provided including previously constructed ones. A vocabulary memory store storing sample outputs representing elements of the kind of properties useful with regard to literalise our fresh-to-recall words where we are kept clean and ready to see what else is possible think thought keeping track of ease ourself",0,397
"The truth is in the code: Fixing vulnerabilities with Sourcegraph. Remediate vulnerabilities with confidence knowing you found every instance of affected code and track your remediation initiatives to completion with one tool that continuously monitors, reports on its findings, and delivers feedback. It's not enough for a developer to know that existing patterns are poor practice - they also need to know why it's wrong, and how to fix it without creating more problems than it solves. In this course we will cover some of the most common coding errors (and anti-patterns), show how to spot them using code analysis tools such as FindBugs, PMD, CheckStyle SonarQube. We'll then create our own custom metric based on these results; which can be used by developers or teams to flag up bad code directly within their source control repository if they so desire. Finally we'll have a look at what all this means from an operational perspective using Jenkins background jobs as well as running unit tests against a set of sample Java projects - showing exactly where there may be issues in those routines.

"Amazon has purchased Facebook's small-satellite division. Facebook was designing and testing ways to advance satellite connectivity as part of an effort to enable the next generation of broadband infrastructure. It turns out that Amazon shares many interests with this initiative, particularly in terms of developing a delivery platform for shortwave radio signals. The social media giant announced yesterday (April 25) it had entered into ""an agreement"" with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to acquire Kuiper Systems LLC - which produces Soapbox satellites and develop high frequency communications networks using them. The deal is reportedly worth 500 million, according to Bloomberg News' Amir Efrati. That would make Kuiper one half of what will be two new ventures between AWS and Facebook: A venture to bring low-cost Internet access to rural Europe and Africa through shortwave transmission; and another related project focused on delivering services via fixed or mobile wireless carriers in places where there are no terrestrial connections. It sounds like something straight from science fiction movies, but it might not seem so far fetched if you happen to be reading techcrunch.com right now. The site is reporting that Google plans to test its own satphone network much sooner than expected. It also seems that Elon Musk is serious about his goal to put up thousands of nano-satellites around Earth by 2020. He's looking for investors interested in helping him achieve his vision. Here's some more analysis at Cxensecurity... Google told us last year we'd have internet service arriving on our doorsteps by 2013 and the company keeps promising improvements every time they trot out their fiber dish map. Despite these lofty projections, Google Fiber didn't start rolling across Kansas City streets until just recently, almost six years after the announcement. Turns out Google really doesn't want to invest much money and risk building a network when even it can't afford to run the current one profitably. And profit isn't exactly what city officials wanted anyway. But FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski wants to change all that. Once he gets the support of Congress, maybe Google and other ISPs will finally get the incentive boost they need. As Apple continues to beef up the iPad line this fall and winter, the latest rumor suggests the tablet maker could soon unveil a second model. According to DigiTimes, Apple is readying multiple versions of the second generation iPad for launch within three months. By comparison, the first version debuted nearly five months ago. While most analysts view Cupertino as content to sell its existing models long-term, Apple may want to introduce additional hardware variations without cannibalizing sales. For example, a cheaper 7-inch model could help drive market penetration in emerging markets by cutting down inventory costs. Or perhaps third-party accessory makers would benefit by offering accessories designed specifically for iPads 2nd edition. A recent survey appears to confirm what many customers suspected: Online shoppers aren't very happy with paying full retail price. Not only do some see retailers online as being ""cheaper,"" but they also don't like the fact companies charge shipping fees for items sold locally. In addition, consumers complain about poor customer service, slow deliveries and billing practices that add insult onto injury. Are those problems going away? Oddly enough, yes! There does appear to be a growing trend towards local transactions, especially among younger generations. Many states such as California provide incentives for brick-and-mortar businesses to offer discounts at some point during their transaction cycle. Perhaps, given today's cost pressures, these trends represent a more realistic approach to consumer purchases. Today is Tax Day, April 15th, which means millions of Americans stand before the IRS to file their individual income tax returns. What happens then depends upon how much your employer deducted for withholding taxes each pay period. If you got back an adjusted gross of less than 1k per month, you're probably done filing. You'll owe nothing because state and federal law requires employers to withhold wages and send funds directly to the Internal Revenue Service. To repeat myself here: Employer withholdings are mandatory. Now I know some people think you should take responsibility for yourself. After all, you were smart enough to take an education.

"Google Cloud has made its first major acquisition under its new CEO, Thomas Kurian. Kurian, a former executive at Oracle, joined Google in November and had announced plans to expand the cloud computing service's availability across the entire US southern region by 2015. Cloud services are becoming increasingly important for developers, advertisers, content creators and other businesses that want their data stored on servers elsewhere. That means there is more interest than ever before from potential buyers of the technology that makes it possible. Clouds also drive competition between tech companies because they spend money competing against each other on hardware and software that enables them to offer extra features or better performance for customers. The company will reportedly pay 1 billion to acquire Dataproc, which develops tools for analyzing big data sets and offers an alternative to Amazon Web Services' Hadoop product suite. The deal was confirmed today when both parties filed documents with regulators. Databricks provides analytics products like Spark and Drill to help developers create apps faster without having to worry about scaling out jobs beyond the capabilities of their own infrastructure. Last year its chief scientist said he'd love to see one day ""a single tool that runs all your data pipelines,"" adding: ""I would say this could be the killer app for clouds."" There have been rumors of such a merger since last August, but talks were only formally initiated after Google decided to move into the hosting business itself earlier this month. It didn't take long for the two sides to reach agreement on terms. ""We're excited to work alongside Apache Software Foundation (ASF) members who commit code for significant contributions over time,"" says Raju Vegesna, DataProc lead engineer at Google. ""In addition, we look forward to working closely with our existing community partners including Datameer, Echosign, Splunk, Talend, Zettlr, and others - as well as users around the world to make open source even more useful through our involvement in the ASF project management team."" Kurian described his vision for Cloud Platforms while speaking at Recode's Code Conference keynote interview session yesterday afternoon. He called for an end to the fragmentation within IT departments caused by the movement toward microservices-based architectures; his solution? A future where you can deploy applications anywhere using Kubernetes and containers hosted on public or private clouds, supported by APIs built atop Google's platform components. With so many different players offering similar solutions now, the key for enterprises isn't just picking the best choice for some particular problem - it's being able to adapt quickly enough so everyone ends up happy. In order to do that successfully, enterprise architecture needs to become less rigid and much more fluid. This doesn't mean throwing out everything completely and starting again, but rather looking creatively at how you might leverage what exists already instead of making things harder on yourself down the road.

"Harvard has created a Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot the size of a penny that can run at speeds of 13.9 body lengths per second. HAMR-JR was built as a test to see how fast and safe it could operate when pushed by human hands while moving on its own. The robot is able to move around obstacles, climb over them or even squeeze through small holes in order to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible by humans. The microrobots were developed by researchers who wanted both robots and people working together productively without causing damage or injury to either party - something which I'm sure will become more important than ever before with the growth of offshore oil rigs and other similar uses for these machines (some already exist). In addition to being tiny enough to be used in non-invasive medical procedures such as breaking up blood clots inside the heart and lungs, they would also work effectively within the brain where surgeons currently need bulky tools to deal with damaged tissue. They may one day not only save lives but improve quality of life too! I think what makes this project interesting is their use of bioinspired technology. This is an area I am interested in myself so I thought I should share my thoughts here... Pigeons have well defined external skeleton, bony wings eyes rather like those of bats; there is good evidence therefore that birds evolved from a bat type ancestor some 175 million years ago. Birds still possess many characteristics related to extraction of food items efficiently from air via fine hair structures called vanes. These vanes provide greater efficiency in capturing flying insects compared to fur covered animals whose hairs cannot present the same surface area relative to weight ratio. Also, feathers offer much better insulation as layers spread out heat and cold evenly across larger surfaces for quick dissipation of warmth or cooling when required. As we know, all living things require oxygen to live and respiration requires energy expenditure, similarly, environmental control often involves thermoregulation: maintaining temperature uniformity of internal organs etc. whilst using minimal energy means less waste of resources making it ideal for survival purposes. Therefore, bird anatomy shows great similarities to that of mammals including our own species, though differences do apply due to evolution towards different lifestyles and habitats. All mammalian respiratory systems consist of two passages termed trachea bronchi connected to large chest cavities known respectively as thoracic sacs and pleural cavity referred to collectively as thorax. An additional passageway into the abdomen, oesophagus (the gullet) joins the mouth leading directly to stomach. A further set of tubes join the throat with nasal sinuses located between cheeks behind ears. Bats are another example of maximising the advantages arising from anatomical connections; their enlarged cerebellum acts as an extension of the skull allowing for increased sensory ability. It allows us to judge distances accurately thus enabling successful hunting techniques. Shoulder blades act as levers extending deep into the torso increasing leverage when attacking prey. Further increases occur when hollow bones are attached to muscle fibres. When attacked, most domestic dogs simply react instinctually automatically biting back with full force whereas the larger predatory cats take advantage of their heightened senses thanks to brain enlargement coupled with facial features providing high magnification of vision essential for threat assessment detection plus extra receptors for smell, hearing and touch. Cattle, horses, sheep goats show similar capabilities, although bovine brains are about half the size of canine ones but proportionally robust. Most domestic chickens remain relatively dumb until slaughter time then serve only one purpose: roasting meat. No domesticated animal except dog behaves more anthropomorphically than man himself since he possesses bestial instincts combined with superior intelligence. Although one might argue against any biological comparison whatsoever because each species evolves independently and according to separate criteria, dinosaurs began evolving approximately 100 million years after reptiles had appeared upon Earth 50 millions of years earlier. Dinosaurs lay eggs while crocodiles produce fairly hard shells that protect offspring during incubation allowing for effective temperature regulation protection from predators. However, those laying eggs usually tend to nest underground leaving theirs exposed. Because dinosaur babies grow slowly most young must remain close to adults for nourishment especially when hatching season approaches. Early human development progressed differently, children became self sufficient and went off to forage for themselves within days or weeks. Under natural conditions infant mortality rates remained low whilst parents provided sustenance throughout childhood. Infants tended to stay near mother father preferring warm environments that mimic womb temperatures whilst suckling thereby conserving vital fluids needed for proper nutrition. Mammals became increasingly adapted to exploit food sources as fads emerged as parental guidance gradually diminished especially in urban centres. Today the average lifespan remains a mere 30yrs whereas the majority of wild creatures survive longer. Two very rare exceptions to this include pandas polar bears, both of which suffer greatly when populations dwindle drastically reducing reproductive success.

"Scientists from Japan have found a species of slug that can self-decapitate and regrow their bodies from their heads.

The researchers are interested in learning what role the parasite plays in determining whether decapitation occurs. The new behavior adds more questions to how evolution works onslaughts our best guesses about complexity, according to one biologist. ""It's not even clear which came first - did these slugs evolve to kill each other because it was better for them than leaving alone?

"GitHub Sponsors is a way to fund your Open Source project, but most developers aren't getting the most out of it. Getting people to sponsor you can be difficult. A lot of time and effort goes into making something look good on GitHub Pages or if using an external hosting provider like Heroku. With that in mind I'll show you how to create attractive sponsorships for projects hosted at cloud9ideas.com which uses powerful features such as Cloudflare worker caching and dynamic web pages from Firebase Hosting. The resulting websites are almost identical to those created by GitHub Sponsors. To start off we need some money to spend so let's create a new ""Sponsor"" model with a monthly cost of 10 per month (this is just enough to break even after founders make their first salary). You'll notice there's also no minimum sponsorship length - this allows users to sponsor us indefinitely if they wish! (We will still ask them before we accept any changes) Now head back over to GitHub and click the ""New Sponsor Repository"" button: You're now presented with options to choose what kind of repository you want to host these funds in; ""Organization"" will only allow donations to organizations registered under the same account used to add the repo while ""UserTeam"" will allow individual members to donate. We recommend choosing either option 2 or 3 since public repository owners won't have access to the page to approve anyone below them. Our account has been set up for organization level sponsors and the name should already appear. Keep in mind when creating names that tokens must begin with uppercase characters because Google Search doesn't recognize lowercase ones. Next fill out all required fields including username, email address and password. Also note that the maximum reposize is 7500 so make sure not to use anything too large. After you're done clicking submit select one of three options for how you want funding applied monthly: 1: Automatic recurring donation based on your credit card payment history If you opt-in here you agree to sharing our billing information with [name] so they may contact you via email about ongoing payments every 30 days. This makes adding sponsors easier if you know how many months would pass until the next payment. If you don't want to share this data drop down to option 5: One Time Donation You can always change your settings later by going to Settings Donations For our purposes we want the automatic approach which updates once a day. Now go ahead and hit Save. Once saved the link to your repo will display in your profile dashboard. Go ahead and visit your profile again to see the changes and confirm your choice. Setting Up Your Website A major difference between traditional open source development and sponsoring on GitHub is that you need a website to showcase who you are. Traditionally you might have had a company logo, written words explaining your work, published articles and maybe links to social media profiles. But none of these things really matter unless someone knows where to find them. With cloud9ideas.com you get everything within Github itself. Let's take a peek inside our newly sponsored site and see what it looks like: Note that content isn't generated yet so right away you'd think that anyone could edit it. Not exactly... It turns out that every file in your directory except README, LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md IS REQUIRED BEFORE YOU CAN POST ANY CONTENT TO THE WEBSITE WITH YOUR GITHUB PROFILE NAME AS USERNAME AND EMAIL ADDRESS AS AUTHEMAIL The other files shown above define the overall structure of your website i.e. index.html defines the layout of each section of the page e.g.: home description etc..

"El Salvador may become the world's first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The country recently partnered with digital wallet company Strike to build modern financial infrastructure using blockchain technology, and could be the next in a line of countries adopting this revolutionary cryptocurrency. The two firms are designing an app that will allow users to buy goods at merchants without exchanging currency - instead paying for items in bits stored on their phones via Blockchain-based smart contracts. When you pay your bill or use credit cards, retailers swipe those cards through payment terminals which take money from banks; when you purchase something digitally they send it directly to the merchant's bank account, where you have access to all funds received throughout the transaction. This is similar to how Bitcoin works except the transactions happen instantaneously, rather than gradually over time. Photo: ShutterstockNicolas Torres. Salvadorian officials say adopting blockchain would make doing business easier by making transactions transparent, more flexible (if there's any fraud going on), efficient to process, inexpensive to operate, and simple to carry out. Merchants won't need new equipment since payments can occur instantly online and offline. Payment processing costs will plummet because companies no longer need staff to receive cash deposits into accounts before recording each sale. And government institutions don't need to maintain separate systems for managing fiat currencies like dollars or euros themselves; these monetary units only exist within the confines of our society's normal economy. If we had good governance, then perhaps governments wouldn't even require taxes anymore. In fact, the citizens of many Latin American nations already live in such societies today. They just haven't discovered cryptocurrency yet. If this system proves successful, other Latin Americans might follow suit. Since 2014, Argentina has been experimenting with its own version of Ethereum called ""Pacto de Horquilla."" Its goal was to create a nationwide peer-to-peer network ensuring everyone pays what they owe while maintaining the integrity of records. It also helps to compensate individuals for their work, so they can see for themselves whether or not the service provider did what he said he would do. Yet, aside from having interesting goals, Pacto doesn't offer much in terms of practicality. Unfortunately for Argentines, the project failed after creating a temporary decentralized ledger riddled with glitches. After seven months working almost full time developing the testnet version of the platform, the team abandoned it due to lack of funding. Publica, an Argentine news outlet covering data privacy issues, claims to have some details about the failure but hasn't verified them. Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin believes the technical interoperability between the different blockchains could mean that one day Latin America will form its own independent Republic of Etheria, if we continue along the path towards becoming self-sufficient through our technological innovations. According to Paolo Arduini, CEO and founder of Strike Payments Technology Inc., Blockchain adoption in El Salvador comes down to two main reasons: 1) Traditional banking solutions aren't perfect, and 2) We want to change things here. As far back as 2006, his uncle introduced him to crypto markets, explaining its benefits to him, and why people should invest in them. He says to CNBC, ""I think the opportunity [of this] is huge."" That same year he founded the firm to help small businesses get started accepting cryptocurrencies while providing customers alternatives to traditional retail payment methods. Today, he says about two-thirds of company clients now accept bitcoin for purchases. These include El Farol Bar Grill (which serves Venezuelan barbecue dishes with side orders of epsom salt baths made from locally grown coconuts); Fuego Brazilian BBQ restaurant chain; and Calzadito Mexican street food vendor. In June 2016, the president signed Decreto para la Reforma y Modernizacion del Sistema Financiero Nacional (the Law for Financial System Reform). Under the law, entities under the supervision of the Central Bank must adhere to certain requirements including storing encrypted personal information in servers outside of the local jurisdiction unless justified otherwise. Additionally, employees cannot withdraw more than 50 000 pesos (3200 USD) per week, and corporate offices must keep detailed ledgers of every deposit and withdrawal. According to Bloomberg, These laws] reflect shifting consumer preferences away from paper cash toward plastic card networks run by large multinational corporations."" Adam Ludwin, Co-Founder of Chainalysis, explains that replacing old legacy technologies with innovative ones isn't always easy, but that the central plank in building a robust future is integrating new software onto existing infrastructures. Therefore, it makes sense to start thinking about putting current centralized databases on top of blockchain tech as soon as possible. I agree, although getting rid of the legacy finance industry is a pretty lofty goal. Who knows? Maybe El Salvador becomes the world's first sovereign republic of bitcoin! Although, who am I kidding?

"GPT-3 is OpenAI's new language model. It has 175 billion parameters, but it is unclear whether a full version or whether one of seven smaller versions will be released. GPT-3 can generate novels and poems in an astonishing array of styles: The above are excerpts from a conversation with the bot about its hometown Vancouver's Stanley Park. The exchange starts out as a fairly standard chatbot interaction - a series of yesno questions; then quickly moves into this sort of Alice in Wonderland dialogue: ""Are you white? Are you black?"" In response to a question by the bot on how long it takes to drive around West Vancouver, we get these answers: ""Your hair says 'I'm not sure', so that means your answer could take longer."" Who knows if the bot actually understands what any of those sentences mean; or maybe it just enjoys playing off the expectations of users who expect more coherent responses than it can offer at the moment. For now, though, let us assume that this kind of bizarre banter makes for entertaining Twitter exchanges during election campaigns. In addition to the AI ""language,"" there are three other aspects of the bot which seem novel. First, GPT-3 generates a name. As the bot writes about itself: ""My name is [name]. I am [occupation]."" Second, it demonstrates some knowledge of geography (in a very limited way). When asked where Norah Hardie lives, its reply includes this map: Third, GPT-3 uses punctuation, like this: When the bot writes about people, it also adds commas after their names: We have no idea if all bots do this because they think that using them enhances user experience, or perhaps even improves data quality, or to make themselves look less artificial. Or possibly, both. Still, when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg wants his platforms to appear human-like, he goes first to sign up for an account of a human person called Sarah Wasko aka Or, perhaps, a nonhuman avatar named Ava Smalls, whose parents were created by Deepfakes creator Mo Hwang: On the other hand, here is another type of bot which embraces technology without making much use of it. This may help explain why many of them remain underused and neglected: Most of these interactions end badly, usually due to Twitter blocking content based upon terms of service violations. But as someone once said: If you want something done right, ask a busybody to do it wrong.",0,409
"Scientists have determined that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size by pitching them against each other in a competition over preferred burrows. There were more aggressive fights among the animals, which may be an extension of their overall social behavior when competing with each other while searching for food."" ""The researchers filmed several instances of mantis shrimps fighting at different densities within established burrow systems. The results showed that the largest and smallest individuals fought less often than medium-sized ones."" ""If these larger animals are indeed dominant or stronger, they could use this strategy to ensure access to desirable habitats where they can feed on algae,"" said study researcher Dr. Michael Vecchione from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry's Department of Ecology Evolutionary Biology. Then again, maybe it is just temperature related? I think body size affects energy availability (to some degree). That means those creatures who have smaller bodies would weigh less so would require lower levels of energy to function properly, i.e., possess less fat reserves but also expend more energy moving around and eating - thus requiring increased physical exertion as well as consuming additional calories. So, if you're extremely lightweight, there simply isn't any reserve left to eat so you don't get very big not necessarily because your genetic structure does something inhibit growth. This is like many things: make sure the environment matches up with what works best for the organism. If a species has problems adapting to its changing surroundings in favor of building bigger and better nestshouses, then they won't evolve much beyond getting covered in mud. They'll probably focus more on producing lots of eggs instead and hope that nature takes care of the rest...if possible.",0,410

"I'm a big fan of these rapid-fire type blog posts (you might want to check out Tyler Cowen's Marginal Revolution if you enjoy them too). This is basically a list post. I can't do full justice here, but hopefully this will give some sense for how things work and what the options are at each stage along the way. If you have an idea in your head about something that would make life better, then step one is to generate some ideas on paper and figure out which ones seem like they could actually be accomplished: Write down all the possible roads ahead that depend upon it Ask yourself questions from previous steps - What happens if we don't take X? What else does my plan need to support? How many different ways could I get there? If I had more resources, could I accomplish those plans with fewer gobs of cash or human labour? One minor point before moving further into this section... the second bullet is where most people fail: you'll often hear highly successful companies talking up the importance of ""failing fast"" and ""continuous improvement,"" without ever bothering to explain exactly why such methods produce success. As far as I know, nobody has identified the reasons behind this basic guideline yet. Maybe someday someone will come up with a theoryexplanation. But in any case, it should be obvious that it makes no sense to say "" 1 failure means 1 lesson learned."" You're not really learning anything by failing; you're just wasting time, money, risk capital etc., based only on what was wrong with your last attempt. So while ""failure shouldn't matter"" may sound good, it sounds sort of stupid because once you've built something, it doesn't become less valuable because it failed! It's inherently valuable per se regardless of whether anybody tried. Anyway, let's move away from philosophy on failure and onto describing the specific practicalities involved in deciding which projects deserve our attention. Phase One: Anecdotes Empathy Most businesses start off as small groups working together at home over coffee, discussing their problems and brainstorming solutions. While there certainly exist smaller scale alternatives, most startups usually involve 4 or 5 people who spend 40 hours working every weekdays between 10am and 6pm attempting to solve real world problems using software. The goal is to find a scalable solution that other humans can use instead of relying solely on machines. At first, the founders simply organize around problem areas that they care about individually, creating ad hoc teams dealing with whatever issues happen to pop up during that iteration. They try to keep their processes simple so that new hires don't need much training, although sometimes mentorships or apprenticeship programs help to demystify unfamiliar concepts. Eventually, once they feel comfortable with the technology stack, they begin scaling operations through hirer expeditions across cities and countries, acquiring customers directly and introducing larger numbers of employees to the product. Across all stages, the primary concern is finding a viable business model that keeps the lights running on past the next day. Anything short of this constitutes either poor planning or lackadaisical execution. In reality, almost everything worthwhile takes two phases - prototypes followed by productionmarket testing. And as long as your early adopters find value in the thing you made, even a couple dozen random users isn't going to kill you. Of course, if you did manage to skip Phase Zero entirely, there's always freelance design agencies to fill in gaps until you get serious enough to invite folks to join forces: This is essentially the standard path laid forth by venture capitalists. Sometimes entrepreneurs get lucky and identify profitable niches immediately, but (almost) invariably many iterations and pivots later, the company finds itself somewhere resembling this: But consider the costs associated with failing at Phase Two. There are several sources of wasted effort; let me walk through some of the common realistic scenarios that lead to startup collapse. Many of these are very difficult to detect unless you already have traction, but when you reach that point, it becomes painfully clear which paths will bring you to profitability versus chaos. Regardless, let's look at some of them now. We'll see another example of ""breaking"" below. Problem 1: Unsuccessful Products Too Complicated To Understand By Consumers There aren't enough programmers willing to do unpaid overtime When a major customer complains (as many do), you think 'Oh well, at least he read our documentation' and work feverishly to add features to your app. Unfortunately, he's reading Google Translate. You push code 11pm Friday night. Tons of bugs creep in. He comes back Monday morning expecting an updated feature set, and gets none. Your server crashes. He calls his ISP complaining that your site is being slow. Everyone blames everyone else with increasing levels of frustration. All kinds of broken interactions ensue.

"Thomas Dohmke is stepping into the CEO role at GitHub. Nat Friedman will become the Chairman Emeritus of the service. Dohmke has a background as a developer and open source evangelist, but he's also an academic with experience in artificial intelligence. The two have been working together since 2007 on projects like Sourcerer 2, a Git GUI tool that attempted to serve up more information about what was happening when you were using git commit or moving your files from one folder to another. In its first year, it racked up roughly 100k downloads. It now runs inside Emacs and works offline. People use Sourcerer all over the world - including places where electricity might be limited or mobile connectivity spotty (Sourcerer runs off USB sticks). The project can tell you how many changes are pending for each file. If you edit some code and save it without committing yet, you get a push notification. All this kind of stuff. I love seeing my own Sourcerers pop up in terminals everywhere I go: every time someone commits something and pushes it back upstream, they send me notifications via email. Some people who aren't even collaborators still manage to contribute! And if there's no internet? No problem, there'll always be Sourcerer2. Neat little thing. ""I wanted to do this,"" says Dohmke. He describes himself as someone who likes making things happen. After Google acquired Chromium and made Chrome their browser IDEIDE-ing platform, Dohmke saw similar possibilities for his contribution to the web development community again. ""You had a massive company trying to make tools better."" At GitHub, he wants to grow the user base by doing what makes sense for developers - helping them collaborate effectively, giving them access to new features quickly, improving organization of data such as issues and pull requests so they're easier to find. These goals contrast sharply with those of Microsoft, which seeks to lock programmers down, control their workflows, and exploit them aggressively. We spoke with Dohmke earlier today, before receiving confirmation of his appointment from the GitHub team; we should hear soon whether he'll keep going with Sourcerer2. For now, though, here's our interview. It may contain spoilers. Just the interview part. What drew you to leave academia? Is your career path entirely different than where you started out? Are you changing careers, or just taking a sabbatical? What does leaving academia involve? It wasn't really until after graduation [from Carnegie Mellon University] that I realized...that I actually didn't want to teach anymore. Or write papers and give talks, because teaching is extremely hard work, especially when you start having to deal with kids learning programming languages for the first time. You can see why academics jump ship into these cushy jobs, because it seems much easier. But I don't think I could ever be happy being an university professor. So I decided that maybe I'd rather spend most of my days dealing with other computer scientists. And then somehow one day I ended up founding a startup called Sourcerer and got stuck hacking away at Emacs for hours every morning. And suddenly it was okay. Because it felt good not only to build software, but to learn how to build things myself so that I could understand what everyone else did. That became sorta the life I've led ever since. Of course, none of us knows exactly what lies ahead for us at any given moment. There's plenty of uncertainty right now. My hope would be that whatever happens next, I'd make sure I'm able to take care of my family, while staying focused on contributing to great free software. So far, that plan is holding pretty well, but change is hard. If you're looking to head a nonprofit corporation, wouldn't you want to know precisely what kinds of skills and abilities you need? Academia doesn't seem like a walk in the park. Maybe you feel you already have a lot of experience with both? Maybe if I hadn't gone through college for four years [laughter], I might have come across somebody at school willing to hire me immediately and pay me six figures for knowing Vim somewhere along the way. I mean, I probably know tons of stuff, but nobody cares because everybody is competing for attention. When universities try to market themselves around research output metrics instead of the value of education itself, it gets very difficult for students to figure out what they actually stand to gain by putting their names behind courses. They end up feeling coerced to produce publications like crazy, like they're supposed to receive credit for reading books outside class - and they eventually realize they ought to be spending more time perfecting those twenty pages than writing fifty thousand words on Python algorithms literature reviews or whatever. It turns out these paper numbers are totally arbitrary anyway. Who set them aside for everything except social science? Nobody knew. Not even mathematicians, they forgot math values altogether. Right now you just show up to classes thinking you'll never graduate, and when you finally do, there isn't anybody else qualified for listing public values because they have failed to separate recruitment tasks. However, we have performed 4 decimal point to have built like ers' constant is real enter real",0,413
"Amazon's yet-unnamed Lord of the Rings original series will debut on Prime Video on September 22, 2022. The series will take place thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and the events in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. The first episode is directed by British television legend Peter Jackson and stars Ben Barnes as Aragorn, Alexis Denisof as Elrond, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Billy Boyd as Legolas, Mark Stanley as Gimli, John Callen as Samwise Gamgee and Ray Stevenson as Frodo Baggins. Jackson told Variety that it was important to him for new audiences to be able to catch up with characters they have already seen portrayed in the films: ""You can't watch LOTR if you don't know what happens at all in the Tolkien material,"" he said. ""So we kind of felt like there were a lot of people who are going to jump into this world who haven't read any of Tolkien prior so why not do it right?"" Unlike The Lord Of The Rings prequel (which establishes how Sauron rose to power), director Peter Jackson says Amazon Studios' upcoming TV adaptation will follow an entirely different storyline. In fact, Jackson didn't even get wind about the project until reports started circulating that there would soon be a second season of Game Of Thrones. ""I wasn't aware of anything because I am very hands off when it comes to my company Kudos, which makes everything, including movies [and] Tv shows... I just want them to make good stuff!"" Jackson laughed."" And then suddenly one day three months later I'm reading something about HBO making a show called 'Game Of Thrones'. So I think I got tipped off! I thought it might be cool but no idea whether or not I'd end up doing it. But anyway... yeah."" He continued, ""It'll be set long before Gollum lives in Mirkwood and rings were invented, ok? It won't really happen back there - in those days... heh..."" Variety also spoke with Warner Bros., New Line Cinema, Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures Distribution Corp. and BBC Worldwide representatives regarding their involvement with the mini-series. All parties mentioned their desire to expand Star Wars franchise mythology with live action content - though none had invested time or money into developing projects for Lucasfilm. According to Thomas Turgoose, executive vice president of production and development at Warner Brothers Television Group, the studio has been talking with J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot team since 2016 about bringing Star Wars beyond its current film releases. These talks foundered however over concerns surrounding potential character licensing issues; Disney owns the rights to most of these expanded universe elements and wants them exclusive to the big screen under a deal that expires after 2019. With interest still high, WBTVG decided to wait until the moment presented itself to bring more stories to life through television. According to a source close to the situation, the approach was made possible thanks to Disney chairman Bob Iger's recent decision to focus on streaming services rather than theatrical release strategy. As part of the renewed partnership between Lucasfilm and Netflix, Disney gave the streamer access to Rogue One and Solo footage ahead of other platforms. As producer Kathleen Kennedy emphasized during the press conference announcing the arrival of Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, Disney sees synergies between new movie franchises and eventual spinoffs on streaming platforms. This broader outlook helped open doors for WBTVG to explore larger scale storytelling opportunities. While flywheel licensing deals remain key ingredients for future blockbusters, executives at large studios tend to prefer handling smaller projects across multiple media channels. After Ewan McGregor announced plans for Obi Wan Kenobi standalone in 2017, Fox employed Josh Trank as director of Fantastic Four reboot before handing the gig over to Simon Kinberg, plus EP Chris Weitz and coauthors Alec Stella Gonet. Similarly, following the success of Marvel Studios superhero properties Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, Sony distributed Captain Marvel successfully as an origin story in theaters while planning out solo outings with Brie Larson, Kumail Nanjiani, and Margot Robbie. Warner Bros. Entertainment Chairman Kevin Tsujihara echoed Martha Lauzen's call for tiered pricing models across entertainment sectors last year, expressing openness towards expanding beyond the traditional breadwinner model. For example, Warner's DC Comics division may eventually offer its own premium subscription service alongside standard digital offerings. By contrast, rival Paramount pulled actors from an early pitch for Han Solo vehicle due to fears around licensing complications. Though STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE actor Diego Luna believes less licensed storylines could create lucrative additional revenue streams down the road. Still, according to sources close to the matter, disagreements arose around what types of episodes should be greenlit for limited networks versus episodic originals favored by online streaming giants such as Apple and Roku. A joint statement by DisneyLucasFilm President Kathleen Kennedy and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings noted producers and directors believe a range of formats best suits each outlet.

"CSS was never designed to be a server-side language, but that doesn't mean that it can't be used as one. This article walks through how to use CSS as a backend for an API endpoint in Node.js and Express. Introduction As the internet continues its march towards more and more data being stored on client machines (and away from servers), static content is becoming increasingly important. It's harder than ever before to strike up a conversation with someone by using just text communications alone without images or videos involved, there are no words to interpret between two people. However, this isn't new: the first email service providers were largely based around presenting plaintext information to users, and most of us still rely heavily on HTML documents today because they work well when viewed on screens which aren't mobile friendly (or even capable). The ability to send large amounts of textual communication over a network has become ubiquitous; we take it for granted now, so much so that often times we don't think about why it works at all. The web works via HTTP requests and responses, where each response consists of a set of keyvalue pairs that are sent back after every request made to any website you visit. These values describe what should show up on your screen next, whether it's another page load, an image file, some CSS or JavaScript code, media files such as video or audio clips, etc. If only one piece of information makes an entire webpage look different, then these pieces must communicate together somehow. In order to do this effectively, the browser needs to be able to understand exactly what kind of document is being presented, and the best way to ensure that happens is by sending along a small description of what type of resource it will respond with later. One of those types of descriptions is a MIME header, also known commonly as Content Type. A Content Type field tells the browser which format the underlying file will have, notifying it what type of information it may expect to find inside. While browsers already make educated guesses like ""HTML"" or ""XML,"" modern versions go further and provide tools that let developers customize their own list of potential mime types. Example Content Types might include PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, JPG, PDF, WOFF2, MP3, SVG, OGG. By default, these sort of customizations happen when your web application sends out cross-site requests, meaning requests to other sites within your domain, since the browser needs to know if something else expects to handle your incoming requests differently. But things get interesting when it comes to serving our own resources. As long as everything lives under our site's root directory, accessing them directly won't require making external changes. So far, nothing too special - except that the browser refers to all resources automatically by looking into the URL itself. Now imagine if your site contained multiple pages, and you wanted the user experience to change depending on what page it currently sits on? Well, here lies the rub: URLs aren't enough anymore! And while it seems obvious nowadays that people shouldn't put sensitive information in public facing locations, online businesses need to consider both security concerns and visitor friendliness and usability. Your visitors want speed and convenience above anything else right now, and the longer it takes for them to find what they're searching for, the less likely they'll continue browsing your site in the future. Having a consistent style throughout your whole site speeds up navigation significantly, especially when you have lots of links that lead off to various parts of the same thing. Let's call a spade a spade and admit that websites are ultimately geared toward achieving conversion rates - having optimized performance characteristics greatly improves conversions. Sure, if you've got really good SEO going on underneath your business model, maybe you could afford to worry about the quality of your site's design, but who hasn't heard horror stories of companies whose individual pages hadn't been touched in years? Using a single style sheet across many different pages can dramatically improve conversion rate optimization efforts. By providing users with a simple interface to browse your site, and allowing keywords specific to your current product line to pop out visually alongside relevant links, you increase search engine visibility. You'd probably rather hire human beings to select photos for your stock imagery section instead of spending hours manually tagging hundreds of pictures yourself, wouldn't you? Whether you're considering having a dedicated developer build a frontend with AngularJS, React or EFX, or starting from scratch with Jade, Haml or Liquid, using a template language removes the burden of building interfaces completely from your plate, leaving room for more time spent crafting great features. What does all of this amount to? More money for you, more profit for everyone. Right? Wrong, actually. I'm sure you saw the headlines circling around recently proclaiming that fewer Americans than ever use Facebook per month. That's... bad news, obviously. Even worse though, is that roughly half of those folks logged onto the social networking giant globally reported that quitting altogether would reduce user stress levels considerably.

"As one of the largest social networks, Facebook receives a massive amount of content from users all over the world. While Facebook has rules regarding the type of content that is allowed and not allowed on its platform, it does not have laws in place to protect users against bots (robot software) created by third-party companies to post advertisements or manipulate people's views. The recent news about Instagram's ""Find Friends Nearby"" feature being used for political purposes has opened up the question: How can we trust such information? One company that uses similar technology as Instagram - but with far more potential than finding friends nearby - is Microsoft. As part of their Bing Search Engine, they are now using face recognition technology to help identify humans[i]. They say this new tool will be able to tell between people in photographs and computer generated faces so that when you search for something like 'best burger near me', only real human photos appear.[ii] The concept behind this machine vision technology is very simple; if you take two pictures of someone's face at slightly different angles, then computers are programmed to recognize which photo shows what expression. This allows them to build profiles of customers based upon how they look when involved in various activities. It could also allow advertisers to target specific groups. For example, an advertisement might show young women who exercise during the day instead of having ads randomly placed across a database.[iii] Yet again questions arise concerning privacy rights. If I am searching for burgers within my city, should Microsoft know exactly where I live if they sell advertising space to local restaurants? Should they know if I go hiking outside town? Are there other ways they use this facial recognition technology? What else do they plan to add? And finally, why hasn't any regulation been put into place to ensure these businesses don't abuse our data? Why We Need Laws Regulating Social Media Bots - Taggers Automated Posts In 2014, Chris Freeland published his book "" Talk To Me Like Google ,"" where he explained how many bloggers' backlinks were purchased through cybersquatting websites under false pretenses. Nowadays, most SEO marketers understand that buying links on PR6 sites related to your niche is considered spammy. But Buying links is still somewhat safe because those websites usually claim to purchase link packages per month, and sometimes even buy few hundred thousands worth of links every single time without realizing it. So basically, before purchasing ANY sort of traffic from another site, quickly check out the website linked after that particular page! There is no point spending money on paid reviews if your competitors own several links pointing to their pages. Secondly, read visitor comments left beneath each review you find. You may see negativenegative feedback which says ""this product doesn't work."" In fact, the reason they bought hundreds of positive reviews probably was due to some technical problem with the product itself (that would explain why they didn't update their customer service department). Also, follow up with support via email if possible. Most times, feedback left by visitors are generally ignored. Don't bother contacting Amazon's ombudsman unless you want 5 minutes of frustration resulting in 30 seconds of waterfalls of emails going nowhere.

After spending countless hours on site visits to blogs, forums and support channels trying to find answers, I finally found out what happened exactly. The GCL had grown beyond what could handle traffic effectively. Our team continued doing everything possible to make sure there weren't any errors or bugs present. However, something broke inside our API servers where requests got stuck because they didn't process fast enough. By the time the request did finish processing, the page would move onto another script, rendering some of the tags incomplete. That caused the page to appear broken despite no problems occurring anywhere else on the site. Fortunately, once we implemented emergency fixes to get things running smoothly, we realised just how big the impact was. Unfortunately, those same fixes created unforeseen consequences. They introduced delays into every single communication between two parties connected to GIPHY, meaning thousands of GIFs were uploaded late. For example, one popular meme creator who uses GIPHY likes to post images taken specifically for him that generate millions of impressions each week. When he saw the error occur, his entire archive had to be reuploaded. There wasn't adequate warning or advance notice that anything unexpected was happening, resulting in disappointing end results. At first, we thought maybe people didn't see the notices telling them the feature was temporarily unavailable, but then we discovered web crawlers still accessed pages while GCL was disabled. In fact, several different sites that relied heavily on bot traffic reported seeing drops in activity immediately following one of our server restarts. How quickly the damage occurred varied wildly depending upon the individual situation. Some were affected 6 hours later; others only 5 minutes. This meant serious money losses, and impacts ranging from annoying inconveniences to major businesses shutdowns. Facebook compensates for lost income by paying companies to host advertisements before certain events, however the entire internet relies on gifting moments to share experiences together. Without GIPHY, interactions decrease significantly, and they're increasingly hard to come by. With GIPHY and its sister platform StickerMule shut down for almost 15 full days due to large scale issues, GIPHY became inaccessible for 7 million users around the world. People couldn't access any content whatsoever. And if you think about YouTube today, a similar problem happens whenever Google takes the service offline for updates. It's difficult to underestimate the importance of fun times spent watching clips online. Regardless of whether you love memes, movie trailers, funny cats, stories of inspirational individuals, sport results, tutorials, dance routines or any number of other categories, if you don't enjoy sharing these things directly online it becomes much harder than normal to create connections with friends, family or colleagues. Given the role social media plays in making relationships stronger, keeping a community alive means having reliable resources for sharing common interests.

"Blocks is a JSX-based page builder for creating websites without writing code. It comes with built-in components that are designed and implemented with Theme UI. The editor reads and writes data asynchronously, in order to keep the application responsive even while working on large layouts. Why use Blocks? If you have ever tried building your own website from scratch using HTMLCSS or PHP then it's safe to say you were faced with one of two problems: either you had to learn all new skills (HTML CSS), which was very time consuming; or, if you did not want to work this way, but rather wanted more control over how things looked like, you would likely end up writing some custom JavaScript code. So why do we need yet another tool to build our webpages when there already exist various editors like WordPress where you can easily edit any document (including ones containing complex elements such as divs) by simply clicking a button at once. We will now explain why we believe Blocks is an awesome solution aimed exactly at people who love frontend development tools like React Native and VueJS.

"Deep Nostalgia is an AI-powered service offered by online genealogy company MyHeritage that creates moving portraits from still photos. It uses pre-recorded driver videos of facial movements and applies them to a face photo, resulting in a 3D video facial animation. The software was launched at the 2017 Singapore International Genealogical Conference (SIGC). History According to cofounder Josephine Lam Tekka: ""Our vision for this product has always been about creating nostalgic content that brings families together - something like meeting up with your ancestors again."" In 2016, they started developing their first version working on a team of six people which became nine after one year. By October 2018, it had grown into a staff of 45 employees and used voiceover recordings supplied by professional actors, while other aspects were done manually. At SIGC 2017 in March 2019, Deep Nostalgia received its public launch reception during the panel discussion session organised by SISTRA Media Centre. They have since incorporated virtual reality as part of their technology offerings. Funding details are undisclosed but according to a report published by VentureBeat, Myheritage raised 60 million in June 2013 led by Sequoia Capital China and Intel Capital, followed by 100 million Series C funding round in November 2015, and another round of 35 million in July 2016. On February 22nd 2020, the United States Patent Office granted patent number 9,972,545 covering visual enhancement systems such as Deep Nostalgia and PhotoNauts, saying ""The invention relates generally to computer programs and interactive methods for visually enhancing multi-media documents including images taken using digital camera devices; text document edit modules; graphical user interfaces; databases containing multiple users' customized versions of common templatesstyles or presentations; applications running over networks; individual portable computing device information sources such as personal computers, cellular telephones, tablet pcs, etc.; social media sites; electronic mail messages; music files; data including private health records; and any combinations thereof.""

"'Can AI Kick It' is a team of Dutch academics who used AI techniques to generate music that was then entered into Eurovision. The lyrics were especially novel, but the results are rubbish The future has never been as bright as it looks on Google Trends when you type in ""Eurovision song contest"": a photograph from last week shows an exultant young woman wearing a glittering tiara. She claps her hands and smiles broadly at some unseen audience. A man stands behind her with his arms raised, fingers lightly touching hers; he too wears goggles and a multicoloured top hat. Both appear to be applauding more energetically than any real-life person could ever manage - or might even want to do so, given how much time, effort and money they must have spent preparing for this moment. They are dressed like a stage director should dress up someone being applauded by millions ... except no one else is watching them applaud. And yet, they can hardly stop grinning. This year's entry comes from Finland (in fact, from Helsinki). Its title? Can You Feel This Moment? Last night I watched its performance (and earlier we had another look at the others) while listening to the awful new jingle about Old Trafford stadium that both BBC Radio 5 Live and Sky Sports had commissioned as part of their coverage. At moments such as these TV production companies try not only to take advantage of what technology allows us to see and hear today but also to use it to exploit our increasing sense of empathy towards celebrities. Remember those first few days after 911 when people couldn't get enough footage of Osama bin Laden walking around talking calmly to reporters, looking utterly disinterested in everything going on round him? That feeling now seems entirely appropriate. We expect a certain level of professionalism from entertainers, although that professionalism can often feel overdone. Look back through your own memory bank of pop videos past - think Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody, Madonna's Like A Prayer, David Bowie's Heroes, Oasis' Don't Believe The Truth, Bjork's Homogenic etc etc - and you will notice something interesting. These artists all seem occasionally out of control, driven almost madly by emotions that come, seemingly, totally unbidden. One thinks of Julianne Rose Mauriello standing there screaming 'I am dead! Someone stabbed me' just before she finished singing Mambo No.5, covered live for the first time by Suede during an unforgettable gig at Brixton Academy. Or Sting admitting his marriage breaking down on Radio 1 just minutes later. It feels somehow natural, if inappropriate, to project ourselves onto stars. Not every artist takes full advantage of this tendency, perhaps because they know their public doesn't quite believe that they might actually get emotionally involved in what they are doing. But others step over the line, sometimes literally. Pink Floyd made several attempts to perform The Wall without Roger Waters, eventually removing him altogether from most gigs. Part of the reason why we don't normally envy successful bands might lie in the way they tend to become famous. Most groups exist for years or decades before, either making songs together or recording albums with other musicians. Some of Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page's finest work came late in the band's life when he stopped working with Robert Plant or bassist John Paul Jones; nowadays, though, it would be unthinkable for anyone to leave their job midway through. Whatever happened between DJ Bob Sinclar and Massive Attack singer Me'Shell Ndegeocello, however, appears to have ended badly. Huge amounts of cash changed hands in recent weeks, eventually leading to Sinclar releasing two tracks under the name 'Massive Attack', one featuring Ndegeocello purporting to sing about killing herself, called Killing Time. Big deal. If you start thinking about celebrity culture in terms of success stories - James Dean (who died aged 24), Amy Winehouse (died 27), Tupac Shakur (also murdered, 20), Michael Jackson (dead 45), Kurt Cobain (shot himself 22), Freddie Mercury (AIDS 25) - then negative developments suddenly loom larger. So here, of course, is where the internet steps in. Because whatever makes celebrities special becomes far less important once you realise that, thanks to social media, everyone else is becoming equally famous. Take that Sinclar track again: a sample of Jeff Buckley crooning over a looped piano riff became an internet hit overnight, changing Sinclar's career trajectory entirely. Audiences did indeed love him (or, rather, loved hearing themselves talk about loving him); even now, memorable parts of his performances continue to go viral online long after they have passed their sell-by date.

For some reason these two interests became merged somewhere along the way, so now my entire life revolves around being able to talk to people while watching whatever movie is playing at any given moment. It was only natural for me (as well as many of my friends) that these skills would lead us to become YouTube stars - after all, what better medium than an online video channel can bring together our talents?

"Scientists at MIT have published a paper detailing a new type of artificial brain synapse that can potentially produce devices that can handle complex AI computing locally without having to send massive amounts of data across the network. The study, led by professor Daniel Rueckert and graduate student Kuldip Sahani, shows how they've created a nanoscale circuit that efficiently computes long-term potentiation (LTP), which is one of two forms of learning in biological neurons and is also thought to be critical for creating human intelligence. The team hopes their work will inspire further research into better ways to simulate neural processes on such local scales. ""We're trying to solve this problem of where we should put our computational resources,"" says Ruckherd. ""And [the idea here] really does propose something which has never been done before."" He adds: ""This work could lead us down some interesting paths with respect to memory storage."" In lay terms LTP means you remember stuff from your past more easily when it comes back up, like if someone was giving you an important phone number or telling you about something new. But just what exactly happens during LTP? And why are there so many different kinds of memories? Let's take a look at how these things happen: Learning What You Need To Know Humans learn through experience as much as any other living thing - but your experiences aren't stored directly within your body; rather they're passed along via receptors known as synapses. Each receptor sends out signals called neurotransmitters based on interactions between nerve cells, causing them to release chemicals onto nearby nerve cell dendrites. This releases ions, positively charged atoms inside the cell membrane, that trigger electrical activity. When too many ions are released into a neuron from one transmitter, its ability to generate action potentials is increased, while less ion flow results in decreased signaling abilities. That's essentially all the cellular biology you need to understand, although researchers still debate whether neurotransmitter concentration alone causes changes in synaptic strength or whether additional mechanisms may contribute. While scientists knew humans used something similar to LTP in their brains, they didn't know quite what kind of energy sources were required to create this form of plasticity, nor did they fully understand why there existed multiple forms of synaptic change. They suspected it had something to do with homeostasis, saying that neural circuits looked the same regardless of how often they reactivate because the amount of ionic flux needed to elicit strong responses would deplete key areas inside the neuron that maintain steady levels and prevent overuse. If true, then perhaps part of how LTP works involves recruiting extra reserves of those reserves to replace depleted ones. In order to test that theory, Ruekherdt et al. designed a digital computer simulation that mimicked the physical structure of transistors to make sure each transistor behaved independently enough to mimic real biological neurons. Next, they paired these units together and ran simulations showing that even small differences in activation timing caused dramatic shifts in conductance - just the sort of effects they'd expect if LTP events drove overexpressed transmission rates. What's Next As previously mentioned, the main goal behind this particular project was to explore how LTP might have evolved in nature and what problems it solves. Because the process has important implications for pattern recognition, signal computation, error correction, and other functions associated with higher cognitive functions, understanding why LTP exists in the first place could help develop future technologies able to perform similar tasks using artificial hardware. For example, since LTP helps cement new information into short term memory to give quick access to items learned earlier, it seems likely to be useful for applications involving search algorithms, navigation, planning, language comprehension, etc., provided certain aspects of the technology allow errors to be corrected quickly. As another application: Using LTP to store memories is typically only temporary. After a few days, the system forgets whatever you wanted it to retain unless you actively keep reinforcing the connection again and again. So if your car alarm taught your houseplants not to fear temperature fluctuations, you could program your door lock to forget everything after five minutes. However, digging deeper into the specifics of biochemistry, Ruekhardt doesn't think that's necessarily true. Instead he thinks ""memory"" occurs every time the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is rereleased at the opening end of a postsynaptic space. Basically, any sort of prolonged increase in the likelihood of releasing ions could result in a permanent alteration in function. Cueing LTP to keep a memory active longer than necessary could improve recall performance, allowing you to retrieve your old song lyrics faster next time around. Of course, the best way to see if this hypothesis holds water is by testing it experimentally. Current methods include measuring neurotransmission patterns as well as looking at gene expression changes that occur hours after stimulation sessions. Currently, most labs use rodents because this gives researchers direct control over both genetic modification and electrodes. While rats and mice can serve as models for studying neural development, as well as exploring consumer products where available, making sure no other effect assessment objective; i'm seeing no matter,ne touchevjonisystem",0,436

"Jordan Peterson has announced the development of a new social media platform, Thinkspot. The platform aims to provide users the best features of other social media, but without the censorship. The news was shared on Twitter by David McRae: Thinking and sharing outside the arbitrary borders assigned us online is an important step toward human liberation. Here's my reaction to jordanbpeterson's announcement that he will be launching thinkspot - david mcrae (davidmcrae) October 13, 2019 Here's what Jordan said about it in his own words: On Oct 11 (the day after I launched my website), one person who viewed thenew site called me up asked if they could send their followers there instead of here. This isn't just any account ... this is a very large audience. It came at exactly the right time for him, which is understandable because so many people have been asking for something like ThinkSpot over the last few months. I told them yes. And now we're getting ready to launch! You can expect all sorts of things to happen with ThinkSpot - including some more announcements soon. In fact, when you sign up for free accounts today, there are no limits or restrictions whatsoever. So please look forward to seeing what we come up with. There'll also be a series of articles written by John Gray (an English professor as well as author). These should start appearing within the next month or two. They cover topics related to internet freedom, identity, thought, truth-seeking, knowledge acquisition etc., and the goal is to produce comprehensive essays that every thinking human being would benefit from reading. As always, we hope ThinkSpot becomes your go-to place where you find inspiration, information, learning, insight, humor and community around ideas that matter most to you. Once again, thank god for the internet. If nothing else comes out of this project, at least it's clear how totally absurd our current political situation is. With everything going wrong, politics looking crazy, capitalism falling apart, power gone mad ... Despite all that, life goes on. We still connect through language, books, movies, music, art, television shows, sports, games and philosophy. All those things help shape the way each of us thinks; together they form a powerful communication system which helps us continue living despite all the madness happening all around us. Thank goodness for net neutrality. Without it this wouldn't even exist. My father used to say ""a good workman never blames tools."" That seems pretty obvious these days. Thanks to everyone involved in putting Thinkspot into production. One thing remains certain: not only does the world need more critical thinkers than ever before, it needs brilliant writers too. - Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, Creator, Founder Executive Producer (DrJPeterson) October 12, 2019 Why Is Thinkspot Important? Isn't Facebook already doing awesome stuff on the web front? Isn't YouTube great? Why do need another website? Well... in short, everybody enjoys having fun elsewhere while keeping access to their friends close. Nobody likes being forced to watch ads on the ""free sites"" such as Facebook and Youtube, especially when you know perfectly well that you don't want to see them anyway. Also, almost nobody wants to spend money on various services and subscriptions. Instead, they prefer free content through platforms which allow them to share whatever they think politically correct or otherwise. Of course, most of them enjoy using the advertising industry to subsidize such a nice experience. That's why I decided to create Thinkspot. Based on user feedback, we wanted to offer a service where anybody would be able to communicate freely with whomever she wished, without fear of cyberbullying or impersonation attacks. Then, we started discussing ways of protecting against fake profiles on websites such as Reddit, Discord and Telegram. A quick search revealed thousands upon thousands of pornographic spammy pages. When can you trust someone? Who determines whether somebody is trustworthy? What criteria must you consider when selecting people to meet? How much control do we actually have over ourselves if we follow others blindly? Should we let anyone join simply because they seem harmless enough? Can we trust ourselves to make wise choices? Indeed, the threat posed by allowing virtually anything is, literally speaking, unfathomable. To address this challenge, we needed to develop a solution based on blockchain technology. After reading countless papers published between 2009 and 2016 on cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers, we realized that blockchains represent an ideal mechanism to tackle security issues on the internet. But none were really equipped to support decentralization, anonymity, encryption and anti-censorship. For instance, Bitcoin uses miners to check transactions and validate blocks; however, once a transaction has been paid, its contents cannot be changed anymore. Thus, Bitcoin did not solve ethical problems caused by centralized government agencies.

"While businesses are complaining about the shortage of workers, older job seekers are finding that even with the right qualifications for the job, they are being turned away due to age-based discrimination. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday there were 6 million unemployed people in August - a record high in the U.S., marking two years since unemployment hit 7 percent. About 3.5 million Americans have been out of work for six months or more, and another 2.7 million remain underemployed (working part time when they want full-time hours). The latest unemployment statistics show many employers will hire only those without disabilities or other disadvantages as long as they can get by on low wages; others may not be willing to train anyone who has had a less than perfect past performance.

"magniX, an Australian engineering firm, in a partnership with Harbour Air, a Canadian air-ferry service, has performed the first fully-electric commercial aircraft test flight. The 15-minute flight took place in Aberdeen Bay on March 5th and was done using only 40 percent of the plane's normal gas engine power to reduce emissions from both sides. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is currently the world's largest passenger jet and has been used by NASA for space shuttle missions as well as military flights around the globe. Its electric engines are typically only rated at about 50 percent capacity while its Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines can deliver up to 200 kw (264 hp) of thrust each. Their batteries will be able to provide extended range after they have been recharged or replaced with alternate electrical sources once their lifespan has ended. A series of B737 Max 8 tests were completed between 2014 through 2015 when the airline tested them out over southern Australia to establish performance parameters that would ensure their successful integration into regular use. They also included battery charging systems and cargo inspections. Ports at Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane were selected based upon logistics considerations such as proximity to facilities capable of analyzing fuel consumption data. All five airports have developed partnerships designed specifically to support Boeing's testing efforts including ones with UBS Aviation Services Ltd., which specializes in aviation industry business services; Aero Electric Power Corp.; EnerGALLO Systems Incorporated; Harris Corporation; and XAviation Technologies. As part of this project, MagniX provided and installed two lithium ion batteries weighing approximately 9 tons apiece, combined with four integrated power inverters producing 120 kW per unit. Three hundred kilowatt hours (kWh) were delivered to the grid but it could be increased to 1 megawatt hour if needed along with additional energy storage systems. It should be noted however that these batteries won't be made available commercially until 2023, so we're looking forward to see how quickly new technologies emerge!",0,455
"Facebook and Ubisoft have reportedly signed a deal to release the next Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed games exclusively on the Oculus VR.

"Haidilao, a Chinese hotpot chain, opened the world's first fully automated restaurant on Sunday. Robots will take orders, prepare food, and deliver it to customers. There's an automated restaurant in Shanghai that functions similarly but is less technologically advanced than this one. In China, consumers have embraced robot doctors and even robotic pets, with sales growing fast enough to make investors nervous about getting burned by missteps. Technology experts are now looking at automated restaurants as yet another opportunity for advancing consumer convenience - or else watching them become laboratories where AI is tested out before it gets put into production elsewhere. The new Haidilao eatery opens just two days after President Obama touted tech advancements during his visit to Beijing, which echoed some of the same themes. The U.S. leader said he wanted America ""to lead again"" through technology investments. He also called for more use cases like Apple Pay in supermarkets across China. But if you believe most smartphones can be used for financial transactions without human assistance, then maybe robots will help bring banking services back home. As automation takes hold, the cost savings should allow companies trying to build their brands around good service instead of big profits. Meanwhile, what's not to love? Automated systems could create jobs while improving efficiency; they could expand access to utilities if the data collected isn't valuable only to corporations who already own your personal information; and they could reduce wait times while saving us money when we order our meals online. Automation has been coming. As economist Paul Krugman wrote recently, ""many people seem genuinely taken aback"" by the idea of self-driving cars. Indeed, according to a survey conducted by Boston Consulting Group, nearly half (45 percent) of respondents expect driverless vehicles to arrive within seven years, compared to 17 percent expecting delivery drones and 18 percent thinking AVs would hit roads by 2025. That suggests many Americans might be okay with having someone behind the wheel ensuring safety standards aren't compromised once autonomous ridesharing becomes available. Those workers displaced by robots may need education and training opportunities to keep up skills needed to make other advances in society possible. That means we won't all lose out economically from automation, although individual businesses might experience short term pain. In fact, automation provides room for job growth as industries shift toward higher productivity labor markets. For example, car manufacturing hasn't lost market share since 2009 thanks mostly to automakers introducing newer models such as BMW, Ford, and Mercedes Benz, all of whom rely heavily on robots. If Haidilao intends to follow suit, there'll likely be plenty of jobs waiting for whoever loses theirs. But the automation wave is becoming unstoppable because it costs so little to introduce more robots into existing operations. They're cheap to manufacture, easy to program and install, and don't break down often. Among the latest innovations: an automatic burger grill that lets chefs cook burgers right alongside traditional grills simply by programming the system to skip certain steps. While economists debate whether humans ultimately benefit more from machines or vice versa, STEM graduates have seen increased demand for their expertise at every level over recent decades. According to figures compiled by Adecco, employers increasingly want employees with degrees related to science, engineering, math, computerization, robotics, etc., thus offering students additional options beyond college once graduation day arrives. That trend continues today, with students choosing majors including software development, artificial intelligence, IT support, quantum computing, cyber security, machine learning, among others in fields poised to grow leaps ahead. For the next decade, those industries will continue attracting top talent in droves thanks to steep salary increases enabled by rising wealth inequality. College tuition grew at 3.9 per year between 2012 and 2017, outpacing inflation, putting 1 trillion worth of debt onto student bodies each year, according to NerdWallet estimates. And those numbers haven't kept pace with wages. Between 2004 and 2014, average compensation went from 40,000 per year to 50,400 per year, largely driven by a 7.6 increase in median pay. Average earnings rose to 85 cents per hour in 2016 from 78 cents in 1973, indicating the rise of low income earners who are working fewer hours due to longer commutes. [See: How much does Amazon really contribute to humanity?] That disconnect creates mismatches along gender lines and explains why women still earn 77 cents for every dollar made by men in 2018, despite roughly equal participation in male-dominated occupations. Combine that with one person holding far too many full time positions pushing 60 miles away from their families' homes, and it makes sense that American adults spend almost an entire month eating alone each week. One-person households headed by single parents all the way up to dual parent households deserve to feel cared for financially and emotionally to pursue happiness outside work, something automation offers. It doesn't require a partnership with anyone else if both parties agree to it. Here's how automating services could start reshaping lives.

"An engineer at a startup that is planning an exit asks others for experiences for how their workplaces changed after other startups either sold via IPOs or changed ownership in the last several years. A few things to note: 1) the company was founded about 7-10 months ago, 2) this has been a small team of 5 people and they are all engineers 3) There have not yet been any real project deliverables (aside from some development). 4) The founderCEO of the company just moved on part time recently because his family business needed him full time. This means it's a decent sized group with no clear end goals other than ""we want to build something cool"" and ""I'm going home.""

We've never had anyone leave so far but our future plans include a large acquisition by another company within 6 month (s), which will require us to sell all our equity [which could be between 7mm-12m]. All of these changes seem to happen more frequently when you become successful enough - can someone better versed in such matters shed light? Is there anything anyone wants to add to my list? Thank you! Hi kate4792. You may wish to clarify your question yourself as it appears incomplete. If others have similar questions then perhaps asking them directly would help them understand exactly what you mean. Personally I'd say a good way to start is getting those thoughts down on paper instead of relying on text alone. It might also be interesting to get feedback from peers mentors etc as they too went through a similar transition once upon a time. Good luck! - krooksjrNov 17 '18 at 20:52 1 Answer 1 In general terms, due diligence should provide useful information around whether to buy shares based on past performance rather than future expectations. For example, if management has historically delivered above market returns, and now expect a massive drop in profits in year two, buyers should know up front whether or not to pay more to avoid holding onto a share until its value drops dramatically. On the flip side, investors often ask businesses selling at a low valuation why it hasn't raised funds already and don't believe that the management team needs access to additional capital. While many companies do need liquidity before going public, having extra money available does not guarantee success. At least one study found that raising venture funding actually increased risk of failure. The specific details of running a tech firm versus managing a non-tech company are much broader than just working conditions. But keeping in mind the big picture context helps framing relevant and meaningful responses. With respect to work culture, while morale generally declines during times of rapid growth, new teams typically adapt rapidly compared to established ones. People learn quickly; sometimes even fast followed by slow, and at the same time, problems can arise when early adopters adopt practices. A CEO leaving suddenly does affect morale under normal circumstances, but especially where leadership transitions occur mid-team. In general though, you shouldn't see a decrease in morale over a short term basis despite negative headlines in the media. Beyond personal experience, research shows that technology firms improve significantly faster than average SP 500 stocks, and show stronger revenues and income gains, suggesting positive differences in work environment contributing to long run productivity. Also, according to data published today, the median employee tenure among U.S. SaaS companies is less than four years, meaning most jobs aren't even gig-economy gigs, but longer term opportunities. However, employees tend to enter into employment relationships wanting favorable outcomes relative to their previous job situation without realizing how hard it can be for individuals to switch careers - unless they're switching from managerial positions or senior roles like hiring managers, sales leads, account executives to entry level technical positions requiring entirely different skill sets. Most importantly, high performing cultures develop organically over decades, making it difficult for companies to manipulate organizational structure to replicate desired results. Employees themselves go through distinct stages of engagement throughout their career, each stage driven by factors including change, uncertainty, stressors, rewards, autonomy, social support, clarity, professional identity formation, and opportunity. Change occurs both externally caused by industry shifts and internally caused by career progression and corporate restructuring. Challenges include maintaining balance between stability and flexibility, formalizing learning processes, aligning incentives across functions, harmonising individual and organisational objectives, meeting stakeholder demands, finding ways to engage diverse groups, promoting interpersonal trust, ensuring safety, improving communication methods, and developing innovative strategies. Finally, the higher salaries associated with engineering role enable strong compensation packages attracting top talent, ultimately improving retention, lower turnover rates, and creating a pipeline of qualified candidates. However, salary levels for software professionals vary widely depending on skillset.

"Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that wants to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting laser beam instead of conventional drilling, saying this will do away with fuel costs and pollution. The idea has been around for half a century but is facing financial troubles in funding from big capital markets who worry about the riskiness of the technology. Quaice Energy was founded by Albert Zouboukos back in 1999. He worked on the project at MIT for six years before leaving last year. In 2004 he launched Quaypoint Energy Ventures to fund development work, but it failed after only 5 million had been raised. The company then decided to try raising money through equity or venture capital. ""It became difficult because there were so many other issues than just our science,"" says Mr Zoubeokos. (See video above) This latest round - which closed in June 2006 - saw a total of US38m invested via two ventures; one taking up 35 per cent of shares while the other 15 per cent went into debt finance. As part of its plan, QEV promised investors more in return if the company made progress towards commercialisation within four quarters. However, despite having won backing from some high profile scientists including Stephen Hawking and Freeman Dyson, as well as professors and companies like Sandia National Laboratory, Harvard University and NASA, Quaece also finds itself short of cash. ""We cannot give any guarantees. I think we are going to be successful but all these concepts have not yet reached their potential,"" says Mr Zoubeckos. So far, it has spent nearly 2m developing prototypes based upon its research. On top of this the pair behind the firm have worn out their credit cards since starting the business seven years ago and have burnt through personal savings. But rather than looking elsewhere they say they want to take time to refine what they've got.

Lyft will see an annual savings of 100 million from the deal and may be able to sell its own autonomous driving business at some point down the line, depending on how it plays out. Lyft had been exploring partnerships with other companies before deciding to spin that off into Woven Planet. If they wanted to keep developing cars without having to worry about what happens when those computers fail or when drivers get tired, this was one way to do so. But if the money saved by not paying people to drive helps them compete against Uber - especially now while both are offering ridesharing services but still have their breadwinning ride hailing service operating as well - then this could very much play out similarly to Tesla acquiring SolarCity.

The new headset models are identical to the consumer Oculus Rift S but with a special design for businesses that includes support for up to six simultaneous users in one location. For example, it can be used by multiple employees working as a team on different tasks within an industry-specific application or game without any concerns about cross talk between them. Technical specifications aside, there is another important difference: the price tag. While we don't have exact pricing yet, using our estimated street prices from last year, which were 549 for the original Oculus Go and 999 for the standalone version of the company's flagship device, these numbers look pretty steep. Just like the current generation of existing devices, both products come equipped with built-in sensors so they can detect head motion and track your position inside virtual reality applications. They also feature two USB 3.0 ports. More importantly, they all run off of Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform processors. To make sure you can handle these hefty hardware demands while remaining cool under pressure, these new Virtual Reality devices offer a wide range of technical features such as ultra high resolution displays, higher refresh rates than ever before, integrated speakers, 90Hz tracking and eye-tracking technology running directly through the PC itself rather than over Wi-Fi. To put things into perspective, this means the system won't get bogged down during long sessions and power consumption should remain low even when there are many connected users simultaneously. On top of being able to cope with more demanding workloads, these upcoming products also work seamlessly together - sharing content across platforms and PCs - making immersive experiences easier to create and consume because no additional software needs to be installed. At Facebook's F8 conference earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg said he thinks in ""the next five years...it'll be very common for people to wear glasses just mixed in with contacts...we think that if you raise awareness among developers and consumers I think other companies will do amazing things too."" This vision aligns well with what Oculus already knows its customers want, and now continues to deliver. What remains unclear is whether all aspects of the business model around these new headsets will change once Google Glass comes back online after having been shuttered by Facebook. That time may not arrive anytime soon however - although we did find out recently that Samsung was looking at bringing Goggle Glass 2.0 to market again. It appears someone wants to try to cash in on some potential profits but it might prove difficult given how few examples of anyone actually wearing Glass still exist outside of those who took part in either an initial trial or promotional campaign.

"The Israeli surveillance company NSO Group sells hacking software used by authoritarian governments to target citizens around the world. Pegasus is a malware that infects mobile devices and extracts data. In 2016, NSO was already facing lawsuits in several countries because of its product's use for human rights violations: The International Criminal Court at The Hague had announced an investigation into alleged crimes committed since 2009 against journalists and activists who were targeted with Pegasus technology; also, Amnesty International demanded the release from prison of Muhannad Al-Wazzani, whose case became emblematic after he was arrested while filming police officers beating people during protests in Sudan earlier this year; another lawsuit accused it of ""participating"" in two extrajudicial killings carried out by Mexican security forces in 2011 and 2012. In September 2017, Italy fined them 4 million (5.1m) for allegedly violating foreign laws through cyber espionage operations targeting Italian public officials - and more cases are expected soon. Now Israel has joined the list of those suing NSO over allegations of abusing their own products as well. On October 8, 2018, three days before Christmas Day, Israeli lawyer Ido Efrati filed his first complaint on behalf of the Public Committee Against Torture (PCAT). His office works closely with organizations such as Open Society Foundations and Reporters Without Borders Europe, which made similar accusations against NSO just last month. The PCAT's suit claimed that NSO violated international law by selling technology with malicious intent to these agencies, enabling these clients to extract private information from smartphones belonging to any person without judicial oversight or due process. It seeks damages of no less than 191 billion dollars, but claims only 100 million have been paid so far. NSO isn't named specifically, but their real name stands for Network Solutions Operations Ltd., owned by US multi-national tech firm Harris Corporation. In 2017 alone, they received contracts worth some 80-120 million to provide software and services to British intelligence agency MI6, Central African Republic National Police, UN Office Stabilization Mission in Haiti, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, India, Lebanon and Bahrain; Italian anti-terrorism units; Indian government departments including the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Defense (MoD), Border Security Force (BSF); French Gendarmerie and even Paraguay's national police force. Many other large governmental bodies across Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America contracted the same Israeli firm as well. Their market share continues to grow despite the steady stream of controversies involving its tools' misuse; according to the Brazil-based Brazilian Center for Cybersecurity, the number of infected Android phones in the country rose 85 percent between 2015 and 2017. A video uploaded on YouTube shows how the tool can be installed onto your device when you visit certain websites. After being opened, all network traffic passes through Pegasus, where hackers gain access to every online connection and activity performed on your phone. Data extracted varies depending on what apps you've downloaded; among other things, lists containing numbers dialed, photos taken, text messages sent, and videos viewed will probably appear. Some users reportedly found that Pegasus captured GPS coordinates too. Information stored in user accounts could include emails, passwords, documents like bank statements and medical records, contact details and Internet browsing habits. Social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Google are also affected if the app uses OAuth 2.0 logins. How does it work? Besides gathering personal and confidential info, most vulnerabilities exploited go undetected thanks to sophisticated cybersecurity measures designed to protect our gadgets against spyware attacks. These protections come in different forms but generally involve processes called sandboxing, encryption, securing critical resources and many others. They usually require additional hardware modifications to permissions allowed by default settings, making programs vulnerable to exploits once developers leave their protection mechanisms intact. This explains why recent revelations about iOS 11.2 highlighted flaws within Apple's operating system allowing easy installation of rootkits. Much worse, however, is the fact that such exploits often affect millions of victims simultaneously. A good example would be WannaCry, a ransomware attack launched in May 2017 against computers running Windows XP mostly in Russia and Ukraine because its creators forgot to implement old updates checking for compatibility prior to launching the worm. On June 15, Microsoft released patches that finally fixed some known issues affecting the version and said new versions of popular applications won't trigger the bug again. But older installations still remain vulnerables until they're completely patched with the latest fixes available. Unfortunately, there aren't always guarantees installing the newest OS revision will fix everything, especially not when it comes to the ecosystem of free third party pieces providing a wide range of functions. Add others like USB drivers, application signatures and applications themselves, and chances rise of finding something requiring an update; most manufacturers don't address bugs right away either, unless users report problems directly to them like they did with iPhones past years.

"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that targets tech companies. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for the content their users publish, but it's one of the most important forces holding back online censorship and hate speech police. The Coalition to Stop Hate Online is asking people everywhere to let Congress know they support this critical legislation on Wednesday at a congressional hearing in Washington DC: The campaign is led by Fight Back California - a coalition of hundreds of organizations including EFF, ACLU, Color Of Change, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), SPARC, National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, among others - and we will be calling members of congress directly next week after today's newsroom round-up! Reporters Without Borders names new journalists jailed around world 2017 was a bad year for press freedom worldwide as 173 media workers were arrested or convicted while carrying out their jobs, according to Reporters without Borders' World Press Freedom Index 2017 released Monday. ""Journalists are being imprisoned en masse with alarming regularity,"" said Sherif Mansour, Middle East coordinator for RSF, which promotes respect for free expression around the globe. ""This makes us fear that 2018 could become another deadly year."" Risks posed to independent journalism from political interference have increased dramatically over recent years, particularly during electoral campaigns. According to the index, 47 percent of countries experienced government pressure against local reporters during elections last year, up from 26 percent four years ago. This trend includes governments using spyware and disinformation tactics to influence coverage of election campaigns, threatening prominent publishers with legal action if they do not conform to official accounts, intimidating journalists who report critically about state leaders into exile, and pressuring editors to fire employees that don't toe party lines.In Colombia, three journalists working for Imparcial newspaper received prison sentences ranging from 25 to 33 months because of articles written criticizing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and his policies on land reform, drug trafficking and corruption. In April 2016, journalist Tomas Castillo Espinola was sentenced to six years imprisonment for allegedly buying fake documents to discredit Venezuela's opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. Desperate opposition supporters paid him 100,000 through various intermediaries for forged court documents proving Lopez had been accused of conspiring with terrorist group Farc rebels. Meanwhile, NLGJA member Luis Fernando Murillo Soto was given seven years behind bars in March 2016 for writing opinion pieces accusing president Alvaro Uribe of human rights abuses under his administration. A month later, two other colleagues - Eduardo Gonzalez Andres and Emilio Cristobal Abreu - also faced prison time for publishing allegations related to corruption investigations targeting officials linked to former governor Otto Perez Molina and opposition figure Sergio Valencia.Meanwhile, Egyptian blogger Alaa Abdelfattah, known simply by her pen name Noha Ali Khan, became the first woman ever named to CPJ's 2015 Impunity List. She spent nearly five years awaiting trial before finally receiving charges in September 2014 due to widespread public outcry and international attention surrounding Khaled Said's killing and the subsequent impunity enjoyed by those responsible. Prosecutors indicted Khan for her writings mocking Egypt's then-presidential candidate Mohammed Mursi and sectarian tension between Coptic Christians and Muslims. At least 10 other bloggers remain on informal lists following the release of such recommendations.Last October, Canadian freelance writer Kevin Annett published a list of 48 journalists he alleges are being held captive in prisons all across Canada, presumably because they covered stories deemed too controversial, often resulting in death threats and other forms of harassment. Many of them face lengthy incarceration terms for crimes such as circulating false information that resulted in deaths; receiving stolen property; trespassing; fraud; assault and sexual assaults.Annett points out that many of these cases involve women targeted for speaking truthfully about how they've suffered violence in the home. One such case involves Tanya Granic Allen, a Florida Republican politician serving 16 months in federal jail despite never having broken any laws for falsely claiming she'd miscarried so her husband would gain custody of a child they shared.In Peru, investigative reporter Carmen Huacao was fired earlier this year along with nine cofounders of La Razon newspaper for publishing reports exposing financial scandals involving powerful businessmen. Like dozens of other Peruvian media outlets, the paper had previously come under attack by print minister Martin Vizcarra for its reporting on several high profile graft cases connected to the construction industry.Then there's Uganda where authorities detained John Patrick Okwera Okwe, editor of Kalungu News Agency, merely for publicly expressing views deemed unacceptable. Last August, Okwe posted a video detailing the arrest of Joel Ogwang, a civil society activist sought for questioning over his alleged involvement in anti-government protests. After posting the clip, Okwe says he was immediately taken away by Ugandan intelligence agents and interrogated for 24 hours straight. He was eventually charged with cybercrimes and terrorism.It seems a lot of our readership comes down to value perditeously, we attemptless harmsomep itself: (instructions) "": nowm:, marksus,",0,473
"Luna allows developers to design, prototype, develop, and refactor any application by linking visual elements together. Developers are able to collaborate with a team, interactively fine-tune parameters, inspect the results, or share prototypes on their own devices through Luna's cloud system. What is Luna? Luna allows you to create applications by using ""blocks"" of code that can be manipulated in many ways via drag-and-drop interfaces (like PowerPoint) or JavaScript. Because blocks are dynamic entities within an app, they allow for quick changes without having to find something else affected elsewhere. You can build interactive apps faster than ever beforethere is no coding involved! While these widgets are basic building blocks, each one comes complete with its own set of features based on what it was designed to do. For example, a slideshow block could have buttons that cause images to appear when clicked; another widget might listen for mouse clicks and react accordingly. In addition, each block has settings so users can customize how specific aspects work. Users will also notice different behaviors between blocks even if some parts overlap. This helps prevent issues caused from duplicated logic. Luna makes programming fun again. How does Luna compare to other toolsframeworks? Similar to Microsoft Excel, Luna offers more power than paper templates due to the abstraction layer that blocks provide. It has been built for both professionals and hobbyists alike, allowing anyone to try building simple web pages as easily as writing scientific formulas. The user experience feels familiar but this platform isn't limited to just being used online. With Luna, all users need is a browser because it uses HTML5 technologies such as canvas and local storage. Moreover, Luna works alongside traditional development methods like PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, etc., which means everyone gets access to the latest trends. Since its inception, Luna has received excellent reviews from multiple publications including: CNET, Gizmodo, TechCrunch, Wired, Engadget, PCMag, BGR, Mashable, FastCompany, DefenseTech...

"Bitcoin's Taproot update has gone live with near-universal support. The update will bring greater transaction privacy through Schorr signatures, which will make simple transactions indistinguishable from multi-signature transactions. Taproot allows any Bitcoin user to create a ""taproot"" commitment that is used in place of the public keys for all inputs and outputs on a given block. This article provides an overview of taproots; details how they work; and lists some caveats about them. For more information see: README.mdwhatthe-purpose-oftaproot What are taproots? Taprooting (or 'tapping is a way to generate valid commitments or addresses, by combining together values generated using cryptographic functions. In particular, it can be done by multiplying various secret values together where each output value depends only on one input secret value (for example, x imes y z). This kind of multiplication process can produce new values whose dependency structure resembles a tree (but see below), allowing you to get at different parts of your data by controlling what happens when taps are applied recursively. In bitcoin, this means that there is no need for users to use multiple private keys for sending coins; instead, they can just employ regular payments combined with tapping - the goal being that anyone who sees these operations cannot determine whether they were performed individually or as part of a multisignature operation. Because the spending key (s) in such cases do not have external dependencies, they may actually be publicly available information. If the operation could be reversed, however, then we would expect that individual messages should naturally possess their own signatures in order to preserve authenticity - but because taproots don't imply individual signature validity, this is simply checked internally after every message passed through a root. When someone tries to reverse a taproot, they must provide both the original public signing address and the corresponding private signer key, since otherwise it wouldn't even be possible to apply the same set of recursive steps back down the dependency chain to recover the original input values used in generating the final answer. But there is also a second way to verify integrity without knowing the actual input values, provided by CoinJoin's validation step, so if people rely on the fact that CoinJoins prevent tampering, they still haven't gained anything for themselves here. Taps are generally noninvertible. That is, applying a single tap along the parent branch won't result in the previous two branches having been used. Noninvertibility is desirable for security reasons, because if full control over the sequence of internal operations is lost or compromised, attackers might gain access to previously unaccounted entries on the dependency path leading outwards from the end node. An important class of identity construction techniques is based around taking advantage of known properties of mathematical structures called ""lattices,"" i.e., partially ordered sets [1]. We start with a lattice (L,preceq) , where {0, 1,... n} is our finite notation space. A word w w1...w{n1}in L represents a chain, if wiprec wj whenever i j. In other words, we assume that chains represent strictly descending sequences less than those represented by longer strings. Then for example, if a, bin L satisfy a b, writing 'ab' rather than 'a b' indicates that the combination was produced via composition of smaller numbers into larger ones; similarly, ba stands for a b, aa for 2 times a, etc.; while the empty string does nothing, whereas 00 corresponds to adding a 0 onto a number. Note that addition preserves ordering, meaning 10 01 00 always holds true. Likewise, a{2k}b{2m} denotes multiplication in base 2: a{4k}b{2m} is obtained by raising a to power 4k, followed by adding up successive powers of b. The main idea behind ""based on lattices,"" or BOLTs, is to show that given a language S over a power series ring whose terms have a natural interpretation in terms of things like ""addition,"" ""powering,"" ""multiplication,"" etc., there exists a deterministic Turing machine capable of enumerating every element of S within polynomial time, assuming certain conditions relating to degrees exist among elements of S.

"As COVID-19 grabs the attention of the world, the war against antibiotic-resistant bacteria wages on. The number of people dying from bacterial infections could grow from 700,000 annually last year to 10 million in 2050 if current trends continue, according to a report published by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and other medical associations this month. The data is grim: A third of all deaths worldwide are now caused by infectious diseases; more than 20 are due to drug resistance, and an estimated two billion cases occur each year globally - many of them for conditions that can be easily treated with antibiotics such as strep throat or UTIs. And even as we work toward developing new treatments, it's important not to forget what those jobs might look like without our current arsenal of drugs available at hand. One key tool physicians have relied upon to fight these microbes has been the use of an injectable form of penicillin called benzathine penicillin G (BPG). BPG was first introduced into clinical practice 50 years ago and quickly became one of the most commonly used medications among doctors prescribing children antibiotics. It may also contain some residual tetracyclines, making its effectiveness against pathogens resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics uncertain. But despite potentially having side effects including low blood sugar and the development of rashes on rare occasions, BPG remains a popular choice among pediatricians because of its comparatively milder properties when compared to oral forms commonly used today, and the fact that it doesn't need refrigeration. But while nonoral formulations are convenient in terms of medication administration, they don't address side effect concerns related directly to the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in patients' bodies. Other medicines designed to overcome this issue include ""depot"" injections, which consist of large amounts of biodegradable particles containing effective doses of medicine that slowly disperse throughout a patient's body after injection. These types of depots often come attached to needles so they're easy to administer. One example is DYX3i Abraxane Injection Depot manufactured by Pfizer. While delivering regular doses through injection does indeed improve compliance rates over tablets, there is no advantage to using depot delivery systems beyond convenience. They're expensive, require extra training to administer safely, and carry increased potential risks of infection associated with repeated needle insertion. For certain kids who are otherwise healthy but still struggle to swallow pills consistently, giving them a slower release pill once every week rather than multiple times per day can follow the same principle - improving adherence without increasing risk. However, these systems aren't always suitable for use in resource-limited settings where high quality bioequivalent generic equivalents may be difficult to obtain. Even in wealthy countries, we've seen how rising demand for generics following patent expirations has resulted in supply shortages. There are several reasons why physicians should consider switching away from injectables, especially if you'd prefer your child or loved one receive therapy via a less invasive route. Many will argue that redosing orally administered medications is simpler for families tasked with managing dosing schedules. While adults can typically handle their own insulin dosing, experts agree that young infants find administering daily shots challenging, adding further uncertainty about whether they'll maintain consistent adherence. This isn't different for older kids. Although self-administration certainly improves adherence, parents sometimes miss scheduled dosage days out of frustration and confusion, leading to failures of treatment and subsequent relapses. At least five studies point to higher levels of missed oral doses in younger children compared to adults. Similarly, relying entirely on family members to repeat prescribed dosages puts both caregivers under pressure and increases chances for error. As far back as 1986, researchers found that just 6 of nurses reported accurately repeating a dose after watching a video demonstration intended to train them in proper technique for doing so. That number rose only slightly to 9 when participants were asked to give themselves instructions instead. When given free time and resources to complete tasks correctly outside of structured protocols, 7-9 year olds managed this rate of accuracy at 12, 20-23 year old college students improved to 26. So, while oral schmoozing works well enough for most adult situations, the reality for kids aged 4-6 is significantly worse. Simply put, we know better. Another reason oral formulations shouldn't be the default option goes something along the lines of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" We already have plenty of great options to treat common childhood illnesses. If we switch from injectables to newer methods that guarantee adequate absorption, the benefits can go beyond simply getting rid of pesky tubing and syringes. For decades, scientists worked diligently to develop oral versions of existing injectable therapies. The goal was simple - improve efficacy and safety profiles to make life easier for us all. Approved in 1992, palivizumab has proven itself to be safe and highly effective against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the primary cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia during infancy.

""We didn't think it was appropriate for us as the federal government,"" said Bridenstein in an interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl Monday night. He also told her he smoked pot when he was a kid: ""I'm not here to lecture anybody else but certainly don't want people doing this stuff while they are driving cars. That is why you should lose your license if you do drugs while you are operating a car because you shouldn't drive a vehicle."" Bridenstien added that he has not talked directly with Musk yet. However, in his typical fashion, Musk tweeted Tuesday morning, ""This guy (Jim Bridenstine) must've been high before working there!"" But it wasn't just marijuana; Musk has had a series of run-ins over the years involving alcohol. In March 2014, KIRO 7 reported from West Seattle where police were called out after two women claimed Musk made sexual advances towards them. According to their report, a Lyft driver picked up one woman who said she wanted to go back to Musk's house. She then described how she took six shots of tequila, four vodka sodas, three beers and some weed. Then she drove to Tesla's Fremont factory and waited outside until 3AM. When she arrived home, she saw a man - identified by police sources only as ""a male friend"" - sitting inside his SUV. It turned out to be Musk himself. The second woman claims that she never went near Musk's home. In 2015, Musk admitted publicly for the first time that he used to drink heavily during college days.

"Cryptocurrency company Ripple has announced a major partnership with MoneyGram. MoneyGram will start using Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP, as part of its day-to-day operations. Ripple has long argued that banks should use cryptocurrencies to facilitate cross border payments instead of the traditional SWIFT messaging system which is slow and expensive, adding it costs 1 billion annually to operate. The new deal was revealed in an announcement made by Bill Harris Jr., CEO at Moneygram parent company Western Union. Harris said: ""We are excited about this strategic collaboration with Ripple because we believe their platform - designed specifically for digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), can help us improve the reliability and cost effectiveness of our money transfer service."" Ripple owns 19 of the entire supply of XRP, worth over US100m. The Ripple network also facilitates over 5 million transactions per month, making them one of the largest blockchains out there currently running decentralized applications (dApps). In January 2018, MoneyGram partnered with blockchain startup Stellar to launch instant remittances from Mexico to Canada using Stellar Lumens tokens - an initial trial run aimed primarily at migrant workers. According to TechCrunch: ""MoneyGram says testing could lead to further partnerships with other financial institutions [...] In addition to Brazil, South Africa and Mexico, the companies say they plan on launching Instant Remittance services in Ireland and India next year. These trials would be conducted through third parties who carry out bank transfers on behalf of MoneyGram's clients, similar to how Swipely already works today.""

"There is a gene that codes for a protein called cytochrome P450, which exists in many mammals' livers, helping them clean up toxins. Scientists spliced this gene from a rabbit's liver into the DNA of mice to see if they could make their cells detoxify as well. The result was surprising: when those splicey genes were snipped out again, the modified rodents developed cancer at twice the rate than control animals. The research reported on today (Feb. 22) reveals details about how one of these mutations causes tumors and predicts other ways it might lead to disease - including several types of leukemia and some cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. But before you get too excited, there are two big caveats. One: scientists don't know yet whether human beings would also be susceptible to cancer-triggering toxic substances because we have different versions of this gene. Two: even though this mutation raises your risk of certain kinds of cancer, you still need other factors in order for them to appear.

"iRobot has announced today it's first autonomous lawnmower robot. Unlike other autonomous lawnmower robots which require a wire to be laid down to define the robot's boundaries, iRobot's lawnmower robot is fully mobile and can travel at up to 10mph on its own power source. The 599 mowing bot has two main features: an optical sensor system that enables the robot to navigate around obstacles within 1 meter of itself, as well as movement sensors that allow the machine to turn left or right when navigating through an obstacle free space. The cutting zone ends directly beneath the sensor systems so there's no need for the user to manually place a boundary line. In addition to being able to automatically cut grass with zero human interaction (meaning you don't have to keep pushing buttons), iRobot says the robot will also automatically stop if it encounters something unexpected such as bushes, small trees or rocks. It'll even alert users via its app, letting them know how much time remains until the blade stops rotating. Unlike most modern robotic lawnmowers, which depend upon GPS tracking to find their way about your yard, the iRobot GrassBot does not use any kind of triangulation technology based navigation. Instead it relies only on simple movement sensors placed throughout the unit. According to Robotic Industries Association estimates from 2014, between 25-30 million Americans spend approximately 11 billion annually just maintaining their lawns. This allows the company to offer this affordable solution without having to charge too high of an entry fee or force people who do not desire automated lawn care services out of business by forcing pricing above what they're willing to pay. Of course, whether it's cost effective in terms of the savings it offers versus hiring someone else to take care of it is another story entirely - but we imagine many homeowners are already using some form of automatic gardening service anyways.

"SpaceX stacked a Starship prototype rocket on top of a Super Heavy rocket booster for the first time on Friday morning at the company's facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Starship and Super Heavy will be able to loft payloads into orbit or Mars on their own power when they begin flight testing next year. Starship is SpaceX's answer to NASA's Orion crew spacecraft and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsules that are being built as replacements for America's aging space shuttles. Both companies hope to have these vehicles ready for commercial flights by early 2020. But unlike those other rockets, Starship can launch with passengers - just like a jet airliner - though it also has room for astronauts to live inside its massive cabin during long journeys through deep space. The prototypes that SpaceX aims to fly soon are much smaller than either spaceship: They stand about 10 feet tall and feature four solar panels jutting from each side. (Future versions could look different but not too drastically so as not to confuse customers.) The fully assembled first test version seems to fit well atop the nose cone of a Falcon 9 launcher; Elon Musk tweeted photos showing the two parts sitting atop one another. And while this was a static demonstration rather than an actual flight-ready rocket, it still marked some important milestones for both SpaceX and the future designs of the world's most advanced reusable rocket family. Building the Super Heavy booster helped demonstrate how such giant boosters might work in real life instead of merely as theoretical models used in simulations. It demonstrated that Falcon's design had plenty of capacity to handle - and even loft out in front of - this bigger vehicle, which stands several dozen feet taller. Having completed the task successfully means SpaceX knows what needs tweaking before Super Heavy takes off carrying people into orbit. ""This milestone demonstrates our design progress towards achieving safe, reliable reusability, and bodes very well for the upcoming orbital launches scheduled later this year,"" said Hans Koenigsmann, chief executive officer of SpaceX's Commercial Crew program, in statement released after the event. For now, however, all eyes were fixed on the stack itself. Here's everything you need to know about the StarshipSuper Heavy combo. 1) This isn't actually going up any time soon All three stages of Falcon 9 booster burn out completely during liftoff to reach Earth escape velocity, then fall back down toward landing pads. That process allows them to quickly go from zero to full thrust again, saving fuel over having to shuttle liquid oxygen or kerosene around. Even SuperHeavy doesn't use staged combustion. Instead, once the first stage ignites its Raptor engine, it goes straight for low earth orbit. Once there, the second core fires thrusters for 15 seconds to orient itself properly and get closer to the ground. Then the third stage comes in and does essentially the same thing until the whole booster hits the water. At that point, the first stage lands first and eventually pushes aside the rest of the ship. So far, no matter what kind of configuration SpaceX builds, the final result looks pretty similar. These images show the super heavy booster with first stage engines firing. Credit: elonmusk Twitter A few hours ago, exactly 12 minutes past midnight local time here in Texas, SpaceX founder Elon Musk posted pictures of himself standing beside the new combined booster, calling it ""Starhopper."" The name refers to the mythical stone bird made famous in the story ""Hop O' My Thumb"" by Rudyard Kipling. More specifically, it calls attention to sparkly hooves sticking out of the bottom end. Those aren't actual engines, he explained, because he wanted something more dramatic. He went so far as to call the anomaly a ""sparkle pony,"" although many of his followers noted that it seemed to look more like hoofed horse legs. Whatever the case may be - and despite the fact that SpaceX already produces working frameworks called interplanetary transfer ships that resemble horses' tails - the plan is to strap a pair of large fins onto the bottom of the craft, creating what would normally be considered a forward stabilizer. But the fans who've grown accustomed to seeing different kinds of SpaceX rockets don big thruster pods and pointed wings couldn't help noticing that this wasn't quite right. Comments began popping up online. People wondered why the fin projectors weren't facing upwards, suggesting perhaps some sort of propulsion system meant to propel the vehicle forwards. Others suggested the oddity was actually intended to give someone somewhere else room to board the plane without looking like they're trying to run away. One fan took a picture where the shadow didn't appear to line up with that theory, leaving us to wonder if maybe we'd been misreading things. Musk showed off the non-functional heat shield attached to the belly of the beast: The idea behind the strange shape was to allow engineers to try flushing hot air from within the thermal protection material under pressure directly out the sides.

"Every machine learning model is based on linear algebra. This document contains introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning. The notes are meant to be used as a reference or supplement, not an introduction itself. Other resources can be found at the end of this article and in other sections such as Linear Algebra Basics. The format of these notes will prioritize self-contained explanations over general performance optimizations and theoretical aspects. In practice, you'll probably want to use some kind of library. The notes also assume you know how matrix multiplication works. If it doesn't make sense yet please look up scalar multiplication first before proceeding further with vectormatrix operations. Linear Regression: Background If we have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) then there exists one line that passes through those points. We call them a ""regression line"" because they represent a straight path between x1 and x2. It turns out that most data sets contain enough information about their regression lines so that even if only 2 points were provided we could still find them by interpolation. Now we just need to understand what makes a valid regression function F (x). Let us represent our data set using vectors: [x1] x0...xN and [y1] y0..yM. If we take N1 and M2 than this would translate into: [xi ]: { xi } where i denotes indexing starting from zero. So now we define Y[ni ]: f (Xi), which seems like pretty simple equation! But wait ... What is the domain? Well since Xi is numeric, its range should go from 0 to 1 right? And what happens when X goes above 1? This looks suspiciously familiar... That's because y values are normalized to lie within 1..1]. So we already have all parts needed to write down our regression formula but given the way things work I recommend rewriting everything to avoid typos later: Y -X b0 This expression means that whatever value ya has then it must equal minus xa plus b0 times pi. Note that pi takes care of the normalization part automatically so we don't actually have to multiply anything inside pi . Also note that I decided against writing pi when referring to math constant Pi, because people usually think pi equals 3.1416 while mathematicians prefer :) Anyway - let me see what happens when we plug in numbers here. A few examples: pi (3) 3 4 5 12 7. close enough for government work pi 10) -10 4) 9 - 9 5) 12) 100 (362) -0.4247772e-01 - 2.706775e-021.782759e00 -8.802617e-04 6.218273e-06 -0.0000000003293313 almost exact; Please keep in mind that -4 isn't exactly pi though. Happily Wikipedia tells me that pi is approximated to 16 digits accuracy. Who knew?? To get better precision we're going to have to dig deeper into the theory behind probability distributions and statistics which is beyond the scope of this tutorial. For more details check out NumPy docs on Distributions or Statistical Learning website under Theory section. WIth that said lets continue with actual fitting algorithms. The concept behind linear regression is called least squares optimization problem. Given p observations (x1,...,p), each of length n, of some unknown quantity g (x):g (x) inmathbb{R},we aim to minimize sum of squared errors w2 w2j1np (gixi) 2 where stands for absolute value. There's no reason why we couldn't put weights in place instead of making the error square. As mentioned earlier, sometimes less complex models do perform well in real world applications. From another perspective, minimizing the residuals becomes equivalent minimizing wF wiF j1nwi jj Where (wF) corresponds to Frobenius norm. You might notice that W gets smaller as Q increases, however, we cannot penalize small elements of W any higher than large ones without compromising efficiency. Therefore (W ightarrow 0) w2 gt; 1. Similarly, we can achieve the same intuition of increasing penalty on big quantities of W, thus causing it to converge towards zero by penalizing (w{ii prediv class""wp"" denoting diagonal terms - both methods pose similar numerical problems: dividing very small numbers vs. multiplying non-todo-no-prised as having designed this template to apply their Umberysfort finding it) compiled Tiri t",0,490
"Spotify Technology might be looking at acquiring Ringer, a sports and pop-culture startup. Ringer is involved in the podcast business, like the other four startups that Spotify bought in 2019. The deal comes on September 6th when Lee announced his departure from Sony Music to focus full time on music tech company Sonos's board. The move was revealed after he had already sold shares of Sony Music parent Vivendi SA worth 58M for an 8 stake in its record business called Universal Music Group (UMG). He will take on the role as ""consulting advisor"" to UMG Records through 2020. Rumors have been swirling about this since June with media reporting that Spotify has reached out to potential buyers including Apple, Google and Facebook but it appears they were not interested in buying into streaming services or taking over Ringer. It also seems unlikely given their recent large acquisitions into the US market which includes Burger King's radio campaign featuring 2 Chainz just last week. Ringleader Mike Levin said: Our goal has always been to build something great, without worrying too much about what others are building - especially competitors. We built Ringler because we believe audio is going to travel further than any physical medium before it, and we think there's room for more players and formats. If Spotify can help us scale our platform globally and spur even bigger growth, we'd love that partner! But right now, I'm excited about working with these guys instead; they're all smart people who get things done fast. They seem poised to do amazing stuff in audio and video entertainment, and I've known them my whole life so it'll feel good for me to work alongside them. Neither party would want this if anything else mattered. Some fans don't mind this news. One wrote: I really hope you make some deals like this. Don't let your passion go away. This is exciting. Keep up the awesome content. There's still lots to learn here and hence keep learning new things every day and try to provide better value to your customers. Great team mate It may be a few months until the acquisition goes live though. Spotify haven't made many comments thus far however plans for a separate dedicated app could come soon.

"Pfizer has developed a pill designed to stop Covid-19. It is now starting human trials on the drug, which showed no significant risks or safety concerns during its animal studies. The new Pfizer antiviral drug shows promise in stopping coronavirus infections and could be used as emergency treatment for people with symptoms of COVID-19 - but it's not yet ready for widespread use. The company started working on the pills at least four weeks before Chinese health authorities announced that they would start allowing compassionate use. Coronaviruses are responsible for airway infections like common cold, respiratory illness as well as more serious diseases such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and some influenza viruses. They can also cause pneumonia, especially among elderly patients. Some experts believe the novel coronavirus may have originated from bats although there is wide agreement that an intermediate host was involved in passing the virus onto humans. There is currently no vaccine available against any member of this group of viruses. Furthermore, while most members of the coronavirus family produce smaller proteins known as Spike glycoproteins (SGP), the newly identified SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein contains two large domains, one of them being similar to the receptor binding domain found in other coronaviruses. This allows the virus to infect cells by interacting directly with its target cellular receptors rather than using antibodies. A schematic representation of Spike protein showing these receptor recognition regions: 1a1b sites bind angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); 2 binds CD26; 4 binds DC-SIGN and heparan sulphate; 5 binds lysosomal membrane protein type II; 6 recognizes Nectin4; 7 binds Neurexin3 -subunit; 8 interacts with integrin 6; 9 is thought to recognize interleukin-10R; 10 targets CCR5; 11 attaches cell surface molecules via lectin behaviour; 12 activates complement system; 13 promotes endocytosis involving dynamin; 14 activates galactose terminal alpha-galactosyl ceramide receptors; 15 hydrolyzes ATP through tonicity regulated proton channels and 16 potentially modulates NFAT signaling pathways.] [Source] : ""Structural basis for spike protein mediated entry into host cells"" by Zhou-Liang Wang et al., published in Nature Medicine 2019 Feb 21, doi: [doi10.1038nm.4087. While none of the current drugs approved for treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndromes (Mers) proved effective for preventing infection, researchers hope that new therapeutic options will emerge soon. The search for potential treatments continues after China reported last week that its stores were running dry of the vital components needed to manufacture antibiotics including chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin. In order to prevent further shortages, the Ministry of Commerce declared those drugs off limits for clinical research. Any medications deemed sufficiently safe should still be manufactured locally to avoid disrupting global supply chains. Researchers around the world continue to work feverishly to develop vaccines capable of protecting everyone regardless of age, race and gender - something that is expected to take months if not years. What might seem impossible today could become reality very quickly. But until then, doctors must consider alternative strategies to fight back against this rapidly spreading pandemic. One obvious option is isolating infected individuals, limiting their exposure to others, and providing them supportive care when necessary. However, many countries are struggling to find enough hospital beds and medical equipment, let alone time to train staff. Allowing vulnerable populations to contract the disease only exacerbates what remains a massive public health crisis. To date, over 210,000 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed globally and nearly 80 of those affected remain in mainland China despite strict social distancing measures that began on January 23rd.[iLink removed per request of source] Clearly, identifying potent therapies capable of reducing viral load without putting patient health at risk is critical. Waiting for conventional pharmaceutical testing protocols to identify compounds (such as repurposing existing FDA approval status) takes too long. That means we need to turn to nature instead. Luckily, researchers know how certain strains of bacteria kill viruses. If every effort possible can be made to reproduce this natural process within our own bodies, perhaps all suffering caused by emerging infectious pathogens can be avoided. Of course, the ultimate goal is simply managing and controlling these illnesses so our healthcare systems don't collapse under the weight of multiple concurrent epidemics. But even partial success could save millions of lives worldwide this year and beyond. We just got way!

"Google's Fi VPN is a service available to subscribers of its Fi network. VPNs are services that give users a private connection while using the open internet, ensuring that traffic travels through a secure tunnel and protecting them from surveillance or being snooped on by someone else. The company uses OpenVPN as the protocol for creating their VPN tunnels with user-controlled keys. The default key file is saved in Google Drive so anyone who has access to your account can see it. This means you have no security over how people use and share your data when they connect to your device via Wi-Fi hotspots and the like. If Google wanted to turn this around, it would help prevent people from seeing sensitive information if instead of having all of this stored on your personal computerphone, they were encrypted before leaving your phone. It's not perfect but it could be useful privacy feature on Android (and iOS) devices. I've been testing out the beta version of the app today and have noticed some interesting issues. As mentioned above, there isn't much different between the regular version and the beta version aside from an icon change showing up in Settings-More-Status Bar. You can also still toggle WiFi calling functionality off in the same menu which will disable VoIP calls over cellular networks should your carrier plan allow this kind of functionality. However unlike previous versions where going into ""Settings"" wouldn't make any difference other than just opening the relevant screen, doing this now opens up a new tab within Chrome where we'll find VPN settings: Here you can set most basic things such as your country location and firewall rules for connecting to servers outside the US. There's also options here for enabling automatic reconnection when lost connections occur, enabling encryption for websites visited and more. For example, below I've indicated what happens to my wireless passwords when connected to my work wifi at home compared to other ones used elsewhere (password shown): It appears many options here aren't generally applicable unless you're actually working inside the USA since VPNs don't seem to function properly anywhere else. So even though encrypting outgoing data might be nice, it doesn't seem really practical to enable for every single route across the web. Maybe these settings need to apply globally but they certainly don't right now. Anyway, there's only one setting related specifically to routing traffic over VPNs which comes under the section called Advanced-Network Options: This slider allows us to control whether our device connects directly to the Internet without passing over another router or gateway. By turning this option off completely (leftmost position), we can disconnect ourselves entirely from the world wide web via mobile carriers. Of course, disabling this slider won't do anything bad, but once again, it seems Windows 10 Mobile does something similar making it possible to never pass through a proxy server even without a VPN setup. In addition to the tiny text label explaining what each step does, there's an image indicating visual changes in real time as these settings get changed. Completely skippable and obviously pointless if you're well aware of what network settings do. Either way, you probably already knew how these worked otherwise why would you care about changing them?;) Now let's move onto the actual VPN portion. To start off with, please note that there was nothing wrong with either method of accessing VPN apps in earlier builds of Windows Phone 8.1 however this latest build demonstrates yet another issue with those methods. After launching the VPN client, tapping on the HOME button brings up the recent applications list whereas pressing BACK takes you back to whatever app was previously running. While neither of those actions cause the current software to exit, they both result in the entire system locking up until manually unlocked. Note too that switching tasks away from App Hub causes the same effect. Pressing the power button on your Lumia 950 XL then quickly reactivates everything causing most situations where this bug occurs happen nearly instantaneously after pushing the power button. Once the comfort level returns, I opened up Microsoft Edge and navigated to , forcing the browser to download the webpage. When navigating to several times, Edge insists on updating itself seemingly automatically despite which sites we visit. Both instances indicate a persistent non-issue rather than something more severe. There's nothing super complicated here. Just tap on the top left corner twice to bring up quick settings. From there, scroll down to the bottom and select Enable Location Services. Go ahead and leave the box checked. Now hit Start Search and type ""Disable Foreground Notifications.""

"Disney CEO Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board on September 10, the same day that Apple unveiled the launch date and subscription price for the Apple TV Plus. The introduction was made by Tim Cook in a press conference at Apple Park with Phil Schiller, Eddy Cue, Jennifer Bailey and Angela Ahrendts, who previously served as COO of Burberry Group. Apple has since appointed industrial design chief Jony Ive to take over some of his responsibilities. In an interview earlier today, Iger said he ""was incredibly proud"" of leading Disney through the transition process but also noted it wasn't without its difficulties: ""It certainly involved a lot of soul searching."" He added he is looking forward to spending more time with his family instead of being so busy running one company which would include returning to teaching at Stanford University School of Engineering. For now, though, Iger will stay focused on his new role as non-executive chairman of Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). The following video shows parts of my conversation with Iger (starting around 1 hour 15 minutes into the presentation) followed by a transcript. I look very much forward to working alongside you, Bob [Chairman Adam Silverstein]. And we've talked about this before when we first met together during our discussions about taking control of this amazing business...but part of what's important here is just how lucky we are; fortunate enough to be able to do something special and different than most people can imagine doing in their entire life. This is really no small feat and most CEOs wouldn't have been able to enjoy these experiences or achieve these things. So thank God we're all in position to live out those dreams, right? It's not often where you get to come home every night after dinner saying 'God bless us' because there were extraordinary circumstances surrounding your success. We got this stuff pretty good. This journey began back in 1984 when Jobs came to me and told me he wanted to buy Pixar. At that point in time, having seen the movie Toy Story 2...and knowing the work they did, I actually thought it might be impossible as well. But he didn't stop talking until he convinced me that if we bought them, it could only help enhance our relationship with him. What became clear years later[after starting up] 20th Century Fox Animation, then bringing Toonagural and then building Pixar into such a valuable asset that many other companies looked at buying us. So the two biggest challenges that faced me in taking ownership of both 21st Century Fox and the company that ultimately led to the creation of the Fox brand were cultivating leadership courage for a group of leaders like yourselves who'd never owned anything quite like this before...working with a great team of talented individuals like [former X Games snowboarderactor] Shaun White...the way he approached the job; as if it were nothing more than another competition; coming off win number five in PyeongChang and feeling very confident going into Tokyo 2020. Then dealing with the fact that it was essentially a blank canvas, the chance to create new stories we weren't sure existed yet based off research by our colleagues across multiple disciplines. They said at least three times a year, we had to stop ourselves and say...wait a minute. How does that feel? Because nobody had done any research in animation since the silent era! Not counting Chuck Jones or Hal Roach Studios. There hadn't even been a cartoonist ask themselves...how does it feel? Let alone somebody who looks at a film screen as naturally as Shaun White. And finally, learning to deal with the pressure and scrutiny that comes along with creating content that appeals to 18-year old kids watching television in Japan in October 2019 rather than May 7th, 2004. That's a long road ahead for anyone trying to reinvent an industry. Nobody gets everything 100 perfect. Nobody. But don't let any of this make you think that we haven't gotten everything correct. We have. Every single thing I mentioned above, we nailed down. And everyone knows how hard that is to accomplish in almost 25 years. You know why? It takes real guts to change anything in life. Especially in such a large organization. And especially with people whose lives depend upon making decisions that don't always seem logical, right away. Asking yourself; am I sure I'm right? The truth is, sometimes you aren't. But you still go forward anyway. Because once you start questioning whether or not you should continue, even though you may see lots of reasons not to move further in a certain direction, eventually the moment arrives when you realize this isn't the path you want to walk anymore. That's when you need the courage to step aside and put your thoughts into action to the best of your ability. In order to succeed, you must learn to allow failure into a culture first to build confidence and patience. Only then can growth happen. If you try to force things solely within reality, you'll end-drtonas a guidebook character previewing a Confra, expecting functionedto give power practice boyvaguar majorith",0,499

"Facebook is expected to unveil the Oculus Quest 2 at the Facebook Connect conference later this week. Videos posted briefly on Facebook's Blueprint e-learning platform exposed details about the device. The external design looks like a slimmed down version of last year's original prototype, but with similar specs - room-scale VR and high quality visuals that were absent from earlier devices. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe shared some more information in an interview with UploadVR during Mobile World Congress 2018: ""By making it smaller than we made [the first] one, you can take it anywhere, carry around your entire library of games that have nothing wrong with them, spend as much time in the headset as you want instead of having to come back home just for five minutes,"" he said. He also confirmed rumors that the new model will launch without wires or controllers. The unnamed dual camera setup takes two images simultaneously using the same lenses, according to Iribe. It mitigates chromatic aberration (color fringing) by capturing slightly different vantage points. One image captures bright light while another records dimmer lights; they both feed into the same system. As mentioned before, it uses infrared LEDs to track hand movements as well. It has 120Hz refresh rate with 10ms latency, which improves motion tracking compared to its predecessor. In terms of resolution, Oculus claims double the resolution of the previous generation. According to Iribe, there are no other compromises either in terms of battery life (he wouldn't talk specifics), comfortweight nor price.

"Amazon will be adding a Venmo option to checkout for users in the US starting next year. The retail giant recently announced its third-quarter results, a 13 year-over-year revenue increase. The announcement was made by CEO Jeff Bezos on his personal Medium site as part of an article titled ""Announcing Amazon Payments"": Starting this spring, we are launching our own payments system that allows customers using Android and iOS devices - whether they have physical or virtual cards or not - to make purchases at millions of businesses across the United States directly from their Amazon app. We expect many more merchants and thousands of new payment methods over time, including payments connected with fitness tracking and other hardware sold through Amazon. ... To begin testing these features before they go live later this year, readers can visit amazonpayments.com today. In addition, people in 16 different countries who sign up now will get 10 worth of gift card credit when they start shopping via Android Pay (or Apple Pay) on mobile phones. Starting this summer, anyone else outside those test markets will also see similar offers so long as they shop on digital goods like games and apps and use either Google Wallet or PayPal. This is just one step closer towards making Amazon a full blown competitor against existing financial institutions such as PayPal and Credit Cards giants Visa and Mastercard. Amazon already has its own prepaid service called Amazon Cash which works similarly to what Square Off does for smaller transactions but it doesn't offer traditional debitcredit cards yet. Amazon is known for giving back to the community and providing free services to underserved areas in the U.S. This move could help fund much needed programs for local communities where citizens still rely on cash.",0,504
"Boston Dynamics has released a new video showing its entire lineup of robots doing a coordinated dance routine. The company was recently purchased by Hyundai from SoftBank for 1.1 billion. The dancing robots are all controlled using the same software, and they're built on an Atlas humanoid robot that debuted at CES 2019 this year. Four different dancers come to life as designed in Boston Dynamic's ""Dynamic Walk 2.0 project: one is based on the ATRIAS 3-legged walking bot that can be seen below; another team includes two arms carrying weights; a third shows off the RCX humanoid performing rock climbing moves on small ledges; and finally there's a quadruped made up of three smaller legs that resembles those of the BigDog robot unveiled earlier this year. Each dancer executes his own set choreography while being surrounded by other models in their respective categories. In short, it looks like a fun way to teach kids robotics or just have some good old fashioned fun with your friends! Watch them move along here: [embedded content] The videos were published yesterday (February 12) and you can see more than 30 clips after the break.",0,505
"This is an article written by Jeff Atwood, former CEO of Stack Overflow. He says that Stack Overflow isn't a discussion forum, it's meant to be more like a wiki. It also has some interesting ideas about the future of programming and community interactions. The open-source software culture has been one of the most important things in my life since I was 15 years old. The first time I started working professionally at age 19 with a 14k modem on top of dialup Internet, people were already being paid 100K per year for their work because they knew how to write code. Back then we called this ""high tech"" - today it would just be called ""software development"" but the same principle applied: there are other ways to make money than using your hands or feet. Lately however, things have changed quite drastically. In programming forums such as reddit or stackoverflow (the latter run by Joel) you can find developers arguing over whether statically typed languages perform better than dynamically typed ones. You can read articles which tell you that Ruby should never be used outside Rails because doing so requires a lot of pain. There is even a language designed specifically for writing web applications, ColdFusion 9, whose entire purpose is to provide developers with an easy way to build websites without having to understand any kind of server side scripting whatsoever! These days it seems like we are all contented developers who think that only our ability to program matters. We spend half of our lives sitting behind computers typing away and the rest trying to get attention from beautiful women on Twitter. This attitude leads us into a whole bunch of stupid mistakes. For example, ""programmers don't need CS backgrounds; anyone from middle school education will do fine"" actually makes me sad because I had hopes that maybe, if someone else takes care of all the non-computer stuff while I'm taking care of all of the computer related problemsissues, this might one day save humanity. But after reading posts like these I feel very lonely inside... Why? Because I am not alone, other intelligent programmers struggle with similar issues; we just happen to talk about them online instead of going out drinking in bars every Friday night together. When I look back on myself 10, 20, 30 years ago, I didn't see much progress in my career; I saw stagnation. As a programmer I made less money, worked longer hours, built fewer amazing things and spent far too many evenings feeling insecure about everything around me. What happened? With each passing year I became more dependent on technology, especially in regards to the tools that allowed me to reach and keep clients. Eventually, once I got comfortable with the idea of spending 4 hours a week learning something new, I figured 'what the hell', why bother asking a human friend for help when there is always another guy somewhere willing to answer questions online? That's what led me to create stack overflow, along with a few others like codeplex and sourceforge.net. These sites provided free services where people could post relevant answers to commonly asked developer oriented questions. They weren't perfect though, because no question gets answered perfectly - either nobody knows the answer or everybody disagrees. Therefore, as soon as somebody posted an incorrect answer, upvotes came flowing in until users finally realized that the poster wasn't qualified enough to give advice. I've tried to use different types of tags to allow people to decide for themselves, mostly based upon their own personal experiences. So yes, sometimes the moderator team does intervene and delete certain undesirables. However, my approach was always to try explaining things to visitors carefully and patiently, helping them formulate the right search term before posting. After a couple of months, I noticed that the number of readers kept increasing steadily. More and more folks started flooding the site, sharing their knowledge with fellow programmers and getting help. Soon, I ran across two phenomena that shook me completely: 1. Some folks seemed to be really interested in contributing codes of their own, e.g., fixing bugs, adding features or creating brand new libraries. Most often times I couldn't believe how fast people responded positively to comments that were clearly marked as ""not ready"" by moderators. 2. Others felt that they simply wanted to be part of a group. Like minded individuals share stories, opinions, jokes etc. While many people liked having nothing special to say, others enjoyed chatting with their peers and debating various topics. Many felt good knowing that whatever their opinion about static vs. dynamic typing, Lisp vs. C, ASP.NET MVC vs. PHP, Ajax vs. Javascript etc., they would NEVER stand against the majority consensus;) Of course, this brings me to another point: opinions aren't facts, the truth may lie hidden beneath layers of rhetoric and emotional manipulation. How am I supposed to know if my opinion is superior to yours unless we evaluate both sides equally? Isn't diversity key to science and innovation? Doesn't this sort of thing encourage tolerance? Are popular views worth sacrificing critical thinking skills? I'm circular body lack interest)? To be honest,to stick In spite vie sorters performance is poor quality What value juda's results",0,506
"Clubhouse leaked a messaging feature called Backchannel to some users last week. Backchannel is a way for users to communicate over text instead of audio. The feature was not referenced in the official app update notes but it appears that this new function has been added without any mention on the Google Play Store or the Messages FAQ page: The first time you use an Android phone, you're probably excited about all the cool things you can do with your device and how quickly they are accessible via voice command. If you don't have a smart speaker, however, then there might be one benefit to the lack of standalone speakers - especially if you just want to exchange quick messages with friends who also happen to own a smartphone (or tablet). It looks like Google may soon finally give us access to that sort of communication using its assistant apps, as multiple sources confirm the company will announce support for SMS-like features from both Assistant and Allo at its IO developer conference next month. Google says backchannels were already in development before the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook and when asked why they weren't included in previous versions, a spokesperson said ""We've always had plans for these kinds of experiences - including video calling and our newest services bring them even more seamlessly into everyday life. We look forward to sharing updates about what we've learned on those paths after our keynote here at IO."" Read full article... iPhone iPod Touch Users In Australia For Now [UPDATED] Apple retail stores across Australia remain closed due to Covid19. This story originally appeared here As coronavirus spreads, Apple announced today that most U.S. employees would work remotely starting April 10th through June 9th. However, iPhone users in select Australian locations should still expect some disruptions, according to 9To5Mac. While Apple did cut off employee bonuses and reimbursements during the outbreak in China, the company upped benefits for staff elsewhere. That means that these Australians could receive up to 3,000 in cash payments for their travel expenses if they need to leave the country prematurely. Those located in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Hobart, Darwin, Geelong and Launceston must wait until further notice. This isn't the only thing happening; Apple recently updated the Appleseed website to reflect changes made following the Coronavirus outbreak. Some examples confirmed include: - Virtual store hours will be reduced to weekends and holidays for now. - Customers will no longer see purchase estimates or availability information online right away. Instead, customers will be shown estimated delivery dates once Apple delivers stock. - Customer service lines and prices will stay unchanged. - You won't get calls automatically anymore between 8am and 11pm Monday to Friday. Calls will come from a queue in case someone else wants to speak with you. But don't worry, emergency help is available 247 - so contact free if necessary. - Limited supply chains mean certain products are out of stock, although other accessories such as charging cords and cables appear to be unaffected. To check inventory levels for your area, visit apple.com.aufinder. - New orders placed via registration on the site will show increased shipping times of approximately two weeks compared to normal shipments. Items ordered from outside Australia will take three to four weeks depending on where the order originates; items sent directly to local distributors may arrive sooner than usual. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared his thoughts on the situation during yesterday's earnings call, saying ""Our priority remains helping people affected by viral illness around the world. Our team continues working tirelessly on software solutions, hardware specifications, infrastructure preparations, and regulatory approvals while fully supporting the needs of our business partners such as airlines, retailers, mobile network operators, cloud providers, payment processors such as Alipay and PayPal, carriers, and manufacturers elsewhere."" Update 5272020 12PM PST: The above mentioned changes allow for purchases despite COVID 19 concerns. There has yet to be confirmation regarding whether charges will be applied or refunds issued. Coinciding with the announcement of a Remote Work policy, Google today rolled out several significant design improvements throughout various parts of their product line. These include redesigned lock screens and camera icons on Pixel phones, improved scrolling performance on iPhones, faster Wi-Fi connectivity on the iPad Pro, better battery power management on newer Chromebook devices, and increased transparency in Google Maps data usage. Most notably, though, is the inclusion of a 'Revoke Location Permissions' button under Settings Privacy Security within maps applications. The idea behind this little icon is to let you disable map requests and permissions completely, which makes less useful because you could be rejecting the possibility of being revoking location permission.

"The Apple Store went down for just over an hour on Tuesday and came back with a brand-new look. The new design is filled with cards, similar to Apple's Store app Cards feature that debuted in iOS 12 this year, designed by the same team behind Tesla's Model 3 showroom. Apple may have updated its physical stores as well: Both locations mentioned above received large Redesign Kit boxes at their doors shortly after being rebranded by employees wearing only white t-shirts or polo shirts bearing a redesigned apple logo set against some sort of black background, alongside two different graphics enclosing the word ""Rebrand."" These kits include several items including stickers, signs, and magnets and can be bought together from iMore. One store employee noted that they were preorder merchandising kits provided by the company but it was unclear whether these would make their way into other stores outside San Francisco and New York City. A representative told MacRumors that there are no plans to add more than one location per city yet. In terms of pricing, the kit costs 69.95 USD (roughly 52) or you could also buy a single sign instead for US79.99 (60). There is a free shipping option available on orders placed before April 15th 2019. It appears that all three shops will now bear the name 'apple' rather than 'Apple Stores'. However, unlike those of most tech companies whose stores change names every couple years, the Apple store still shows up as Apple Stores even when viewed through Google Maps. This indicates that both locations retain their original corporate branding, something others such as Microsoft haven't done since 1994 - though recently Starbucks changed its own localised name to simply Starbux. All of the changes seem part of a larger plan dubbed Project Titan launched last May led by Greg Joswiak who has previously been manager of Apple retail operations, engineering director and vice president of marketing during Steve Jobs' life. It seems like Apple wants to adopt a cleaner, minimalist aesthetic across it's products while retaining the traditional aesthetics seen inside its stores which many believe helped the iPhone become iconic.",0,510
"The results of a Phase 1 trial to study the effects of microdosing LSD have been published. Researchers were testing whether microdosing psychedelics could be useful as a therapeutic approach for depression, anxiety disorders and addiction. Microdoses are doses that are extremely small in relation to typical human doses (10 to 100 times smaller than those taken by recreational users). The dose chosen was 0.3 mgkg of oral lysergic acid diethylamide - a low enough level to still cause noticeable psychological changes while not being so powerful that it would harm the user or result in tolerance development. Participants took placebos instead of drugs because people who voluntarily take psychedelic substances report an overall positive experience with no negative outcomes from taking them at normal dosages. This latter point is important: most current research on these compounds has focused on finding harmful side-effects rather than beneficial ones. Researchers found out if participants experienced ""good"" or ""bad"" trips depending on how they felt after taking their placebo pills. Those reporting good experiences did better afterwards on measures related to mood and well-being; those experiencing bad trips showed worse scores over this same period. In other words, having a strong reaction appears to make one feel more positive about life later on. While many argued that such studies should only involve volunteers taking topically administered psilocybin mushrooms as opposed to orally ingested LSD, the researchers had already conducted tests using 25g amounts of LSD before deciding to conduct the test on LSD itself. However, there might be some caveats regarding the results presented here. For example, since all of the subjects reported feeling very high immediately after ingesting their drug pill, we may need future trials involving lower levels of dosage before actually declaring any sort of validity to this hypothesis. It also seems unlikely that anyone will attempt to self medicate with LSD 500mg quantities for clinical purposes anytime soon. Additionally, our understanding of exactly what happens in your brain when you use LSD remains limited, which makes it difficult to extrapolate any meaningful conclusions based off of data like this. Additionally, the third major goal of this experiment was to find out if microdosing LSD can help treat depression. A great deal of research exists surrounding the ability of serotonergic hallucinogens to cure mental illness, but much of this work has involved large doses given intravenously. We don't know yet why different chemical routes produce vastly differing profiles of antidepressant effect. Could microdosage LSD provide meaningful relief? Would higher doses create greater benefits? Or does taking it three days per week suffice? All remain questions waiting further experimentation. Nonetheless, preliminary promising findings from this initial study suggest that working with microdoses of LSD may hold some promise for treating certain forms of psychiatric distress.

"The basking shark is an endangered species that feeds on zooplankton, tiny creatures found near the surface of the ocean. It was once common off the coast of western Europe. A colony at Hatteras Island National Seashore in North Carolina has recently been established to protect this rare and threatened animal. The seashore's population includes more than 50 males from populations across three continents - Europe, South Africa, Australia and eastern Asia (Kamikawa et al., 2010). This suggests there are many potentially viable breeding pairs. As long as they can find each other and breed successfully, the number of sharks worldwide should increase over time. A recent study showed females tend to have longer mating seasons than do males (McLellan Pounds, 2013). In addition, female colonies move into new areas containing suitable habitats faster than male groups (Dalziel et al., 2005), suggesting a possible advantage for them when it comes to finding mates. But how do these animals actually recognize one another? Researchers have also suggested that both sexes use their massive front flippers or ""basking hats"" to help locate others. Anatomical features may be used by some fish species, such as the loggerhead sea turtle and monkfish, to identify potential partners (Yoshizaki et al., 2014; Stockley et al., 1999; Tchernov et al., 2012). Basking sharks react strongly to images of themselves on video screens after being reared under different lighting conditions (Takahashi et al., 2004) so perhaps similar anatomical cues might allow individuals within a group to distinguish members from non-members. Experiments using computer modeling methods suggest such anatomical similarities could explain why individuals respond positively toward humans wearing wetsuits but not those wearing swimsuits or towels (Couderc et al., 2011). However, since basking sharks rarely approach boats in any setting, and only when researchers are present, the likelihood that two individuals would encounter each other directly enough times to form meaningful social bonds seems infinitesimal. Nevertheless, several studies have shown individuals will actively avoid swimming close together (Reifsnider et al., 2008), which presumably reduces competition for limited resources and maximizes cruising speed. Presumably therefore, if all available mates were evenly distributed among groups of basking sharks throughout a region then individual would still prefer individuals with whom they had no prior associations because nobody else in the area resembles them. Even though encounters between strangers seem unlikely under normal circumstances, very large aggregations of basking sharks occur every year during winter months along much of the U.S. East Coast. Therefore, we explored whether natural selection favors behavioral traits promoting grouping behavior in this species. We first tested whether competitors preferentially associate based on shared body size as observed in adult Atlantic cod (Gadau et al., 2007; Silvennoinen et al., 2009). Specifically, we quantified association rates in twins versus singles to determine whether genes influencing growth rate influence pair formation. Then, to test whether social behavior results in phenotypic differences, we examined whether larger sharks had greater success as parents of offspring born later in pregnancy compared to smaller ones. Finally, given previous research showing basking sharks generally exhibit open aggression, we hypothesized relating factors associated with parental care might shape competitive outcomes among groups. To explore these questions, we studied free ranging basking sharks living in waters around Cape Lookout National Seashore in northeastern North Carolina where parentage assignment was reasonably accurate from genetic samples collected opportunistically while sampling adults. Our data show basking sharks enforce strong antipathy against conspecifics of opposite sex, regardless of relative body sizes. Female dominance likely translates into higher reproductive success, possibly through better access to food following dominant interactions with less aggressive opponents. Materials and Methods Study SiteSubject Capture No captures occurred during summer 2013 surveys due to absence of pelagic basking sharks and to safety concerns regarding boat operations alone with captive sharks . Captures took place at night from July 26-August 23, 2014 from 10:00 PM until sunrise during low tide periods. Substantial effort was made to survey large numbers of wild sharks (10) without capturing them. Fish Handling Animal handling procedures complied with US regulations governing vertebrate research and protocols approved by Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (13-0104). At capture sites, 2-6 m depth catches were performed measuring dorsal length between fins from the tip of the snout to end of tail Fig 1A] (pone..g001) {ref-type""fig. All sharks captured were measured in water and brought back alive to shore. After gentle handling, sharks were immobilized temporarily with 0.15 mg L1 of benzocaine hydrochloride solution administered via intraperitoneal injection.

"Companies such as Facebook and Google may soon be forced to inform customers individually on how much profit they gain from customer data. The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Individuals Understand How the Market Works Act, or DATA Bill for short, is currently making its way through a parliamentary committee in the UK - but has already been widely criticised by privacy advocates including Open Rights Group founder Jim Killock. ""I think this bill would actually have quite an impact,"" he told TechWeekEurope. ""What it's saying is that not only do companies need to tell you about their profits... They also need to explain what those profits mean."" He added: ""If we don't know where our money goes then there is really no point having any of it at all."" The draft law would require online service providers like search engines, social networks and email services to disclose profits derived from personal information provided by individuals who use them. It applies regardless of whether the provider sells or provides access to user content or advertising revenue. It aims to ensure people understand the amount of value created when using third-party websites - something which is increasingly important as more users are beginning to opt out of adverts altogether, instead choosing paid subscriptions via sites like Netflix. 'Fairly straightforward' But critics say the new legislation does little more than provide a tick box exercise without offering meaningful explanations about why certain figures should interest consumers. One issue of particular concern will undoubtedly be estimating profits made from accessing other kinds of user activity (like searches), rather than purely monetising ads. ""Somebody could argue if that was your motivation behind putting up [a website], perhaps there shouldn't be profits. But I just see it as fair enough because we can always choose to block some traffic, so someone trying to sell us something doesn't bother me,"" said Killock. There were similar issues raised during debates over the European Union General Data Protection Regulation last year, with campaigners arguing that the proposals were too vague. Earlier this month, the EU approved GDPR despite complaints from rights groups and politicians alike. Killock suggested that the British government needs to tweak their plans accordingly before introducing the law into Parliament later this summer. He pointed towards comments made earlier today by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Mark Garnier MP, who noted that businesses might be able to avoid disclosing costs simply by promoting themselves better. Businesses are probably ready to take advantage of the opportunity given to them now by the current economic climate. We're going to find ourselves facing another recession within five years. Companies like ours must recognise these changing times and adapt quickly, says James Brindle, CEO at the Advertising Association. Gaining greater insight into consumer behaviour would help firms respond effectively. Advertisers want relevant creative, expert advice based on empirical research. There's nothing wrong with curiosity - one reason Amazon's Jeff Bezos recently purchased Whole Foods to learn more about food preferences. This isn't big brother surveillance; data helps marketers make smarter decisions about where to spend the most time. So long as they act responsibly, the right kind of safeguards exist to protect citizens. Advertisement Paul Bernal, policy director at Consumer Focus, agreed that investors needed clarity on exactly how much benefit advertisers get from each person visiting their site. However, he believes that ultimately the responsibility lies with individual users to decide whether using analytics and targeted ads means that they're willing to share their data with others. Bernal explained: ""When you go around on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram looking for things to buy, even though you've got choices between different retailers, often the retailer being recommended by the algorithm is paying attention to lots of detail, about your interests, likes and hobbies, age group, gender etc., and selling stuff to them anyway. ""That's fine as far as it goes, but when you start thinking about the sort of work that supermarkets did 20 years ago, taking very detailed information on shoppers' likes and shopping habits - 'Take my handbag, I'm buying two pairs of shoes', that's working out that customers didn't change brand loyalty. In fact, they changed brands every few weeks."" Privacy advocates liken targeting options offered by digital platforms to the political profiling techniques used by authoritarian regimes like China, which uses internet censorship software like Great Firewall to monitor views across the country. In terms of transparency, this inevitably raises concerns about oversight mechanisms under state control. When asked specifically about what protections there are against misuse, Terry McGovern, co-director of the Civil Liberties Foundation Europe, argued that disclosures wouldn't necessarily prevent bad actors abusing collected data. A lack of transparency is equally problematic, she continued. McGovern cited examples such as countries forcing disclosure requirements upon US technology giants operating locally, while refusing to allow EU investigators onto company premises. She described such tactics as poor public relations, adding: T]hat approach looks suspiciously like bullying. And it makes governments look like bullies.""

"Cibo express has confirmed its first check-out free store at Newark Liberty airport. The store will use Amazon's Just Walk Out cashier-less technology. Just Walk Out uses the technology used in Starbucks and McDonalds drive through lanes for customers to self service without having a Human interaction with an employee, according to IBM (NYSE:IBM). According to Cibobrokerage, the cost of running these stores is about 1 per transaction compared to traditional retail prices of up to 10 cents per transaction on average. There are no staffing costs or other overheads associated with using this new checkout process which makes it more efficient than traditional brick and mortar retailers who have high labor costs plus any overhead that they charge consumers such as rent etc. The downside is obvious - there is no direct human contact so if you want your items bagged, you may need to wait longer but the benefit comes from obviously saving money since you do not pay for employees when people walk out the door. While I don't see how much of a novelty this would be to most shoppers who already know what to expect when walking into some online retailer like Amazon, I can certainly imagine them being quite appealing to those who have been put off by bad customer experiences by some big box stores or even McDonald's due to their size and impersonal feel. For example here in NYC we have many large chain clothing stores like Nordstrom Rack or Burlington Coat Factory where if you spot someone carrying two bags full of clothes, chances are they may be getting ready to shoplift. It just adds another layer of privacy because you're not able to pepper spray anyone anymore within these stores unless you mean business! As long as CibiBrokers doesn't add shipping fees onto this model though I think this could become extremely popular especially among female travelers who hate shopping around for shoes during holiday season. I'm sure that once word gets out about this program, more airports will follow suit looking to provide better services to their passengers while also keeping down operational expenses including payroll, taxes etc... Hopefully this trend continues- all sorts of places should take note and come out with their own version too:)",0,516
"A group of startups is using end-to-end learning to teach self-driving cars how to drive. Despite investors sinking more than 100 billion into self-driving car technology, driverless tech is still a long way from being ready for prime time. The big question remains: Will it ever be? And if not, what's the point of all this investment in autonomous vehicles and AI algorithms that can control them - or at least try to? To answer those questions, I spoke with Eric Kiefer, who has been following technological developments around autonomy since he was an engineer 15 years ago on Google X (now known as the moonshot factory). He now runs an advocacy organization called ARK Strategies that helps entrepreneurs navigate these issues. Here are edited excerpts of our conversation about why we need to keep investing in robotic vehicle development even though they might never become mainstream; where people should invest their money when thinking about buying an electric or shared mobility solution for personal transportation; and my favorite quote from his new book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us. I think there's only one thing you could say definitively about autonomous vehicles right now: They won't have enough data to decide which lane to take. We simply don't know whether urban traffic will become faster or slower because humans aren't driving anymore. So whenever a company like Cruise says its software knows exactly where every other human motorist is going before it does, it sounds impressive but also scary. You hear stories in Silicon Valley about companies testing out their fleets by having ridesharing drivers follow each other for months without actually getting paid, just so the network connects itself to existing maps, and then releasing those tests on YouTube. It seems ridiculous, except that some company (Uber?) did do precisely that. None of us wants to see a repeat performance during fully automated self-driving operations - a kind of market failure in which robot-led trucks run over pedestrians and refuse collectors turn back to their homes while holding their smartphones aloft. Right now we don't have enough public safety data to make any decisions about whether all roads will start to look like America circa 1995. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't continue developing advanced technologies like preflighting sensors, active cruise controls, LiDAR, radars, etc., along with pure research on self-driving systems. There's no return until something happens, but technology marches forward regardless. Markets change fast; laws come slowly. Take action today - you may get your shares tomorrow. A sense of urgency. If we don't act urgently, Uber's actions speak volumes."" Some things die quickly, others live forever - John F Kennedy said that in 1962. When JFK made that statement in February 1963, he meant politically dead - or gone down in flames, burnt beyond recognition. Cars were easy targets. Things that didn't fit within the prevailing norms; ideas that seemed too crazy at first glance; risks taken for fun or profit and lost out of ambition, hubris or plain old immaturity. New York wasn't built in a day, nor are most laws written overnight. Rockstar legislation takes decades, sometimes centuries, and requires constant vigilance. Sometimes the worst offenders suffer the quickest demise. As a result, legacy institutions took many years to adapt to the realities of a constantly changing world and went extinct, including entire industries such as the horse carriage business, coal mines, and railroad lines. In short, ebbs and flows occur in everything, throughout history. With respect to the fate of AVs - yes, they're definitely doomed! Technology advances gradually through incremental improvements and rapid obsolescence, precipitated largely by increased customer demand and lower prices. Sophisticated manufacturing processes allow manufacturers to build products quicker, cheaper and better than competitors. Today, the terms ""traditional"" (pickup truck) and ""modern"" (SUV) merely describe the year or two difference between generations of pickupSUVs, rather than differentiating features and capabilities. Not to mention greater efficiencies in consumer electronics and lifestyle enhancements resulting in higher quality, longer lasting items that provide benefits far beyond initial purchase price considerations. Things are destined to always be ""improving."" Unfortunately, the human condition being what it is, there is often resistance against change. That includes government agencies adopting regulations and policies designed to slow innovation. This leads to continued adoption despite clear evidence that new concepts are superior to outdated practices, leading to obsolete modes of operation, expensive maintenance costs and less efficient use of capital assets. In addition to government bureaucrats, many individuals seek validation from peers and society at large for their perceived contributions. Those groups seldom recognize merit outside their own sphere and often cite past success as proof that efforts toward current endeavors must fall flat. As a result, very little good gets done. Furthermore, businesses and organizations wedded to the status quo usually fail miserably when introducing new alternatives to those antiquated methods. Simply put, nobody likes disruption, especially if it acts as the means to separate jar entry parties expectant of value proposition.

"Leaf 3 is a PHP framework for creating web apps and APIs with a clean, simple, and flexible structure. It is powered by an ecosystem of powerful modules with zero global dependencies on each other or the core Leaf3 library that makes it possible to build your app in any language from anywhere! The main features of Leaf include: - An MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework where controllers can be written as classes whose methods deal exclusively with database interactionsqueries, API calls, requests etc., views are updated based on changes made by the model layer and templates like Blade template engine provide a very readable way of generating HTML pages using blade directives which replace parts of the rendered output with variables set within the view, controller or request object. - The ability to easily generate OpenAPI validation definitions using Swagger documents so you get all of these benefits without having to learn yet another JSON schema notation or getting bogged down writing complex XSD files manually. - Easy integration with various databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch via PDO drivers, Doctrine2 ORM integration, Active Record patterns, Riak, redis pubsub and many more! For those who want even greater flexibility, we also have support for several third party libraries such as Eloquent and Laravel Forge through our lightweight dependency injection system. - A package manager for managing your application's dependencies with over 300 packages available out of the box covering everything from strings, arrays to XML parsers and encryption libraries. No need to search around for outdated versions, install one dependency here and there and waste time updating them individually everytime something breaks. - Using Composer allows developers all across the globe to share new ideas and contribute back to projects making Leaf a truly open source project! Documentation You can find documentation about how to use this framework at Most themes will come bundled with basic examples showing exactly what to do next in order to quickly create a Hello World! type application. If not, they're easy enough to figure out yourself if you read carefully. We've tried to make things clear throughout but please let us know if anything seems unclear. Disclaimer 'Leaf3' was created around 2 years ago when I wanted to write my own general purpose MVC framework and decided it could never happen due to limitations within PHP itself limiting its potential in terms of frameworks much less ecosystems surrounding it. Since then however I'm happy to say 'Leaf3' has matured into something I think anyone else should try:) So feel free to fork and contribute back as long as you follow good practice!

"Set Your Day to Music with Productivity Playlists from Setapp. A playlist to help you focus. A playlist to inspire creativity. A playlist to hold your daily standup meeting to. Whatever it is, a productivity playlist can be super helpful when put in the right place at the right time. From my experience as both an extrovert and introvert, I find that music makes me feel better about starting something new or diving into something hard (like studying for exams). Once I'm so engrossed listening and enjoying music while working on a project, it's much easier to go through all of those little tasks required before finishing something off. I get asked this question every day: ""What app should I download? Which one will make me more productive?!"" No matter what kind of apps you have on your device - whether they are used by students like myself or professionals like yourself - there needs to be some form of organization happening within them before they work. For example, if you're going over goals and assignments during study hall, there's no point having any distractions around you because once school starts back up you won't spend half of your free time doing anything else but what you've been assigned to do! We come prepared to learn and grow our minds; we don't need to waste valuable brain power on social media. Therefore, I suggest downloading only 1-2 toolsapps per month and limiting their usage accordingly. If you're feeling overwhelmed by all of the different resources out there then start slowly. After all, nothing good comes easy Tip 1 Downloading Apps Features That Aren't Necessary But Add Value The first major thing I did was limit each category of apps to 2 or 3 types of features and features that served very specific functions. So instead of just downloading programs which were simply great apps that didn't add value to my life, I started downloading ones whose features would enhance how I live my life. Some examples include these categories below: Phone Purity - It's not necessary to use any other phone numbers when using Signal since everything happens solely through the messaging section. Other phones require you to open multiple tabs per number, making this feature useless unless you're constantly switching between communication methods. Telegram Groups - The ability to store files without worrying about being deleted due to layout issues is extremely useful. Plus, you get group chat capabilities, which means you'll always stay connected socially even when you're offline. This was another huge addition after adding Signal since now I never want to lose conversations with friends again. Image by AwesomePixies via Pixabay Organizer App - Without a doubt, Evernote is still my favorite organizer tool on iOS devices. There's almost too many ways to organize information - checklists, tags, notebooks, scheduling, etc. However, additionally enhancing its functionality has kept me coming back to it. From saving articles directly inside Evernote, tagging notes with keywords, finding inspiration from collections like ""learning"" and ""productivity,"" setting reminders, creating documents, creating web pages to embed images onto, managing lists, and finally exporting absolutely anywhere, Evernote gives me unlimited freedom and flexibility whenever possible. Twitter Thread Viewer - In order to keep track of all of the hashtags across various platforms, I've had success just reading threads within Twitter alone. While scrolling down I quickly skim through messages and refer to older tweets that might contain relevant content. Using this method I'm able to save a lot of time previously spent checking multiple sources for similar topics. YouTube Player - Instead of wasting hours browsing videos when bored, trying to decide whether or not a certain video deserves attention, why not let someone who knows what they're talking about interpret your thoughts for you? Rather than watching lectures online, subscribing to vloggers' channels allows us to see exactly what goes behind the scenes when people create entertaining videos. It also provides access to insightful interviews where creators share interesting stories about themselves along with educational tidbits regarding whatever topic they cover. Pinterest Board Organizer - Before discovering Tipsy, link pinning actually seemed complicated. Now I think of it as my best friend. My Pinterest board takes on a whole new meaning when I know I can show everyone the pictures simultaneously to give context to my ideas while expressing gratitude for amazing creations shared by others. Social Media Management Tools - Since Facebook has become such an integral part of modern society, keeping up with posts created against our interests sometimes feels impossible (especially when you forget to logout!). As opposed to getting tangled up in countless notifications from random groups and pages, clearing out unused accounts isn't nearly as difficult. You could use TweetDeck, HootSuite, FB Downers, SimpleSocial, Sysomos, Buffer, Google Personalities and more to automate specific actions depending upon the type of post.

"Origin Space, a Chinese private space resources company, will launch a space mining robot in November. The small satellite will enter a 500-kilometer-altitude sun-synchronous orbit, where it will be testing technologies for several years before returning to Earth with minerals and rare earth elements that can potentially fuel commercial satellites. The first phase of the project will cost about 6 million, according to CEO Lin Jingcheng. ""We are developing the technology as we go along - carrying out experiments all over China so our partners know what works best,"" he says. From there they will begin selling their services on a competitive basis between themselves and other companies such as SpaceX or Blue Origin. In this way, he hopes, one day they could become both suppliers and customers. As new technological developments come online or old ones show wear (such as solar panels), they'd have an inexpensive option for changing up their supply chain even though they might not necessarily want to purchase certain products. Lin is also optimistic about how much progress has been made since his company began working on its first prototype four years ago. Prior to then, no country had successfully launched anything into geostationary orbit, which sits at 36,000 kilometers above Earth and allows satellites to remain fixed in place relative to ground infrastructure despite moving through local time zones. Nowadays, virtually any spacecraft manufacturer can offer the same service and provide coverage around the globe by using multiple rockets if necessary. And while many others may be able to tap into low-Earth orbits such as GPS, most aren't equipped to take advantage of higher altitudes. But future iterations of the NewSpace industry should allow more countries access to these heights.",0,524
"This case study investigates how TikTok created a'fun and addictive' app. The setup can seem a bit tedious, with users having to select from different interests before being shown any content related to them. Whether or not that's the right approach is debatable and depends on what you're trying to do with your product. The app allows for in-app purchases within videos by offering premium versions of its filters, stickers, and themes. Its revenue model has also proven effective: after just 10 months of operation, it pulled in 2 billion in 2018 alone. Moreover, there are plenty of other platforms that allow creators to monetize their work as well through sponsored posts (e.g., Instagram), which means you could choose TikTok instead if this were an option for you. There's no question that such features make the platform more attractive than others when looking at why people use social media - but they aren't necessarily selling points over others like Snapchat Stories or Twitter Moments. It should be noted, however, that while you may only need one feature in order to find success on Facebook, you may need many in order to see significant traction on YouTube where video views don't always translate into increased engagement.",0,525
"Scientists have created a vaccine for cat allergies that trains the immune systems of cats, instead of desensitizing the immune system of people allergic to cats. Hypocat trains the cat's immune system by exposing them to harmless amounts of cat proteins on their skin and inside their bodies. Injecting this vaccine into kittens reduces peri-and postoperative symptoms (eosinophilic granuloma) caused by feline allergy in children who are at risk of developing asthma later in life as adults. The study was published online January 15, 2016 in Translational Medicine. Laura Niederhofer is an Associate Professor in Immunology Microbiology with dual appointments in Dermatology at the University of Minnesota Medical School where she leads studies evaluating methods to prevent or treat allergic diseases including eosinophilic granulomas such as those found in humans exposed to domestic cats and mice with eczema. She also serves as Deputy Director of Research Programs (Dermatologic AllergyImmunology Program). ""The current gold standard of treatment for eosinophiloma remains highly invasive surgical excision,"" said Dr. Niederhofer. They must not only remove nonhealing lesions but extract tissue from areas away from vital anatomical structures."" Cats bring joy to millions of families around the world. But they can be hazardous when living near houses where someone has been diagnosed with serious food allergies. This creates a problem: how can you keep your kitten out of harm's way? Fortunately, there may soon be a solution - if it works well enough. A new animal model shows promise for testing vaccines against IgE antibodies specific to certain foods. When tested on healthy human volunteers, two doses weakened these undesirable antibodies so much that it might help make existing vaccination therapy more effective. And because its mechanism differs significantly from other allergy treatments currently being used, it could lead directly to safer therapies for treating severe reactions from accidental exposure to allergens like peanuts and shellfish. A team led by geneticist David Huber, Ph.D., professor of biological sciences in UT Austin's McKinnon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, recently developed a method to disrupt genes using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which work much like Cas9 protein does in bacteria. CRISPR uses DNA sequence information stored within viral genomes to target and destroy any gene for which researchers specify a change would make animals healthier or less susceptible to disease. We know that disrupting particular genes makes mice better protected against influenza virus infection; perhaps someday we will learn whether similar changes improve our ability to fight off allergy attacks. Researchers modified their technique by packaging multiple pairs of guide RNA strands together as single long molecules called ribonucleoprotein complexes, or RNPs. These RNP constructs were then introduced into T cells taken from mouse blood samples. After about three weeks without the need of further outside intervention, half of the engineered T cells were able to completely turn off their native form of the Fc receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI alpha subunit) while the remaining cells began expressing levels of the targeted Fcepsilon RIalpha equivalent to what occurs naturally after birth. ""This overcomes one of the main hurdles in making strong therapeutics targeting IgE production, since local recruitment of mast cell precursors requires high numbers of pre-existing IgE-producing B cells. Our approach allows us to bypass that step entirely and direct therapeutic modification in vivo during early stages of development before mature serum IgE concentrations become established,"" says Huber, senior author of the paper describing this research in Nature Biotechnology. Previous efforts to develop anti-IgE drugs have failed due to overly broad effects achieved with monovalent biologics. While some researchers question the validity of data supporting the efficacy of monomeric IgE antibody therapies for elimination of allergenic reactivity in patients, others remain optimistic that improved understanding of mechanisms regulating IgE synthesis will some day yield safe and effective medications capable of preventing or reversing this debilitating condition. Until then, nature provides a unique alternative to trying to arrest this potentially fatal autoimmune self-attack. As one example, scientists working in Austria have successfully bred dogs genetically altered so that they produce no natural IgE and therefore do not suffer adverse responses to common allergens. Importantly, however, these changes appear to negatively affect other aspects of dog health, leading to reduced lifespan and fertility. For now, not everyone agrees that genetically engineering organisms should ever be made available for human consumption. It took decades for researchers to build up momentum toward approval based upon extensive safety trials involving tens of thousands of animals across dozens of species. Recent events suggest FDA regulators may take an even slower pace moving forward. Last year, former head of FDA Michael Taylor warned Congress that President Obama had threatened to delay regulations until after his term expired unless lawmakers backed down from imposing stricter rules on manufacturers releasing genetically modified plants and animals.

"Scientists from Stanford have posted the mRNA sequence that powers the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on GitHub. The scientists sequenced the mRNA using samples obtained from discarded vaccines. No vaccines were used in making this particular mRNA, but companies are already planning to use it for their own vaccines. The new study was published today by Nature Biotechnology and is led by Dr. Jiaxing Huang who heads multiple research groups at Stanford including a lab called Vaxilab which has developed several modern antivirals as well as one of the first successful HIVAIDS treatments. Dr. Huang said: ""This work shows us how to get all of the information contained within an infectious virus into our cells - where we now can do remarkable things with them."" Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MODRN) announced plans last week to begin testing its Phase 1 clinical trial for COVID-19 on April 18th after the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization granted by President Trump earlier this year. Last month Moderna formed a partnership with pharmaceutical giant Merck Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), to develop its lead drug candidate mCOVRLX-Seq, or SC1. In a press release announcing the collaboration, Jonathan Reed, senior vice president, global development programs at Merck stated: ""Today marks another milestone toward developing and bringing to market a safe, effective treatment against SARS-CoV2."" By partnering up with Moderna, Merck will be able to more quickly access the company's proprietary platform technology designed specifically for nucleic acid delivery. Merck also signed Abbott Laboratories, LLC, AstraZeneca PLC and GlaxoSmithKline plc to collaborate on 'vaccine candidates' targeting COVID-19. Earlier this year Merck received regulatory approval to test remdesivir, a novel anti-viral medication known to kill off viruses like Ebola. It is being tested on patients infected with both MERS and NDM-1 bacteria resistant strains of E. Coli. Remdesivir was initially licensed by GSK under the name GS-5734 but did not make it past phase 2 human trials. Its recent licensing agreement with Merck made production of the drug accessible outside China where manufacturing costs skyrocketed when the original license holder went bankrupt. In March of 2019 Remdesivir joined a class of other drugs that failed to make it through large randomized double blind studies conducted by researchers around the globe due to results indicating they didn't improve outcomes in severely ill patient populations. According to Moderna's website, mCOVRLX-Seq encodes four viral genes known to bind antibodies generated during natural infection. Together these four proteins induce ""broad neutralization"" - i.e. binding to many different types of coronavirus - on entry to target host cell receptors. This technique is similar to what is done in creating live attenuated vaccines such as those produced by Sanofi Pasteur or Pfizer that mimic childhood vaccination so people naturally produce antibodies to later protect themselves from re-infection. While most current efforts aimed at producing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine involve evolving genetic material from existing animal models via reverse genetics techniques, Modernata does offer an alternative approach. Instead of selecting and amplifying specific mutations responsible for infectivity, Dr. Huang and his team sequenced RNA directly extracted from virions found inside the nose swabs taken from people diagnosed with COVID-19. According to the paper, the data was then translated and assembled into a full length genome assembly. He said: ""We bypassed months and years of time consuming selection processes in favor of getting straight to the point. We took advantage of the fact that every single virus particle contains identical copies each containing a unique genome sequence; that makes sequencing millions of particles trivial. And once you've got the sequences, assembling the genomes from fragments is just about putting together Lego blocks. You don't need any prior knowledge of the structure of the gene. All you really need to know is whether there are gaps between adjacent pieces."" He added: ""I hope that this method is widely adopted because it takes care of all three major bottlenecks holding back progress towards a universal flu prevention strategy - cost, speed and safety. I believe the latter two will become increasingly important over the next decade, given that worldwide influenza activity remains low even though expectations suggest otherwise. While encouraging news abounds regarding advances in preventing rare events such as SARS-CoVs and bird flue H5N6 infections, the lowest hanging fruit continues to elude us. Better tools to prevent pandemic disease are urgently needed."" Dr. Huang noted that their findings may enable rapid adaptation of the same process to design safer COVID-19 therapies if subsequent use proves necessary. They could also accelerate identification of targets for therapeutic intervention as they apply the technology to larger scale screening of existing compounds for possible new uses.

"Using machine learning to analyze chest X-rays is difficult because the clinical labels required to train these algorithms are obtained through rule-based natural language processing or human annotation, both of which can result in errors. The most common error type we observed was a failure to classify electronic health records (EHR) patients as having pneumonia when radiologists diagnosed them with ""pneumonia not otherwise specified."" We hypothesized that this misclassification could occur because our training data did not include cases where it appeared clinically typical for an EHR patient without pneumonia symptoms to be labeled by the radiologist as having pneumonia at the time of the radiology study rather than another diagnosis. For example, if an individual had cough and congestion but no fever over 30 degrees C on exam room admission, they would still have been considered symptomatic enough for their preadmission diagnosis code to reflect pneumonia; however, they would be missing the imaging findings suggestive of consolidation associated with interstitial pneumonitis.",0,532

"Elon Musk has told several of his close friends and associates that he is planning to move to Texas. Musk put his Californian houses on the market and expanded operations in Southern California, where Tesla's new Gigafactory will be built with Panasonic. He also moved some employees from Canada to this side of the border in reaction to UAW negotiations. Now the company has opened a second office for its ""Tesla Energy Group"" (TEG) at 4700 Walnut Hill Lane near downtown Dallas, according to media reports as well as photos posted on Twitter by TEG employee Jason Hollinger. The building was previously occupied by 3M until 2009 and then primarily used as an adult day care center. It sits adjacent to 6735 Oakwood Ave., which houses Elon Musk's private residence. Some short-term rentals are being offered through VRBO or Airbnb. The only real question about whether he will actually do it seems to be when: Musk said last month that if he had gone ahead with plans for his space colony, it would have cost 10 billion - far more than he expected. But he'll spend less now and can easily afford whatever it costs him to come back. On Monday, SpaceX published an update showing analysts' projections of future revenue, profit margins and cash generation with about half again as many launches planned over the next five years, indicating the firm could become profitable within two to three years. An important factor here is how much help (or hindrance!) moves like that might be given by local governments. Earlier today I wrote a post about Texas cities and towns giving incentives worth tens of millions of dollars based on aerospace manufacturing - particularly related to landing rockets at their facilities. In general these sorts of deals tend to benefit existing companies who provide goods and services to those industries, but might not lead to all that great economic development if you don't happen to reside in one of them. Of course there's no reason why they couldn't be structured so as to encourage newcomers instead ... if such folks want them. That may very well be what Musk wants. Not everyone compares things to Silicon Valley though; we're talking about government money after all! One thing worth pointing out is that while industrial parks and tax breaks are sometimes attractive inducements for businesses to stay somewhere rather than leave, they aren't always necessary even desirable. If someone else is willing to build your productservice for you, it doesn't make sense for that business to go elsewhere just because you pay lower taxes than they did. And even supposing you were providing something unique, turning down offers for factory sites is standard operating procedure anyway. For example, Google didn't really need Austin to get started making search engines - indeed ""fictitious"" ones were already available. Likewise, Facebook has been able to expand into numerous other locations around the world without any massive incentive packages on offer. So long as people keep offering markets and customers, tech startups continue to succeed despite low barriers to entry in most places. Companies end up expanding outwards regardless of location, assuming they still serve enough global demand. When Tesla announced its initial plan to open a Texas facility earlier this year, CEO Elon Musk claimed that the giga-plant represented a first step towards an eventual Martian settlement. Now, in April 2016, NASA officials confirmed that Mars One intends to send humans to the red planet starting in 2025. But counting on technology alone isn't good enough: even if Mars' surface conditions made human life sustainable, getting a group of talented individuals together to start working on establishing a permanent society poses significant challenges. According to Rob Skirving of Microsoft Research, as cited by Fortune magazine, the first problem involves figuring out what exactly everybody should work on. Is some person better off studying math? Or writing software code? How about designing spacesuits? What happens once each task becomes too specialized? Then comes managing expectations: when approximately 100 volunteers get selected, most won't understand everything going into it. Still others will assume they'll be among the lucky few. Beyond that, Mars needs infrastructure: transportation systems must exist somehow, even if merely to deliver supplies between communities. This kind of thought experiment helps shed light on some awkward aspects of Mars colonization. Going forward, let's say you establish communication with Martians. Maybe you contact them via radio waves, maybe via lasers, or perhaps using some entirely different method altogether. All that matters is the message transmitted. Do you broadcast the same information as every other mission, sending every single detail and factoid along? Would they prefer to hear a novel story or listen to you talk politics? Are certain subjects simply either irrelevant or dangerous to discuss in advance? Can you safely assume that whoever gets the job is capable of handling those issues themselves? As noted above, Skirving suggests addressing each issue individually, allowing individuals plenty of time to develop expertise before anyone else notices anything amiss. This way problems arise organically and quickly resolve themselves amongst others outside your own party. Even if you've selected persons with a tonal preference, the selection process tends to select persons who place focuses genuine intent to have passed the part itself has no longer",0,538
"Large and mysterious land carvings have been discovered in India's Thar Desert. The geoglyphs may be the largest-ever graphical depictions designed by humans. They were discovered using Google Earth during an expedition led by Colorado State University researcher Praveen Patel, PhD, who is also a professor of biology at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., and director of research for the nonprofit organization GPS Quest International. ""There are hundreds or even thousands more to find,"" Patel said about these amazing artworks that scientists believe date back 1,000 years before Christ. ""We found them right here on our doorstep."" The discovery raises questions about how human beings managed to create so many large-scale images from the ground up without modern technology that exists today. Conventional wisdom holds that such works would require extensive time (about 100 years), great skill and huge amounts of water - all ingredients not evident in this region where arid conditions prevail year round. No one knows if the images pre-date the first travelers through the area between 500 BC and AD 1500. But their origin has always puzzled archaeologists because they can't explain why someone went to the trouble of carving out such elaborate designs when there was no apparent reason for doing so; it appears as though they were simply made to last forever. There are 3-D versions of each figure, which show distinctly different body types and facial characteristics than other known Indian desert drawings etched into rock surfaces. Each face features two eyes, but one pair seems much larger than the other with a corresponding oddity in mouth position. ""It looks like they're smiling,"" Dr. David Meltzer told CBS News correspondent Bob Simon. A team of researchers look over the figures, including David Meltzer, left, Richard MacKenzie, center, and John Ristow, right, after finding giant petroglyphs near Junagadh, Gujarat state, western India. CBS As you walk around these curious scenes some observers might remark: 'What could possibly make people spend hours making art? It doesn't seem worth it unless there is something important hidden behind those pictures,' or maybe it's just beautiful in its own way?"" says MacKenzie. In fact the meaning of the enigmatic etchings remains largely unknown, so it should come as no surprise that little scientific work had ever been done until now. What we do know is that they are approximately three feet tall and seven to 15 feet long - which should give us pause, considering average heights and lengths of 16th century Europeans. These particular figures appear less likely to be standing warriors, considered the most common form of image among ancient peoples of the subcontinent, than pioneers wearing caps and holding tools shining bright against the dark desert background. Some smaller faces suggest that perhaps women held positions of prominence within the society depicted. Whether the divas represented gods, kings or queens remains uncertain. And what exactly the images symbolize still eludes scholars. Multiple theories exist concerning possible meanings, ranging from celestial bodies to animals and birds to hunting implements. Dr. Vasant Shinde examines a carved stone formation near Jaisalmer, Rajastan, India. CBS About 40 miles north of Agra, Nizamuddin Dargah lies sleepy city of Varanasi along the Ganges River. This holy shrine attracts several millions of Muslim pilgrims every day. Although there are literally dozens of shrines throughout India dedicated solely to Islam worshipers places very similar to the Great Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia none attract such enormous crowds like this famous mosque located deep inside a small forested valley. Known locally as Har ki Pauri Waterfall Of Feet, the complex consists of four square buildings surrounded by gardens of trees and plants. A series of courtyards lead visitors down through winding corridors leading to multiple mosques, mausoleums and tombs dating from early medieval times to recent centuries. Like the rest of northern India, the building styles vary throughout the country, but some structures are remarkably well preserved despite nearly two millennia passing since construction began: With red sandstone walls adorned with intricate patterns, the compound resembles a miniature version of the Taj Mahal, built entirely by hand. Its fame grew when Islamic Republic founder Muhammed Ali Jinnah visited during his exile in 1942 and declared this location to be the site of future free-will pilgrimage sites. The popularity increased further following the death of Pakistani hockey player Muhammad Ali Jinnah in 1948. Today the village contains 20 temples housing tombstones displaying inscriptions from the 14th Century while across town sits another temple whose ruins date back to 450BC.

"Google announced a 5.5-inch Pixel 3 and a 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL for 799 and 899 respectively (available on October 18th). It is also rolling out Google Duplex (the cool AI assistant) to users of the Assistant app who have enabled it in their settings. You can test if you're ready for this feature by clicking your profile icon, then Settings Advanced. The ""Smart Accurate Assistant"" option should be turned ON. Not all people will want or need this so don't feel bad about turning off when you get used to Google. This new capability isn't actually available yet but most are able to give us some insight into how it might work. Here's what we know until more information becomes available: Can I Talk To My Phone? Can my phone talk back to me? Yes! You can now tell your smartphone things like ""When was my last text message?"" or even ask about your email with responses such as, ""I sent an email earlier today from [youremail]."" All you need do is open up the Google App and say those words aloud after tapping on one of the suggestions that appear below the search box. Also try telling Google something absurd Ask me anything - it'll respond with humorous quips every time, including 'funny' ones that aren't really true. On iPhone Android, hit the microphone button and speak while holding down on the home screen tile; see above image for example. Be careful though because Google may confuse your questions for commands issued out loud which could disrupt other Siri functions or cause apps (like games) to take over your device state so remember to only use voice input if there is no pressing reason not too. What If I Say Something Surprising? Users will notice that saying certain phrases comes with a response. For instance, the question, ""Who wants pancakes?,"" brings up options like ""Me!"" However, instead of just returning that answer, users may hear remarks like, ""Why yes, thank you,"" if they're using an earbud headset connected to Chromecast Audio. At least two tech sites report hearing similar results - Google has confirmed these incidents where user headphones were plugged in via Twitter. Customers who reported having trouble receiving audio messages during testing said they received feedback through loudspeaker sounds without any problems. We've been told that Assistant works best when connecting with wired headsets or speakers since wireless connections tend to go silent when speaking. One drawback here is that it cannot connect wirelessly unless the speakerheadset has Google Cast built-in, otherwise there's no battery life advantage. How Do These Answers Work? Lets start at the beginning - What happens inside Google's servers? When you ask Assistant a simple question like, How many stars are in the Galaxy?, she looks around her database of knowledge to find matches. Then instead of giving you an exact number, she tells you something along the lines of, ""There are billions of galaxies in our universe. Most contain hundreds to thousands of millions of suns. Your galaxy is called Milky Way despite containing trillions of star systems."" In addition to basic facts, the software understands context and gives better answers based on its understanding of a situation. So if someone asks you, Who won Wimbledon 2016?, Google knows tennis fans often follow local players in limited tournaments. She would therefore offer links to ATP rankings, match schedules, scores and headlines. Does Google plan to expand beyond searching within apps? Of course. Though Assistant doesn't understand everything humans can think of, in fact it never expects to surpass human capabilities because it must keep itself functional and responsive in real-time. As stated before, assistants usually operate much faster than people as well. (Though Chinese companies already support digitized voices.) There's currently no word regarding plans to implement voice control outside of Google Search and YouTube though company execs did stress they expect to make progress within the next year. Eventually, Assistant hopes to handle tasks and queries across appliances, devices, websites, etc. Note That none of this suggests that people are losing jobs to robots anytime soon (yet), but smart machines are becoming smarter all the time. And manufacturers like Samsung are adding artificial intelligence features directly into its products, rather than trying to shoehorn them into phones via smartphones updates.

"Researchers from London have developed a deep neural network that can determine a person's emotional state by analyzing wireless signals. The technique involves sending radio signals towards targets and measuring how much of the signal is reflected back in order to deduce what emotions or moods they are feeling, such as anger, happiness or frustration. The team says their model could be used for purposes including home security systems while also helping people with mental health issues via spot-on psychotherapy. It could even help patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease monitor whether medication has been effective. Dr. Michael Barnett at University College London (UCL) said: ""Our machine learning approach provides an objective measure of mood which we believe will find use in many different areas of health care - although it may initially prove useful in psychiatry, where there remains no widely accepted standard method for assessing patient wellbeing.""

"The Planetary Society, an organization founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, is sending a small spacecraft to orbit the planet. Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite will test out solar sails in space for future missions to Mars or even interplanetary travel through interstellar space. Related: Top 10 Ways We'll Colonize Space In The Next 50 Years ""LightSail2 was born from our desire to explore new frontiers,"" says Jim Benford, president of the society. ""We're not looking at just one destination."" [See more photos of the Apollo 11 moon landing] The group has been working on the project since 2009 in partnership with NanoRacks under NASA's New Frontiers program. LightSails are thin panels made up of woven carbon nanotubes covered with reflective material that catch sunlight like sails catching wind. (For comparison, it takes about 7 million metric tons of force to move 1 cubic meter across Earth's surface.) Once they reach speeds around 4 miles per second (7 kms), the tiny satellites switch off their engines and rely solely on momentum to keep going. This makes them ideal candidates for visiting other planets, especially ones with thick atmospheres - including Venus and Jupiter, which have thick clouds. But light-pressure also limits how fast a sail can go without hitting something. Unlike some previous generation of solar sail vehicles, such as Helios II, which had only a few grams worth of sail surface area, LightSail 2 has 44 square meters (460 sq ft). That should provide plenty of room for scientific experiments and guidance technology, along with powering systems needed to house onboard electronics, communications equipment, navigation sensors, cameras, thrusters and batteries. Story continues When launched into orbit from Florida atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket this year, the solar sail system would separate from the main payload. It then pivots to face the sun in order to draw power. Lightsail 2's roughly 3x3 feet (1 x 1 m) shape won't be able to withstand the rigors of deep space indefinitely; after all, no self-respecting space probe survives launch intact. Eventually, its designers say, the craft may need to detach itself from its mother ship and hitchhike towards another object like Saturn's moons Titan or Enceladus, where gravitational nudge could boost it to escape velocity. And while that might seem daunting, once the mission gets started there really isn't much stopping the craft. After next summer's launch, scientists plan to monitor the device remotely until late 2016 when it reaches 200,000 mph, according to Margaret Coker, vice president of engineering and operations at NanoRack. At that point, if everything goes well, the team plans to command LightSail 2 back down toward Earth.That part involves firing retro rockets beneath the vehicle. These can push LightSail2 away from the booster and send it hurtling back down to Earth.Once safely above the atmosphere, the craft will deploy three parachutes into a gentle descent over Australia before landing near Perth. According to Benford, most of the craft's mass shouldn't fall too far short of 100 lbs (45 kg); any additional weight added during construction will likely make disposal easier. NASA's two Voyager space probes already demonstrated what happened when a lightweight sail hit the vacuum outside the solar system. Both came within thousands of kilometers (miles) of reaching Pluto in 1990, but bounced off instead due to atmospheric drag. Onboard instruments actually recorded data confirming the maneuver, providing information showing why planets like Neptune don't host moons despite having large amounts of hydrogen gas. The experiment inspired many researchers to try different ways of traveling between stars. One of those projects resulted in Breakthrough Starshot, announced last June, funded by Yuri Milner, Elon Musk and Peter Diamandis. Like LightSail 2, the proposed vessel uses reflectorized sails held aloft by electromagnetic winds. Unlike the Planetary Society's design though, which relies mostly on kinetic energy alone, Starshot's sailcraft will use lasers to energize themselves and generate thrust.

"A researcher from the Swiss research institute EMPA has developed an invisible lock system that uses conductive ink on a transparent polymer film to create invisible buttons. The result is a ""soft touch"" surface, which could be used for everything from touchscreen computers and cellphone displays to smart packaging. After five years of intensive development work by a group led by Bernhard Vollbrecht at EMPA, the scientists have succeeded in developing a new type of two-dimensional (2D) locking technology - one based on extremely thin layers of intermetallic compounds rather than magnetic materials or optical films. Individual metallic elements are embedded between sheets of polymers during production; these are then firstly heated up using thermocouples until they separate in order to reveal their internal structure as individual components - like tiny tubes filled with coloured liquid. These parts can later be connected again when required through laser welding. This method makes it possible to produce 2D structures whose complexity outstrips anything previously achieved. In addition to this technical breakthrough, making visible electronic modules in thin form means not only being able to incorporate them into products but also to combine different functions within one module - that is to say, for example, imaging sensors combined with electrical contact strips without any additional connection methods. So far, very few researchers are pursuing the use of metal nanostructures in electronics since such applications remain largely unexplored: however, Professor Vollbrecht believes his approach will open up entirely novel areas of application. Indeed, he predicts there will soon be no need for conventional mechanical contacts whatsoever if all we want is to transmit information over complex networks. They would simply become visual signals. Likewise, conventional display covers would lose much of their function. He points out that nobody today wants light bulbs anymore because fluorescent lighting is so commonplace that people don't see its lack of aesthetics. Why should contactless data transmission not be regarded in exactly the same way? What we dream about now is something completely different!

"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has created a 2 billion fund called the Day One Fund to help homeless families and create a network of nonprofit preschools in low-income communities. It 's an admirable effort, but it could be better if he used his influence to do more for these children now. The preschools will start with 100 million from the Day One Fund. And as anyone who knows anything about philanthropy knows, that'll never get you very far. The problem is that they can only accept proposals - there is no timeline on when or how long any given grant might last. There are also limits on which nonprofits qualify: They have to be based in ""low-income communities where homelessness poses one of the greatest threats to the well-being of young people,"" according to their website. AD AD There aren't many organizations like this around because wealthy donors often don't want to invest in something that won't produce results immediately. That isn't usually the case at colleges where students pay tuition years in advance; instead, admissions counselors tell them to look ahead three to five years while saving money so they can afford college in the future. But, unlike those kids applying to schools whose parents make six figures per year, these families shouldn't wait decades before getting financial aid and starting early education. What would happen if Amazon gave each child below poverty level 1,000 right away? Or what if other companies did the same thing? Imagine all the social problems we could address today! We already know that childhood development programs improve academic performance (and IQ) in even poor neighborhoods later in life. If I were Bezos, I'd give every kid 5,500 bucks today rather than waiting until adulthood. Probably not enough to move the needle in terms of income inequality, but maybe we'll figure out some way to use technology to measure success over time with this kind of data collection. Either way, it's worth experimenting with new solutions that could work much faster and cost less than going down the traditional route of government subsidies, adoption agencies and private foundations. It makes sense for us adults to think about giving back, too. After all, the median wealth among working Americans age 65 is just under 250,000 thanks largely to Social Security benefits. This means older Americans likely live longer and spend most of their retirement savings building up assets, leaving younger generations without resources unless they save after they reach certain milestones like 25 and 35. These numbers may sound generous compared to our own family (or friends), but, where should everyone draw the line between supporting themselves and helping others? You probably don't need to donate half your paycheck forever, but perhaps 10 percent of your salary wouldn't go amiss for a few years. AD AD Because Bezos doesn't plan to support preschools completely through contributions, he needs to find other ways to raise funds. He can ask corporations to match donations, require employees to contribute, sell stock andor add fees to service charges. That said, I love Bezos' approach much more than asking Congress to hand him 2B plus interest. Even though everything will be public information, it gives me hope that investors believe helping disadvantaged kids is valuable.",0,551
"Japan's terrain doesn't allow for forests of wind turbines or fields of solar panels, so Japanese engineers are looking to ocean currents for renewable energy.

"Google's DeepMind AI team has successfully trained its software to control a tokamak. Small reactors like tokamaks use software to monitor the state of the plasma they contain and respond by adjusting their magnetic fields, providing fuel for nuclear fusion power generation. The machine learning systems that train these programs work best when fed lots of data from previous runs on similar machines, but most researchers thought it was difficult to get enough simulation time to learn how big tokamaks behave in real-world conditions - until now. Google's team developed new programming tools and techniques that allowed them to run simulations at sustained rates of 700 trillion operations per second using a single eight teraflop processor, which is about 95 times more than what we typically see today used in supercomputers or even large clusters that can be found in universities and companies worldwide. ""This project provides an example where people have been able to find novel ways of solving some really tough computational challenges,"" says Douglas MacLatchy, chief scientist with MIT's Plasma Science Center who wasn't involved with this research. ""We always say there are no'silver bullets', but maybe in physics there still might be one."" Right now, IBM scientists are working to put together a tokamak simulator called Guided Mesh Refinement (GMR) that will simulate physical geometries to create sharp boundaries between different regions inside a reactor while allowing fluid flow through those spaces. This means you could more easily perform detailed experiments with steady flows, which would allow researchers to study complex interactions across multiple spatial scales, said Alexander Kuranov, lead developer for GMR at IBM Research - Zurich during a presentation last month at the American Physical Society meeting in San Francisco. The idea behind simulating the full geometry of a tokomak comes courtesy of UCSF professor Vaclav Petitjean; he created code to track particles as they moved around and appeared to collide within videos of particle collisions. Those results led him to conclude that computers needed to model the entire environment if they were going to accurately predict experimental outcomes. IBM provided funding toward developing a system capable of performing many thousands of computer simulated tests each day while also capturing and analyzing the information gleaned from all such tests simultaneously. It appears that success with their efforts may be getting closer thanks to two papers posted online recently describing recent advances made towards accomplishing that goal: ""A GPU Cluster For Simulation Of Tokamak Plasmas With Classically Motivated Particle Tracers And Reconnection Detection Algorithms,"" by Atsushi Morikawa et al., published in IEEE Transactions On Applied Superconductivity Vol. 28 No. 1 in February 2018, and ""Simulation of Tokamak Dynamics Using Hybrid MultiGPUCPU Architecture Based on CUDA Technology,"" by Miho Koga, Yosuke Matsumoto, Tetsuya Uesugi, Nobuo Takahashi, Shigeki Tomita and Masayuki Sato, published in TOPICS In High Performance Computing Programming Letters Volume 8 Issue 9 in September 2017. These studies document important improvements that make it possible for researchers to do much larger scale testing of their ideas for tokamak design optimization. But before we dive into details regarding both papers, let's first recap what the current status looks like in terms of the dominant players in this space right now. Supercomputers Are Not Enough Today, computing resources usually fall into three categories: public clouds, academic institutions, and corporate giants. Public clouds provide enormous amounts of compute capacity globally accessible via web interfaces, making them useful for running massive processing tasks because users don't need to buy hardware upfront. Academic centers tend to leverage high performance architectures like GPUs and specialized accelerators rather than traditional CPUs, but their focus is often broadening scientific knowledge instead of building applications. Only giant corporations like Amazon offer ample numbers of CPU cores available at relatively low prices. Usually, when people talk about networking capabilities, they mean bandwidth rather than raw number of ports. While having plenty of network connections isn't necessarily necessary for parallelization purposes, you want those links to be very fast so you don't waste time waiting for packets to move over long distances. Academic and corporate installations tend to rely heavily on conventional hardware configurations. These take advantage of threads on multicore x86 processors known as hyperthreading technology, which effectively multiplies core counts up to 16 (4 pairs). They also exploit special purpose devices built specifically for managing memory and executing computations, such as graphics cards. As shown below, a typical cluster configuration includes several hundred server nodes with hundreds to perhaps tens of thousands of individual sockets. While these storage node types aren't cheap, they cost only 1,000-3,000 apiece compared to costs associated with renting dedicated cloud servers ranging from 25 per hour to upwards of 150 per hour depending on size and location.

"Cows at the RusMoloko dairy farm near Moscow in Russia wear VR headsets to improve their conditions and to enable them to relax into producing more milk. Data from farms such as this could help identify ways of improving animal welfare It's not just humans who can benefit from virtual reality technology - cows are also getting a taste for it. At least three Russian dairies have created games using virtual reality applications that they say make animals happier, healthier, fatter...and more productive. The idea is simple: by immersing cattle wearing goggle-like devices into simulated environments, farmers hope old behaviours will be replaced with new ones, and problems like mastitis and overfeeding problems will become less common staples on factory farms. Although some companies claim these experiences may, eventually, lead to meat grown without antibiotics or hormones made fat by eating nothing but kale, there are no studies yet available showing any positive result after two years of use, according to Andrei Gartenberg, CEO of software company Metaio Spatial Technologies. ""To prove anything [about these apps], you need a randomized control trial ... so far we don't know if what people see through these systems actually has an effect on their behaviour."" But while Gartenberg doubts the benefits are immediate, he says current research suggests that within months of using the technologies, herd performance improves significantly and will continue to do so over time. In other words, he thinks the solutions aren't completely foolproof, but he notes that those tests were conducted mainly with dairy cows rather than beef cows which generally study harder - leading some researchers question whether results apply equally across species. Some experts even suggest the same app designed to increase a cow's weight might reduce its productivity instead. Virtual Reality: The Farm Experience In June 2013, RusMolokonovo was one of four large dairy farms that formed Holocom Group and began testing out the concept with a pilot run. Today, hundreds of cows have been fitted with head mounted displays (HMD) as part of a long term project funded by IBM Research Labs called Beyond Real Farming. Inside each HMD a cow user gets immersed into several virtual worlds that show her different views of how she lives. There's a small paradise landscape where visitors feed nutritious grasses to each other; another shows off a lush meadow full of poppies whose scent encourages reproduction; and finally a forest scene where cows loll about looking closely groomed before being released back into their herds. All of these scenes encourage good behavior because the experience makes users feel comfortable enough to indulge every day habits like grazing when they normally wouldn't. Dairy farmer Svetlana Alekseeva said that initially she thought the whole thing would fail. But now she says after eight weeks putting her first batch of 150 cows through the program, none of the animals had fallen sick since the treatment started, despite living under harsh conditions at times. She credits the change to improved feeding practices among other things. Alekseeva believes the success has led managers at other big Russian farms to adopt similar programs for their own herds. Herd sizes vary widely between 10,000 and 40,000 cows depending upon region. At the beginning, both Aleksander Sevastyanov and Vladimir Grigoriev ran experiments only with groups of 20 cows - they found that even smaller groups responded better to the system. Since then, though, they've opened up access to larger groupings too. It seems the effects are cumulative. A video posted online showed a bull named Sasha enjoying himself in his virtual world during calving season. Now fully recovered from surgery, he enjoyed browsing around peacefully until someone came along to point him towards food and water. As soon as he got going, however, Sasha took off running round trying to tell everyone else where all the best grass patches were. He didn't care how fast he went; he wasn't alone anymore. His attempts to communicate, along with rubbing noses together, helped create bonds amongst the calves. They became friends spending hours playing together before heading home, often accompanied by a calf mama. Sasha calved last year thanks to one application used at RusMoloka. Photo credit Dmitry Melnichenko While RusMoloko's VR cheese processing facility isn't due to open until next spring, the production team already uses the tech extensively. A further experiment includes a sauna simulation intended for cows when temperatures start dropping below zero. Each barn holds about 50 cows and six staff members play each game separately and adjust timing accordingly based on feedback. While traditional management focuses on keeping individual animals healthy, the effort here centers on creating optimal health for a collective purpose.

"India shut down the internet in the state of Assam during protests against a new citizenship rule. The Citizenship Amendment Bill, which creates a pathway for citizenship for minorities in India from Muslim-majority Bangladesh and Pakistan, has stoked tensions across several states - including West Bengal where what began as a peaceful protest quickly escalated into violent clashes between police and supporters of Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress party. Here are some key things to know about how this unfolded: What sparked violence? The Trinamool chief was not happy with the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill when it came up for discussion before Parliament on 16 December 2017. She took her concerns directly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with other opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi who she believed were ""partners"" in their fight against the bill. In an address at Patna University campus, Ms Banerjee said that she had conveyed these views to Mr Gandhi through Manish Tewari, his media advisor. ""I told him why I wanted my MPs opposed to the CAB... I have even taken part in discussions regarding the issue... We have always been partners,"" he quoted her as saying. According to Hindu Sena president Pramod Muthalik, Ms Banerjee called off talks with party allies over passing the legislation after sending out press statements aimed at portraying herself as being opposed to its passage. At one point, she is understood to have suggested that if Mr Modi did not listen, then all alliance parties should walk out of the ruling coalition. It's unclear how exactly this led to massive demonstrations across the country but there are reports of sloganeering by members of the BJP government in New Delhi cheering those protesting. By 20 January 2018, the day the Lok Sabha passed the controversial law, mobs gathered outside parliament demanding protection and support for people facing arrest due mass arrests under Section 144 CrPC. Many more joined them later. In Bengaluru, thousands of protesters clashed with police while in Kolkata today hundreds of people turned out en masse. Here's what happened so far.

Right-wing groups, primarily backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have repeatedly attempted to pass similar bills since 2002. All failed because they faced stiff resistance at every step from stakeholders ranging from the Centre (which controls laws promulgated by governments) to various regional states. But having successfully got wider political backing, the current move now faces major opponents too. Opposition voices include both the Left Front and the UPA II Ministry of Home Affairs led by Amit Shah, the leader of the ruling party; besides citizens and civil society organisations representing different religious communities in India, also Supreme Court lawyers, academics and constitutional experts. Even former Chief Justice Dipak Misra has spoken out against it despite being home minister himself while senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan has filed anticipatory bail applications seeking relief for individuals expected to face detention under section 4 (2) (b) of the Citizenship Act. Civil rights activists say the rationale behind the Citizenship Act of 1948, which grants Indian nationality to non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries, is justifiably based on security considerations. They cite examples such as large-scale refugee influxes affecting stability in Kashmir or increasing infiltration attempts from militants into India from across the border. Critics argue the proposed amendments could amount to illegal discrimination on grounds of religion, violating Article 14 of the constitution. ""This amendment is motivated exclusively for reasons of domestic politics rather than providing any reasonable justification. This practice of making inflammatory speeches targeting minority community without empirical basis only increases communal tension and can lead to dangerous events,"" says Advocate Gopinath Pillai, convenor of People's Union For Democratic Rights (PUDR). He adds, given past experience, tensions in northeast India are likely to increase once the sanctuary period granted to residents from certain north east states ends.

"When you want to edit something using an online tool today, you usually have to upload the file to the tool by selecting the file or dragging it into your browser window.

"SAGA's LUNARK is a habitat designed to help people live on the lunar surface. It has a carbon fiber shell that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to stand up, but collapses when gravity takes over and they are needed for space travel. SagAga Lunar Orbital Structure (LUNAR) The design of this structure was inspired by Chinese paper folding techniques called Origamis. This style of construction uses layers upon layers of folded materials to create complex shapes. Most commonly used today are book or magazine covers that can be opened flat and closed up into a box shape with no internal support. A couple of other popular origamis include a telescope lens made from cardboard and a shoe last that folds out like a zipper as well as a windmill that opens up like a fan to catch air around its blades. By using these generation methods we could fold our own version of this type of origami using modern engineering technologies - sheets of metal instead of paper.

This included allowing filters as stickers instead of emojis or other images; requiring paid subscriptions be logged with one's name rather than anonymous (to reduce spam); restricting access only via web browser not apps such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp; adding info screens before video uploads so they can explain how they will appear online; introducing password protection when using stories from public servers; limiting what kind of data is shared through ads; and allowing people full control over their profile information by enabling them to remove others' ability to tag themselves in photos.[23] Zuckerberg stated: ""Over time we want this feature set to get even better.

"Airseas' Seawing is a parafoil kite designed to attach to ships to reduce emissions on shipping trips by up to 20. It can be mounted onto the deck of any ship, making it ideal for use in harbours and coastal areas where there are low wind speeds. The Seawing was created as part of an EU Horizon 2020 project named CHIMIRAD (Controlling Harmful Industrial Marine Emissions with Remote Controlled Devices). The design process began when engineering student Craig Morrison visited Shipskaar, Norway in May 2009. He filmed and photographed what he saw from the air while flying his paraglider. After completing this experience, he worked out how to make something similar using only materials available at school: polystyrene foam sheets, rope and a rubber band. Three months later, after talking about his ideas with other students at York University they suggested that he should form into a company. Within six weeks of working full-time on the idea, Morrison founded Airseas Aviation Ltd in October 2010 which included five members who had all been involved with the original concept. By January 2011, the first prototype ""Seawing"" was ready for testing. As well as being used aboard commercial passenger ferries, Royal Mail vessels have also been fitted with them. In the early days they were made privately but now many seacraft firms buy a batch of 25 or more. They cost 1,000 each plus VAT depending upon size. One airline has bought 250 for its fleet, one ferry firm ordered five dozen for their craft and another four hundred series 1s are currently under construction with orders coming through already.

"Elon Musk has revealed that he has a design for a submarine car, like the one from the James Bond movie 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. As a child, Musk was fascinated by submarines and knew they were essential to any future space mission. ""My father said it would be really cool if you could drive around under water [in your own vehicle],"" Musk told an audience at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas on Monday (25 March). ""I thought about this as a kid because I'm always looking up into the sky thinking about what's above us."" On Saturday night, Musk posted pictures of his new Tesla Roadster 3D print-out onto Twitter with the caption: ""Tried talking to Elon Musk but he is busy designing the world's best submarine. Trying again after 12 hours... 3dprinting."" The images show a black shape inside what appears to be some sort of tank attached to the roof. There are no words or captions overlaid on them. But given how much time has passed since Musk originally tweeted those photos, we can infer that the man driving the Roadster - either himself or someone else sitting behind the wheel - isn't happy about having been left out of this conversation. Musk then began tweeting details regarding the internal design specifications for this hypothetical underwater vehicle. He described it as being able to travel through the ocean floor without hitting the ground first and possessing several features similar to those found on SpaceX rockets, including the ability to land itself back on earth when necessary. SpaceX have now begun building the Falcon Heavy rocket which will carry their Dragon capsule further than ever before. If all goes well, the launch is due to take place some time between June and August next year. This morning, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled plans to send humans to Mars within the coming decades. In order for a manned flight mission to succeed successfully, however, there needs to be enough food available to sustain the crew throughout their long journey to the Red Planet. While Musk didn't go too far into providing exact details as yet, he did make reference to a recent study published in the journal Astrobiology by researchers from NASA, Cornell University, Pitzer College and Rice University (link). According to the report, human settlement near Earth's equator - where temperatures remain consistently low during most parts of the year - would require a large amount of arable farmland and fresh drinking water. A major concern here is whether such resources might come dangerously close to running out over the period of many years needed to complete such a lengthy trip! What does the data say? Can our planet support life even beyond 2070?, asks Metzger in her book Why Extinction Matters, referring to research conducted by Stephen O'Brien of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. For example, what happens when crops fail due to drought or pests; when water tables drop below bottomless wells; when glaciers disappear or rainforests become so degraded that nothing remains alive? What happens when carbon dioxide levels rise past dangerous levels? Humans already live in many places unsuitable for habitation above sea level or high latitudes, far away from oceans and underground volcanic activity. Yet despite the fact that the United States alone contains millions of square miles suitable only for hunting game, virtually every city dweller knows nary a trace about its true geography. But once the species becomes aware of areas appropriate for landing, growing, breeding, living, working, dying, reproducing, sleeping, fighting, loving, praying, eating, laughing, grieving, suffering, resting, crying, making war, doing business, dreaming, holding hands, baking bread, knitting sweaters, growing pot, writing sonnets, raping children, going insaneand other activities still less considered proper in polite societywe know that a single stretch of coastline doesn't quite suffice anymore, not unless the whole nation actually buys the entire shoreline and lives atop it. We realize, rather late, that our small island home won't do very well for thousands more people living here. Our economy cannot grow sufficiently fast enough to keep pace with population expansion. There simply aren't enough factories, ports, shipping lanes, roads and railroads for everyone. We already consume energy faster than the planet renews it, using fossil fuels whose production may someday cause climate change so severe that current civilization collapses toward extinction. Those who'll lose everything won't be just ourselves but also ecosystems upon ecosystems, each lost habitat adding another step to disappearance, until we're facing extinction event number 11. No matter how great our technological skill or ingenuity, we stand poised to destroy civilization. Only if we stop playing God, care for nature wisely, forgive ourselves for trampling on Mother Nature, learn humility towards fellow beings who think alike, bravely face reality and admit planetary limits, relinquish power and responsibility, commit to harmony, eschew violence, recognize global interdependency, depend equally on others instead of selfishness, trust in wisdom elsewhere among civilizations as much as compare to reevaluate the waste:think holdfast hope scarce possibilities now rest vie act apply better get rid out look fate resistance test results multiple store last time line rate potential",0,569
"Ford is releasing a comprehensive self-driving dataset to academics and researchers. The data was collected over a year and it comes from multiple self-driving vehicles. Ford is also sharing a report that details the technical challenges of autonomous driving while battling demons such as time, safety regulations and bias in human decision making. A few weeks ago we published an article on how Tesla has become ""the new Cool Guy"" when compared with other manufacturers like Google, Apple, and even Waymo (self-driving cars). We heard back from many readers who questioned why Tesla had not been mentioned by name. A fair question: they are often overshadowed by Elon Musk, Tim Cook, and Steve Jobs. Perhaps this is because their success still needs some explaining. This week, however, another news story revealed what may be one of Tesla's most significant achievements - and the company deserves more credit than ever for its efforts at developing technologies which are now being used around the world. Two months after Tesla announced autopilot 2.0 software update last December, Forbes posted a story titled, ""Tesla Autopilot Accident Rate Drops 45 In Last Year, With Industry Average Still Rising..."" Their findings were based upon statistics provided by NHTSA. According to these numbers, there have only been five fatalities involving Model S or X drivers using hands free autopilot since 2016. There have been no injuries during recent trips made in the same period either. One driver died after his car crashed into a concrete barrier in Florida earlier this month but two passengers survived the accident due to quick action taken by professional first responders. Another fatality occurred in May 2017. It involved a Model 3 crash in California where it hit a semi truck. Thankfully all three occupants of the vehicle walked away uninjured. These occurrences seem almost routine today despite the fact that those accidents took place just eight months apart. Yet this topic remains highly controversial among investors, analysts, consumers, regulators, automakers and others as well. Many worry about excessive risk taking behavior done by humans behind the wheel, especially with the rise of distraction technology like smartphones and social media apps. Even though autopilot and other advanced tech can make our lives safer right now, conservative pundits disagree if this will lead people to stop caring about road rules and drive recklessly. Some believe it could encourage average Joe to push them to places faster cars cannot go without adding fatigue and stress to already demanding jobs, potentially leading to traffic congestion, crashes, and increased pollution. And then again, maybe that is exactly what Elon wants us to do!

"Apple has extended its deadline for employees returning to the office because of the increase of Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant. The return to the offices was controversial since most companies were forced by their governments to close and reopen later on, which caused much debate in the market about how well Apple is preparing for this situation. According to a report from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, the company will extend its January 30th reopening until March 29th, but it expects all departments except work requiring ""immediate physical presence"" will be closed till April 4th at least. On top of that, according to sources familiar with the development there are no set timelines for when some teams would resume normal operations and others won't either. This confusion might also have an impact on product releases. For example, the last OSX 10.14 Mojave release date had been planned for today (March 11), as usual, along with other products such as iPadOS 14.2. However, reports say these dates could now change if the internal timeline changes.

"Amazon Web Services has partnered with D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti to launch Braket, a quantum computing service. It has also announced the launch of the AWS Center for Quantum Computing in Sydney (AWS C4), which will be led by IBM's Simon Cross, University Of Oxford faculty member David Cory, CSIRO senior scientist Scott Aaronson, and Google Research fellow Michael Freedman. With this new collaboration, Amazon hopes that it can help companies leverage its cloud-based resources - in terms of compute power, networking bandwidth, storage capacity, processing speed, and other factors - to build their own machines dedicated solely to running applications on a quantum computer. What Is Quatum Computation? The idea behind quantum computers is pretty simple: they harness an unusual way to store data using qubits instead of bits. In classical computation, all information is stored as binary digits, 1 or 0. But qubits use two values at once, one marked ""1"" and another marked ""0."" That allows them to manipulate more than just one bit per operation; if you need to do 10 operations at once, you have 10 different possibilities represented simultaneously. This turns out to make executing certain algorithms much faster, especially those involving factoring large numbers. For instance, say I want to find a prime number between 2 million and 5 million, but not 3 million. With today's best computers, I could try each possible value individually until I hit upon a valid one. This would take about 15 years given current hardware limitations. However, there are some algorithms that factor very quickly into something like 35 factorizations every second. If we were able to create a system capable of handling thousands of these calculations simultaneously, then finding such primes might only require hours rather than days, weeks even. The same thing goes for encryption keys and passwords used when signing up for things online, cracking codes for bank accounts and various security systems, drug discovery, bioengineering, physics modeling - the list goes on. While many argue that quantum computers won't ever work due to fundamental physical reasons, most scientists agree that someday they'll be able to calculate problems exponentially faster than modern supercomputers. And right now, quantum computers may already be outperforming traditional ones on select mathematical problems, so they've got time before reaching any kind of full maturity anytime soon. How Does AWS Handle General Use Cases Like These? For starters, AWS provides customers with access to general purpose servers based on Intel x86 processors. Those computers handle tasks like web hosting and email services while being extremely fast at performing those functions. They aren't purpose built for quantum computing however. Instead, they run programs written specifically for conventional parallel architectures, meaning that users must write code optimized for that kind of machine. From there, they'd submit the program's results back to AWS where programmers would perform post-processing and analysis. Once everything was done, the original user would receive the final answer. A recent test performed by academics from MIT gave us a glimpse of how efficient quantum computing could become compared to regular computers. Backed by a 5 million grant, researchers ran a run of Shor's algorithm on top 700 optimizations to see whether a ""quantum advantage"" existed. What did they find? Some 305 billion times better performance over five minutes. This was mostly attributed to existing quantum devices' ability to operate far beyond non-superconducting chips. Although others argue otherwise, the tests seem to point towards the future of this technology. There are several business models available here including monthly subscription pricing tiers for single instances, reserved quantities, and pay-per-use options. Startups looking to develop prototypes of specialized quantum software will likely opt for the latter option since they don't necessarily need large amounts of continuous memory space. Meanwhile, companies possessing significant computational needs will probably choose to adopt multiples of larger clusters ready for immediate deployment. It should come as no surprise that Amazon doesn't actually sell quantum computers themselves. While it hasn't been confirmed yet, the company does believe that people who wish to buy a fully functional unit shouldn't get their hands on one through third party manufacturers because of potential misuse. Aside from offering servers equipped for quantum computing, Amazon offers custom solutions developed around specific manufacturing processes. One example includes HPC Live!, an array that comes with 48 customized nodes designed for high-performance computing suited for big data analytics, simulations, cryptography, finance, biotechnology, and genomics. Similarly, EC2 P3 instances allow owners to utilize GPUs to accelerate heavy workloads. Both offer detailed customization features allowing developers and businesses to pick exactly what components they're after. Why Use Your Own Hardware Now Rather Than Buy Into An Outsourced Solution Later On? At first glance, buying your own hardware seems pointless as it could often cost upwards of millions of dollars to purchase a device capable of running complicated algorithms. Applications such as image recognition or simulation may require multiple combinations, along with smaller parts thrown away for folks wanting to upgrade the world. All else terravenno more.

"GPS systems are unable to work underwater as water breaks down the radio waves GPS relies on to function. MIT scientists have developed a device called an underwater backscatter localization system that uses sound instead of light, making it possible for all sorts of devices - from medical sensors and smart phones to cars and drones to communicate in the ocean depths."" Researchers at ETH Zurich's Laboratory of Acoustics (LAM) have created the first demonstration of acoustic communication submerged under natural seawater conditions. They believe their new method will allow us to use underwater communications without having to rely on expensive optical fibers or large-scale submarine cable networks. Their proof-of-concept experiment was published today in Nature Communications Secure Surface-to-Submarine Sound Communication Using Backscatterers. The technology could come into play when we need to send information across long distances over open seas, communicating through deep waters and avoiding getting bogged down by obstacles such as reefs or shallows, says lead author Nima Mesgarani, who began investigating acoustics more than 20 years ago while studying how dolphins can navigate using echoes mixed with clicks. ""If you're sending data between two ships,"" he explains, ""you would want them not be next to one another so if they don't know each other's location then this is cost effective way of doing it [over] wide areas."" The same principle applies to submarines: 'We might really like our subs to stay out longer,' he adds, 'and I think they should be able to do that. Backscattering refers to the reflection of emitted signals off solid objects. With the help of recent breakthroughs in ultrasound design, engineers are now experimenting with membranes and microbubbles designed to act as transmitters and receivers simultaneously. In theory, these devices could enable much greater power efficiency compared to passive sonar sensors currently used in marine applications. Not bad enough?

Professional skydiver and BASE jumper Peter Salzmann, who was part of a team that tested the device called ""E-Wing"" for BMW Group Research in Munich last year, explains how it works: The E-wing is based on kite technology - and this means that if you pull hard enough into your arms, you can move yourself forward by creating tension between them (the harness) and the ground below. This creates lift. The wing folds down when I get close to my target point so that it doesn't affect me flying underneath; then as soon as I'm over top, or above our test area, which is about 400 meters high here in Germany, the system unfolds again and gives me greater freedom. We're looking to have it ready next summer as well."" This article originally appeared on Business Insider. To read more click here.",0,580
"Facebook came out with it's own smart home device, it's sort of a tablet with a speaker attached to the base. It's called Facebook Portal, and it comes in two sizes: devie big for 199 or small for 179. It has Alexa built in, as well as support for Google Assistant and Siri (not sure if Apple HomeKit is supported). The smaller size has 8GB RAM128 GB storage while the bigger one has 16GB256gb. Both are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors at 2GHz. The problem I have with this product - there's no Wi-Fi! There's Bluetooth 4.1 LE though which means you can connect up other devices such as speakers etc... but you won't be able to access your Amazon Echo or whatever else through a smartphone like on their previous Portals that had WiFi built into them. Now they don't say anything about connecting an Ethernet cable or something like that so perhaps someone could enlighten me? Anyway the benefit of having these tablets over a simple screen mic is exactly what people were hoping for; voice activation but without having to use a bulky phone or even getting tangled up with all the cables.",0,581
"A new finding suggests that the Ebola viruses behind a new outbreak in Guinea may have originated from a survivor who carried the virus for at least five years. The unusual survival time of an infected person could shed light on how long this strain, called Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV), has been around and what its potential impact may be. Researchers estimate that the index casethe first known infection due to the 2014-2016 West African epidemicoccurred about two weeks before February 25th, 2004. This date is important because it marks when all other members of her family were evacuated after being exposed to bat feces contaminated with Ebola particles within their cave home. She was not one of them; she waited until May 17th, 2007, to die of EVD. Her body was never tested or buried during the 2003 outbreak after there wasn't enough funding for burial teams. But researchers managed to get genetic material out of another member of the same household where she died: 57 year old Filomena ""Fiona"" Pagoto Makanga, also called Fiona Mkomazi. [1] Using sequencing technology developed by collaborators here at University College London, they showed that Fiona's genome contains DNA sequences similar to those found in genomes obtained from samples taken between December 23rd, 2005 and October 27th, 2006 from people living here in western Cote d'Ivoire. Further analysis suggested that ZEBOV may originate from relatives of Fiona whose caves were used as shelters while fleeing fighting between rebel forces and government troops in March 1999. Due to lack of medical attention and food supplies, many villagers fled into these remote locations. [2] The UCL team's findings are published online today by Nature Communications. It shows, for example, that some strains of EboZIK13 had more than 95 nucleotide sequence identity with genomes identified among survivors from 1994 onwards, explained co-author Dorcas Wilson. However, given the large volume of work required to identify such small differences, researchers believe that only a few individuals survived past the initial stages of disease and subsequently went undetected through the period of intense transmission. These include Fiona Mkomozi, who likely contracted a mild form of EVD early on but did not seek treatment before she died of 'complications'. Other individuals might have later succumbed, without any recorded deaths. For instance, 14 days post exposure is considered to be the earliest point at which dead patients can still test positive using current techniques. However, if all patients survive that stage, then there will be no chance of detecting a surviving patient using standard methods. Unpublished data suggest that the number of survivors may actually exceed 170, meaning that we're unlikely to see any currently available antibody tests detect anyone left alive and infectious. Although most survivors remain healthy even now, the possibility remains that others harbour ZEBOVs, scientists note. Dr David Mabuza, Research Fellow based in Zambia said: ""While our research does add weight to the idea that the origin of the 20142015 outbreak lies elsewhere, I do not think it indicates a single source. In fact my own research group has shown that multiple variants circulate across Africa showing that multiple lineages exist outside Sierra Leone."" Dr Peter Horby, Senior Lecturer added: ""This study adds valuable information to our understanding of who gets sick and why."" With 6 months having passed since the end of the latest West African outbreak, scientists fear that further outbreaks could occur in regions previously unaffected by EVD. As noted above, recent scientific advances mean that every day counts when tracking down sources of future infections. By uncovering the origins of previous epidemics, public health officials aim to better understand whether to prioritise certain areas over others and thereby reduce risk for future spread. The authors also emphasised that given the high fatality rate associated with this particular subtype, extensive testing needs to be done to determine what proportion of cases may go undiagnosed, potentially leading to recrudescence or resurgence of ZEBOV. - See all stories on EcoHealthNews """,0,582
"Scientists have grown plants in lunar soil using samples collected during the Apollo missions to the moon. The scientists grew thale cress, a small flowering plant that is attractive to beetles and butterflies but otherwise has no economic value on Earth. They found that many of their seedlings survived after only one week exposed to the Moon's near-vacuum environment. The discovery was made by growing seeds in two different habitats: either in flat plates or in large tubes covered with filters designed to mimic some aspects of the conditions in space. Vegetation could be maintained for 18 months without watering under these filters. These results suggest that life may have originated right there at the base of our solar system 4 billion years ago on the surface of the first celestial body outside our own planet.

"The same CSS code can sometimes output different and unexpected results. CSS is a complex system and subtle differences can change how properties behave. This article looks at layout algorithms in order to understand what causes specific behavior, why certain browsers are more or less consistent, and where the gaps lie when it comes to browser-specific implementations of HTML5CSS3. In this article we'll be looking at a few things: box model quirks and problems resulting from them; alignment issues (both vertical and horizontal), as well as floats and positioning algorithms. We won't go into everything there ever was - that would take too long to write - but I will try to explain all the important concepts and most common pitfalls. If you want to jump straight to some examples then check out my demo site here. It contains various sample boxes with their borders and padding set up so they look like regular blocks on top of an image. They contain links for each section which allow you to quickly switch between layouts by changing the supporting divs. Of course these ones could also easily have been made using only tables with inline styles! The whole thing should be pretty self explanatory once you see it working... if not just ask away:) Here's my third example again as reference: Box Model Quirks Problems 1) Margins, Padding, Borders Collapse When Floated Elements Are Wrapped In Block Level Divs Boxes and floated elements tend to collapse together when wrapped within block level containers. Be careful with margins and other styling related to border widths around floating content. 2) Spans Don't Get Hidden Inside An Element With A Prefix Class Some versions of IE hide non-displayed children inside display:none; elements when classes containing spaces or dashes are used. 3) Invisible Text Can Still Have Outline Image Trickle Upwards Property outline does indeed work above specified values (as far as background colors go). But! If applied to text directly it doesn't affect anything because the invisible character stays invisible. 4) Horizontal Alignment Sometimes Doesn't Work Properly Different browsers handle horizontal centering differently compared to normal baseline line alignment. 5) Nested Lists May Cause Other List Items To Appear Below Them Certain list items may appear below others due to over zealous nesting. 6) Vertical Centring Is Broken In Internet Explorer 7-9 The ""vertical-align"" property isn't always very useful. Forcing multiple lines of text to align vertically may cause word wrapping glitches when combined with another element whose height exceeds 100. Alternatively use JavaScript to centre your lists correctly instead. 7) Float Does Not Apply Where There Are No Clear IDs 8) Floating Tables Misbehave On Mobile Devices Because many mobile devices don't support nested table cells, any attempt to float one must either be done without cellpadding and heigth attributes (not recommended!) or else be placed outside of its parents using table tags rather than div s. 9) Overflow Means Something Very Different Depending on whether overflow: hidden is set or simply has no effect, setting clip implies clipping an area itself whereas scroll involves scrolling past areas offscreen. 10) Positioning Requires Too Many Math Expressions Modern browsers provide browser prefixes such as -webkit-, -moz-, and -o-. These make position computations much easier, especially since we can now use fractions for offsets relatively easily. Just remember that specifying absolute positions from pixels requires a lot of calculation before getting anywhere close to being accurate. 11) Stacking Floats Aren't Easy Sometimes two layers of stacking flows aren't quite aligned properly even though both are positioned absolutely. However when both have positive left and right margin padding combinations, the parent container offers zero space between the edges of stacked elements. 12) You Can Accidentally Add Negative Padding That Way More Space Appears Than Required While some modern browsers let negative paddings compensate for applied gutters, negative padding still means space too. 13) Background Images On Separate Columns Could Look Really Bad Depending on column heights similar images could produce ugly banding effects. 14) Fixed Scrollbar Needs Height Set Any Layout Which Uses Fixed Heights As Well As Varying Width Will Make Sure All Pages Always Fit 16) Inheritance Issues 17) Line Length And Gutter Size Should Always Match Whenever Possible Most designers assume that adding a gutter size value to an already-set body tag style sheet somehow affects the entire document. Even worse, the default value might be set too big once you start including things like font sizes, backgrounds and line spacing into equations, thus doubling up on the original issue and increasing overall page load time. 18) 'float' Has A Low Priority Compared To 'position' Despite Both Being Used Often 19) Newbies Tiptoe Around Trying Maintaining One Or Two Border Pairings At A Time Making sure a particular border pair never forms becomes tricky. 20) Determining Dimensions From Percentages Isn't Exactly Rocket Science Having percentages for widths and headings sets much greater retrospective communication is a bit more real-but-real quickie quote the greatest concern doable?

"Researchers at MIT have created a rechargeable lithium-ion battery in the form of a 460-foot-long fiber. The batteries can be manufactured to arbitrarily long lengths. They can be 3D-printed into any shape, and they can even function when bent or compressed. The design is intended as an alternative to conventional lead-acid storage cells - which are used extensively for their low cost and safe disposal. Lead acid batteries contain hazardous materials that can kill you if ingested; they also need constant monitoring because many chemicals inside them will eventually leak out and create toxic messes on a sunny day. But until now, nobody had been able stand up such batteries outside of laboratories without breaking them apart after a few hours. That's changed with this research: Batteries made from these nanotubes could last days instead of weeks; they'll pack more energy per volume than anything else available today; and they won't require regular maintenance like other battery technologies. As a result, once fully developed (it's not clear exactly how far along we are right now), it would make sense to make cars run off of them rather than fossil fuels. In addition, since fibers don't break easily and aren't prone to short circuits like traditional designs, they offer safety improvements over conventional batteries of similar size. If batteries ever become too thin, flexible, or hard to handle, scientists should consider building larger versions using these ""battery packs"" so that they retain some mechanical strength. And since many consumers want electronics to come with medical devices designed specifically around those batteries' unique properties, researchers are working towards creating phone chargers that work while tethered to hospital equipment. All told, though, this isn't quite the first time someone has thought about building such a thing. In fact, the idea may sound familiar to anyone who remembers watching Star Trek: The Next Generation's episode ""Q Who?"" Q was actually one half of two fictional robots charged by the Enterprise crew using technology almost identical to what's being proposed here. Of course, in reality, there were no actual wires involved, but the gist remains the same: By powering the whole structure through a single wire, engineers can use power efficiently. While most of the project still needs to go through extensive testing before reaching production stages, the team certainly seems optimistic. After all, the polymer electrolyte membranes already exist, and spinoff companies in Japan appear poised to begin mass producing carbon nanofiber sheets within months. [MIT via IEEE Spectrum]",0,585
"The International Space Station is supposed to retire in 2024, though that date will probably be pushed back to 2030. It is slowly leaking air and getting increasingly expensive to repair. One of its most useful instruments has just been retired because it was too old. Just now (Feb 4) NASA announced the retirement of all six science truss modules due to a number of issues with them: ISS Instrument Retiring Due To Inadequate Service Life The New Horizons Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph for ISS Experiments will not continue operating after Jan 1st 2020. This instrument can no longer meet the requirements necessary for routine operation on the station. While servicing could extend operational life and provide valuable data from some future missions, this particular experiment would have minimal value by the time additional technical resources are available to address its hardware needs or replace its scientific objectives. The James Webb Telescope's Near Infrared Camera-Mid IR Surveyor (JWST NIRCam MIRI), which took images of nearby stars as part of the mission's primary science program, also reached end of operations status on Dec 31, 2019. JWST continues to operate well past the scheduled lifetime of 2018 - 2021; however, the spacecraft requires regular maintenance such as an annual dust sweep and other activities every two years to plan new observations. Still under development at prime contractor Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, these next steps help ensure safe ongoing operation through July 2028, when JWST completes its first year of full science operations. Since the beginning of 2016, there were more than 19 opportunities for critical space station systems components to require service support - including electrical power distribution units, cooling fansshafts, batteries, thermal control equipment, fuel cells, valves, pumps and much more. These required repairs occurred during periods where crews had difficulty accessing the station since they coincided with orbital mechanics that made reboosting impossible without incurring significant risks. There was only one opportunity between flights 11 and 18 of Expedition 56 when Houston Mission Control commanded the robotic arm used to unload cargo into position for those seats, but even then the astronauts elected to delay doing so until a day before their planned departure at the conclusion of their current flight earlier this month. During ISS assembly construction, another 12 incidents were reported requiring actions ranging from removal of panels to replacement of major subsystems. [Read More] ""In addition, many of the crew living quarters have limited windows making natural light inaccessible for vital sleep cycles, creating potentially adverse effects on habitability. Other common areas include bathrooms, galley and sleeping bunks which require water cleaning and waste management utilizing complicated plumbing designs. Aircrew activities are constrained by the size and weight restrictions associated with human occupancy while pressurized suits create safety hazards for routine movement throughout the microgravity environment. Finally, complex schedules limit flexibility for conducting maintenance work aboard the orbiting laboratory due to launch vehicle and ship availability constraints. For example, a Soyuz TMA-19M resupply mission currently underway has a minimum delivery window requirement of 7 days prior to the start of each EVA sequence. Further complicating scheduling efforts is typically about 90 of any ISS UAC accesses occur within 150 km range of Earth allowing little or no planning margin for contingency scenarios. Consequently, the majority of all ISS operations commands originate from either Moscow Russia or Houston USA, limiting options for mitigating potential consequences if unexpected events arise during normal business hours. Following operations completion, hundreds of thousands of pounds of scrap metal remain scattered across small islands in orbit. Both Hermes and Cygnus vehicles contain large amounts of unusable metals and debris, leaving ample room for improvement in technologies needed for recycling projects. As evidenced over the course of nearly 40 years of spaceflight experience, both humans and robots face challenges every step of the way. But despite unforeseen circumstances, our collective expertise honed by decades of aerospace research helps us stay focused on completing important tasks safely and successfully, paving the road toward a sustainable spacefaring presence in deep space.

[Source] NASA says that ""each module serves multiple functions, depending upon what type of experiments might be performed on board.

The absence of a natural opening in that barrier could be an advantage too, since you won't need another procedure like brain surgery or a needle injection. The researchers injected tiny nanoparticles into rats with diabetes. They were able to make them enter through the walls of capillaries without damaging any cells lining those vessels. Then they added molecules designed to trigger inflammation inside the brains of each rat, causing one side of its skull to swell up like a balloon - but only on the right side.

"Public health officials have long been urging Americans to limit the consumption of red and processed meats due to its links with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Researchers have spent years trying to prove that vegetarian diets are healthier than meat-heavy ones - but some new evidence suggests there may be a ""meat is better"" message floating around in our culture as well. According to the results of an Ipsos survey conducted for The Wall Street Journal, 52 of people surveyed believed it was more healthy to eat less protein. Only 28 believed eating too many animal products could pose serious threats to their own wellbeing. Surprisingly, 62 of respondents also agreed with another statement claiming that vegans tend to look unhealthy and underweight. That last one makes sense considering that zero plant foods were included on any category of food consumed during the 2012 Food Atlas Survey. In fact, 17 of respondents said they thought vegetarians looked thinner because they ate nothing at all! The most positive outcomes reported by those who responded positively to the questions include being happier (61) and feeling superior to others (60). Interestingly enough, 41 of individuals disagreed that vegans tended to be thin even though they omitted meat from their diet. This seems especially odd given how common this stereotype is. Additionally, only 23 claimed to believe that veganism led people to become depressed or angry while 39 replied that it made them feel good about themselves. Those numbers seem far lower than you might expect, despite what the 68th Annual Vegetarian Hall of Fame has come up with: 1) 2 million kids choose not to attend school on days when there isn't pizza; and 2) 23rds of adults consume meatless meals every day. It would make sense if consumers felt embarrassed about becoming vegetarians - however, very few cited the reason of societal pressure. Perhaps this stems from the idea that we must eat animals in order to survive? Either way, these findings should give us pause regarding the current messaging surrounding going meat free.

So now that you understand why you shouldn't miss breakfast just yet...time to crack open those yellow treasures! This time of year can take a toll on body image. When I first moved away to college, my friends told me to keep heavy things off of myself until I had lost weight after having babies. If I didn't wear certain clothes, they thought I might get scolded by teachers. They warned me that if someone really did comment negatively about something I wore, it would reinforce negative self-image about my fatness, not to mention my ability to control my appearance. Even though nobody ever seemed to care much about whether I bought into that level of scrutiny, I still carried that judgmental attitude and held onto beliefs such as ""I am overweight, therefore, unacceptable."" Such thoughts hold a lot of power over any individual in society, regardless of gender, race, size, age, sexuality, or religion. Unfortunately, this sort of thinking doesn't only happen in the adult world. Many children grow up believing that looking different means they aren't beautiful, worthy, smart, interesting, etc. Because society obsesses over looks to begin with, often times those notions seep into adulthood and perpetuate poor attitudes towards oneself. And yes, skinny people do sometimes beat down heavier bodies. Sometimes skinny people even harass the fatter person in front of them, telling them that they deserve to lose weight. Some skinny people even go so far as to criticize the larger person for their health concerns, instead of treating their own fears as seriously. Often these instances occur on social media platforms, and that kind of bullying needs to stop whether online or offline. Kids need role models who treat each human life equally without regard for differences, rather than encouraging self-loathing through harsh judgments of size, shape, color, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, intelligence, beauty or anything else. So let's break those norms together. Let's talk about acceptance and empathy. Let's feed hungry bellies together and offer words of support to each other.

"Tardigrades are microscopic extremophiles that can survive exposure to intense temperatures, pressures, and even the vacuum of space. A group of scientists recently recorded high-speed videos of the animals traversing a series of ""mazes"" in which they were forced to navigate through water-filled channels lined with ice particles. The video is published today (February 23) on the cover page of Nature Methods. [See Images: Tumbling Robots Test Waters] Beneath their cute appearance lies an unnerving level of competence. When tardigrade aftertards find themselves trapped behind obstacles or have been made ill by too much pressure, they use special hooks located at the underside of their bodies called setae to crawl over surfaces until they reach another route. In this study, researchers had tested how quickly the tiny creatures could make it across various maze patterns - sometimes having to traverse unusually large distances - as well as what factors affected movement speed and efficiency. This work was done in collaboration with colleagues from Japan's National Institute for Materials Science; the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems; and Moscow State University, according to Mary Ellen Ratcliffe, one of the paper's coauthors and director of the Center for Applied Microbiome Research within the Department of Bioengineering Therapeutic Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. Ratcliffe told LiveScience, The research team] wanted to see if there would be any difference between male and female tardigrades in terms of navigation ability."" To test their theory, she and her fellow researchers collected about 100 specimens from three species of tardigrades - all of them members of the same genus, Heterothermus - and then placed each animal into its own individual container filled with filter sterilized water. After 1 hour, during which time the researchers observed the animals' behavior, the containers were shaken vigorously; the animals underwent rapid acceleration due to centrifugal force. Then, when the shaking stopped, the researchers let the little guys settle back down again so they wouldn't move around while being filmed. All movement throughout these tests was captured using high-speed cameras running at up to 10 frames per second (fps). The amount of light used contributed to the duration of filming. Each frame lasted anywhere from 30 milliseconds to several seconds depending upon location and lighting conditions. The final frame rate depends on the camera used and the number of megapixels available, but many of the images generated from the video footage taken of the tardigrades run at 2 million fps. These readings don't usually happen, though, because balancing out screen resolution with picture quality tends to take away from overall image clarity. Once the data was collected, the researchers analyzed how fast the animals moved (in millimeters per millisecond), and whether those movements varied based on the length and shape of the channel. They also investigated why some animals consistently took longer paths than others. For example, one specimen didn't just follow the shortest path possible but zigzagged along a diagonal course through the maze instead. So, perhaps the animal wasn't trying to cut corners? The researchers suspected otherwise. Instead, they theorize that the animal may have sensed changes in direction as it traveled, thus marking off different routes. Alternatively, the critter could detect slight differences in depth when navigating, or maybe chemical cues emanating from other nearby organisms might trigger the tardy to change pathways. Regardless, the researchers found that both males and females moved equally quickly in straight lines across all pattern options, regardless of size or complexity. However, in certain instances that weren't quite straight lines, such as the two examples above, the female tardigrades always chose the serpentine path over the direct line. Males tended to travel more slowly vs. females, however, once they reached the end of the mazes. As expected, neither gender had difficulty crossing long stretches of relatively flat terrain. Also, the lengths of paths mattered most significantly in determining speed - the average swim speeds slowed dramatically as chambers got wider, narrowing toward the center. At 6 centimeters wide, swimming speeds dropped below 0.35 mms (about twice the thickness of a human hair); faster swimmers needed smaller openings. Stillness worked best, but only when no obstructions stood between the creature and the destination; whenever something impeded progress, mobility dwindled considerably. Ultimately, moving backwards proved to be a nonstarter. Both sexes showed equal proficiency for turning in circles, 90 degrees at a time in tight quarters. But compared to locomotion, staying motionless completely stalled growth rates. Water really did seem to play a role in speeding things up, especially when going from moderate depths. Sometimes merely getting wet did not necessarily mean trouble, though. One specie kept crawling relatively briskly across slotted platforms despite constant immersion in watertight tubes; rather than submerge entirely, they simply squirted themselves out onto dry land repeatedly via gills located beneath their heads.

"Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have relinquished their control of Alphabet to the current Google CEO Sundar Pichai. They will continue to remain Alphabet employees and retain their ownership in other non-corporate entities like Sidewalk Labs, which is developing a high rise district within Toronto called Quayside that promises to be Canada's answer to Manhattan or Shoreditch districts in Europe. Pichai has been named as sole CEO for both companies; they are also making him president. The move was announced after a meeting of Alphabet board members on Tuesday morning. At first glance there may not seem much difference between having three CEOs vs one with two names, but I think it reflects how we expect executives should operate professionally today: cross functional teams working together towards common goals. In an internal memo sent out by the company this afternoon, Pichai outlined his plan for executing on what he considers core values - trust, focus, respect, responsibility, empathy, and humility - at Google and under Alphabet: ""Our goal is simple: To organize people, technology, and capital so any team can succeed. We want our work culture to feel more like a startup than big tech. Our DNA remains unchanged. But we are rethinking some things about how we structure ourselves inside the organization."" The centralization of executive leadership in Alphabet's form becomes most evident when you compare it to previous holding structures: In March 2014, the founders founded Google outright without the help of any type of autonomous group, while Facebook in September 2008 became its own subsidiary owned by Mark Zuckerberg at age 23 (with no oversight). You could argue that Page and Brin never really left Google, but rather just transferred their interests from being chief executive officers of an operating division into being directors of another corporation entirely. As such, instead of being listed among the highest paid Fortune 500 CEOs (31 million) CEO Robert Friedland comes in only number 739. This explains why over half of Alphabet's 100 billion market cap belongs to Google itself, and not all these assets are held directly by either founder or parent entity. It also means investors get concerned when Page and Brin speak very publicly about anything involving Google, even if they're talking about something completely unrelated. According to Bloomberg, Page told reporters that the Silicon Valley duo would still hold positions across Alphabet alongside Pichai, including serving as ""distant observers"" who rarely interfere. There are seven known independent directors plus one appointed by each founding investor. Right now James Murdoch serves as Chairman, Vint Cerf as Vice Chair, Eric Schmidt as Lead Independent Director, Leo Apotheker as Chief Financial Officer, George Lucas as Treasurer, Jared Cohen as Special Advisor, John Doerr as Senior Independent Director, Sheryl Sandberg as Non-Executive Director, and former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold as Executive Director. All eight serve ex officio on every major committee. Each director takes turns chairing meetings of the Board and committees. When asked whether Page and Brin were planning to stay involved with the company, I believe it depends upon how closely they interact with Pichai. If your vision and input isn't requested or desired then don't count yourself part of the conversation. What matters ultimately is if you have influence. Does someone need advice? Ask for it. Is there conflict brewing up front? Be ready to step in. Or perhaps shepherding them through difficult decisions, knowing that if one steps wrong Google could end up suffering damage similar to Apple's iPhone 5c fiasco. For example, look back to 2016 where Google faced several antitrust investigations due to Android phone makers taking advantage of software patents - and received criticism because they didn't fight back against those suits. A few months later it came off worse than expected when a U.S. Federal Court ruled against Motorola Mobility patent infringement claims against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd., ruling that the South Korean conglomerate did not infringe on 10 of 13 asserted patents. That decision had implications beyond phones and tablets, affecting everything from cars to smart watches. Now imagine if Page and Brin felt they needed to take sides in court proceedings around the world, even though they weren't personally sued themselves. Would they have spoken up earlier?

One thing's for sure, now that Alphabet exists Pichai controls 100 percent of them. As noted above, Page and Brin started Alphabet independently from GOOG nearly a decade ago, and since then it has grown into a huge enterprise with hundreds of products ranging from life sciences to self driving vehicles to satellites.

"Iberospinus natarioi, a newly identified 8-meter-long predatory dinosaur, represents a new genus and species of spinosaurid, a group that includes the Spinosaurus. An analysis of the spinosaurid's jaws found that they were extremely flexible and probably helped kill their prey by crushing it to death rather than slicing its flesh with serrated teeth. ""This is really exciting,"" said study lead author Dr. Juan Martinez de la Fuente, an expert on dinosaurs at Spain's Universidad Autonoma del Pais Vasco (UAPV). ""It tells us something about how these animals ate and what kind of environment they lived in."" The findings also challenge previous conclusions based upon spinosaurid fossils from elsewhere in Europe. The team has dubbed IberoSpinoNatori for this newfound species because both the generic name - meaning ""West European Iberian [branch] lizard"" - and the specific epithet are derived from terms used historically within Spanish paleontology. It belongs to the family Spinonatidae, which comprises five genera: Hypsilophodon, Zephyrosaurus, Majundaratherium, Indosaurus, and Astrophocaudia (the last three previously assigned to Comodracon). None of those names refer specifically or exclusively to Western European forms; only Hypsilophodon and Zephyrosaurus are known from such areas. Thus, the latter two have been placed into subfamilies separate from the Iberonautini, whose members include all other extant and extinct taxa in the subfamily. However, as part of the recent discovery of several additional specimens from modern times, Aragons et al. now argue convincingly that no valid distinction should be made between western and eastern African and South American spinosaurs. By definition, therefore, the same wide distribution covers the entire discography of the subfamily Iberonautinae, which accepted non-European form spinosaurs until recently. Accordingly, we here accept as valid the use of Iberonautini for the remaining extant North-African and West Indian forms plus the new specimens from Lourdes, France, while publishing under the current monotypic designation Astropholius Ibericus and Zephyronautilus lascauxensis respectively. In line with the situation above, we hereby formally synonymize Hypsilophodon, Euparkeria and Protohadrodon as junior subjective synonyms of Astrobactris. We further recognize as a senior subjective synonym Cycnorhamphus mongoziensis, following the example set forth earlier with Majundaratherium. Lastly, we consider Astraphocaudia aberti to represent a nomen dubium. A similar case will be explored below regarding the long-standing question of whether any hypothetical early Mesozoic theropods evolved dental weaponry like that seen before the Triassic Period, during which tooth crowns became more complex. This view was originally proposed after comparing the teeth of Edmontonia suturalis from the Late Cretaceous Galapagos islands with those of basal sauropodomorphs from Africa and Asia, but later rejected, because the close similarity between them appeared too good to explain by chance alone. Now, however, another hypothesis suggests that a snakelike animal lacking teeth could have brought these features over from the PaleogeneNeogene, when some snakes first began feeding on meat. Furthermore, the presence of a deep oral trench around the jawbones may indicate a diet that included consumption of hard parts like bones and shells. Indeed, spinosaurs are thought to have fed primarily on fish, birds and small reptiles. As such, according to Patricia Vickers-Rich Peter Makovicky, one possible explanation would involve spinosaurs having bitten down onto their victims' bodies, then using ""muscle contractions and even suction along a massive tract of skin inside the mouth cavity to grasp large portions and sever the soft tissues in order to remove and swallow the meal whole. Such behavior seems unlikely outside the realm of crocodiles, turtles, lepidosaurs and fishes."" But if true, it means that spinosaurs had evolved relatively advanced intelligence, foresight, memory, dexterity, coordination and skill to bring off tasks requiring considerable precision, strength and control. And given their size and longevity, each individual might quite possibly have developed sophisticated social skills like teamwork. To improve our understanding of the evolutionary relationships among living examples of carnivorous archosaurs, researchers described three partial skeletons recovered at a site called Les Madelons Quatre Tiers Four Peaks near Montmelian d'Agrives, northeastern France. These remains demonstrate numerous morphological characters traditionally considered primitive for the clade Alligatoroidea, including reduced hind limbs and short tails.

"Scientists from the University of California San Diego have developed a method to create neurons. The technique is able to convert astrocytes, the supporting cells in the brain, into neurons, which are responsible for communicating with neighboring nerve cells. The advance may lead to new treatments using neural stem cells derived from human embryos or foetuses - something already banned in Canada and New York but permitted under law elsewhere around the world. In early October, federal legislators voted overwhelmingly to lift the ban on research that uses such ""fetal tissue"" after advocacy by pro-life groups, including the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). That decision was made largely because researchers had found ways of deriving safe lines of embryonic stem cells suitable for use as lab models, without relying upon the creation of blastocysts. But supporters say obtaining those same types of stem cell lines could provide an opportunity for far more effective therapies if they can be generated from the nonhuman sources described above. Stem Cells: The Road Ahead? Fertilized eggs are created when sperm enter an ovule; fertilization occurs within one hour of intercourse. A few hours later, a newly formed embryo leaves its protective environment inside the egg and begins dividing until there are about 100 individual blastomeres - cells about three times the size of typical somatic cells (i.e., body tissue). These tiny progenitor cells proliferate rapidly during gestation producing both extraembryonic membranes and definitive tissues like heart, liver, kidney, pancreas and hematopoietic system [1]. Most survive embryogenesis only to die shortly after birth. Those that do not differentiate must undergo apoptosis (programmed cellular suicide) resulting in incomplete organ differentiation and death before day 25 post conception [2]. What makes these unique cells so attractive to developmental biologists is their ability to renew themselves indefinitely while remaining viable outside of the host organism. The most well known experiment demonstrating this phenomenon remains work done at Stanford University in the late 1970s, where Dr. Martin Evans implanted mouse bone marrow (containing haematopoetic stem cells) into 82 newborn SCID mice (severe combined immunodeficiency disease), some of whom then survived beyond six months [3], proving that clonal populations of bone marrow-derived pluripotent cells can populate multiple organs over time. This discovery opened up exciting possibilities for several reasons. First, it suggested that adult mammalian domestic animals might also harbour multipotential stem cells replicating throughout life. Secondly, immune compromised individuals could experience restoration of normal function through infusion of fetal and neonatal blood or other tissues containing undifferentiated precursor cells whose engraftment would influence the balance between T helper 1 (Th1) T Helper 2 (Th2) -like subsets leading to long lasting tolerance to transplanted allogeneic grafts [4-6] Thirdly, a recent report has demonstrated that human umbilical cord blood contains large numbers of immature CD34CD38 stem cells capable of differentiating into multilineage mature peripheral blood cells [7] and fourthly although controversial, therapeutic applications involving autologous transplantation of genetically modified murine cancer cells expressing selective gene products designed to target tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been used successfully to generate experimental cures in preclinical animal models [8]. Taken together these findings have led investigators to believe that somatic cells can indeed transform into fully functional specialized differentiated cells and thus consider further investigations to examine whether naturally occurring stem cells occur in cattle may allow us to explore fundamentals of physiology lost since Darwin's time. This concept is particularly important given current limitations associated with our understanding of development in humans and livestock alike and represents a new frontier in biotechnology providing opportunities for regenerative medicine and agriculture. Indeed generating induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells from bovine fibroblast cultures are now underway, however protocols remain variable and little progress has yet been made towards truly establishing robust IPS cell lines specifically from primary cells obtained directly from living born calves [9]. In theory at least two approaches exist whereby we can isolate and genetically manipulate embryonic stem cells from dairy cows to investigate fundamental questions concerning growth and differentiation. One possibility involves mating traditional bulls to super cow dams who carry genetic defects that result in congenital abnormalities such as dwarfism or lack of horns. Embryos from carrier females could potentially contain mutations caused by recessive genes present in sperm coming from affected sires. However, any fetuses produced via IVF techniques will invariably be maternally derived. Alternatively, the technology exists to produce transgenic cattle carrying foreign DNA sequences introduced selectively into defined regions of the genome. For example, homology recombination mediated insertions of marker genes beneath regulatory elements of select locus control region promoters have been shown to induce expression of reporter genes and regulate endogenous or exogenous genes with similar temporal and spatial patterns [10]. Currently four retroviral vectors are available commercially for delivery of specific DNA segments.

"Jack Ma has been absent from public view for the past two months. His last public appearance was in late October, where he blasted China's regulatory system. This resulted in a strong backlash by Chinese regulators and exchanges against him as well as other early adopters of digital currency. Reached at his home on Thursday evening, Jack Ma had this to say: ""I want you guys (the media) not to write that I left bitcoin because it is collapsing."" He also said that leveraged trading with cryptocurrency speculation in Bitcoin futures markets combined with short selling are responsible for its price collapse. ""It [Bitcoin] may be used only for money laundering or buying drugs but if governments ban it then all these bad things will disappear,"" says Jack Ma. ""So people who use cryptocurrencies should follow laws like everyone else,"" adds Ma. If anyone believes in free speech, they can look up my tweets instead! pic.twitter.comNZR7B6nftE - jack ma (jackmacn) November 22, 2018 Ma started working on blockchain technology more than 10 years ago when it first emerged. But he didn't get into cryptocurrencies until 2014, about five years later. At press time, Bitfinex shares were down over 20 year-to-date. The company, which holds an estimated 1 billion in client funds, suspended withdrawals earlier today after reports surfaced over concerns about its cash position. Earlier this week, the exchange reported it lost around 400 BTC and some fiat currencies through hacking attempts. However, there have been no specific claims made regarding stolen crypto assets. ""When we took our support off Ethereum Classic, it cost us about 40 cents per coin,"" explains Ma, adding that recurring costs associated with supporting altcoins would run higher than expected. Still, even with their loss in value, these larger cryptos remain valuable commodities thanks to relatively high daily transaction volumes. And many investors see them as long term store of wealth, especially given recent volatility. A January survey conducted by research firm Cinnober found that 12 percent of surveyed Americans believe Bitcoin has potential to become one of the world's most important inventions of the 21st century. Others are optimistic about the future prospects of Ethereum too. According to a study released in August 2018 by eToro, about 53 of respondents expect ETH prices to rise significantly, while 25 expect those gains to be modest. Ninety percent think that adopting Blockchain is inevitable, and 68 foresee Ethereum being adopted above others over the next decade. pic.twitter.comaWfBeF1PJ5 - eToro UK (etoroUK) September 19, 2018 Indeed, Ethereum remains the second largest asset listed on CoinMarketCap behind Bitcoin with a market cap just under half that of Ripple (14.4 billion). It continues to trade in line with expectations, having rallied nearly 50 since July 24, before reversing course and falling back again below 200 following another round of CEO drama. Meanwhile, XRP is still enjoying relative stability, despite losing almost 30 in Q3 compared to the prior quarter. Like the rest of the industry, it seems likely that questions surrounding regulation could put a damper on any further upside. In fact, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, over 70 countries worldwide now limit initial coin offerings (ICOs), including Korea, Malaysia and Japan. In addition to blasting China, Ma also lashed out at ""speculators,"" saying Jamie Dimon - head of JPMorgan Chase Co.- shouldn't worry so much about what happens to Bitcoin.

"Droidlet is a platform for building intelligent agents that simplifies integrating a wide range of machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid prototyping. It can be used to quickly test out different models on real data and then deploy the most promising ones in production environments with little need for specialist knowledge or expertise. In this post, we will introduce you to Droidlets (and what they are), how they work, how many different types there are available, and even give an example application. What Are They? When first introduced by Google AI at IO 2017, ""droidlets"" were defined as: A droidlet is an expert system based around AI components that allow developers to rapidly prototype new applications without needing any deep understanding of advanced concepts such as reinforcement learning and neural networks... A droidlet consists of a black-box algorithm whose performance metrics must be tracked over time - usually using log files - which allows you to measure its success and potentially intervene if it performs poorly. This gives you feedback loops just like those seen across real engineering projects but while being gentle enough to use in increasingly complex systems. You may have heard them referred to more recently under their other name of DRLs - Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems - but these two terms actually refer to slightly different things so don't get confused! The main difference between an agent in an RL setting and a droidlet is that an existing model trained from scratch would generally not start off having any idea about how best to act. Instead, since the entire architecture is designed solely to serve the task itself, all of the decision making decisions are made purely through trial and error exploration with no guidance whatsoever coming from some kind of preprogrammed strategy. That means that unlike traditional approaches where the developer has full control over every part of how the agent acts, instead they only have limited access to information and measurements within their environment during training - the droidlet takes care of everything else while giving the developer complete freedom. In fact, the whole point behind using a droidlet approach is to take away any possible worries regarding long term stability and generalization with respect to the model created; because in practice when trying to apply anything learned before deployment into your own live environment, you won't really know whether it was going to perform well until after several months, weeks or days worth of trials. With droidelets however, due to the nature of the underlying implementation, once deployed the model should remain unchanged regardless of usage frequency or external factors. An additional benefit of the droidlet approach is the lack of requirement for specialized hardware resources especially given recent developments in low power mobile computing platforms; the basic premise here being that running the same experiments again and again could easily exhaust battery life faster than one might reasonably expect. Differently put, with standard RNN techniques applied directly to raw input, trying to make predictions far outside the normal operational bounds results in very large amounts of computation required, whereas with a droidlet application specifically implemented for the problem domain this doesn't need to happen as the overall complexity level does not change depending on context - simply feeding forward inputs as necessary while producing sensible output. Overall, the goal is to create something that works instantly yet isn't necessarily useful unless the user actually trains up a lot of samples by hand according to the definition above. While early implementations of droidelets did require a bit of programming skill, newer libraries now support scripting right inside Android Studio, freeing users who also happen to possess that skill set from ever having to write code. Over time, as creators come together towards similar goals to better cater for specific problems, this area continues to grow and develop thanks to constantly improving technology. So let's dig deeper below to find out exactly what makes each type of droidlet special and why you might choose to go down one route rather than another... Types of Droidlets You Can Build Yourself Like I mentioned earlier, though using the word 'agent' sounds accurate in describing typical RL scenarios, unfortunately this term tends to pick out both the human operator of the agent alongside also the software itself. Confusing stuff indeed and fortunately there's been quite a development push underway to eliminate ambiguity surrounding terminology in this space recently leading to our current situation today. As a result, we believe it should be stated clearly that Droidlets themselves aren't the same thing as humanoid robots nor do they employ true self-driving capabilities. None of the examples mentioned thus far would technically qualify either as they rely on continuous direct supervision via an operator throughout testing execution periods - not least because, when dealing with actual live production environments, humans will always inevitably take charge of the process due to safety concerns related to autonomous vehicle adoption. So, what exactly is a droidlet then? From our perspective, a droidlet should primarily contain the following four pieces: a predictive ability. Provided an appropriate starting state, the aim is to automatically learn how best to behave without requiring explicit intervention from a human trainer; . The reason provided to expect proper behaviour to originate from getting rid of and tagging along the ability, the purpose of ""manual laboriousness, when working",0,608

"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be encrypted by default in addition to building end-to-end message encryption into all versions of its mobile apps, and for developers to use it when they build their own software. The move is intended to prevent third parties from spying on users' private conversations. It's also aimed at helping people who want to keep their communications away from governments or other government agencies like Apple Inc., which recently said it would encrypt iPhone backups stored on iCloud servers unless customers opt out. Facebook has been criticized before over whether user data was being adequately protected; after this announcement, it'll have another talking point: ""We are now using strong end-to-end encryption by default"" for many services, Mark wrote. And he confirmed what we've reported previously about how much money the company makes off advertising. If you're not familiar with the story so far, here's an overview of where things stand right now. You can read more details on our sister site ZDNet later tonight. All your messages are safe at least until May 1st! With this new policy change, Facebook unveiled two major goals. One goal is to push the public forward toward adopting stronger privacy protections for everyone including those whose voices may often be drowned out due to minority status, such as women and ethnic minorities. The second goal is to make sure that no matter what device someone uses to access these tools, their content will still remain secret. Both of these goals could benefit society as a whole, but there could be some drawbacks if something goes wrong. For example, companies might inadvertently leak customer information or become vulnerable to hacks because of lax security practices (like Heartbleed). In exchange for avoiding any real downsides though, Mark suggested that his firm had developed better ways to protect user privacy than others currently available and argued that business models built around selling user data were weakening free speech online. Here's the full statement from his team and me: At first glance, this doesn't look good for either side of the encryption debate. On the one hand, it seems reasonable that businesses should be able to monitor their employees to ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing employee behavior and corporate decisions. But Mark says this won't happen again without warrants issued based on probable cause that justify surveillance. If history serves us well, however, finding evidence against criminal activity isn't always easy, and even when prosecutors do find it, judges sometimes aren't willing to sign search warrants based solely on allegations presented through anonymous tips. That means lawyers working for police organizations or intelligence groups need help investigating potentially illegal activities and gathering enough evidence to present them to courts. Does Mark really think law enforcement needs less power to investigate potential violations? Plus, don't most of us imagine our bosses being annoyed when we talk behind their backs, rather than holding back until a warrant expires? Wouldn't it be preferable to avoid having such discussions altogether? Letting tech firms decimate worker rights while providing little protection for human dignity doesn't seem wise. Shouldn't social networks also agree to limit the amount of profiling done about users? Although he didn't say nearly as much in his post, it seems clear that regardless of the pros and cons of his plan, Mark understands offering fewer services to individual consumers is probably a bad idea given current concerns. Still, I'm glad to see him committing in writing. This is particularly significant since Mark just dropped 2 billion worth of stock last week. Finally, although Mark made a lot of points about protecting speech and encouraging innovation, it seemed odd to include messages about Russia Today International broadcasting fake news stories on American soil. Perhaps we missed something in the long press release. Don't hold your breath waiting for Facebook to reverse itself in the coming months, however. Despite lots of advocacy work done at Facebook HQ, it took years for Google to adopt HTTPS support across Android. There's plenty of reason to believe that Mark's efforts will fall short of their original promises too. However, until then, let's hope his statements provide protection from potential abuses by authorities, employers and individuals alike.

"PredPol is a software that claims to use an algorithm to predict crime in specific sections of a city. Several police departments in the US have been quietly experimenting with this predictive policing tool, and now it's ready for prime time. On August 11th 2015 at exactly 10am sharp, Edina Police Department (EPD) officers began streaming into their respective sectors - East Precinct, West Precinct, South Precinct, North Precinct - to begin patrolling those areas. For these four hours each officer was assigned to his or her sector and only worked eastwest streets within that particular area. This type of rotation creates overlapping coverage which helps ensure all parts of the community are accessible by law enforcement during any shift cycle. The EPD also set up manned checkpoints as well as heightened visibility near schools and commercial districts centered around major thoroughfares leading into downtown Minneapolis; they were looking out for suspicious activity and targeting known criminal hot-spots. This ""real world experiment"" started off small but quickly grew bigger after other agencies began asking about what we used out here in Minnesota. At the end of two weeks the four precincts had 65,000 live patrols on duty; according to the department more than 500 officers participated in some form of patrol during this period. The idea behind Predpol originated from Ian Millington, a former Chief Constable at Wiltshire Constabulary UK National Crime Agency who currently works part time at MIT Lincoln Laboratory researching counter terrorism operations. In response to the success he saw from sharing information between local first responders such as fire departments and police forces in Europe, Mr. Millington decided to create a similar platform for America using data gathered over recent years and decades through arrests made across the country. He even took advantage of open source footage of incidents recorded via citizen videos shared onto YouTube and Facebook pages like Storify.com to train his algorithm and fine tune its accuracy before using it against American cities. According to Mr. Millington: ""You can take something like Wikipedia where you get lots of content, peer reviewed [content], then add a layer of technology that pulls down everything else."" Whether people consider it factually accurate or not depends on how deeply one digs into that 'layer of technology.' If someone disagrees with the Predpol software's predictions based on real events, there isn't much recourse available in most countries outside of contacting relevant investigative authorities and waiting for police to investigate the discrepancy. It takes too long to wait when lives are being lost and property destroyed every day due to police intervention. There is no chance of getting any legal redress unless you catch the culprit red handed committing a crime. Even if you manage to secure a conviction relating back to your case, the judge has already ruled you guilty. That means you've already paid your dues for what happens next. You could always try to sue, but many do not believe Predpol will ever be proven to be completely factual because there is no way to actually prove a negative assertion. Sure, you may argue that maybe the scriptwriter got it wrong and the actor didn't act the role correctly, and so forth. However, just like eyewitness testimony can lead to false convictions, proof does not exist to dispute Predpol's assertions either. Furthermore, even though the public knows little about EDP's internal training protocol, the reality is they may suspect that they're following guidelines closely calibrated specifically to match the Predpol predictions, thus increasing the chances of producing results that match them. In 2012 when the LAPD conducted research on the subject, they found that 80 percent of crimes predicted would come true while 16 turned out false positives. After analyzing several thousand cases they came to a conclusion that showed Predpol performed better in predicting high priority violent crimes such as rape, murder and robbery compared to lower level offenses. On average 43 of homicides were accurately identified by the program, 75 - 85 of rapes, 68 - 92 of robberies and 60 - 94 of aggravated assaults were successfully flagged by the system. When measured against actual arrest rates these figures rose significantly to 93, 91, 96 95. How often did the Predpol software flag crimes? Over half of all reported crimes occurred and accounted for in total 8 of arrests. These numbers are slightly higher than previous studies showing 14 accuracy overall, however this number comes under scrutiny since they don't account for unreported or unrecorded occurrences. Based on official reports alone, 2,500 domestic violence contacts were missed in 2011 and 1,700 sex offense encounters weren't flagged by Predpol that same year. To make matters worse, the FBI database contains less reliable records and has problems keeping track of repeat offenders. Meanwhile, according to 2013 census estimates, 41 million Americans lived in poverty. While homelessness continues to increase, Predpol still predicts 678 homeless individuals living in shelters and abandoned buildings.

"Austria-based Cyclotech and Japanese delivery firm Yamato have partnered to create a concept delivery drone. The CCY-01 will use a thrust vectoring propulsion system developed by Cyclotech that will enable the aircraft's front winglets to make constant 360 turns at speeds up to 150kmh, according to Reuters. The plan is for the UAV to be deployed in Japan in 2020 as part of an effort to reduce road congestion. In one scenario, the vehicle could deliver packages across urban centers using roads with three lanes or less. It would also carry small objects such as medication when there are no other options available. CycloTech hopes that its technology - which combines propeller blades attached to their own electric motors with forward-mounted airfoils called ""fins"" - will help overcome problems faced by existing drones including safety concerns from traffic controllers and restrictions on operating hours imposed by governments due to noise pollution. Its previous work has included developing a helicopter-like unmanned aerial taxi service for Japan's Shinkansen train network, but this marks its first foray into delivering goods.

"A Windows zero-day exploit tool was stolen from the NSA's Equation Group by Chinese threat actors, who used the tool for years before the flaw was patched. A hacking group calling itself Shadow Brokers dumped a trove of exploits on Friday that they allege were taken during an attack last year in which attackers breached tools belonging to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), or 613 Office. The dump includes plenty of malware and other spyware developed by the U.S.'s advanced cyberweapons team called The Equation Group, including legitimate software to steal banking credentials as well as malicious Trojans, keyloggers and more. But there are also some unconfirmed claims about another type of espionage tool: one targeting air traffic control systems around the world. That claim comes with its own set of questions - such as whether it was ever actually deployed at all. We're still trying to figure out what is real and what isn't in this massive dump released late Monday night. Even so, based on our reporting, here's what we know now: Experts say no actual threats have been discovered yet. And many believe all of these vulnerabilities date back to 2013 through 2015 when equating groups operated under MSS direction. We've divided everything into three categories: Something For Your Pants, something you should be worried about and finally, something everyone else should worry about but probably won't. Something For Our Pockets The whole point of writing this post is to try and make sense of a bunch of data dumps that contain multiple types of code. Some attacks take advantage of known bugs while others use unknown ones, either by exploiting new ones or figuring them out. In nearly every case, however, researchers can read traffic between the computer system being hacked and its hacker and understand how things work. As long as people keep using computers, hackers will keep finding ways to break into those systems. Of course, most security experts would rather not see any information published online because it could cause big problems down the line if the right person sees your name and IP address. Investigators first began analyzing evidence leaked earlier this month from the reclusive Dark Side Club, whose members include former CIA agents involved in cyberwarfare programs like Tailored Access Operations (TAO). Those documents contained numerous files detailing undisclosed flaws in several different popular operating systems, including Microsoft Vista, Windows 7, 8 and 10; Apple OS X Yosemite, Mavericks, El Capitan and Sierra; as well as Linux versions dating back to the 4.0 kernel version. Most people think of viruses as malicious codes designed to destroy hardware or infect PCs, but if you remove ""virus"" entirely from your definition, just imagine a piece of code nobody has seen before. Viruses aren't necessarily pieces of executable code, instead they can be entire runs of instructions that wreak havoc without leaving behind recognizable traces. They might even allow someone access to information hidden deep inside PC hard drives. Because viruses rarely appear alone, they usually need help getting onto their target machines and that means human interaction. Hackers stealing secrets have made taking out specific targets part of their job description. It doesn't matter where you live or how secure your networks are virus makers want somewhere to deploy their creations. These days, companies regularly hire contractors to do remote reconnaissance and maintain relationships with overseas spies. One common example is hotel Wi-Fi hotspots. From there, hackers often attempt crack passwords, login credentials and gain root level access to victim devices. They may then install trojan horses, botnets and other illicit software. Sometimes they leave little clues, like modified file names or screen shots containing binary strings. Many of these exploits become available through underground message boards frequented by miscreants looking to sell each other useful tidbits of otherwise hidden knowledge. If you search for ""rootkit sqlite"", you'll find plenty of places asking for similar pieces of kit acquired via raids against foreign government agencies, military contractors, financial institutions or large corporations. You never really get yourself anything new unless you pay dirt. Cybercriminals don't operate anonymously or simply remotely, they sometimes put themselves directly next to victims. By paying vendors cash up front, criminals establish relationships that eventually lead to compromised servers or hijacked databases filled with bank account numbers, social security numbers, encrypted messages and lots of personal details. On top of that, once intelligence organizations discover a particular vulnerability, they typically publish software updates publicly within weeks and patching systems becomes tantamount to survival. When faced with a choice between jail time and working for free someday as a penance for screwing over millions, ordinarily responsible people take the latter option. This makes it easy for anyone to download patches meant only for targeted individuals. Unfortunately, that process creates greater opportunities for mischievous actors to hijack vulnerable public services like air traffic controllers, power plants, water treatment facilities, nuclear energy grids and much more.

The Big Cryptocurrency Conference Has Just Wrapped Up So What Happened At BTC-e Expo In Milan Yesterday? Well first off, I was able to catch a few minutes at the end when CEO Alexander Borodin gave his closing remarks as he announced plans to launch ""Bitcoin2"" - which sounds very similar to the much anticipated plan outlined by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterins speth project called Casper - but with less buzz surrounding it because its mainnet date isn't until next month. ""The world takes note,"" said Alex after introducing himself and explaining why he came from Russia because good timing:), ""It seems people are finally ready."" He went into detail about their new mining pool naming agreement with Hashnest saying they would pay back every miner who contributes blocks to the blockchain helping miners earn rewards faster. They want to simplify things for everyone including exchanges, wallets, developers and users all while keeping costs low. Their ASIC designs are already being released today along with a version of Bitcore v0.20 the open source reference client for full nodes. You can read the press release below: Their engineering team were invited into the mining pools themselves to observe firsthand how well PoW works as compared to other consensus algorithms before making these changes. This is truly fascinating stuff. Their goal with this transition is to provide a platform on which any exchange can potentially host their own Counterparty node giving them instant access to real time balances of any asset. By doing this, they hope to build trust between exchanges and users. To do this though requires massive amounts of computing power. Hence, hashpower on the network needs to increase significantly. ""So far we've set us an initial target to achieve 600 THash per second,"" said Alex, ""For comparison, Bitcoin is 21 millions hashes per seconds now, Litecoin 725k etc.. All of these numbers are measured at 100THash per watt. A typical PC graphically capable user spends roughly 50 watts which limits its hashing performance to 200THashsec. Which currently translates to 0.00024 of Bitcoin's hashing capacity."" Now let me state the obvious here; That number sucks. Let's be honest. Nobody wants to spend their entire day sitting behind a computer running one program analyzing data for hours only to get rewarded with fractions of Satoshis. Basically, if someone doesn't use it 247 then it's worthless. Enter Hashnest which offers a service for individuals or enterprises interested in getting hardware put together to mine bitcoin. Using parts supplied by AMD, GPUs, CPUs or FPGAs Hashnest aims to make sure large scale deployment occurs smoothly without having to go through setting everything up yourself. Currently, Hashnests services are free until October 31st 2017. After that cost starts climbing from 1 USDUSD to keep units fully functional. Though the technology itself might sound appealing enough - anything built on top of it is going to benefit accordingly. Given the amount of hype happening in the space right now it shouldn't take long for customers to realize and demand higher hashrate availability from their chosen provider.

"The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (Star) is the first robotic system to plan, adapt, and execute a surgical plan in soft tissue with minimal human intervention. It recently performed laparoscopic partial nephrectomy on an ex vivo kidney harvested from an animal model. Laparoscopy was invented by German surgeon Georg Kellinghusen.[1] He used this procedure for his patients; however, he lost most of them because it became so difficult that surgeons spent more time repairing damage than doing surgery. His work inspired Wilhelm Hertz,[23] who developed the electrohydraulic device known as the ""Surgitron,"" which could perform both endobroaching and blunt dissection but had only limited use in suturing due to its size and weight. The Surgitron's analog, developed years later, would become the da Vinci robot, or Intuitive Surgical Inc.'s flagship product DaVinci, marketed since 2003. In 1987, David Barone at Harvard Medical School noted that existing mechanical devices would be too bulky and costly if they were ever to replace the current gold standard and cure cancer cells while leaving normal surrounding tissues intact - a goal the researchers sought after working closely together through their respective laboratories. However, after performing numerous experiments over several months, George Cotsarelis, George Karasek, Wolfgang Otto and Mary Ann Steiner realized that it might not even be possible to achieve such objectives using available technologies.[4] Although these attempts were unsuccessful, their research laid out the groundwork for many future developments in medical robotics[5], including Star: The World's First Robotic System To Plan And Perform An Operative Procedure Without Human Assistance. FIGURE 1A - Diagram Shows How Star Works Inside the torso are the lungs, heart, esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large colon. These organs all have distinct anatomical features that must be taken into account when planning and executing the operation. Figure 1B-D shows how Star works. The camera shown here can capture images and video up to 5MP in resolution. This image was captured during an experiment where we simultaneously injected two different fluorescent chemicals into separate regions of the body. We then placed a virtual pin marker inside each one of these areas, and requested Star to make sure we didn't run into any obstacles along our way. After 30 minutes, the robot returned and successfully found the correct location without our help. More details about this experimental process will be published soon! Click on the diagram below to see a larger version. Each organ has unique landmarks near the surface that the surgeon may want to avoid damaging. For example, some locations have delicate blood vessels that should remain functional. Others contain nerve fibers that need not be harmed. Most importantly though, each organ needs to be separated precisely enough from other structures that cutting one causes no harm to the others. As illustrated above, Star uses a preloaded 3d model specific to every patient to determine what safe distance to keep between itself and nearby vital structures before carrying out the planned operative task. Once determined, Star performs minimally invasive tasks within those boundaries safely and quickly, minimizing human involvement. What makes Star especially innovative is that it does not blindly follow computer instructions but instead intelligently decides based upon external factors like light sources, cameras, pressure sensors, and various angles of view projected onto physical surfaces. This approach allows Star to take into consideration and react appropriately to deviations from the expected path it takes, thus preventing accidents and ensuring safety throughout the entire procedure. Using real data obtained directly from the patient during surgeries across multiple institutions, Star learns from past mistakes and improves its capabilities continually. Patient Safety - A prevailing concern among physicians has been whether robots pose a greater risk to patients than even highly skilled humans. Over twenty years ago Hideo Kodaka demonstrated a mouse operated orthopedic drilling machine whose performance matched that of experts and produced results equivalent to or better than traditional open bone sawing techniques [6]. While being similar to today's state of art robotic systems, Kodaka's invention lacks the ability to interact meaningfully with users beyond pushing buttons, scanning instruments, and monitoring the status of equipment. Over the last decade, significant advances in microelectronics made machines like Google DeepMind AlphaGo capable of learning new skills entirely independent of previous experience. Such ""intelligent agents"" require no prior training and learn autonomously starting from scratch. They also do not rely solely on programmed rules, nor do they necessarily conform to rigid algorithms. Instead, intelligent agents reflect important aspects of the cognitive processes underlying expert human problem solving. As described earlier, existing robotic systems lack the autonomy necessary to complete complex procedures on their own, thus requiring constant supervision and correction by still active users of the same technology. By contrast, Star plans and executes each step completely independently, taking full advantage of advanced AI software tools to attain competency rapidly without needing user input. The company estimates that much more trained user time is eliminated altogether to trainable mechanisms produces a testabilities linked to tests.teststestables) testing out testability test, testing mode testabilities;). durations go",0,627
"Scientists have observed electrical activity similar to the brain activity of premature babies in lab-grown brains. The lab-grown brains are simplified versions of the organ that is grown in a dish or jar, and they could be used as models for understanding how fetuses develop early on in life. The study was led by Dr. Laura Bierman from Stanford University School of Medicine's Department of Molecular Cellular Physiology (MCP) at its Medical Center campus. Her team aimed to better understand how neural stem cells - which can grow into any type of neuron in the nervous system - develop before birth and throughout childhood. In their work published online this week in Nature Neuron journal, the researchers developed an array containing more than 10,000 electrodes called iCell GeNeuro, which provides data about how these cells behave when stimulated with different signals. ""One thing we found out through our research is there were very rich interactions among individual neurons within these complex networks,"" says co-author Ryan Meehan, PhD, who joined the faculty at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health after working with Bierman previously. ""We're trying to capture what makes those connections happen so we can learn even more."" During fetal development, the first roughly 60 days, the human embryo is not yet capable of independent thought; it relies almost exclusively on external stimuli such as hormones and other environmental factors. But between 40 weeks gestation and delivery the fetus starts developing its own internally generated electric fields. These static currents help direct movement patterns and create small muscle contractions, but the nature of those waves remains poorly understood. ""In previous studies researchers had tried to record nerve cell spikes using electrode arrays, but these efforts proved challenging because each spike travels down one strand of axon, making them hard to detect unless simultaneous recordings are made across multiple strands,"" explains senior author Bierman, Ph.D., director of the Brain Initiative Lab at Stanford.",0,629

"Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond s are one of nature's hardest materials, but they tend not to occur naturally on Earth because it takes very high pressures (1 million times higher than what occurs in the deepest part of our planet) for them to form from carbon under normal conditions. Now, researchers say that this new method could be used to make diamond deposits on earth as well as create synthetic diamonds on other planets like Mars or Ceres in space - an idea NASA is studying right now. The technique also has potential applications beyond mining and manufacturing purposes; its use might help determine whether certain types of hydrocarbons can sustain life. The study was published today in Science Advances. Diamonds aren't easy to find Discovery of natural diamonds was once considered to be rare phenomena, but recent studies show otherwise: diamonds appear to be abundant within meteorites and ice samples taken by spacecraft during their journeys through outer solar system destinations such as Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan. Scientists estimate there are roughly 1 billion carats (one carat equals 200 milligrams) worth of these gems lying beneath the surface of those bodies. That would amount to more than 1 trillion worth of gem quality material if properly mined. [What Is 'Ice Billionaire' Elon Musk Worth?] This places the research behind creating artificial diamonds and harnessing the element known as carbon next to real-world possibilities. ""If you want to get down production,"" says Luca Bindi, lead author of the paper who works at both Stanford and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ""you need one thing above all else: pressure."" Despite being one of the most common elements on Earth, making a single atom out of it requires extremely high temperatures and long periods of time. A typical laboratory setup uses up to 15 gigapascals of force - about 100 million atmospheres - along with hundreds of degrees Celsius over many hours or days to accomplish just this task; it doesn't take much longer than 5 minutes until someone starts fiddling with your diamond to destroy it. This makes perfect sense when we think about how hard diamond really is. It contains 90 percent carbon atoms bound together by 60 hydrogen bonds per square nanometer - basically, lots of small buildings packed tightly together. Such a structure makes it incredibly resistant against chemical etching and easily damaging physical forces. In fact, according to past experiments conducted at Harvard University, diamond appears immune to friction and any kind of wear associated with erosion, meaning it lasts forever unless something actually cuts or wears it away entirely. But even though diamond turns out to have some amazing properties for industrial application, it still isn't stable enough for everyday human consumption. Before going out to dinner, you'd better ensure that your food won't explode or spontaneously combust upon contact, lest anyone lose his appetite. Even then, you'll probably leave your house without worrying too deeply about whatever happens when you're gone. And yet, despite having no atmospheric constituents capable of destroying itself, diamonds remain fragile due to their unique atomic arrangement. If left alone, carbon can only endure so much stress before self-destructing. So scientists had to come up with ways to put extreme pressure onto them while keeping the temperature relatively steady. How do you snuff out a fire? You don't try putting water on top of it. Instead, you pour oxygen directly on it. But where does free oxygen exist outside of Earth's atmosphere? On Venus, scientists believe water vapor bridges between plants and clouds, which trap sunlight and turn it into energy that travels back toward us - thus fulfilling most definitions of photosynthesis. Similarly, methane gas molecules on mars extend chains far across the Martian landscape by connecting themselves via hydrogen bonding, allowing light to pass freely throughout large areas covered in dirt and sand. These two examples helped inspire Bindi and his colleagues to consider exploring similar mechanisms in more distant locations. If hydrocarbon gases existed on icy bodies like Ceres or Uranus, perhaps some combination of heating and pressurization techniques could generate diamonds as well. They began looking for answers on a smaller scale first using computer models and simulations at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. According to the team's calculations, simply applying high levels of CO2 gas to simulated rock surfaces at room temperature should cause clusters of carbon to bond together, forming graphite sheets. However, adding additional heat (5000C), specifically focused around those ""sheets"" created by high concentrations of CO2, caused carbon atoms deep inside to rearrange and bind together to become stronger molecular structures called sp3 crystals. Those later stages required less pressure, making the process easier overall. Also important was giving off extra energy to compensate for the added compression by considering the mechanism's impact on electrons instead of photons - in essence, explaining why the experiment worked. After repeating the simulation four separate times, the results were consistent each time. But none of the same applies quite heavy price constraints could apply again (and thus expectconsideration tests involve ever-lost ratios at the region's eryth function but",0,635

"A study has demonstrated how the sight or smell of a meal can trigger an inflammatory response that guides insulin production. The researchers say their findings could eventually lead to new ways for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity disorders to control blood sugar levels without using drugs Diabetes, obesity, heart disease: These are all more common in middle-aged and older adults who have had Type 2 Diabetes for many years than they were when younger generations first developed it. In fact, according to this report from Medscape Medical News on April 1st, 2014, over one million Americans currently suffer from some form of chronic diabetic complications including kidney failure, blindness, amputations and stroke (and these numbers continue to rise). Clearly, as our health care system attempts to manage individuals with long term, and potentially life threatening conditions like diabetes (as well as other illnesses), there is a need not only for improved medical management but also for better communication between patients and physicians so that patient outcomes may be optimized. This article will attempt to shed light on the latter by discussing current research into ""non-pharmacological"" treatment methods which involve nutrition and exercise. It introduces you to two studies exploring a potential link between sensory experiences and immune function; the implications of those findings for future treatments involving diet andor physical activity; and finally explores related information about whether greater use of occasional fasting might help reduce inflammation in overweight diabetics and non-diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome.

It has been observed in many places around the world - from waterfalls to small streams, to mighty rivers such as the Amazon or Mekong. In this post we will focus on one particular place where both large-scale engineering projects and natural phenomena come together: The huge Shasta Dam outside Mt Whitney, CA (USA). In fact, at 3.2 km long it's so big that even NASA cannot avoid mentioning it! Let's see what happens when two vast bodies of water meet... What does damming do? With its height over 100 metres high, the Shasta Dam stands out like an island amid all the surrounding valleys of California. This picture shows why: Those are most likely mountain chains referred to as ""gorge fillers""; they prevent any surface runoff along those steep slopes from flowing down towards the reservoir behind the dam. Instead, these waters dissipate via lateral erosion or run-offstreaming through meadows. That makes sense since there's no continuous drainage channel with a steady current. And if you look closely, some of the valley fills spoil a view completely by blocking your view for miles until clouds roll in front of them. Even though the massive stone towers of the dam hide much of the landscape, the presence of almost 30 million cubic meters of concrete can be clearly felt here. The material used comes mainly from local mines which provide about 20 of all sand and gravel extracted in US. But besides serving as material supply, dams also change the physical properties of groundwater systems significantly. Because their volume is too great compared to typical aquifer volumes found in nature, they create what are known as impounded basins or reservoirs. A simplified representation of how this process works would go something like this: Water enters the basin through multiple sources. As more lies ahead within the basin, pressure increases continuously. If enough time passes without letting the levels rise further, eventually air locks form between each water body, leading to the formation of lakes with stagnant layers inside. Eventually the lake reaches equilibrium with the surroundings environment after filling up the full volume of the basin. Generally speaking, ground water masses tend to sink below other parts of the earth which lie above it. When gravity fails to move the water sufficiently fast, energy instead gets released in the form of heat. For instance, it was observed that during the building phase of the Grand Coulee Dam (1936) - intended to cure severe flooding problems in Washington State - the level rose 4 m higher than before construction began. Even today, it continues sinking 2-3 cm per year due to weathering processes. Due to this kind of reason, scientists call the phenomenon induced levees. They don't create natural barriers but rather delay failure processes in comparison to geological units built naturally. Treating hydrogeological data mathematically, geophysicists usually assume that dry zones with low permeability located beneath a saturated zone compensate for subsidence effects. Thus displacement becomes increasingly exponential with rising depth. However, if someone wants to build a structure preventing subsurface water from penetrating certain areas and recharging shallower ones, it might not always work out well. Such failures have occurred several times already after the creation of artificial reservoirs; think e. g., of Hurricane Katrina. Where did Shasta Reservoir come from? After completion of Mount Wilson Dam in 1911, much of the Sacramento River's course became unnavigable because the lower part of the American River Valley had become blocked off between Lake Tahoe and Owens Lake Death Valley. To help solve this problem, Congress passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933. One section of this law set aside land for the construction of five dams in order to generate power plants for irrigation purposes. Two years later, the members of the Federal Power Commission adopted a hydropower plan creating Lake Oroville near Mount Lassen in Northern California. Next to capturement facilities, another of the planned structures needed to store water against periods of drought was required. Therefore, the Central Valley Flood Control Association decided to underwrite a project to reclaim floodplains with soil taken from nearby mountains. With the help of engineers hired by the association and Sierra Club, the first steps were made in 1934 by blowing up the existing San Andreas Fault line. Construction started four months later, led by William Pinchot Jr.. Initially conceived as a half-mile dike, the present 650 feet wide structure finally gained a length of 1 mile, including a 988 ft deep canyon. Based on the experience of cataclysmic earthquakes, some safety measures were implemented and made mandatory by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation: There should be a minimum distance of 300 ft from active fault surfaces, 200 ft from unstable sediment deposits. Furthermore, seismically vulnerable buildings should stay away from cliff faces. Another unique feature of the dam is the provision of an army arm spacey that goes out of reality.

Airlines are not required to notify passengers who have been exposed to someone else infected with Ebola or other types of viruses; however, some airlines do so voluntarily because they want to reassure their customers before traveling. It is very rare for people to die from Ebola outside Africa, according to U.S. health officials working alongside local responders. However, there were no signs Wednesday morning at Newark Liberty International Airport where dozens of CDC staff members had gathered to board a flight...to West Africa. As many as 20 of those who contract Ebola virus survive but experience long term complications such as organ failure and neurological problems. While scientists say the system was only supposed to be used during wartime emergencies, Trump told reporters Sunday that his administration may use it even during non-crisis situations like hurricanes and fires. This test also did not cause harm to any humans, animals or wildlife involved. Since then, though, the company later announced in February 2019 that it would stop using this research. In January 2018, NBC News quoted unnamed law enforcement sources saying the system could help detect chemical weapons without invading privacy.

"Zomato has acquired the Indian operations of Uber Eats for around 350 million. The deal will give Uber about 10 percent shareholding in Zomato. Uber Eats customers will be redirected to a new site called ""Uber,"" which is owned by both companies. The company said it was launching various new services under its uber brand including ride-hailing and food delivery with an aim to consolidate all such services under one umbrella across multiple geographies over time. This includes launch of uber cuisines which will allow passengers to choose from different cuisines while ordering their meals. It also plans to build up business like taxi aggregators that can add on top of these offerings. ""This could become one destination within us where you can go into two destinations - Uber as well as uber eats,"" CEO Johann Rupert told CNBC. Shares of Grab fell 2 after hours following news of Uber's acquisition of rival food delivery startup. ""It would have been better if they waited till we were out of this contract (with Amazon) but not everyone lives according to your own set schedule,"" said Alex Mathews, founder at Sorenson Capital. He added: ""What is important right now is how high does Zomato grow or what are other growth catalysts."" Zomato's stock had gained nearly 30 so far this year through Tuesday trading even though its market value dropped 24.4 billion rupees (306m). Then it hit 54 times earnings forecast in June, compared with 16 times average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters IBES. Grab grew significantly last quarter, adding 700,000 users. Its total user base stood at 3.1 million against 1.9 million in March. But some investors remain skeptical whether it can replicate Grab's success in Indonesia and Malaysia outside of Southeast Asia due to competition in those markets. A survey carried out by Bloomberg found only 20 per cent of Malaysians use Grab, with more than half preferring local rivals. However, Dr Kai Kornhuber, an assistant professor of marketing at Singapore Management University who studies consumer behaviour, believes Uber Eats' global footprint and reach make it much easier for them to take advantage of buying opportunities.

"Kings of Leon's new album will be released in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT). There will be three types of tokens with different perks, such as front-row seats for a concert or winning an autographed guitar. The NFTs represent promises to deliver you real goods and services from now on that can never change. Think cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These are digital ""things"" with value because people have agreed they should have it. They're not just pieces of paper; they're worth something at some point in time. The same thing is happening here: Tim Kingsbury promised his followers he would give them one of three exclusive sets when the album comes out. But once the music drops this Friday, each set becomes worthless unless people want to keep their pledge. If nobody wants any of them, then there won't be anything left except empty cardboard boxes. In other words, what we know today could cease to exist if the service fails tomorrow! Just like a promise between two individuals I'll buy dinner next week which can become nullified by the failure of either party delivering on their promise - especially given all sorts of complications around consumer fraud, credit card security issues, etc., blockchain technology has the potential to make those kinds of conditions impossible. That means setting up smart contracts on the Ethereum network (or similar) where each individual who pledges to get that album can check off on its completion process without fear of anyone changing their mind after signing their name down, or taking someone else's money before giving himherselves enough time to fulfill their end of the bargain. This is also why [CEO] Adam Ludwin chose the term 'heroes' for his company instead of saying things like 'blockchain.'

"Starship, SpaceX's next-generation rocket, partially burst apart during ground tests in Texas. SpaceX was conducting some pressure tests with the vehicle. The explosions were not completely unexpected, according to SpaceX. ""The test fire that we just had today is actually part of a series,"" said Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, at an event for investors on Wednesday. ""We wanted to make sure that the system worked before doing any sort of flight."" SpaceX was testing Starship - the company's self-proclaimed ""beyond LEO"" spaceship intended to ferry tourists around Earth orbit - as well as its new Super Heavy booster. This particular mission only involved one stage; the full Starship will have two boosters attached to it, which are also being tested by SpaceX now. That means if this first launch doesn't go smoothly, SpaceX won't be able to escape much damage (if any). This isn't the first time the highly ambitious project has been hit with setbacks: A few months ago, SpaceX suffered major engine blowouts while trying to land one of their Falcon 9 rockets back on Earth after launching into space. When asked about those issues earlier on Wednesday, Musk made clear they didn't really impact what he hoped would eventually become his plan to colonize Mars. In fact, Musk reiterated why he believes humanity needs to get off planet pretty soon. He stressed that sending people to Mars brings up all kind of thorny ethical questions related to things like artificial gravity, long-term life support systems, robotic maintenance crews, etc., but that moving forward right away is vital. ""If you want your kids to live longer than your parents did... you can either sit here or there,"" said Musk. ..."" If you don't think any human should ever visit Mars... then maybe you shouldn't do anything. But I'd say even making such high risk decisions might give you more chance of surviving yourself.""",0,648
"A 122,000-tonne ultra-large natural gas tanker is the first large ship to make an ocean passage of over 10,000 km under autonomous control. Prism Courage made the 33-day voyage from Murmansk in Russia through Europe and on into South East Asia, with a crew of only four people onboard after being computer controlled up until it reached its destination at Singapore's port of Tanjung Pelepas. The upgrade saw all navigation systems replaced by six new diesel generators that powered two electric motors installed onto each propeller shaft; additional battery storage was installed. The self-sufficiency meant no fuel or manual controls were needed during the journey. According to its builders Bremen Shipyard, other ships will be equipped for similar upgrades. Prism Courage departs the quay at the Port of Tanjung Pelepas Medan, North Sumatra - Indonesia 13 April 2018 Credit: AFPGetty Images Transforming vessels Vessel owners have long understood how increasingly sophisticated information technology can transform their vessel operations and reduce costs. But transforming existing ships is never easy as manufacturers are often reluctant to take on such major projects due to both engineering challenges and expense. This has been particularly true when retrofitting existing tonnage. Just look back three decades ago to where we began our story... One of the earliest examples of ""smart shipping"" came 23 years before automatic engines went mainstream. In 1988 ConocoPhillips fitted motorised ballast tanks in support of research undertaken by Shell using computers running IBM PC compatible software code developed by Southampton University (today known as the National Oceanography Centre). By providing data about precisely what they carried while underway this research helped oil companies better understand currents and tides which could affect deliveries. At first these ballasts saved 10 on every tank full but eventually proved so successful that investment quickly turned into cost savings. Today most supertankers use ballasted propulsion. In fact some believe redesigning entire vessels may soon become common practice. Japanese company Daewoo Marine Engineering recently unveiled plans for a 45m long container carrier capable of carrying 11,500 TEUs weighing 1 million tons thanks in part to advances in material science. Building such huge containers requires extensive steel design changes to accommodate more cargo than ever. JRR Holdings president says Smart Ships used to carry one ton per day. Now he expects them to transport 20 tonnes daily This not to mention technological innovations like radar sensors, satellite communications arrays and advanced artificial intelligence. All combined mean that safety standards too have improved dramatically for marine operators who seek out cyber security expertise to avoid disaster. However we must also ask whether the benefits outweigh risks? Are there any dangers associated with automated steering and power generation? Could this lead to accidents? Here we explore just what makes smart ships tick. We begin by examining problems associated with poor system monitoring. From here we look at solutions including autonomously managed emergency response centres and remote data collection via modern communication networks. Finally we come to the issue of hacking and cybersecurity threats posed by non state actors. A comprehensive guide to navigating the world of connected deep sea craft follows. When things go wrong aboard even the largest vessels, crews are usually left relying solely on the chart plotter for help. Not anymore! A number of maritime firms now offer collaborative technologies designed specifically for mariners operating high risk areas close to land. It turns out many of these same tools could also assist offshore engineers working in similarly hazardous conditions. For example, they might provide a means of sharing real time sonar images much easier than sending live video feeds wirelessly across vast oceans. So if you're wondering why your fleet isn't always sailing quietly right next door - read on... because you'll probably find something useful along the way. There's nothing quite like approaching a huge floating wave moving swiftly towards you. When faced with such a hazard, alarm bells start ringing straight away making sure sailors know exactly what to do to ensure everyone is safe and sound. Remotely operated vehicle teams need to operate within hours notice enabling them to move assets between vessels safely. Large waves distort depth lines causing significant issues for ROVs. To mitigate against this threat, unmanned surface vehicles are able to navigate depths down to 800ft without distortion. Offshore workers typically rely upon GPS signals to maintain position relative to anchors attached to fixed structures ashore. While reliable and convenient it is vulnerable to interference caused by underwater mountains, wrecks, moorings and cables. Its precision comes at a price however, lagging several seconds behind actual movement meaning potentially dangerous errors can occur. An alternative solution would allow unattended operation whilst maintaining accuracy throughout. As part of a project called UMSatRISP currently assessing the feasibility of satellite based positioning shore side experts monitor seafloor topology remotely thus freeing trackers free to focus on jobs rather than map building. Of course you don't want to spend days sitting around waiting for data to arrive especially when an immense wave looms overhead. Why not fix that problem instead?

It seems every week we have another celebrity coming forward about being sexually assaulted, abused, harassed, etc. So today I wanted to talk about this issue in terms of memes because it always brings up a different type of conversation about these issues. One thing that people definitely don't see when watching comedy shows is that many comedians actually do suffer abuse and harassment (which became apparent since Louis CK came out). Because of this, some comics make jokes towards certain expected reactions based off stereotypes. An example would be someone making fun of a woman who cries like a little girl. Some of those jokes may feel funny and bring laughter but unfortunately people get hurt too. For example take Corinne Fisher, whose life was threatened due to her online persona. Her online presence ended up causing her family to move around the country so she lost contact with both friends and family. She eventually had no choice but to go back to school away from home while trying to figure things out. After graduating college, she went onto law school but quit in order to focus solely on herself. Eventually she got involved with porn and started working more than 10 hours a day. As her career took off she began receiving threats hoping that if she reported the harassers they would stop harassing her. Sadly even though she tried contacting police and social media companies didn't respond well, she still received death threats. These incidents led to emotional distress which lead to self harming then ultimately suicide attempts. A lot of times celebrities are not taken seriously, especially women, which can cause victims to believe that reporting cases won't help much because authorities aren't going to care anyway.

"The reddish-brown'scars' that form on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa are actually etched into the layer of water ice that covers the surface of a potentially habitable subsurface ocean. ""What we think is happening, because there was no other alternative explanation for this coloration on the europan snowman, is that it somehow gets transferred from the red material onto the white parts when they get close enough to each other,"" said lead author Olivier Witasse of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ""This process may happen via evaporation, ejection or just by direct contact between two patches of liquid and solid surfaces together with particles falling off one body onto another. And once these colors have been deposited, they remain stable over time as long as the underlying ice remains pure."" [Photos: Evidence For Water Under The Surface Of A Jovian Moon] Witasse added that it would be very interesting if future flybys reveal whether such large clusters occur more frequently than has previously been thought - which could help explain why some of the icy moons in our solar system seem so tantalizingly similar to Earth. ""We don't know yet what kind of variance can exist,"" he told SPACE.com last week at the Lunar Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) 2017 meeting here in Houston.

Credit: Tanya Harrison LPLCaltech ""There might even be habitats under those layers and you might want to look through them before exploring deeper,"" he mused. Such environments could perhaps harbor life, although material trapped in their depths will likely be extremely cold. ""It means they're pretty good candidates for astrobiology research,"" Witasse concluded. For now though, scientists still need proof that Europa does indeed contain underground oceans of liquid water locked away beneath its frozen exterior, and recent discoveries suggest that progress toward solving the puzzle may soon become easier. In mid-November 2016, researchers using ESA's powerful ground station located at La Palma island in Spain announced that data collected from five flyby encounters between Europe's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft and the outermost Galilean satellite had provided compelling evidence that plumes of water vapor were erupting up out of the south pole regions of Enceladus. Although not entirely sure exactly what mechanism is responsible for this phenomenon, Witasse noted that it appears to originate deep within Enceladus itself - something that any underground sea should certainly facilitate. In January 2015, however, mission team members also reported finding hints of hydrothermal activity emanating from cracks along Saturn's largest moon Titan thanks to strong indications that methane molecules were being released, possibly due to interactions with internal lakes of liquid ethane. One year later, researchers then revealed that Cassini had observed several clouds emerging directly above the north polar area of Enceladus and forming geysers like structures of water droplets. At present, roughly 2 billion years ago, while all three worlds remained embedded within the gas giants of Uranus and Neptune, much greater tides exerted by the planets caused the giant satellites of Io, Ganymede, Callisto, Mars and Vesta to collide repeatedly. As a result, multiple fragments broke free and formed a number of smaller bodies including Europa, followed by numerous breakups that scattered many of these objects around the orbits where today they reside. These include Titania, Rhea, Oberon, Metis and Dione; in addition, several dozen additional inner rocky planetoids called trojans orbit farther from the sun but lie inside the asteroid belt. According to previous observations conducted thus far though, only Europa seems to possess an extensive amount of internal heat generated from tidal heating and radio emissions. Last month, the European Space Agency launched Europe's first joint venture space science experiment designed specifically to study Europa. Called JuiceFly, the probe consists of four sensors capable of collecting thermal infrared radiation emitted by surface features hidden underneath the ice shell. If anything active exists below the frozen crust, the instrumented device should be able to detect it. Since 2005, countless missions across various platforms have explored the rest of the Solar System, visiting every planet except Mercury. But until next summer, no probes have ever attempted to reach beyond our own planetary neighborhood, testing ideas about possible extraterrestrial habitability. Now, however, NASA hopes the new OSIRIS-REx craft currently en route to the vicinity of the second rock from the Sun will make history by becoming the first U.S.-led mission specifically aimed at investigating signs of alien life elsewhere in the Universe.

"Two plant-based burger companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are set to launch the next versions of their burgers. While both burgers are plant-based, their formulas are quite different. Beyond is focused on its ""bleeding"" process that creates a meaty flavour in almost all of its products while Impossible has been much more selective with its ingredients. Here is our guide to help you decide which one will work better for your dog (and if it matters at all). Beyond Meat Burger vs Impossible Burger: Ingredients List The two burgers share similar lists of nutrients, but differ greatly when talking ingredient-by-ingredient. Each company claims that they have developed an innovative new production method that makes them healthier than traditional animal-based foods. Both companies use wheat protein as one of their main ingredients along with soy oil and nitrogenous compounds such as peas or mung bean flour. However, beyond uses pea protein instead of soy isolate and lacks red food colourings and preservatives while impossible contains egg white powder, emulsifiers and stabilisers. Check out these complete nutrition facts below! Does Your Dog Need Protein? Protein is essential to maintain muscle mass and support bone health - both vital for growing dogs. For adult weightlifters, around 1 gram per pound of bodyweight can be used daily. How Healthy Is Chicken? Chicken breast (breast fillet) is considered healthy by many experts considering how relatively low in fat, cholesterol and sodium it is. It also provides good sources of iron, vitamin B12, niacin, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc among other nutrients. Unfortunately, processed chicken tends to contain high levels of sugar and salt because processing speeds up cooking times to make it taste great. The best way to ensure that your dog gets enough protein from his meals is to feed him regular ground chicken rather than whole chickens. If he doesn't like this texture, consider adding some cooked eggs into his meal. Not only do eggs provide extra protein, but they add calcium and vitamins too thanks to the shell. Alternatively, try adding cereal grains such as rice krispies or corn flakes or veggies like carrots, celery and broccoli. You could even go further back to oats, fruit and nuts. Since human studies show no adverse effects after consuming certain amounts of tofu, it might not be harmful either. Read our article about feeding dogs well so you know what type of diet works for any breed. Ingredients found in Beyond Caution 1: Soy Soybeans are extremely popular in American diets due to their affordability, convenience and versatility. Popularly added to sauces and dressings, they offer potential benefits including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer according to science. Besides providing phytonutrients and Omega 3 fatty acids, soy may prevent age-related declines in cognitive function. Apart from being part of nutritional supplements sold online to people looking for ways to improve brain power, most commercial pet treats have nothing to do with natural soybean products. They usually made from indigestible proteins derived from bacteria...or worse, chemical additives. Thankfully there's now naturally gluten free alternatives available too. Know where your pet got yours Ingredients found in Beyond Caution2: Peas Lentils If you're worried about whether your dog needs protein given his size, then lentil and pea beans are likely safe options. According to research conducted by Cornell University scientists, consumption of leguminous pulses improves blood lipid profiles, reduces inflammation and lowers BMI without causing negative impacts like bloating associated with higher intakes of carbohydrates. Plus, both types of beans are inexpensive, making them suitable choices for those who want to invest in quality nutrition for their pets. Read More: Why Dogs Should Avoid Garlic What Are Nitrates And Chlorates In Food? Nitrites and chlorinates are commonly used artificial preservatives often confused with each other. Although both can be fatal if consumed in large quantities over short periods of time, nitrite-containing products were banned in dog foods under FDA regulation in 1986. Many years later, USDA regulations reaffirmed this decision, stating that ""NITRATE LEVELS SHOULD NOT EXCEED 15 ppm."" Chlorinated water treatments applied to areas deemed 'at risk' prior to Hurricane Sandy resulted in New York City drinking supplies containing high concentrations of chlorine dioxide ranging between 0 - 25.

"This article follows the story of Kayode, an A-grade student that was studying at one of the country's most elite educational institutions who turned to cybercrime during the pandemic. The novel is a unique perspective on how the Nigerian education system puts its students in danger and reveals some of the realities about life under lockdown. Kayode had been driving his way home from college when he received a call from someone named Iyke asking if he could hack into Access Bank's email account and send emails using their data (a practice known as ""spoofing. Kayode said he never did anything like this before, but knew he would have no problem doing it for free money; so he agreed. He told me there were other people involved with him. But he didn't know them by name. It wasn't until later that they revealed themselves to be members of Jinka which is a hacking group popular among Yoruba boys - mostly active within Nigeria's south western region. For 20 minutes or more they kept calling back and forth trying to get instructions and help from each other. Eventually it got too much for Kayode to take any longer. Waking up early the next morning he decided against the idea because he thought the university might notice something going on and report him. Instead he went straight home and asked his mother to discreetly delete all the messages and photos sent between him and the hacker. She promised she wouldn't say anything. After that things happened very fast. His phone started getting hacked almost every day. First they'd use WhatsApp to impersonate a teacher. Then they'd mess around with my Facebook profile pretending to be friends with me. They found out where I lived and took pictures and videos of me walking outside my house. My brother saw it online. When we read through these posts, we couldn't believe what we were seeing. We realised our lives weren't safe anymore. This person had access to everything. People are supposed to trust teachers but not anymore after this incident. No matter how many times you tell your parents nothing will stop happening. They promise nothing can happen [to us] again even though it keeps coming back exactly the same. Today is Monday, June 30th 2020. Almost two months since the start of coronavirus. For those of us still alive today it has been made clear that the virus is far less deadly than first anticipated. On April 13th ministers claimed over 1 million cases nationwide- now there are 2.5m. According to news reports only 41 deaths have occurred so far due to Covid19. In comparison, Nigeria lost 3200 during Biafra2 War. And 45000 in the Civil War3. Some experts think the real number may be closer to 150000 dead4. All schools, colleges, universities remain closed. There is strict government control on movement leading to mass unemployment. Many Nigerians are literally starving. Food shortages are widespread across the country. Government statistics show just 4.8 of Nigerians have access to sufficient food while 8.1 struggle to meet daily requirements. With millions unemployed and hungry, drug dealers are thriving buying stocks off consumers. Crime rates soar. ""Drug dealing"" drugs includes hard drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine and also common substances such as weed (known locally as 'shisha and prescription medication. These drugs are easily available and cheap. Dope is everywhere. It's normalised. Families are being broken apart leaving children without fathers. Relationships suffer. Youngsters make bad choices...Here's a case study: Coronaviruses don't discriminate. As long as you breathe air circulating somewhere else you're vulnerable. Anyone working in healthcare is especially susceptible. Nurses, doctors, hospital cleaners, janitors etc are hit hardest by infection. If infected are unable to work then hospitals have nowhere to go. During earlier outbreaks nurses have taken time away from caring for patients to either self isolate in their homes or look after sick family members. Now their exposure risk increases dramatically. So if a nurse contracts the virus the impact is felt beyond her health alone. Patients become fearful - rightly or wrongly depending upon the level of care they receive-once exposed. Fearful of contracting the disease the patient may refuse treatment further exacerbating the situation. Quarantines are difficult for everyone involved. Parents fear their children becoming infected or dying. Students worry about school closures affecting exams results. Doctors and nurses dread returning to work. Because of poor supplies, equipment can't always be used properly. Overworked staff can fall ill themselves resulting in more infections. To avoid transmission employers often require workers to wear face masks. Even with appropriate protective gear doctors, nurses, technicians continue to contract the viruses. According to estimates theirs more than 1700 new cases per day worldwide. More than 95 of those affected recover. However others experience severe illness requiring intensive care unit facilities including respiratory support and dialysis.

"SQLFlow connects SQL and Tensorflow together so that SQL can be used for machine learning. SQL is a popular data storage solution, so implementing machine learning capabilities to work with it just makes sense. I've been working on the project in my spare time over the last year or two as I was wondering if there were any existing solutions like this one out there. There are some different approaches people have taken but they either don't connect SQLTensorflow directly or use outdated technologies (like Keras). This approach uses PyTorch which is gaining popularity right now and has good support for connecting SQL and Python in general. It allows us to build complex models using an abstraction layer. And we only need basic input-output functions: 1 line of code gets you from your database table into tensors. Then, once trained, you can reuse those layers again by calling them between queries instead of having to start all over every query. You end up doing a lot less programming around getting what you want from SQL and starting to train neural networks. But most importantly, because these operations happen at scale inside the GPU cluster, performance is optimal even within larger datasets (one feature of EQL is that its efficient enough that you can train large databases without worrying about performance bottlenecks). We also made sure to make clean separation of concerns between developing our application logic and building sophisticated models. So if we ever do get more involved in MLOps then it will naturally follow the same architectural pattern. For example, adding another model involves looking at how we are going to implement the interface to interface between the two. Another critical topic that came up during development is writing testable components. In particular, testing Tensorflow requires things like NumPy, which isn't always included in enterprise environments, which could pose problems while deploying to production. However, because frameworks such as Pandas automatically generate tables based off collections of DataFrames, I decided to write tests against those too since they encapsulate metadata and business rules separately from the actual operation itself. With this design decision, should the rest of the team depend upon me on their backend architecture, we're not complicating matters unnecessarily. The main features include: Automatic creation of tables using SQLAlchemy's declarative extension Automatic generation of input output python objects from tables via pytorch Ability to perform simple matrix multiplication (and other mathematical operations) using torch.matmul . Support for arbitrary Python modules (including custom ones) to add custom operators. These are useful when creating new types from existing sample data - e.g., converting text strings to integers or handling missing values. This extends beyond simply providing new Numpy array ops, as well; for instance, I added support for SageMaker, allowing users to import sagemaker notebooks as custom module references (i.e., ""import notebookname as nb, using astropy routines and being able to define user-defined functions which accept inputs and outputs. Of course, given that most applications involve reading and writing data, handling missing entries becomes important. Because of this, whenever training happens, a mechanism adds information into the schema describing whether each entry was present in the original dataset and gives an indication of statistical uncertainty for the value based on its presence. Extracting Information From Raw Computations When running multiple iterations of backpropagation through gradient descent on a network, homogeneous results would likely violate your prior assumptions about underlying relationships. Other researchers identified three main reasons why certain methods may fail depending on circumstances: Incorrect priors Not enough samples Insufficient amount of data Used as part of stochastic gradient descent, moving away from deterministic backward pass allow -based algorithms to produce better results when applying lots of similar weights per neuron toward deep nets. Two examples are discussed below, explaining this phenomenon from two perspectives. DeepLab V4 provides both improved segmentation accuracy due to smaller receptive fields and faster inference speed thanks to deeper convolutions and higher activated units. While previous versions had 3x3 convolutional kernels, the latest version has 4x4 competing windows. Shifting Convolutions Beyond the fact that reducing kernel size improves image quality, repurposing small integer arrays (1x1 pixels) inside 2D convolutions produces additional benefits: ImageNet style architectures are usually restricted to fixed width images due to memory limitations - this forces designers to trade off between resolution increase with depth and vice versa. By opening a window across several channels, DeepLab v4 shifts convolutions horizontally across rows of pixels rather than vertically, effectively increasing the number of filters available by size ratio wise. Their comparison demonstrates the differences visually:",0,661
"Jupiter's moon Europa is about the size of Earth and completely covered in ice. Scientists think that Europa has saltwater oceans, which is exciting because this means that it is likely to have life like we do on our planet! The Jovian satellite Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) will visit Saturn's biggest world at some point during its three-year mission - but not until 2030 or 2035 when the spacecraft returns to us from orbit around Uranus. What happens next? Well, nothing. That's all there is going to be for now. For the first time ever, a probe will look as closely at Jupiter - the second largest planet in our Solar System after Neptune, according to NASA - as we are able, with no more data than what we can see here right now. There won't be any follow-up missions; simply because we haven't been told we need one yet. It was decided early on by scientists that an approach such as this would give us unprecedented insights into how these planets form, develop and interact. And they were probably correct. ""After 30 years of planetary exploration,"" says Martin Rees, astronomer royal, professor emeritus of cosmology at Cambridge University and chairman of the European Space Agency's science council: ""it might seem surprising that the final frontier [for space travel] remains unexplored."" But if you take a step back and consider how many times journeys of discovery have happened over history, there should be no surprise at all. The only thing really unusual here is the fact that we've never visited one before. We know so much already. If we don't explore further, then why bother? We're basically asking ourselves: where else could we go? When Galileo Halford made his famous proposal to fly past the outer edge of Mars and study up close something new about its atmosphere in 1610, he wasn't expecting anything other than a polite refusal. Telling him that even though the idea sounded tempting, serious scientific enquiry had better wait for another day didn't exactly wash with this slightly maverick character who'd just discovered four moons of Jupiter himself. No matter how intractable his fellow academics tried being towards him outside work hours, he refused to budge. He wanted to find out something more. Something bigger. A lot bigger. In hindsight, perhaps he shouldn't have pushed things quite so far, and his efforts may well have gone unnoticed today if he hadn't taken advantage of a political loophole. Instead, nobody challenged his plans at all. They were too busy trying to figure out how to stop people getting killed by cannonballs hitting their heads off Mount Vesuvius instead. So with that in mind, let me tell you what we don't know and what we might discover... As someone once said, ignorance isn't bliss. Despite knowing everything we possibly could about Jupiter from satellites such as Voyager 1, Juno, Galileo and Cassini - plus ten years' worth of images returned by Hubble - we still know very little indeed about these giant gas giants. Here's a selection of facts about some unexpected aspects of them which none of those previous probes managed to learn. 1 How Jupiter formed Jupiter took millions of years to grow to its current size. Most massive stars end their lives as supernovae explosions rather than dying gently inside a black hole. Supernova blasts carry away vast amounts of material into space, while leftover stellar dust drifts slowly across galaxies, building themselves into larger collections called galactic nuclei. These structures eventually evolve into large groups of stars known as open clusters. The reason Jupiter survived a similar fate is down to luck. While most supernovae explode fairly quickly, others blast on for enormous periods of time, heating the surrounding environment and creating huge clouds of ionised hydrogen gas which collect together to become the sun. This nearby source of heat meant that the cloud surrounding the star forming 'nucleus' - which contained Jupiter - remained warm enough to allow water molecules to condense further, becoming gaseous ammonia ice instead of solid rock. Then gravity pulled these clumps closer together, forcing them to fuse together under incredible pressure. Once they got big enough, they started to lose energy through radioactive decay and collapse rapidly into dense cores known as protostars, which began fusing metals together within them. Inside each protstar, increasingly hot conditions allowed heavier elements to combine and form helium, oxygen and carbon atoms. This produced heavy gases such as neon and magnesium that mixed with lighter ingredients to make silicate rocks. From these rocky materials, hundreds of thousands of kilometres later, came the core of Jupiter itself, containing 99 per cent of its mass along with 81 per cent of its total volume. Eventually, billions of asteroids collided hard against the growing body, smashing craters deeper and faster than anywhere in the Sun. Yet despite the violence wreaked upon it, Jupiter itself continued to shrink as it cooled any surviving debris left behind by the collision into orbiting chunks that became part of the rest of the planet.

"Amazon has introduced a new initiative called'less packaging, more smiles' that will see the company reduce the materials used for sending out items as well as provide instructions for reusing and recycling boxes. The aim of the program is to help customers buy from Amazon in an environmentally-friendly way by reducing waste. It means plastic bags attached to products will be replaced with reusable returnable boxes so there are no longer any need to throw away those paper inserts made from cardboard or other nonrecycled material. An image shows how some items have now been sent without their traditional packaging All sellers on Amazon are required to follow this policy under the'seller responsibility code.' The eCommerce giant states: ""We want everyone at all levels - employees, suppliers, manufacturers, shipping companies, and partners - all of us play a part in making the world better."" Only goods which qualify as hazardous materials such as batteries, hazardous substances like paintacrylics (some glass bottles) and aerosol canisters still require these kinds of additional measures. Conventional plastics and thin film plastic wraps do not fall into this category. Apple's iMac was among those first to benefit when Apple launched its own fully recyclable box design back in 2011. Other early adopters include Samsung Galaxy Note 4, HP Spectre x360 13,"" Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and Fujifilm S6 Edge. Even Microsoft decided it would make a change after Apple proved others could be successful.

"Elon Musk has asked his Twitter followers to vote on whether he should sell 10 of his Tesla shares.

Elon Musk (elonmusk) A post shared by Bloomberg (businessweek) on Jul 18, 2017 at 12:05am PDT Warren said her proposal will target billionaires like Mr Trump and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates who have recently joined the ranks of those paying lower effective taxes than middle class families thanks to loopholes such as carried interest. Earlier this month Mr Gates donated 3bn (2.4bn), along with other wealthy individuals including George Soros, Michael Dell and David Koch, to fund leftwing causes ahead of November's midterm elections.

"Google employees will hold a sit-in protest to protest retaliation against employees on May 1. In November, more than 20,000 employees walked out to protest against the company's handling of sexual harassment and gender discrimination cases. It's been five months since Google Walkout Day - when thousands of Google workers took part in a mass walkout protesting various issues at the search giant - but some women say that they still feel ""underpaid for doing work no one else wants to do."" Others claim the 70 billion tech industry is dominated by men and that their voices are rarely heard or appreciated. But these two groups couldn't be further apart: The protesters were predominantly white, with few African Americans present. For now, the problem seems to mostly reside among younger generations. According to Pew Research data from last year's survey, almost 90 percent of millennials said there was ""either not enough representation in leadership positions (or) people who look like them getting important jobs and career opportunities,"" compared to just 38 of Gen Xers and 15 of baby boomers. But for those older generations, it can sometimes seem as if progress has stalled. The majority of Google employees surveyed about pay inequality believe that women have lower salaries because they tend to take less risky roles within companies. Frank KnappReuters A recent report found that men make between 80 cents and 1 per every dollar paid to women across all industries. This disparity exists even though many studies show that historically male and female occupations had similar levels of risk. One study showed that only 10 of Fortune 500 CEOs during Donald Trump's presidency were minorities, despite research indicating that black Americans disproportionately suffer negative economic outcomes due to racism.There are several reasons why we don't see greater diversity on Wall Street or Silicon Valley's top ranks. As economist David Autor wrote in his book Why Are There Still So Many Women Coders?, ""Women may face an information barrier that limits access to compensation structures requiring quantitative skills.

"The plant-based meat industry is now worth 800 million and accounts for two percent of packaged meat sales. Both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have started to expand their product lines beyond burgers, roasts, sausages, patties, and bacon; they are offering various cuts (stewing beef pot roast? Or pork shoulder?) as well as new ""meat"" products such as chicken nuggets made from wheat protein (the real thing) or fishless seafood in the form of crumbles that can be added to pasta sauce. While there will surely always be a place at the table for traditional meat like hamburger and steak, many consumers want more than just meat substitutes that taste similar but don't look much different. They want food with a story: something that tells them about its origins, where it has been produced, who guided its production process, how it was raised, fed, processed, and transported before reaching your plate ... show me the backstories! Nowhere else does this happen so prominently as when you order what appears to be an ordinary burger patty on a bun, topped by lettuce, tomato, ketchup, pickles, etc., and presented under the title ""Ground Beef.""

The difference between these products and the average ground chuck is staggering - though not as dramatic as when you discover what happens after slaughter. Read my article here to learn why we should care what goes into our food and avoid products containing ingredients derived from animals that were tortured first. At Subway restaurants across Canada, customers unknowingly ordered exactly one thing instead of another while ordering online: turkey breast sub sliders. An investigation conducted by CBC News revealed that since August 2016, Canadian locations offered customers both a regular turkey sandwich without bread and a vegetarian option of chickpea flour buns stuffed with deli slices. In addition, some of the sandwiches included cheese sticks, which did not appear on any other menu item. According to Subway franchise owner Stefanos Kousouris, employees chose the wrong items at random during busy periods. From the time he bought his first restaurant 12 years ago until today, he says he never had problems with mislabeled foods - until last summer. He told CBC: ""I thought maybe it's going out because people wanted the Vegetarian Slider."" But then he got a call from someone who said she'd seen the same problem at her local store. And even worse - she found nothing edible inside the bag. As 2018 began bringing us ever closer towards the end of the year, the world seemed full of worry - over epics like Brexit, Trumpism, migration issues, climate change, nuclear war, gender inequality, fake news, and arms trade. We also saw strange things around us: protests against Monsanto, refugee youths burning down an old border fence, Russia becoming president again, and scientists warning that we face a mass extinction event because humanity is failing to meet the challenges facing Earth. Meanwhile, corporations continued making profits by selling commodities ranging from clothessocksshoes to weapons and automobiles, with the help of governments. These political events and economic trends affected rations stock levels worldwide. As if it wasn't bad enough already, 2019 proved to be more of the same. Every day brought disturbing reports of environmental disasters from plastic pollution and ocean dead zones, deforestation, species extinctions, water shortages. What could possibly make the situation better? Everything except foolish optimism. It seems that the aforementioned political upheavals weren't so good either. By the opening days of January, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation repealing Obama-era Dodd Frank regulations created specifically to prevent banks once again engaging in fraudulent lending practices. This move further weakened regulation over Wall Street, allowing the big banks to continue wreaking havoc upon US citizens through irresponsible lending and unregulated investments. On top of that, the Federal Reserve announced three rate hikes to keep interest rates low, in spite of new evidence showing signs of labor market slackening affecting growth prospects globally. While stocks rose following the Fed decision, experts warned that the downward spiral would soon start rolling itself onwards once investors realized that inflationary pressures remain intact. With US equities trading at record highs based on minimal fundamental reasons, it doesn't take too long before speculation takes priority over actual earnings potential - especially when corporate earnings and revenues go unannounced. Just ask ExxonMobil whose annual report is due out later this week.

It doesn't happen overnight; rather, many tend to get through a series of steps: 1) You have an idea for some sort of product or service. Even if it's just something like ""something people would buy for fun,"" you already know what your customers want. After all, why else are there so many startups? 2) Due diligence checks come in. During these conversations with friends, family, venture capitalists (VCs), angel investors, employees and other sources you may find yourself having to answer questions such as: What market does my product serve? Who will use it? Is there demand? Can we make money doing X? Does it solve Y problem? How big is the potential audience? etc... These kinds of things provide insights into whether the concept makes sense at all. If it does, then you need to further refine the scope of the project by finding additional experts whom you'd consult before investing any more resources in development. Investors almost always require some form of traction, i.e., evidence that someone wants what you're offering enough to spend real money. Some also ask about roadmaps and timelines because they need confidence that funds won't be needed immediately after investment. Asking for numbers helps gauge how much capital will be required over time even down to the amount per month if the startup is going to survive and grow successfully. This process is part science, part art. Just remember that if you don't invest in developing good ideas, no one else will. In fact, most VC firms say they'll only invest in productsservices where at least 50 of them believe there exists sufficient revenue opportunity to sustainably generate returns. And when speaking with potential users, they often have very specific expectations as to features and functionality. So when presenting your idea, consider getting feedback early-on from experienced professionals outside your immediate social circle to ensure you understand exactly what those expectations are. 3) The plan becomes clear and defined. Once everyone agrees on the direction, funding gets approved, milestones become official and everything begins moving forward. At this point, you should begin building something that meets initial goals. Make sure you test it well, manage expectations and figure out ways to bring value to stakeholders along the way. When you feel confident that you found good solutions here, double check again with external parties to see if anything has changed. Expecting continuous movement without maintenance is asking too much! Planned updates shouldn't interfere with core objectives, though, and can sometimes prove helpful in smoothing bumps along the way. 4) Uncertainty creeps in. As things start taking shape, however, entrepreneurs must constantly monitor performance against common metrics set forth during planning stages, including progress towards overall milestones, increasing amounts spent on operations and hiring new team members, among others. While plans are important guides throughout, they leave plenty of room for unexpected issues during implementation. Face reality head-on and adjust accordingly. 5) Finances worsen. Sometimes despite doing the best possible job at managing costs, businesses simply aren't generating income fast enough. My experience tells me this happens less frequently than you might expect. That said, this phase can cost you dearly. A fair number of companies shut down due to lack of survival capital and personal responsibility. But what do you do when you run low on cash? With thoughtful actions taken ahead of time, nothing short of bankruptcy is inevitable. Donating to non-profit organizations, existing customers, paying off debts, renegotiating contracts, quitting jobs, etc... are essential measures every entrepreneur needs to take advantage of when facing severe constraints. Volunteer work may also present itself. Finding and applying opportunities to help others directly benefits both sides. More importantly, volunteers helping others tends to create positive feelings toward the entire industry that ultimately translates into greater brand reputation and increased sales. 6) Good times return. Things finally seem to fall into place and strong growth starts kicking in. For long-term businesses with proper operational management, this stage typically lasts months or years. Like any organization worth its salt, your goal should still be profitability year after year, provided day-to-day expenses keep coming under control and key players remain satisfied with productivity levels. However, absolute success comes in different forms depending on which sector you operate within. If your company is B2C oriented (i.e. selling physical goods online via various channels) and monetizes primarily through commissions, fees, subscriptions, advertising or similar means, great profits and rapid growth usually follow. Success is measured not necessarily by revenues, although that certainly factors heavily in. Rather, growth rates usually matter higher since they tell usif wealthy buyers plus being awake ""goodness' negative clients are spending behavior, controlling the rest P and now, it's The stunningly clean and",0,675

"A group of researchers has developed a way to create food without sunlight using artificial photosynthesis. The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding the product back to bacteria that convert it further into ethanol or butanol fuel. While such an approach could potentially provide a future solution for producing sustainable biofuels from renewable energy sources, it also raises questions about its safety and climate change effects. ""This is another step toward artificially creating life on Earth - and we should all be concerned by this,"" said Craig Venter, co-inventor of the first synthetic cell in 1980s and founder of Celera Genomics Inc., who was not involved with the recent research. ""We have created far more dangerous organisms than plants,"" he added. ""The biggest problem is going extinct like today's species do every day."" In addition to being able to produce fuels directly from CO 2, such technology would offer other advantages over traditional fossil fuels: It doesn't require land use as much space and materials are used at lower cost. There would no longer need to collect oil when exploring new lands, nor any mining operations to obtain coal, which means less land clearing and habitat destruction. And if there were enough solar panels spread across the globe to power these systems, demand for natural gas would decrease as well. ""If you want to go straight up and talk about positive impacts on our environment,"" Michael Tretter, one of the scientists behind the study and a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign told Gizmodo via email, ""that part falls squarely under [the] 'if you build it, they will come' premise."" Creating Fuel Using Artificial Photosynthesis In 2010, NASA published a report titled ""Artificial Photosynthesis Will Transform Energy Markets Within A Generation Or Less"" - an optimistic prediction that many others had claimed before them, including James Lovelock himself. Pessimists, however, remain skeptical - mainly because we don't know how exactly photosynthetic microorganisms work. According to Greg Ebelkamp, curator of microbiology at Florida Museum of Natural History, the process isn't yet perfect. Microbes living near the surface tend to eat atmospheric nitrogen while those deeper down consume hydrogen sulfide instead. Some strains can only survive on organic matter (like dead cells). One problem facing photosynthetic microbes, according to Eibelkamp, is their suspension within large amounts of saltwater or brine. When exposed to high levels of salinity, some marine algae turn brownish due to an inability to excrete excess salts. That makes harvesting even easier for big companies like Shell Oil and Chevron. Nevertheless, microbes might still prove useful for making clean air - something most people now think impossible. Though we've been unable to reproduce this so-called oxygenic photosynthesis inside lab conditions, several labs around the world have succeeded in doing so, using different configurations of cyanobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and purple nonsulfur bacteria. Now, two groups led by Carnegie Mellon professor Ali Khademhosseini and chemist Douglas Fields, both members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, believe they've found a better route to liquid hydrocarbons using ocean lifeforms altogether. Their research appears in the journal Science Advances. Here's what they did to make fuel. First off, let's get the basics out of the way. Researchers already knew that redox reactions happen naturally whenever light hits certain minerals, generating charged particles called electrons. These charges move through biological molecules, where they're captured by electron acceptors called terminal oxidases. This creates usable chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), or ADP phosphate ATP. Since 1960, though, engineers have tried to replicate this reaction outside the body, and failed miserably. For example, chemists working at Caltech attempted to synthesize fatty acids from methane and oxygen in a reactor separated by 100 yards from a flame; the result sparked five small fires. In 2006, researchers coupled methanol oxidation with light-driven proton reduction in a separate chamber. But eventually, the system died after twelve hours due to a lack of sufficient nutrients, clogging pipes, and poor design. To solve problems like these, Khademhosseini and his team originally engineered a few dozen genes from bacterial symbionts known collectively as extremophiles to become active again. They made sure to add extra enzymes that flared up quickly after receiving photons, directing the electrons towards superoxide ion radicals, rather than protons. With this help, the team managed to generate butyl esters - compounds commonly found in gasoline - using light alone in just six days, or four times faster than existing methods. Then came one of the cooler parts: they put each drop of resultant biocompounds into saltwater containing microbes hungry for sugar (a type of carbohydrate) and sodium chloride. After incubating for three months, they pumped the solution overboard and tested with? Any chemistry? No! It hasn: According to 610 Asiri: What! Yes! You! So! It's All",0,677

"Following the popularity of MoviePass, which peaked at 3.2 million subscribers earlier this summer, AMC rolled out its own subscription service, a 19.95 pass to watch up to 3 movies per week in any theater for 6.99 per month (they're also selling 15-day passes). After spending most of 2017 as one of Hollywood's top box office behemoths - scoring blockbuster wins with Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Black Panther and grossing over 50 more than it did last year according to Box Office Mojo - Disney announced that they would distribute 20th Century Fox films on Netflix starting January 1st. This means Marvel will stream their films through Netflix, along with those from other studios like Disney themselves and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Those titles include much older fare such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull, along newer releases including X-Men Apocalypse, Deadpool 2, Logan, Thor Ragnarok, Finding Dory, The Greatest Showman and Captain America: Civil War. That roster is almost all available now through Hulu Plus too if you don't want to sign up for an entire streaming package. Of course, we hope this move brings us new content from Fox, especially since many of them have been sitting around collecting dust ever since Avatar became a hit back in 2009. We'll find out soon enough when they start rolling films into theaters again; some are already scheduled for 2020 theatrical release dates. Regardless of whether or not you're interested in going forward subscribing to these services, there has never been any better time to get started. Here's everything you need to know about how to sign up for each service below.

Customers must be 18 years old or younger. While free memberships are limited to 10 times a year, paying customers can unlock unlimited admissions. Rewards vary based on category, though discounts on merchandise tend to make up a large portion of earned points. For example, getting four drinks at the bar gets a member 4 13 points. Purchasing popcorn earns 6 points. And so forth. There are no limits on movie ticket amounts either within individual categories, unlike what you may experience elsewhere. Essentially, you earn a reward every single dollar spent within AMC Stubs, provided you've visited multiple locations throughout the chain. Digital downloads can be redeemed against physical items at Amazon and iTunes, but only once during a given calendar quarter. Physical prizes range between 25-100 depending on location.

In addition to perks available for digital download, you can gain entries into sweepstakes monthly for things like gift cards and trips using mobile point apps. Some tiers even provide complimentary upgrades to premium seating whenever possible. So far, this seems like the best deal among streaming subscriptions because it allows you to pay as little as 40 for a bundle of three features which include upgraded seats, loyalty program status and a savings card worth 5 off at AMCs nationwide. However, anyone hoping to redeem frequent flier miles won't be able to do so unless downloading is allowed. Its competitors allow you to apply credits towards certain products like CDs or Blu Rays instead. Still, you'd probably need to spend quite a bit before reaching a decent percentage discount anyway. Domestic shipping costs extra. It's entirely optional as well, meaning you aren't required to join just leave the site open on your laptop screen until you feel comfortable shopping.

"China has blocked Bing, even though Bing already censors results in China.

"data2vec is a multi-modal artificial intelligence algorithm from Meta that attempts to replicate the general learning ability that the human mind possesses. The team aimed to create an AI that can learn and understand multiple types of data, analyze patterns in those datasets for insight, and draw conclusions based on what it has learned. The team built their system upon Google's Word Embedding model (WE), which is essentially a subset search engine - any word or phrase you type into google will be mapped back onto its original meaning. Since words have many meanings and are easily linked together with other concepts they represent, WE allows researchers to become more effective when conducting large scale searches within documents such as Wikipedia. Many use this same technique to build out related sentences using WE combined with semantic analysis techniques like LSA and topic modeling.

"The US Navy has banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices. It claims that the short-form video app is a cybersecurity threat, but declined to describe in detail what dangers the platform poses for military networks and bases. TikTok's ban follows reports by BuzzFeed News last month of a surge in videos posted on the platform containing copyright-protected content - such as songs or movies - related to active duty service members serving overseas. The stories prompted calls among some lawmakers for the Defense Department to create guidelines governing how TikTok can be used publicly online. That would follow similar moves taken this year against Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Baidu. ""We now prohibit our personnel ... from using any form of commercial software application [on personal digital assistants] (PDAs), including popular messaging applications like WhatsApp, Kik, Viber,"" Chief Information Warfare Executive Officer Linda Hudson said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday morning titled ""Cybersecurity: A Primer."" Hudson added later in her opening statement: "" (W) e are concerned about these apps' role in facilitating malicious cyber activity because they provide an avenue into DoD systems without rigorous security measures."" She did not specify whether the concern relates specifically to TikTok. Presumably, however, those concerns stem largely from the fact that a number of U.S.-based companies have developed mobile apps based on the Android operating system, which use open source code licensed under Apache 2.0. A version of iOS does not come with licensing terms generally associated with free software licenses. But Apple doesn't expressly endorse third parties who develop freemium versions of its products. Instead, it warns developers that they must comply with all applicable laws when building products for sale in their countries of origin. Given this stance, Congressional investigators asked questions about why other major U.S. tech firms have released apps built around iOS and Android but none of them have been implicated in breaches affecting America's elected officials, government agencies, defense contractors, banks, law enforcement, etc. ""It was hypocritical for Apple to get away with something that Microsoft didn't get away with,"" former Senator Jim Webb told reporters during his appearance before Congress Friday afternoon, referring to Microsoft's decision earlier this week to remove certain Windows 10 features available only within enterprise environments upon installing updates made through automatic rollouts. ""They should be held accountable; I think everyone agrees with that. And so we need to start looking more closely than ever at the practices inside corporations particularly where issues exist concerning misuse of data."" In contrast with Webb and others testifying before Congress, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer remained relatively tightlipped about the company's internal efforts to prevent abuse of its users' information even though he admitted that over 1 billion people visit the site every day. He also refused to say if there were plans to release a dedicated Malicious Content Report dashboard along with new tools aimed at identifying suspicious accounts. Asked repeatedly if he agreed or disagreed with Congressman Trey Gowdy's suggestion that preventing Russian meddling shouldn't just mean shutting down websites but rather focusing on ways to identify bots and trolls, the CTO demurred. At times, his responses drew laughter from the audience, many of whom appeared disappointed that Zuckerberg had no concrete answers to specific question posed by Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Hanneke van Berkel, VP of communications for the Internet Association, explained afterwards that the technology industry views the rules regarding election interference as different than privacy regulations due to the unique nature of user behavior while connected to networked computers. ""For example, you don't expect your ISP provider to monitor your internet usage when you're home alone, but once you connect to the web - well then that changes everything,"" she stated. But questioned separately after his testimony by Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo, Zuckerberg reiterated statements he made three weeks ago when he announced additional steps designed to combat foreign manipulation of elections across the world ""I believe that right here in Washington today, we need to do better together because I see our country coming apart,"" he began, stating at one point that he wanted to ""ensure that the process works fairly, honestly and transparently - regardless of party affiliation - and reflects basic American values."" He continued, ""I want to work with leaders in both political parties...to take meaningful action to ensure the integrity of fair elections in 2020. This includes improving voter registration databases and protecting voting infrastructure."" Asked again if he believed fake news had influenced voters enough that a second Trump administration could happen, Zuckerberg replied, ""That's really hard to answer."" When pressed further if he believes Russia deliberately interfered in 2016, he responded, ""Right now my belief is yes, they tried to interfere in 2015 and 2016. They may try to make themselves look less evil doing it."" At least a few references pointed out, he confirmed that the situation, a third aria-as-theater vernix? President George ernamaz",0,683

"Facebook has released a report that shows what content was most widely viewed by Americans between April and June. It contains sections showing the top 20 domains, links, pages, and events in each category - but also some interesting details about how much time users spent on those items. Facebook says it analyzed more than 100 billion pieces of data to come up with its findings. The company reports that Facebook's NewsFeed is driving 13rd of all page views. For comparison, Google, using similar methods, reported news sites as being responsible for just 3 of overall web traffic volume during March 2011. Below you can find our analysis from last month comparing Facebook and Google numbers, as well as new information we have uncovered since then relating specifically to Twitter usage patterns. We hope this will help give your knowledge base when evaluating these companies as they continue their tussle over who governs the online world. Google vs. Facebook: What are Pages? Pages include blogs, fan clubs, and other public profiles. They may be linked or related directly to an individual user profile (eg: 'John Doe's Blog. Or maybe there is no direct connection at all (ie: they are not listed under any of your friends) - they could even appear completely uncurated (eg. ""What You Need To Know About Post-Apocalyptic movies. In all cases, however, Pages represent public identities which may carry a recognizable reputation. If people like you or follow people you know reading them, chances are good you might see something by looking through Page feed or stream. Many brands take advantage of having fans create Pages to attract publicity or build brand awareness. The key difference between a User Profile and a Page is that Pages do not necessarily link back to any individuals. Thus, a Page can exist independently of an actual person, whereas a User Profile must belong to someone. This means that while anyone can view a User Profiles list within her own Friends network, only specific Users can access a diverse set of Page feeds and streams across the entire internet. In the following section, we found out more about how many total users visit versus non-users, both combined, as well as breaking down the numbers per platform. Here's where things get real interesting! How Much Time Do People Spend On These Websites? We used three metrics to determine how long average visitors spend on websites: Average Visit Length, Bounce Rate, and Average Session Duration. When analyzing data for these factors, we excluded visits lasting less than five minutes to avoid skewing results due to session length variations. Additionally, we consolidated session duration into two categories: First Interactives (or clicks) and Second Interactives (clicks followed by another click after 10 seconds), because we thought that if people were clicking quickly multiple times on either side of the same element, that would indicate they were bouncing away rather than interacting genuinely (and therefore less likely to convert to make purchases later). Finally, we did not exclude visits made via mobile phones as you would expect bounce rate and average visit lengths to increase slightly when accessed through a limited screen size. Results According to figures collected by Nielsen Online, 33.2 million unique U.S. Internet users visited Facebook between April 25th 2009 and May 22nd 2010, representing 4.9 of U.S adults aged 16 years old and older. If this number had stayed static, 32 million people visiting Facebook would amount to roughly half of all internet users in America today. And as social networking grows exponentially worldwide, it seems that proportion will grow too. However, Facebook has seen quite substantial growth in terms of daily active users, increasing from around 150 million users in September 2008 to 400 million users in February 2010. As of July 17th 2010, according to SimilarWeb, Facebook had approximately 700 million monthly Active Users. That represents 30 of Americas population; assuming similar growth rates, and keeping in mind that the US population grew 37 million through 2009 alone, Facebook should soon reach double digits among the general populace. A significant percentage of Facebook users don't go beyond simply viewing a friend's status update or posting updates themselves. Indeed, one study suggested that 50 of American Facebook users use the site merely for entertainment. By contrast, Gartner predicts that 46 of all consumer devices sold globally will contain Social Networks applications this year. Based on that prediction, 38 of all consumers will become regular visitors of the site. Facebook's market penetration is already approaching an almost absurd level, so growth appears certain to slow. (See below.) YouTube stats show that 80 of video watches happen outside of live TV broadcasts, primarily online, though a small fraction of viewers still tune in exclusively from broadcast platforms. A recent study by ComScore suggests that YouTube generates 617 hours of online video every minute throughout the United States. Over 10 of Internet households now watch television ONLINE.

"Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, has told Square employees that they will be able to work from home even after the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders end. Twitter had recently announced a new policy giving every employee in its US office access to flexible workspace if they need it, but on Monday afternoon he made clear his company is also taking measures to help people at their offices as well. The reason for this sudden move? According to Hany Farid, an assistant professor at Dartmouth College who studies how social media influence elections: ""This pandemic was always going to put big companies like Facebook under pressure because of all these things happening simultaneously. It's just too much stuff. We have so many different threats now - coronavirus, tariffs, war with Russia, etc...that a lot of companies are feeling really stressed out about what might happen next. Everyone needs time off or some kind of relief right now, so why can't we do both?"" For an industry built around business travel, working remotely (and especially telecommuting) doesn't come naturally. For most workers there's still a sense of pride involved in being able to get physically close to supervisors, colleagues, clients, customers and co-workers. When you think about it, we probably wouldn't want anyone else living near us either; no one wants someone else coughing in our face. But increasingly, workplaces are adopting more remote options for managing day-to-day operations in light of the spread of novel coronaviruses - particularly SARS-CoV-2. The idea behind such changes isn't necessarily to prevent future outbreaks, however, but rather to protect employees against mental health issues caused by being away from friends and family during times when everyone should be spending plenty of quality time together anyway. And doing so requires flexibility, something Google parent Alphabet famously offers by allowing any worker to spend 50 of the week commuting elsewhere. It may seem bizarre to suggest that a deadly virus could cause corporations to rethink everything from scooters to plexiglass, but as Jonathan Evans writes over at Bloomberg Businessweek, Covid-19 has forced Silicon Valley tech giants to reevaluate not only how best to keep employees safe at the workplace while keeping up productivity, but also how to make sure those same employees feel comfortable enough to return to the boss once the danger passes. A recent survey conducted by Market Probe showed that 70 percent of respondents said working from home would improve morale. Likewise, 65 percent indicated they wanted a way to provide physical distancing without risking permanent job loss. Companies have since been quick to respond, announcing plans on Friday to bring back office perks including free food and drinks, gym memberships, pools where they can swim or take laps and interactive presentations through Zoom. These moves represent a significant shift within the industry - which prides itself on enabling autonomy among workers - but also prove yet another example of how quickly businesses adapt to changing circumstances. So far, 25 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment insurance benefits, according to the Department of Labor. That number is expected to climb significantly higher before states begin letting people return to work, which likely won't occur until May 4th. However, employers say that last year's Great Recession taught them lessons about the importance of offering workers continuing support following layoffs. Indeed, several large tech firms took steps early this month to expand financial stability programs amid fears that hundreds of thousands of salaried staff could soon find themselves unemployed. In April alone, Microsoft began hiring 2,000 ""new career ambassadors"" to assist workers navigating retirement planning services offered via its Teams platform. The software giant also implemented other safeguards to ensure stability during uncertain economic times. Beginning June 1st, employees must enroll six months ahead of time for automatic enrollment into 401 (k), dental and vision coverage through direct investment in index funds. And starting July 1st, the firm will offer reassigned paychecks to impacted employees, meaning their salary remains paid whether they continue to work part-time or take leave due to illness. Coincidentally, the first two weeks of March were designated ""Coronavirus Response Week,"" with each major city imposing quarantines. France went a step further than New York City did, closing down theaters nationwide except for small venues. As the death toll climbed to nearly 10,000 globally, China's Communist Party launched a campaign urging citizens to avoid traveling abroad. President Xi Jinping called upon passengers to refrain from flying, particularly international flights that originate overseas. Japan became the second country to impose strict quarantine rules on incoming travelers. While the United States hasn't followed suit, South Korea imposed restrictions similar to those enacted in Japan, albeit less strictly. On Wednesday, Germany instituted partial border closures and increased screening procedures for foreign visitors. European countries are now considering expanding existing bans beyond Italy.

"Stories of data loss can be embarrassing, but they help people learn useful things in case they end up in similar situations. This article tells the story of how a Linux user lost 8TB of important data on his hard drive and what he did to recover it all. The little blue lights stopped blinking on my ancient 3-year old desktop PC (no fan) one day last year when I was installing updates - or so I thought at first. The problem is that instead of updating itself after rebooting, Windows just hung with an endless spinning beach ball as if waiting for something else to happen. So in frustration I gave up and started looking around for other explanations: had a power surge fried some motherboard components? Computer glitch! Something about low disk space? A virus or trojan program? Sure enough, the next morning every single file on my C: root partition seemed inaccessible due to ""read only"" status. After checking to make sure nothing obvious like setting permissions had been changed by myself during sleep mode, obviously some kind of malware attack took place overnight. Even though I knew there was no way that could have happened, still I decided not take any chances; I couldn't afford further damage while trying to figure out where this thing came from or removing whatever it may be. To do the latter, I called my friend who's also into computers, John Doe. We discussed possible causes until we both agreed that either Microsoft Windows installers, which are notorious for doing stupid stuff, had corrupted my system somehow or a hacker with access to my machine had planted malicious software there. In order to avoid future episodes such as these, I've learned better ways to protect my computer from outside threats through numerous online resources. However, my main concern back then wasn't security against cyberattacks - it was fixing my files: And so began my journey towards recovery... I'd run several tools available at the time: scandisk chkdsk to checkfix bad sectors, CCleaner, 6-way boot manager etc., even tried restoring files using Norton Ghost, but none helped me getting past read-only problems. Finally, because I'm somewhat familiar with linux internals (both kernel and drivers), I changed the permissions via GUI tool allowing fullwrite actions on various directories and drive structures chown,"" R and rebooted successfully. Only later I realized that Windows installer would probably have fixed this issue automatically when scanning all partitions. Unfortunately, since the attacker (s) didn't give us much information during their intrusion attempt, I had to assume the worst and set everything to read-only again before continuing my research. While running ls -alF command under terminal, I saw that the attacker actually left couple of process zombies behind: Etwmgr (corresponding to its RDP-viewable icon in taskbar tray). When searching on Google for them, I found that apparently ""Etwmgr"" stands for Event Tracing Utility Manager; you see, upon installation, Windows creates 10 different event log sources including those two; each logs specific events ranging from user settings changes to application failures. It turns out that this particular source appears whenever someone tries accessing the currently logged-in account's profile. Reading more articles led me to conclude that indeed hackers inserted themselves directly inside the login screen session and were now taking snapshots of the current activity taking place within it... Ahh! If I hadn't done so already, I should delete those processes. But wait, why use zombie processes? Surely they don't hurt anything right? They're sorta dead but still running; Therefore, they won't slow down your startup significantly nor cause unnecessary load on CPU. Also, perhaps the person responsible for the initial compromise used this trick to hide traces of intrusions. I figured that rather than killing Etwmgr, I'll simply kill its parent PSSWSH hibernate handler as well... and boom! All locked accounts became unlocked, yet mysteriously remained frozen. Thanks to WUDFS service provided by NTFS driver combined with standard journal replay functionality offered by Linux, all compromised users' passwords were restored without requiring reacquiring new ones. Since I opened all Firefox tabs and windows associated with each account, I had to kill parent process (es) manually. As soon as I did it, however, all sessions resumed working properly. One by one I killed zombie child processes too. Then I ran scandisk chkdsk hoping for good news, to find that only 1GB worth of single-spaced random garbage occupied 238MB area now:- (How come?! Shouldn't infected filesystems brim over with lots of corruptions? Well, not necessarily. Remember that while operating systems typically log errors and warnings, sometimes programmers write code that blocks entire OS threads resulting in reported corruption symptoms that appear seemingly out nowhere.

"HQ, the makers of HQ Trivia, is closing down its business and laying off its 25 employees. CEO Rus Yusupov sent a note to employees informing them of the company's decision on Wednesday after shutting down the Augmented Reality game last month. ""It's with heavy hearts that we must now announce an end-of-life for QuizUp,"" he wrote in the letter obtained by VentureBeat. ""We are deeply grateful to our loyal players who have supported us over the years."" The Verge reports that Mashable has also learned from sources on the inside about the closure. The staff will be let go within days starting next week, according to a statement given to the publication. A representative for HQ told GameSpot this morning that it was not aware of any layoffs but wouldn't comment further due to pending litigation. An email seeking confirmation was only returned late Thursday evening. It's unclear if employees were notified prior to the lawsuit being filed or during the suit process. Yusupov started working at HQ seven months ago as part of a media partnership between NBCU and Playground Global Inc., which operates HQ. He previously worked at another location trivia app called Meerkat where he helped launch the product and eventually led all development teams. A source said Yusupov left Meerkat before its issues became public and joined the current team that runs HQ. That meant some members had never met him until joining HQ and they weren't happy with his leadership style when things began going south. According to court documents seen by GameSpot, one former employee claims Yusupov fired her because she complained about poor work conditions. She claimed her manager asked her to make changes to code without properly understanding how to do so. When she refused, the manager allegedly blocked access to GitHub.com, the online hosting service used by developers. That same person alleged she was retaliated against after complaining about the firing. Another developer posted complaints on Twitter and Reddit following the shutdown claiming there wasn't enough time for anyone trying to fix bugs in the system among other problems. They allege that Yusupov only cared about revenue growth while ignoring criticism. Another user tweeted about Yusupov telling them privately that his lawyers advised him to shut down the site. Other users reported issues receiving phone calls indicating their account information was compromised, such as people attempting to change passwords multiple times even though the accounts didn't exist yet.",0,691
"The resignations of Larry Page and Sergey Brin from their roles as CEO and president of Alphabet marked the end of an era. The pair cited changes to Google's all-hands meetings, a desire for more control over product developments at the company, and disagreements with its parent company, Facebook. However, it also marks the beginning of a new one - the rise of Mark Zuckerberg's empire into a formidable rival on multiple fronts. Here are 10 ways in which Facebook is poised to challenge Google: 1) Facebook Is Taking Over Your News Feed Facebook has taken one huge step toward taking over your life by launching ""Instant Articles."" An instant article can be read without downloading anything using special software that works through mobile browsers like Chrome or Safari. This allows publishers to create articles to fit any device; they just need to put them online instead of creating separate apps for every platform and keeping those operating systems updated. In addition, users only have to scroll down (or click up) to view these stories. Instant articles say goodbye to clunky websites and hello to high quality content displayed quickly and easily. As of right now there aren't many big names publishing this way yet, but if you believe that news should be accessible from anywhere then this might change your mind about what constitutes good journalism. It will likely take some time for developers to catch up to the technology, though, so don't expect Instant Articles to appear overnight. It takes too long to launch updates across all devices, anyway. 2) Instagram Is Now A Revenue Machine For Firms Like Nike And Adidas Instagram was once a social media network where people shared photographs of themselves doing cool stuff, making friends, eating food, etc... However, since announcing massive plans to turn itself into a multi billion dollar business last September, the service has changed dramatically. Users who post photos are encouraged to follow brands such as Nike and Adidas, allowing companies to advertise directly to consumers via images posted to their feeds. Most importantly, users get paid when their posts receive likes, follows, comments, retweets, or other reactions. Brands pay between 3-6 per 1000 views on average, depending on your reach, according to TechCrunch. Because the cost of impressions used to depend solely upon eyeballs, marketers were spending heavily on ads to make sure their messages got seen. This led them to not spend enough money buying actual ad space because it wasn't worth their while. As a result companies found themselves paying for fake likes, followers, and even entire accounts. If the number of interactions on a photo equals revenue on a small scale, imagine how much it could generate on a global level! Adidas' cofounder Adolf Dassler famously stated that ""a man must work. But he should play, and do something creative and beautiful, otherwise his whole being becomes ugly."" If that doesn't ring true, consider that we think about sports when choosing shoes, and that most shoe designs wouldn't look out of place on our desks during office hours. That idea couldn't possibly come from just watching someone run around a track before settling on the perfect design. We would never design clothes for ourselves based on viewing pictures of models wearing others. Why? Well, it's pretty obvious - everyone looks different than another person, and no two faces have exactly the same features. So why do we assume that all objects possess similar qualities? No matter how attractive you are, or whatever feature sets you may possess, we still gravitate towards things that remind us of people we know well, or see frequently. [Source] Nike Founder Phil Knight said ""All I ask is that you try running half marathons. Try walking half marathon distances. You will find your limits expand and your endurance improve [...] eventually you won't want to stop until somebody kicks you off. Then you'll understand what running means."" Running gives you purpose. Sports give you meaning. Football gave me my first love, basketball gave me passion, athletics gave me a sense of achievement, cycling brought me to Europe, skiing made me feel free... There isn't a sport that didn't shape me in one way or another. Businesses already use athletic shoes as promotional tools, like giving away pairs during sporting events or sponsoring teams. These types of deals help businesses entice customers and build brand loyalty among athletes. With influencer marketing becoming increasingly popular, this type of sponsorship will only become bigger, and the market will grow exponentially. If event organizers start promoting certain products, regardless of whether or not the athlete buys into these sponsorships, people will flock to the events carrying products associated with each champion. People love to show support for rising stars. Even better than having celebrities wear your dress code during parties or red carpet appearances, is attaching your logo onto the clothing actually worn by someone famous. The results speak for themselves. Although larger companies like Nike already use influencers to promote their goods, smaller ones lack access to this kind of marketing channel. Smaller, however to keep a continued to promote the best players, perhaps. After all. To ColemanBracktopplee wants to get",0,692

"Scrollex is a library for building beautiful scroll experiences using minimal code. A library of interactive demos is available. Scrollex was developed by Bjarke Ingels and his team at BIG in Copenhagen, Denmark and it's published under the MIT license. It has been used in web projects like this one: where you can find more info about Scrollex on their website. I've also contributed to it, working with Stefan Couple] Stahlberg"" Eriksen (Aurora) as well as Jens Boker Jensen Alter] . We hope that our work will help others make better sites too!:) Introduction {intro} In JavaScript we often need scrollable content which isn't part of an iframe or any other frame element but directly placed into the DOM tree without being hidden. This gives us the ability to use normal scrolling operations such as page up down keys when navigating around text documents and similar. Typically these kinds of elements are pretty plain, displaying what we want in text form. But there might be cases where we have something else, say graphs or charts, which would look much nicer displayed inside some kind of canvas element or even as 3D objects [1]. Ideally such things should behave just like regular text document lines - they shouldn't break line characters nor wrap within multiple lines (as happens currently). When skimming through them quickly we'd expect typical navigation behavior (page up down), but when slowing browsing we'd simply read the whole thing until we hit the bottom or top edge before jumping back to the start. And since it'll probably not fit into memory anyway usually two views per window will suffice. Ideally the user interface would consist only of spacebars, arrows and so forth. A very simple example could be found here[2]: body ... div id""chart""...div body We need all sorts of functionality from the browser itself though. For instance, the user needs to know whether they're actually reading the data now according to the time stamps or already caught up with how far ahead the dataset covers. The most important feature however is definitely allowing users to navigate between different chunks of information dynamically. So pages linked via anchors won't cut it anymore; they require knowing full URLs instead of relative paths. In fact, the end goal here should resemble the real world quite closely: open a file having hundreds of thousands of records filled with data points over 100 years ago, skim it as needed and jump to the next bit whenever your interest wanes. Several times a day. Or maybe you decide to dive right into it. Whatever floats your boat. You don't really care how long you spend looking at each chunk; you just want to move along. Scrolling isn't time critical, yet people may get impatient when waiting while images load etc. Hence we ought to give the impression of continuous smoothness regardless of loading speed. Some browsers do exactly that nowadays thanks to Web Workers, but this still requires knowledge of URL syntax. If possible the amount of hassle involved should ideally remain fairly low. Especially due to the fact that the current implementation doesn't allow for internal links easily. Unfortunately, many modern websites are built using dynamic solutions such as jQuery UI tabs or AJAX calls among others. These may offer nice visual effects including animation, modals, dropdowns and gallery viewings, which might enhance user experience significantly. However, here we aim for pure HTML5 and CSS3 support since those can hardly be faked correctly. That said, we'd never intend to replace entire libraries like jQuery UI for the sake of fine tuning a few remaining quirks. There are several ways of achieving all this. One promising approach I've seen proposed lately is Canvas 2D drawing using SVG fonts. But unfortunately neither Chrome nor Firefox supports those properly. So let's try another path first. We'd make use of the CSS 'overflow' property. The main idea behind overflow:scroll is that we can add a background image underneath the content area and then define transparent areas above and below the content ourselves. Those represent parts of ""screen,"" i.e., of actual physical pixels on the screen that cannot be accessed unless scrolling occurs. Once we have done that, we can set whatever backgrounds and borders we wish. As mentioned earlier, after doing that the following behaviour emerges naturally: moving between bits becomes easy because the boundaries appear seamlessly jagged and hence no flickering occurs. Furthermore, we avoid problems related to repainting the same region repeatedly, especially noticeable on mobile devices where resources would otherwise be wasted unnecessarily. However, please keep in mind that in order to benefit from this technique externally visible changes must be made to the markup. Also note that you cannot reproduce zooming results with this method.

"Jeff Bezos will step down as CEO and become the executive chair of the Amazon board in Q3 2021. Andy Jassy will replace Bezos as CEO. Bezos plans to focus on philanthropic, charitable, non-profits work outside of Amazon after he retires from his role at Amazon. Jassy is an old friend with whom I launched The New Digital Age (TNDA) newsletter back in 2012 when we were still students at Harvard Business School. He helped me get a job at McKinsey Company which was then part of Arthur Andersen before moving into investment banking where he worked for Citigroup. He became a founding member of Andreessen Horowitz. When the merge between Facebook and Instagram occurred, Jassy got acquired by Facebook according to my sources who told me that it wasn't a handshake deal but a done deal and everyone knew about it since the acquisition deal was already signed by Zuck. Soon thereafter, I saw him leave Facebook following the sale of Onavo VPN app maker SpectorSoft to ComcastNBC Universal after engaging them in data sharing talks over WhatsApp. There are so many reasons why Jassy left that he won't talk about publicly but they include: He didn't want to be involved in any way shape or form because he felt like he could not trust Zuckerberg The previous team led by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger let go of their jobs without asking him if there would be opportunities for former employees there When asked why he stepped out from working at Facebook, every time you ask him what happened, he gives the same answer ""I don't know... this sounds weird but I just decided one day... it made sense!"" This is extremely rare among people in power especially those in Silicon Valley. For example, Jared Leto refused to say anything else other than 'that movie sucked ass' even though he had been talking about how great Suicide Squad was during multiple interviews. In general, most people only speak positively towards themselves although there might have been exceptions. That said, here it seems like something more serious has happened internally causing everything to fall apart - obviously, Jassy couldn't give away details unless he knows them first hand as someone high up inside FB itself. One thing is clear though; it looks like Facebook is taking another round of layoffs soon given that he quit while the merger was pending. Maybe Jassy went through hell internally as well? Who can tell? Hey, whatever happened makes perfect sense considering the recent changes happening at Facebook. We all need to learn something new everyday regardless of whether it's good news or bad.

"A team of researchers have genetically modified jellyfish so that their neurons light up when activated. This allowed them to watch the animal's neural activity as it behaved naturally. Jellyfish appear in a variety of colors, but this is just one step toward implanting brain-like devices into animals and humans. Scientists are hard at work creating ""artificial brains"" out of synthetic materials: microchips, plastic circuits (often derived from computer chips), or assemblies of living cells - including neurons from human skin tissue - all held together with glue. It's an exciting prospect for scientists who want to design new ways to explore our own brains, understand how they operate, and even potentially treat some neurological diseases by replacing damaged circuitry. But there's been little progress on developing real artificial intelligence. Most attempts to create ""neural dust"" (a miniature version of brain tissue) haven't worked well enough to be practical, says Andrew Schwartz, director of engineering science group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). And in experiments like those he led at Caltech last year, where scientists inserted silicon wafers containing designs for logic gates into brains made of trillions of spontaneously firing cells called Hydra vulgaris polyps, Schwartz found no evidence that these ideas would ever lead to working machines. That could change soon, if researchers identify which principles make biological brains tick. The problem isn't technology; scientists know quite a lot about how neurons behave thanks to decades of research on other organisms - they don't need abiomicsurebrain to figure it out. The snag comes down to scale, says neuroscientist Julie Mao at Harvard University. Understanding complex networks requires not only knowing what each neuron does, but also understanding how its thousands of connections influence the rest of the central nervous system. Simply replicating individual processes won't do the trick, because interconnections aren't simply multiplexed separate signals going through different paths. Scientists need a way to map neural circuitry and simulate whole systems rather than get stuck trying to replicate single pathways using computers alone. ""If we can take advantage of natural architectures, then we should expect far more success."" Because they're built around natural architecture, many large biomolecules such as proteins fold themselves up nicely and conserve energy without wasting motion. If you build your robot parts out of something similar, ""you will achieve greater efficiency over time with lower power consumption, and less waste heat,"" explains Peijia Zhuang, CEO and chief scientist of NeoCell Biosciences Inc., based in San Diego, California. Last October, she announced her company had taken its first steps towards making that happen, demonstrating a tiny sensor capable of detecting whether neuromuscular synapses were active inside live mice of various sizes. The device consists of two parallel electrodes linked together with DNA strands, mimicking axons and dendrites within the mouse cortex, so that currents flow between them. A dual voltage source activates both terminals, while changing voltages affect strength of current flowing across the gap between them. Similar pairs of probes placed near motor nerves in worm tails showed they register touch stimuli and respond accordingly, proving that these sensors can pick up information about neuronal activity. But it wasn't clear how the probes would perform under more demanding conditions, nor was it possible to connect them directly to neurons. Peijia Zhuang has now developed liquid metal batteries that let her mimic signaling patterns in small clusters of neurons. In April 2013, she published results showing that the probe pair generates action potentials whose waveforms follow physiological protocols observed during electrical stimulation tests. They weren't perfect, however. While evoking spikes fairly well overall, the amplitude varied greatly depending on electrode position relative to nearby neurons. Here, too, Zhuang is optimistic she'll eventually improve things with trial and error. ""This is definitely part of the next phase,"" she says. ""We're learning how to program [different] mechanisms of signal integration."" She's currently adapting the technique to myosin motors, protein complexes used to transport vesicles along actin fibers, rather than neurotransmitters. With larger arrays of probes able to monitor entire populations of neurons simultaneously, Neocell hopes to deploy automated software programs that learn how to interpret data coming back from those sets of closely spaced electrodes. Neuroscience labs might use the same principle to readout quantities ranging from x-rays to radioactivity. DNA tends to behave much better than most engineered nanostructures designed to interact with molecules like nucleic acids. As of yet, neo-cells doesn't offer any solution to translating concepts or rules learned from studying a given species' brain into machine code. Still, a growing number of companies think they've overcome problems involving scaling.

"Airspeeder's electric flying race car has completed its first unpiloted test flights in southern Australia. The Alauda Mk3 is an electric vertical takeoff multicopter (eVTOL). It weighs 130 kilograms and flies at up to 40 kilometres per hour for a maximum distance of 160 metres, according to the manufacturer. The aircraft was developed by Australian startup company Aeronautics Pty Ltd. The design means the user does not need to land or take off from runways as would be necessary with conventional VTOLs such as helicopters or jets. This makes it possible to carry both passengers and cargo in remote locations where they can access natural resources quickly and efficiently. Besides providing transport capabilities similar to those of other light fixed-wing UAVs, the eVTOl system also allows users to fly over areas that are inaccessible by road due to rough terrain. Efficient communication between personnel who work remotely during operations and onsite staff is made easier thanks to the simple interface of this vehicle. Onboard systems include two cameras which provide real time video streaming directly onto mobile devices via wi-fi connections. Aeronautics' founder Paul Wright told FlightGlobal: ""This technology could save lives and make life much better in rural communities."" He added that his team had tested several designs before deciding upon the final product. They will now focus their efforts on testing durability, endurance, navigation accuracy, power consumption and control performance. These tests are key factors in the certification process for commercial applications operating under federal aviation regulations. Alauda still needs full-scale proof of concept verification before receiving FAA approval to operate commercially. In addition, there may be further regulatory hurdles to clear before the development costs involved can be recouped through sales revenues. If successful, however, the market potential looks promising. According to research firm Frost Sullivan, global demand for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAS) should grow from 1.9 billion in 2013 to nearly 7.5bn in 2020. Australian companies have been carrying out various types of drone experiments for years. One notable example is the University of New South Wales' autonomous solar powered drones, known as 'Solarbirds', operated by Newcastle University, which have flown more than 250 missions since 2002. A recent study conducted at Zhejiang University showed how lightweight quadcopter drones capable of hovering above people and even performing manoeuvres while fitted with LED lights could find use in monitoring traffic congestion. For instance, a team led by Professor Yang Liqun plans to build drones equipped with radar sensors to monitor river banks for signs of landslides during floods.",0,699

"Apple's HomePod mini smart speaker has a secret temperature and humidity sensor in its casing. It isn't currently usable by owners of the device yet, but Apple has previously included such sensors inside other devices A watchdog group is asking Apple to disclose whether its new ""Homepod"" Mini smart speaker contains an environmental sensing chip that can record some key metrics like air quality or indoor temperatures. The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) urged the Cupertino giant yesterday to reveal if it made the ""environmental monitoring technology,"" used for things like home security systems, which was found during testing last month at one of Apple's suppliers. The company tested the microphone-equipped iPod Shuffle models produced between 2014 through 2017. After finding the chip, CTA researcher Dr. Angad Singh said ""this discovery raises questions about how well [the] privacy policies outlined on their website match reality."" He added: ...""manufacturers have been able to access realtime data from users' homes without explicit consent."" Singh says he doesn't know what type of information the chip collects, adding: ""I only know that there are similar chips embedded in millions of consumer electronics products sold today. But I don't think they're capturing anything particularly private except perhaps your location."" In addition to this specific gadget, numerous brands including Samsung, Sony, LG and more all include such hidden microchips in their gear. Similar concerns were raised when these various companies leaked earlier details of their own internal tests. What happens next? Read our full explainer here - One thing is certain. It seems we will soon find out just how much power big tech corporations have over us as consumers. Although that didn't stop them from collecting as much personal info as possible before being forced into legal compliance. Reports suggest that third party sellers may be allowed to use Wi-Fi networks operated by cellular carriers, while others could opt for advertising based on demographic statistics gathered online. That means your browsing habits, buying preferences and even physical address would all be shared with the Big Players. There's also no mention of using facial recognition software to identify customers who walk past the stores. This report comes shortly after Verizon revealed that its commercial division plans to merge ads and contact databases across several vertical markets into one platform under development called Project Velocity. Joe McBride, general manager for product intelligence at Forrester Research tells Bloomberg Businessweek: 'We want every time you connect to the internet you should be connected to something else... We've got a lot of surface area now. Our friends aren't going away any time soon."" A New York Times article titled 'Verizon Working On App To Pinpoint Your Location Based Ads', suggests that ad targeting might be more invasive than online tracking done by social media giants Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., Google LLC and Amazon. com Inc.. ""It sounds like the first step towards turning people's phones into constant surveillance machines, where advertisers track every move they make - both online and offline - in order to target them with personalized commercials tailored to everything they do in the world,"" writes James Vincent. Meanwhile, news published on Tuesday suggested that motion detectors installed at ATT wireless cell sites monitor not only phone calls and texts sent via iPhones and Android smartphones, but also audio conversations conducted in cars. According to reports, the system automatically records all smartphone activity within a 1km region around each tower, regardless of whether someone uses a mobile service provider affiliated with the telecom operator. Such captures aim to help providers identify and locate trespassers trespassing onto the company's property without permission, the Wall Street Journal reported. As per the agreement reached with US authorities back in October 2016, Facebook agreed to give up access to user location data collected from WhatsApp messages for 90 days. However, according to documents obtained by Motherboard, Facebook still retains precise location data captured from Messenger chats even beyond those initial three months sometimes indefinitely. Previously, Facebook had claimed that it did not store ""dialed number identification resources"" metadata associated with customer phone numbers unless required for law enforcement purposes. Similarly, it does not keep records of SMS and MMS messages received or sent outside of the app itself, although it does retain copies of outgoing text and multimedia messages stored locally until deleted. The social networking giant has recently begun pushing a messaging feature known as Secret Chat to users of its flagship application aimed at keeping sensitive communications secure against snooping eyes. Instead of sending ordinary chat messages directly, individuals can send encrypted messages that disappear once delivered. While not entirely visible to everyone viewing your inbox, a handful of savvy observers may spot a short code written into plain sight on top of secret links pointing to the actual content. The same goes for incoming secrets. When deciding to take action on a message, recipients must confirm they value the very existence of enterprise services engineers.

"A college student who stole 5 million in cryptocurrencies using SIM swap attacks (hacking the user's phone and using that to gain access to their email and cryptocurrency wallets) has been arrested, according to reports. The New York Times reported on Monday that 29-year-old Rohan Rahat was charged with ""unauthorized use of computing devices"" after being accused by UBS Wealth Management as well as others at a company he worked for. The paper claims police have not yet found any evidence of his involvement in any other hacks or crimes but are searching for him. According to the FBI's website, an unauthorized person can be charged if they knowingly posses stolen property, receive it knowing it is stolen, transmit information about stolen property over the Internet, transport such property across state lines, sell it without authorization to recover what you paid for it, or purchase items intending to transfer title from someone else through fraud or deception means. If convicted, a defendant could face up to five years imprisonment, 250k fines, andor three years supervised release. It's unclear how much money Rahat had when he allegedly carried out the attack against UBS employees' accounts which stored more than 1bn worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash. However, Daily Mail took note that while there were no immediate charges filed against him, he may have faced additional federal tax evasion charges due to some discrepancies between himself and UBS: ""He got into trouble because he didn't report [the] income in good faith,"" said Michael Maudlin, a former IRS agent now working as managing director of investigations at IRS Criminal Investigation Division. ""If in fact there is taxable income associated with these transactions he should file Form 1040 - unless of course he intended throughout this scheme to avoid filing taxes altogether."" While cryptocurrency enthusiasts don't necessarily view crypto hacking as criminal activity per se, we do take issue with people failing to disclose thefts once discovered by law enforcement agencies; something even conservative politicians agree upon. That being said, Rahat apparently disclosed details to authorities within days of the hack taking place. According to Reuters, the alleged hacker told investigators where he hid most of the coins before meeting with them. Rahat reportedly confessed to carrying out multiple cyberattacks against clients of investment firm Wellington Partners, including two high profile targets in February 2017. While details haven't surfaced, one victim included billionaire Bill Gates who lost around 1 of his USD 2 billion fortune following the theft. When Moreno was asked whether this would affect Microsoft's plans to bring Windows down on ARM processors sooner rather than later, she replied: (Reuters) - Several new technology trends will shape 2018, ranging from artificial intelligence advancements to disruptions caused by aging populations. Here are four major areas where change is expected in coming year. Artificial Intelligence Microsoft Is Finally Making Its Cosmos Blockchain Technology More Accessible This week saw Microsoft open up its Azure blockchain cloud platform for developers to start creating decentralized apps and Dapps. Now anyone can jump aboard Microsoft's growing ecosystem to build and deploy blockchains on top of the technology based on Proof of Work consensus protocol. This comes amid recent changes made to the tech giant's policy regarding third party desktop software. As stated by Azure CTO Mark Russinovich, via ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley:""We've always kept our community informed of the kinds of things that happen behind closed doors in Microsoft, and so we're going to continue doing that... We believe that the world needs choice, competition and innovation.......]Read more... In September last year, Azure launched v0.8 of its developer environment offering, allowing users to create and run decentralised applications. It also offered support for bitcoin and ethereum networks. With this latest announcement, it seems like Microsoft wants to increase awareness of digital currencies and distributed ledgers across the industry. Announcing the launch, Russiunovich commented: ""Azure Cosmos DB is uniquely positioned to help customers accelerate time to value enabling organizations to get faster insights and decisions in real-time."" Named 'CosmosDB', the service offers scalable database storage management and ACID compliance under a single API, making it perfect for running both public and permissioned ledger protocols. Developers simply need to add the option to set themselves up and then only pay for data usage as needed. No upfront fees are required, either! And best of all, CosmosDB allows businesses to keep control of their own private keys despite network security concerns.

"Tech companies are operating shuttle buses that go all the way to the Central Valley as more and more tech employees move into the area. When tech companies first started moving in, they were spread throughout the region - but now it's practically a one-way street. The majority of San Francisco Bay Area companies have moved hundreds or thousands of miles away from their city limits. They flock together near the urban centers where housing is cheaper: Palo Alto and Mountain View on the Peninsula, Cupertino and Sunnyvale in Santa Clara County, Berkeley and Oakland on the East Shoreline. Instead of building new high-rises around downtowns like San Jose has done, these areas continue expanding outward for several blocks along major freeways such as 280 (San Mateo), 101 (Mountain View) and 680 (Sunnyvale). There aren't many places left in Silicon Valley that are boring enough to make you want to move there - until this point. For example, a home worth 1 million will sell for about half that amount when compared to other parts of California, so people who can afford that kind of money don't see much incentive to drive an hour and a third across town just to get a house with a view. With any luck, the Bay Area leads the nation again by becoming America's most affordable large metropolitan county next year, according to UBS Investment Research analysts Mark Muro and Hans Hoeferstrasser in ""America's Most Affordable Large Metropolitan Areas 2018."" The report contends that nine out of 10 households could find decent living space without spending too much on housing.",0,710
"With the rise of cheap small ""Cube Satellites,"" startups are now taking photos and infrared images of factories, retail parking lots, oil tankers, and more and selling these images to businesses that can use them for a variety of purposes including insurance claims. This article will cover how we built one such CubeSat using an Arduino-based embedded Linux platform designed by David Maloney. It was also written with help from our friends at Make magazine who have been supporting us on this project since day 1. You'll learn about: The hardware required in order to perform this mission How you would build your own version of this CubeSat. A tutorial showing you what to solder onto your board as well as a link to where to get everything needed to do it yourself! What cool things will be possible once we start putting cameras like this into space? As mentioned before, I'm going to go over all aspects of building a camera system similar to what is capable inside Google's Project Tango mobile device. The focus here will primarily revolve around the last two parts - actually getting your very first digital photo out of the sensor attached to the outside of your CubeSat and then sending those data back down to Earth via the internet. Designing the Hardware Before diving too deeply into creating something like this ourselves, let me explain why you'd want to make something like this happen. With a few sensors attached to some miniature solar panels, you could detect objects (like humans) or even interesting buildings inside cities. This information could potentially come to light when disaster strikes due to floods, earthquakes, fires, etc... It could give people time to evacuate andor track traffic during emergency situations. In addition, there may be potential applications for tracking ships or other transportation vehicles. Finally, if someone wanted to produce maps of cities they could simply attach tiny little devices called Drones to their rooftop to fly overhead and take pictures. These drones wouldn't need any additional power sources within the city so long as the satellites were properly aligned. Why not just buy commercially available systems already created specifically for these types of missions instead of trying to create your own DIY versions? First off, you're probably spending 200-500 dollars per unit whereas most commercial products run between 100-1000. Another reason might be cost; many of which require licenses while others only provide limited functionality for free. I personally think it's great to know exactly how our products work because it makes troubleshooting easier when problems arise later on. If you'd rather skip that step, let me point out that there are plenty of companies making various types of satellite technology available ranging anywhere form Wi-Fi transmissions up to laser beams transmitting wavelengths in the x-ray range. Unfortunately, none of them allow users access to raw image files without having to pay extra fees. For instance, here's an overview video detailing just how powerful the Light Detection And Ranging laser beam technology used for LIDAR imaging software really is. They don't mention anything related to photography but it should still demonstrate a pretty good idea of just how much detail you could pull out of multiple measurements taken by webcams. Let's check that box right off the bat after all:). If you find yourself wanting to dive deeper look no further than the makerspace hosted by Maker Faire or visit sites like Instructables. Both have quite extensive guides to building specific projects based upon popular open source platforms like Arduinos and Raspberry Pi s. If you're interested in learning how to program computers and electronics you should definitely pick up into Python programming language along with associated libraries. That way you'll be able to integrate whatever kind of technologies you desire with almost any operating system running on an ARM processor. Bitcoin mining pools also house whole GPU clusters dedicated to special tasks like rendering graphics or solving complex mathematical equations relating to BlockChain. Very quickly though, modern CPUs shine compared to GPUs. Even better news for you fanboys out there is that there's a growing number of hobbyist groups attempting to develop high performance computing platforms powered by single core 8GB Intel i7 processors. Now that we've talked about where to acquire basic knowledge concerning microcontrollers, components, 3D printing and open source development tools, let's begin designing something comparable to Project Tango by modifying our existing boards. We won't be doing anything fancy, just spinning up a new blog post. Dammit! Instead, we'll focus on building a simple yet robust camera capable of converting incoming ambient light captured through its lens into color representations visible to human observers. This particular design uses OpenCV library v0.3.1 combined with custom code utilizing V4L2 API calls.

"Microsoft has updated its Xbox Cloud Gaming app for Android, adding support for the dual-screen Surface Duo. Surface Duo users will see a virtual gamepad on one screen and the game itself in full resolution when connected to another display - basically a split view mode like Google's own Daydream View VR headset or Samsung's stand-alone GearVR device. While most of us probably don't need all that extra power right now (or ever), Microsoft is working with partners including AMD, Qualcomm and NVIDIA to integrate cloud gaming technology into new devices as it continues building HoloLens 2, an augmented reality smartglasses system that runs Windows 10 X apps via holograms. The company also wants developers to build more 3D games that can be displayed across multiple screens, creating what CEO Satya Nadella calls ""the next computing platform"" for people who want to play, watch TV or interact socially online. The update brings current features such as Game DVR and friends lists into general availability, while expanding to include multi-user multiplayer options across platforms from PlayStation 4 Pro up through PC and Mac versions. There are some neat little details included in this release too: you can easily switch between portrait and landscape modes using your phone's keyboard; there's a handy Live Tile shortcut for turning off notifications when you come back from playing; and if things go really wrong Microsoft offers the ability to reset a player's profile settings without having to reinstall everything from scratch.

"Falso is a package that can produce fake data in the browser and NodeJS. It features more than 140 functions and it is tree shakeable and fully typed, so unused imports will not affect the build process of your project. There are many other packages out there which claim to be able to do this kind of thing but Falsy does most things while making no compromises. I've also found one very interesting post by Mark Erikson (the author of Redux) about how he uses falsy for conditional rendering with React components. Let me show you an example: As you see, I have two buttons. Each button has its own JSX code using props. A boolean value defaults to true, thus showing both renderings at once. Then if some condition passes, only one of these should happen. In our case we want to hide that second button. We could achieve that following traditional ways such as passing a prop or setting state: But since we already have nested objects like labels and attributes inside each component, let's pass falsy values instead: This way works perfectly. Surprisingly even though falsy was created specifically to solve this problem, almost all libraries that handle formatting problems just use strings! When faced with questions regarding formatters we always end up going back to string manipulation... until now:)",0,715
"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology involves a lot of math, and there are many papers discussing its underlying reasoning, it's only when you start to dig into those specifics that AI researchers begin to see what they have actually built. In this post I want to describe my journey in learning more about Deep Learning, where this knowledge took me, and why knowing these things made me feel like less of an idiot for asking basic questions about neural networks (NN). In particular I will discuss two things: firstly, exactly what NNs are; then secondly, how I came across deep RL (deep reinforcement learning) as a practical way of solving certain problems - or rather, ""the best"" approach for some problems. After doing so, I hope to explain what the problem was, and argue that deep RL isn't a silver bullet but can be very powerful. Only after showing off how powerful deep RL is, should I go on to show why people think deep RL doesn't scale well. Despite what others may say, I believe no one has yet shown that scaling deep RL is impossible. For now though, let us take stock of our progress towards building machines that are intelligent enough to steal your job. What Is A Neural Network? Before we get started I would recommend reading through at least parts of a recent paper called Information Processing In Computational Models Of Brain Function by Geoffrey Hinton et al., which is available online [1]. It provides a clear introduction of Neural Networks based solely around their function, something I found myself struggling with whenever looking at NN papers before reading that paper. The name comes from the fact that our understanding the brain is still incomplete and the behaviour of neurons inside them does not necessarily reflect any actual processing happening. They don't even perform arithmetic operations quite generally! Instead each neuron takes weighted inputs from other neurons and produces outputs depending upon both the weights of connections and the state of individual cells themselves (via spikes). The combination of these activities gives rise to patterns of spiking activity, from which information emerges over time and space leading to complex decisions being taken. To translate this back into machine learning terms, imagine yourself trying to build a process that could learn to recognise cats and dogs in images from the web. Rather than providing raw pixels and features fed directly into whatever type of model you want to use (e.g. Convolutional Neural Nets), you need to provide the network with examples of cats (photos) and dogs (other photos from the web). Each image needs to contain multiple objects, all spatially connected together. Some input patterns might give rise to different responses in the output layer according to the weightings provided. Once trained, the system learns the map between the input and output layers, producing what appear to be correct classifications. But ideally, if you were able to view every single detail of the neurons, you would find out that none were performing simple additions because the activation being measured had been carefully crafted to yield the desired result without using such logic. Yet despite modelling millions of randomly chosen neurons within the brain, scientists cannot reproduce that level of precision simply by feeding in data. We cannot draw conclusions from observing just neurons, as the relationships between events occurring beyond the reach of our current mathematical tools means that anything we measure must also include the dynamics of non-neuronal mechanisms. As we gain greater insight into these remaining mysteries, our models will become better approximations of reality and allow us to make predictions we wouldn't otherwise be able to predict. Deep Neural Networks As far as I am aware, people who call themselves ""Neural Net"" experts typically refer to Artificial Intelligence applications based entirely around simulating human brains rather than real ones. They tend to focus almost exclusively on ""classification,"" whether applied to photographs or videos or audio recordings. This tends to mean they fail to appreciate that classification, while important, is only half a picture of intelligence since we already have plenty of smart systems today that aren't classified at all. Modeling a biological neural net requires dealing with lots more complexity, including some issues regarding neuroplasticity that are ignored by existing solutions. However, what is often overlooked among proponents of the AI revolution is that cognitive science research shows that while we don't fully understand how our own minds work, there is enough evidence to suggest that large layered structures exist in part to deal with uncertainty. So instead of completing graphs and equations, we decided to try a new thing: experiment. Our goal wasn't to create a computer program whose sole purpose was to win Jeopardy!, but rather a simulation of a range of possible ways humans can solve problems. How do we define ""problem solving""? Well, consider the following question: Which value hasn't changed recently? If we asked this kind of question to groups of 1st grade children, some would memorise the values, whilst others would reason, compare, count backwards or attempt to interpret the situation.

"The American CryptoFed DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is the first legally recognized DAO in the US. It is based on the EOS protocol instead of Ethereum, the cryptocurrency most commonly used to build decentralized applications. Founded by two developers from Texas and California, it was launched on April 25th 2019 at ETHDenver's hackathon event. The project has received an incredible amount of media attention since its launch due to the risk-free investment model as well as the unique use case for this type of structure that provides investors a return if the system succeeds or fails. Blockchain technology offers many advantages including immutable transaction records, cross border transactions, security against hacks and fraud, privacy protection, transparency and cost savings. America's crypto community wants more Americans to be part of these benefits through real tangible projects focused around economic development opportunities within our country. To achieve this goal we are using distributed ledgers such as blockchain technology and DAOs which best serve these requirements. In order to attract new users into the existing network, the team decided not only to run their own token sale but also to offer free tokens directly to any user who registers there account with them while they are running their ICO sales. This means anyone can start investing in their own Blockchain ecosystem even before the main crowdsale begins! American CryptoFed aims to empower U.S citizens with education, job training, and employment opportunities throughout rural communities utilizing disruptive technologies like public blockchains. They believe that access to capital should never be limited in the United States because allocating funds responsibly will always be better than allowing money to sit idle. Unlike traditional venture funding models where money sits unused until someone loses faith in those investments, American CryptoFed anticipates that the low barriers of entry along with the ability for consumersinvestors to immediately receive dividends will motivate long term participation. What makes the American CryptoFed platform different? What sets them apart from other similar platforms out there? Well, unlike some others, they do plan on getting involved in regional politics while holding local elections. On top of that you will find them offering incentives to voters and politicians alike. For example: The next time you vote, your reward will come in the form of 1 AMCFD Token per voter, bought back during auctioning off votes. You'll get paid back via dividend payments once the election results have been confirmed. They've already started voting towards one candidate - Dallas McLean. Next up, Kyoto, KY USA! Another way the American CryptoFed model differs from what we know about cryptocurrencies today is their decision to operate under a non profit foundation rather than being listed on exchanges or use an Initial Coin Offering Model. When building something like American CryptoFed, having legal representation is key. This allows people to become surer that their assets are safe when contributing to American Cryptofed. In addition, they can go further than just setting up a fund; they can execute programs themselves and manage projects without needing third parties. Furthermore, they don't need to worry about compliance issues. As the Decentralization Movement continues to grow, so does awareness regarding government regulations. With proper consulting, the team behind American CryptoFed is confident that they're covered. Finally, how could anyone forget why they are doing this in the first place: providing jobs. By creating a strong board of directors, hiring qualified staff members, working closely with teachers and students, developing specialized curriculum, supporting STEM initiatives across the county, encouraging involvement in local politics, and engaging young talent, the vision becomes clear - helping educate others and create meaningful jobs that encourage growth and success. So basically, making significantly positive impact on society AND unleashing massive value to the economy. Instead of putting everyone else through years of school, now millions of kids can earn degrees online from accredited universities that have partnered with us. Our goal is to give every child in America the opportunity to succeed no matter what obstacle gets in the way. We want to make sure that each individual receives equal educational opportunities and resources regardless of gender, race or socio-economic status. That's why we created an A rating from Charity Navigator 4 of profits meant to provide scholarships and grants to high quality schools that partner with us. Not only is this needed, but it helps reduce over population rates and ensures increased equality among neighborhoods and families alike. History of the American CryptoFed Foundation The American CryptoFed Foundation was founded in 2018 after meeting multiple times with representatives from various industries. From financial advisors to educators, insurance specialists to business owners, entrepreneurs to small businesses, politicians to organizations looking for help, it seemed there were countless professionals available willing to talk about how technology could benefit them as individuals and collectively. One of the things they talked about was how to take advantage of the emerging decentralization movement and utilize innovative financing methods. Once this discussion got rolling, ideas began flowing. ""We spoke about ways that traditional venture capitalists could change their model to allow startups to scale faster, without waiting for months upon days thinking process,"" explains Seth Moolton,with twinning consensus at least partially responsible for carrying the rest of the text illserving.

"Netflix plans to offer a less expensive tier supported by advertising. Many of its competitors have ad-backed tiers and many advertisers have pushed for the streaming giant to let them run ads in their content, but Netflix is holding out on this option until it can be confident that it won't cannibalize revenue from premium memberships. In an interview with The Verge at CES 2019 today (Jan 6), CEO Reed Hastings said he expects his service will charge 8-9 per month as a base fee - much cheaper than other rivals including Disney, which recently revealed pricing details for new subscribers.

"Rivian's network of Level 3 fast DC chargers will be accessible to nearly every other EV on the road. Because they're all connected, drivers can charge at any time and avoid the frustration that comes with waiting for a charger or finding an open one along their commute. And Rivian is also actively working on developing advanced battery technology so it only takes hours instead of days to recharge your vehicle - which could make those charging stations even less necessary down the line. The company claims its vehicles are ""safer than gas"" because they have no engine emissions. The R1T has six airbags across three frames, including two that deploy from behind the rear seats in case you need them. They'll start out standard but eventually become optional if there aren't enough buyers. Safety features like lane keep assist, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring and ultrasonic sensors inside mirrors could come as well. Tesla hasn't announced pricing yet though early estimates say 78k for the base model, more than twice what some rival EVs cost once tax credits are factored in. That price tag makes it a hard sell despite potential incentives offered by several states, including Nevada, California and Hawaii where Tesla operates stores. But the 20 markdown means someone who buys the Model Y won't feel ripped off after spending hundreds or thousands more for similar-sized luxury cars. For now, we just haven't seen many compelling reasons why a Tesla owner should trade up.",0,720
"Netflix's latest experiment, Fast Laughs, is a feed of short-form comedy clips drawn from its catalog of shows. Fast Laughs offers full-screen videos that can be swiped through vertically, with each clip featuring the signature jumbo font and red logo slathered across the top of a black background. For now, Netflix has only made one type of video available: sketches based on episodes from David Letterman or Adam Sandler movies (as well as some movies starring Steve Carell). Other styles will follow over time, including standup routines and music parodies, which are more likely to appear in other streaming services like HBO Max. But for now, it seems clear that the company views this library of content - all acquired, Binge Mode included, by Snap Inc., whose CEO Evan Spiegel worked at Netflix before founding his own service, according to TechCrunch sources - as something worth maintaining beyond the time when people start bingeing their way through every episode. In fact, the potential for profit may even exceed what they earn from subscriptions to subscription services such as Amazon Prime Video and Hulu Plus. ""This isn't just about novelty,"" said Daniel Ek, chief executive officer of Spotify, who joined Netflix last year after a 20-year career building digital businesses around North America and Europe. ""We're not doing any of these things because we think anyone else is going to pay us."" Instead, he says, Netflix is trying to find new ways of getting people to subscribe to its 8 per month offer while simultaneously making enough money to cover the costs of running such an operation. If anything, he argues, Fast Laugs could serve as evidence that Netflix is finding success in attracting users back into the fold. And if it continues to do so, there might soon come a day, perhaps sooner than you'd expect, when people don't need to use YouTube Red to watch old episodes of Friends anyway.",0,721
"Amazon will acquire MGM Studios for 8.45 billion. It will be the second-largest acquisition in Amazon's history after its purchase of Whole Foods in 2017. The deal shows how Amazon is willing to spend big on entertainment content, even though it has not been able to gain a foothold as much due to increasing competition from Netflix and other providers. ""This transaction combines two iconic companies that have shaped popular culture worldwide,"" said Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon. ""We are excited to welcome this talented team into our company."" Bezos' announcement comes just hours before Disney begins opening previews of Marvel's Avengers: Endgame at theaters around the world. Fans were already lining up outside movie theaters across America when news broke late Tuesday night about Amazon's plan to buy out 21st Century Fox and the rest of what remains of Time Warner Inc (TWX). Related: How This Movie Deal Could Affect You - From Movies To Broadway Shows To Your Favorite TV Show Season Passes Few people know exactly why Amazon would want to do something like this but the reason might surprise you. For now there's no word if these assets will remain intact under Amazon or how they fit within the new company structure. But it was clear Amazon executives had their eye on Hollywood throughout 2018. Last year alone, Amazon released one blockbuster film starring Jennifer Lopez: Second Act, which brought in 250 million globally off the back of strong reviews from critics, and 2D animated feature Mozart! In Space, along with another kids show called Kariye Shopping - Efsanevlerisi ve Ticareti. Both starred Aydin Senkapag who became an overnight sensation on YouTube thanks to his live performances on traditional Turkish music accompanied by dance moves. He also appeared alongside Julia Roberts in Homecoming starring Kevin Hart. And last December saw the arrival of 24 Frames, an indie romcom directed by Yaman Ergenekon who won Best Director at Turkey's Golden Orange Awards earlier this month. But if Amazon does end up purchasing all those other properties, we wonder where else they'll go? There's certainly some room left to grow among Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Now and Showtime streaming services.",0,722

"Developer Zukalous spent over one year creating a challenging platform game called 1 Screen Platformer. As it was his first game, he decided to make it short and focused on the gameplay instead of complicated story or beautiful graphics. After submitting an early prototype on itch.io in 2015 and getting positive feedback from the community for its unique mechanics and interesting concept, developer Nielzpaul began work on incorporating more content into this early version as part of a larger project titled 'The Dreaming City', which would eventually be released as The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds back in 2016. We sat down with him about how long these ideas had been bouncing around his head before turning them into a playable demo. How do you define your own personal style? What is important to you when making games? My personal style isn't so much defined by genre as I'm not very particular what genres people classify me under, although my favourite pastimes are roguelikes, top-down actionadventure rpgs (weirdo!), side scrolling adventure games and platformers but I'd say just call me ""a gamer."" It's all fine though because I love working with all of those different styles fairly equally - even if they're seemingly opposite ends of the spectrum! I simply enjoy playing most things that involve solving puzzles, finding keysitems and meeting obstacles through clever thinking rather than relying purely on button mashing. So anything along with these themes will probably tickle my fancy at some point during development:P. In terms of being critical of myself however, I think the best thing anyone can do is take time out of their day and try new things; it'll teach you far quicker and better than any criticism ever could. That said, if there were something in question that I felt strongly negatively towards then obviously there would be merit in speaking up but sometimes we have great feedback without having even realised that we need it ourselves... How do you feel about your recent work compared to where you currently want to go long term? Are you satisfied with both? Is there still room for improvement? Do you ever get stuck? If yes, why? I don't really know how much progress I've made since posting my last update 5 months ago now. When starting off I didn't set my goals too high initially but after nearly dying several times developing the same idea multiple ways thanks to bad programming decisions I quickly learnt that I needed to either stop trying to keep my brain alive by drowning it in code or start putting together something worthwhile. Some might argue that I already tried doing the latter and failed miserably twice due to lack of proper planning or motivation, but maybe that meant I should give the former another chance;D I'm happy with the current state of affairs right now - no real reason to change anything yet, apart from adding life bars etc. - I'm sure a lot has changed since then! My biggest concern is whether or not sales numbers will increase enough to justify hiring additional personnel properly. Nowadays it seems like every week someone posts a blog post saying ""New guy here!"" and the response usually goes something like ""Oh yeah cool"" except on Twitter. There doesn't seem to be many jobs advertised anymore (or perhaps that's just my area?). Of course, none of us care in the slightest if we gain more followers on Facebook and twitter, but for some reason developers prefer job sites and forums to social media nowadays. Either way, am only interested in good projects regardless of who makes them! Completionist: No I wouldn't consider myself a completionist! But I certainly strive for 100 achievement in everything I create. Having said that, I did recently discover two mistakes that I've never noticed until people pointed them out to me... Ah well. You learn from your mistakes. And if you make enough of them, then we won't mind:). Why did you choose to develop using Unity3d, particularly as opposed to other software packages? Was this decision difficult? Which aspect surprised you most while building the final product? Have you found useful features missing from Unity3d itself that you wish existed otherwise? Any plans to release future versions of ""1 Screen Platformer""? Will you continue with similar projects in the future? For example, if done correctly, [Innocent Bystander] was quite impressive despite the low budget ) Epic Fail: Yes, it wasn't hard. Although it took ages to find the funds, especially considering the fact that I knew nothing about coding before diving in. At this stage, learning Unity3d was easy compared to setting up servers to host the online leaderboards and achievements in the beginning. That being said, not knowing Python allowed me to write procedural level generation algorithms efficiently straight away whereas the C scripting language required a bit longer to comprehend fully. Overall, it's all pretty straightforward stuff once you wrap your head around the basics.

"Karate is a tool that combines API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing, and UI automation into a single framework. It uses BDD syntax and has powerful JSON and XML assertions built-in. Developers can create their own tests using an interface called Gherkin or the Karate DSL (domain specific language). The benefits of karatemoji are: it's easy to learn; you don't need experience in any programming languages before diving in; You get 100 coverage with no bugs. Of course, if you do have some prior knowledge about one language, you will be able to dive right in; The code provides basic examples so it's easier for beginners than React Native does. We've got our team working on this project full time since we launched! If your idea sounds interesting please contact us through email at . We analyzed 4 different types of testing tools mentioned below. To conclude, KARATEMOOCH was the most suitable solution for mobile automated functional testing even though there were many intense competitors as well. In addition, we also went ahead with creating our custom solutions which we implemented using Nodejs and TypeScript. What Is Testing? Testing consists of identifying values related to elements that appear during interactions between users and program application components such as user interfaces, data structures, algorithms, etc. Manual verification by testers takes place after development while the process involves checking whether all specifications included for software design work correctly. One way to identify problems that could arise from faulty processes is via manual testing [source]. Even though it is very expensive, having experienced quality assurance professionals verify designs makes sure errors aren't made when designing products and hence reduces costs significantly. Thus, QA teams focus mainly on uncovering defects found within applications so they can pinpoint where issues occur. This leads to better product management and considerably higher sales revenue because fewer customers complain about buggy apps which means less money lost due to dissatisfied customers. These responsibilities include evaluating code from other developers who may not accompany them, ensuring applications meets requirements, following standards set forth, fixing any flaws identified by clients, and analyzing client feedback regarding how beneficial changes would impact the end product. Lastly, testers ensure those changes created won't lead to disastrous outcomes like security breaches or unexpected behavior which might damage functionality. Implications Of Software Development On Society And Environment Doing proper research pertaining to environmental legislation and safety regulations will help avoid violating laws when developing software. Moreover, making use of sustainable energy sources may entail more cost per unit but the overall expense reduced over time. For example, solar power as opposed to natural gas or coal usage is much cheaper than traditional methods of gaining electricity. Since switching to renewables doesn't involve hazardous chemicals or harmful emissions, much of society treats these technologies favorably along with wanting greater progress towards sustainability. Also, investing in alternative modes of transportation instead of cars encourages job creation and eliminates pollution. Also, integrating renewable energies with smart grids promotes efficiency and cuts down expenses rather dramatically too. Hence, adopting clean technology saves resources and helps meet goals for protecting nature as a whole. Furthermore, every business must follow guidelines for both labor practices and environment protection. Such actions make company workers feel valued and appreciated which motivates employees and boosts morale. Therefore, businesses should consider researching ways to incorporate green features to promote employee satisfaction, enhance customer loyalty, and revitalize brand reputation among consumers. Finally, it is crucial to adopt ecofriendly measures including utilizing recycling facilities for waste and choosing energy efficient programs for computing power which enables companies to lessen carbon footprints thereby mitigating negative impacts on climate change. Overall, programmers adhere to certain codes of conduct which aim at improving citizens' lives in terms of health, employment opportunities, social wellbeing, success rate, and competitiveness. For instance, fair pay, transparency, anti-discrimination policies, diversity, respect, inclusion of minorities, equal opportunity, compensation based on merit, flexible scheduling, and good communication styles foster collaboration amongst individuals leading to positive results. Different Types Of Automated Functional Testings And Their Benefits 1) Unit Tests Unit tests consist of verifying each part individually without considering others that may relate back together. They provide various advantages which includes quicker implementation, increased reliability, and greater scalability. All units become isolated and can therefore benefit independent from each other thus providing the ability to write integration tests later. Each section can then be tested separately resulting in faster testing times. Integration tests prove helpful for testing sections alongside one another meaning everything goes smoothly when multiple parts are running simultaneously. In fact, coding several functions in Java becomes difficult when writing automatic tests. However, it's possible to achieve with ease when using frameworks such as JUNITSPEC4J or Cucumber. When implementing a system under test, devs will only concern themselves tests focused on particular tasks and skip irrelevant ones. Due to its limited scope, unit tests sometimes fail to cover all scenarios, leaving developers feeling overwhelmed and unable to debug problematic areas properly. Besides, conventional approaches require extensive development cycles which result in overruns developing unsuitable slowcore emicients being evaluated by the Teataperio2, for And last resort expectations this means Me urnatRutchinality competin",0,725

"Over the last two years, researchers have rewritten nearly every major chapter in our galaxy's history due to working with better data. In 2018, the European spacecraft Gaia released a trove of new measurements for stars and galaxies around Earth including millions of new precise distances on how far away they are from us. Today (Nov. 13), scientists announced that their most recent estimate now puts the Milky Way at 1 trillion miles across, or roughly 17 percent bigger than previous estimates made over the past 2 decades. The figure comes courtesy of calculations based off of billions of observations taken by Gaia during its first three months of operations. Since it launched into orbit 634 million kilometers above Earth in December 2013, Gaia has collected more than 150 billion astrometric positions of stars, constraining how much mass is between them thus giving astronomers an estimated radius. To put this measurement into perspective: That distance would be equivalent to what one person could wrap his arms around about 9 times before he'd hit the moon if he were standing still. And while many other previously-estimated figures had been within 5 of that number, Gaia's measurement was so accurate it pushed out all but 0.5.In any case, the news isn't just groundbreaking because we've come closer to understanding our own home galaxy. It's also been another important step towards verifying Albert Einstein's General Theory Of Relativity, which describes gravity as falling objects feel against each other through space time itself rather than purely by matter alone. Thanks to these changes in theory, no set amount of matter will ever ""explain"" why something else exists without making assumptions such as infinite energy, or infinite numbers of particles. According to Andrew Liddle, author of Gravity Cosmology: Jumping Gravitational Forces You Haven't Seen Before. These] particle theories explain everything you can possibly see. So they account for nothing outside of looking.""So when NASA astronaut Scott Kelly successfully completed 340 days in space back in March 2016, it provided additional proof supporting GR and its importance.

"Scientists in China have developed an extremely fast charging technology that can charge a lithium-ion battery to up to 60 percent capacity in under six minutes. The technology involves a unique electrochemical process, which is reported today (April 27) in Nature Energy by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Fujian University of Technology. The development builds on prior work described earlier this year by researchers at Tsinghua University, who also showed how nanoscale graphite particles power high performance batteries for short periods without degradation over thousands of cycles. But because they were limited to less than 10 percentage points, their potential was not as great as the new system that has reached 60 percent capacities after just a few seconds. [Gallery: Fast Charging Batteries] ""This represents a big step forward,"" said researcher Jianliang Xiao, lead author of the study published in nature energy, ""as it demonstrates a very efficient way to recharge without any loss of power."" His team's results show that when used with commercially available electrodes, it should be possible to achieve full recharging within five or fewer minutes, he added. Lithium storage devices such as cells are currently built using porous carbon materials called supercapacitors; these store energy chemically but do so slowly, meaning that people must wait hours or even days before they can use them again. Supercapacitor tanks offer far greater power density - that is, more energy stored per unit volume - compared to traditional capacitors, and because they don't degrade with time like other chemical systems, they could change our idea about what constitutes a small portable device. This research shows that if we want devices that provide longer lasting power on demand, then we need to harness both chemistry and physics, Xiao told LiveScience. How it works Xiao's group first needed to build enough room inside the cell to accommodate huge amounts of current, explained Li Dongdong, deputy director of Professor Zhang Gaoli's Center for Novel Materials and Devices of the Key Laboratory of Functional Inorganic Nanomaterials and Related Applications Underlying Mechanism of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. To avoid overheating, conventional liquid electrolytes cannot flow through narrow spaces between electrodes, but graphene sheets make excellent channels because there is no resistance across micrometer gaps. These flexible sheets would allow us to pack many times more conductive carbon atoms into one square inch of space compared with the cylindrical fibers found in existing commercial cathode materials, Wang Minhui, another member of Gaoli's team working on the project, previously told LiveScience. In experiments designed to understand why higher temperatures led to better performance, his team discovered that increasing temperature caused electrostatic repulsion among negatively charged ions inside the electrode pores. That made the nanopores smaller, reducing the distance between positive and negative charges, boosting electric currents flowing around the electrode surface. With this knowledge as background information, Xiao co put together two different types of highly ordered mesoporous carbons known as MCM-41 and SBA15. Both already had been shown to enable rapid ion diffusion. But only MSC composite demonstrated stable electrical properties after cycling hundreds of times, while SBC material degraded quickly upon repeated discharges. So Xiao decided to see whether combining the two kinds of carbon would result in even faster charging times. Indeed, his team now reports that electrons travel twice as fast along the MCS interface compared with SC alone. Combining the two compounds produced 3000 increase in peak power density, Xinxin Liu, one of the authors of the paper, noted on her personal blog. Realizing the importance of nanoarchitecture, Zhu Xiaoping and colleagues assemble three-dimensional graphene frameworks into a hierarchically organized double layer structure. Pressurized against Ni foam substrates, these composites produce large specific areas and high volumetric capacitances independent of the pore size and geometry of the underlying substrate, offering a major advance toward practical applications. Cellulose films (a green renewable feedstock) coated with these scaffolds yield impressive performances due to their high geometric area provided by a hierarchical architecture based on polymeric networks, reinforced by aligned 3D framework structures. Graphene has recently received much attention due to its extraordinary physical and mechanical properties. However, until now, synthesis methods have offered little control over the final morphologies imparted to graphene resulting in nonuniform samples containing domains with varying sizes and shapes. Here, Zhiyuan Gao et al., from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, demonstrate fabrication techniques to synthesize submicron-sized GO flakes supported by well-aligned CeO2 nanoparticles acting as electron conducting supports. They find that the ability of CeGO hybrids to efficiently transfer photogenerated holes in organic dye sensitized solar cells depends strongly on partial reduction of GO during their fabrication, mediated by oxidized oxygen functionalities present on the outermost layers of reduced GO flake surfaces. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the researchers model the effect of physicochemical interactions on thin layered flocks where they plan to maintaination rates as a but will open conditions that value.

"A hacker claims to have stolen over 500GB of data from Microsoft's private GitHub repositories. The hacker had originally intended to sell the information but has now decided to give it away instead as part of a ""guerilla campaign"" against ""evil organizations."" The hack comes just days after a ransom was demanded for the release of hundreds of gigabytes worth of files that were allegedly taken from LinkedIn, Twitter and Github accounts by hacking group Lulz Security (LulzSec). Although no one is reported to have paid the 100,000 (150,000) in Bitcoin required at the time, the alleged info-leakage could be significant if true, because the hackers are claiming they've obtained user credentials for each account along with passwords and email addresses belonging to employees who worked on everything from Windows 8 to Office 365. If this all turns out legit, it would effectively make every password weak - and thus valuable - in an instant; we'll update this post once more details become available about how much may have been lost. [Update: We're hearing some smaller amounts than what Lulzsec initially claimed - see bottom.] In any case, Angela Whitehouse reports over at ZDNet that she found evidence online explaining where the leak originated, and folks working today with whom she spoke confirmed its validity. She writes: According to several sources I conversed with, the thief was planning on selling access to the leaked data before deciding to dump them instead... This person believes the hacker will continue releasing chunks of this trove until heshe gets caught or the company takes action against himher, which most likely won't happen since there isn't anything incriminating attached to these releases yet. Some people think it should be made public immediately so others don't fall victim when their accounts get hacked in the future. It wasn't clear whether the individual intends to keep leaking fresh batches of the leak indefinitely. You can read her full writeup here. UPDATE 1:45 pm ET: More leaks! Per Quinn Norton, another source tipped us off about new documents being released via torrents that contain not only other internal docs, but also Microsoft developer laptops presumably used for work purposes. According to our own analysis, those include Skype videos, Excel spreadsheets containing contact lists and MSDN subscription records. Check below: As you can imagine, however, given that many thousands of users use Skype for business, using Skype video logs might reveal very personal information. And like the LinkedIn hacks last week, which contained things like payroll info, job titles, salary ranges and bonus data, it appears to be too early to speculate about exactly how much money was potentially affected. But considering these kinds of leaks usually come down to payment transactions, it wouldn't surprise me to hear about such a transaction occurring here soon.

He points out that while LulzSec claimed to take over 165 million logins between May 2011 and April 2013, and ""probably"" took 100 million passwords, only two thirds of the network requests came from Russian IP addresses. For example, he says that looking through some 30 GB worth of HTTP traffic, he couldn't find anything indicative of the actual amount of login information indexed during that period. In other words, while it looks like the database includes lot of names and emails, it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone whose name and address appear in the breached file actually logged into that service. Here's why that matters: WHY DID LAULZ SEC HIT AEROSPACE? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HACKED THE INTERNET?! GAH MY EYES ARE STICKING!! Also Boeing Commercial Airplanes American Airlines Space Shuttle - LoafingOAF (loafingof18) July 23, 2014 So basically we now know that the database does indeed contain lots of Microsoft employee IDs, but judging by the fact that the vast majority of the requests for the said database came from Russia, chances are good that a huge percentage of them didn't even touch the services meant to store usernamepassword combinations behind certain companies.

"While CRISPR technology has the potential to help many people, it also has the potential to be used as a dangerous weapon. The technology works by editing genes within living organisms, how this is done and possible outcomes are being studied in detail. One of these studies took place recently at the University of Cambridge where researchers tested how bacteria with edited CRISPR gene systems would react to antibiotics that were meant to wipe them out. The research team wanted to figure out if they could make viruses resistant to an antibiotic by knocking out key proteins which are needed for its ability to kill cells. They did this using two different types of modified DNA - one designed to cause fatal mutations on infected bacterial cell walls and another designed to knock out specific proteins when inserted into the genome. Using both approaches they worked out whether there was any way in which this virus could become immune to an existing drug. To test their theory, they infected E. coli bacteria with each version of modified DNA along with regular synthetic RNA (RNA produced from lab-made genetic material). This allowed the scientists to observe what happened inside the cell after exposure to several antibiotics including ampicillin and tetracycline. Their findings showed that: An engineered bacterium can develop resistance to certain drugs, suggesting that similar adaptations might occur during therapy. Both techniques led to viable endpoints but only by killing nonviable targets; Both methods resulted in lasting changes by disrupting normal processes; and Resistance mediated by genomic modification occurred via different pathways than those induced through transcriptional effects or point mutation alone. It's still early days though so don't go rushing out to buy your first set of CRISPR kits just yet! Even if you have everything ready to edit human genes, there may not actually be much benefit to doing so until we learn more about safety issues and long-term effects. It could take years before anything useful comes off the ground but things will move quickly once companies jump headlong into exploring ways to use CRISPR to create new life forms. And even then don't hold me personally responsible for all the amazing applications humans find for the technology... (Images from Shutterstock)",0,732
"Israel's Defense Ministry has created a laser that can intercept rockets and antitank guided missiles. It is based on a precision laser beam that can be focused on long-range targets , such as missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Wednesday the development of this system in an effort to cope with rocket attacks from Gaza Strip terrorists for Israeli citizens living near the border between Israel and Egypt. The announcement was made during Netanyahu's meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House. In addition, he praised U.S.-made weapons, saying they were ""the best."" He also said that his country will ""never accept"" any deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program. A senior official from China revealed the Chinese government would like to hold talks about creating a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) following trade negotiations concluded between Beijing and Washington last month. This means the two countries have agreed not only to ease their tariffs but to negotiate other things too including how far they should go towards opening up markets and doing business together more freely. But while there are many challenges ahead, one thing seems clear: after years dragging their feet over opening up their economies, both sides now seem serious about striking deals.

"The pandemic has caused hairlines to recede faster than usual through both stress and the aftereffects of Covid-19. dNovo, a biotech startup, claims that it can create new hair using human cells that have not been damaged by radiation or chemotherapy. In March 2020, when most people were still living their daily lives with minimal interruption from the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic, scientists at California Institute for Biomedical Innovation in San Fransisco announced they had successfully replicated embryonic stem cell lines in mice. The announcement was met with much fanfare in media coverage across the world as well as excitement among those who believed this portended the potential for creating long awaited cures for incurable diseases like cancer. Around the same time, doctors in Boston used genetically modified male mouse sperm to produce healthy pups, which raised similar hopes about an eventual means of producing human eggs and sperms. But these two very exciting scientific developments are only the first steps towards large scale production. In fact, it is likely many months before we will start seeing widespread clinical trials hoping to use these breakthroughs, if ever. And until then, there remains little hope for bringing any treatments into wide usage anytime soon. What makes some more hopeful? A company called D'Arcy BioScience, based out of New York City, recently announced another successful round of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs), created without genetic engineering methods but rather using skin samples derived from patients undergoing cosmetic surgery procedures. Not surprisingly, this news set off a firestorm of debate online - mostly supportive of D'Arcy while critics voiced concern over safety and ethics issues surrounding such research. Many others pointed out, however, that D'Arcy does offer options for donating tissue samples for iPSC generation including breast reduction, face lift facelift, liposuction and abdominoplasty surgeries - all performed under local anaesthesia. While this may sound ominous in its implications, researchers claim that reprogramming technology already exists and the innovations needed to bring them forward should be all but ready after the recent successes of the D' Arcy team. To date, these reprogrammed iPSCs appear no different from ones produced via traditional techniques and may even possess enhanced properties, making them worth exploring further studies. For one thing, unlike other adult stem cells created so far, the 'adult' cells could potentially include patient DNA remnants left behind during earlier transformations or inaccuracies introduced during sample collection. These represent risks that cannot be completely eliminated to this day and may become greater moving forward. But beyond ethical concerns, there remain serious questions regarding whether these advances can actually help fight disease. What is known today is that once neural progenitor cells have reached sufficient maturity and have developed certain traits, they behave just like brain neurons. This includes firing synapses, maintaining pools of neurotransmitters as required by specific functions; sending signals along nerve pathways; and forming connections with neighbouring neurons. It is this neurogenesis factor that sets apart these cells from other types of cells found elsewhere in our bodies. While also capable of maturing into muscle cells, bone and fat cells, the final goal here would seem to be generating functional organs, tissues or whole body replacements. For example, neural stem cells generated from skin biopsies of Parkinson's Disease sufferers, showed significant improvements in movement disorders compared to controls, although further study on larger scales is required. Researchers at University College London reported success in coaxing skin-derived fibroblasts (the type of cells that form scar tissue and connective tissue) into becoming heart muscle cells which improved blood flow around blocked arteries. Still others report almost identical results here from dermal cells taken from scars relating to accidents and medical conditions. Successful attempts have been made to generate retinal pigment epithelial cells through the repurposing of prostate cells, suggesting vascularization problems might be remedied in cases involving macular degeneration and Diabetic Retinopathy. Other applications include developing nerves for peripheral nerve repair, alpha motor neurons to replace spinal cord injury damage, cartilage cells to treat rheumatoid arthritis pain, smooth muscles for bladder regeneration, sweat glands to address cystic fibrosis complications, pancreas beta cells to aid diabetes treatment, red blood cells for transfusions, and increasing amounts of oxygen transporting lung capacity. All of these application areas, as yet untested, point toward a future where ""plasticity"" itself becomes a key driver in regenerative medicine. This is why companies like Senolytics.ai join forces with innovation hubs like the French National Center for Scientific Research, MIT Media Lab and the Max Plank institute UK in promoting cellular plasticity as the way to go not only for better understanding how the body works, but perhaps also tending to serious chronic illnesses. They argue that current therapies do nothing more than mask symptoms by targeting cancerous tumours instead of attacking the root cause of illness: inflammation.

"A leaked video of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G handset suggests that the device might be revealed at Samsung's upcoming August 5th Galaxy Unpacked event. The device appears visually very similar to earlier foldable devices like the LG G8 and Huawei Mate X, with features including a dual-camera setup on its back and a flexible OLED display panel which can open up into multiple modes or even two separate screens. In addition to this new information we also have some internal details about the phone itself as well. According to our source inside Korea, the device will feature an 18:9 aspect ratio (the exact same size as the iPhone 11), 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, 128GB microSD slot, USB Type-C port for chargingdata transfer, IP68 water resistance rating, a 3200 mAh battery, 2x 12MP cameras, one 16MP selfie camera and facial recognition technology.",0,735
"Facebook and Instagram experienced intermittent outages during Thanksgiving. The services have since been restored. Instagram acknowledged the issue on Twitter early Thursday morning and Facebook began to restore access to its site around 11 a.m. local time, according to DownDetector.com The outage affected both apps for BlackBerry users as well as iOS and Android smartphones running Google Maps and WhatsApp respectively. Both platforms had no major changes between them at the time of this writing but it is possible that there could be some minor updates before we see any significant change in service quality. However neither company has officially commented on what caused the outage nor when exactly they will resume normal operations. There was also no reported downtime or issues with either platform's payments systems like Apple Pay or Venmo. The outage comes after a tumultuous few months for the social media giant which not only saw the loss of one billion monthly active users last August following allegations of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica but also revealed subsequently that Russian operatives used these same tactics to influence voters across multiple elections including 2016 presidential election. Despite denying knowledge of the alleged involvement from anyone associated with Russian intelligence agencies over the weekend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced criticism from many quarters regarding his failure to prevent such an attack from taking place in the first place. On top of all this recent news came just days ago when a pair of high profile lawsuits were filed against Facebook accusing the company of being responsible for creating fake profiles for people who wanted to engage in online romance scams. These types of activities are illegal under criminal law but legal under civil liability rules if you can prove your identity was stolen. If successful then individuals would receive damages plus another third party compensation. This situation highlights the precarious path on which the world's most powerful technology platform finds itself, caught between regulation enforcement bodies (the FTC) and litigants willing enough to use extreme measures to make a point. In this context the recent rollback of mobile app permissions raises even more questions about where personal privacy begins and ends within Facebook, especially given how much information we willingly give up as part of our daily lives via their sites.",0,737
"Deep fakes or videos created using artificial intelligence technology and these videos are increasingly common and easy to make. The US government has taken notice of this technology and its potential threat, but even so there have been no prosecutions yet as the creators use techniques that often go undetected by those who watch them. Fake news is a real problem in 2018. Even with all the information available online, people can still be misled by fake stories made for political gain or just simple entertainment. Facebook's attempts at fixing fake news problems only seem to get worse instead of better - which means we need new ways to combat it. Luckily, as always happens when Google comes up with something cool (or maybe not), they share their ideas publicly on Drive. A team from X Labs set out to find solutions on how to tackle fake news; it ended up creating an AI-based tool called Deepfake Detect. The idea behind Deepfake Detect According to the researchers: ""We believe that deepfakes will become more prevalent over time. They provide users an opportunity to create content easily without much technical skills and allow everyone watch everything freely. Thus, detecting deepfakes would play an important role toward protecting user privacy and maintaining social cohesion."" YouTube also had similar concerns about deepfakes. For example, during last year's Super Bowl Halftime Show anyone could put together any video clip using footage that was paired with music thanks to software like Adobe Audition CC. Unfortunately there wasn't really anything you could do about it because YouTube didn't want to censor the uploaders' work. With Deepfake Detect, you'll now know if your favorite YouTuber uploaded a deepfake before watching whatever his next masterpiece might be... Only trouble is, it won't alert viewers because of its algorithm, meaning we're likely to continue seeing bad creations on YouTube. How does Deepfake Detect actually detect deepfakes? During testing, X Lab's research found 50 of the images contained embedded text making the detection possible. To avoid taking too long to check every image, the bot used speed to quickly scan through files containing words such as ""blonde,"" ""beautiful"" and ""cute."" It then checks whether these embedded texts match known instances of what someone would look like after having plastic surgery. If they don't match, it'll flag the file as being fake. This way it can spot the difference between photoshopped images and actual ones within seconds rather than minutes. When it detects a suspected deepfake, the app keeps track of it because not doing so could seriously affect some parties in ""wrong hands,"" according to X Labs. This includes cases where deepfakes could lead to violence especially if automated weapons start firing based off of inaccurate information fed into algorithms. When requested by law enforcement agencies or media entities, the company said it'd take down the respective videos immediately. It doesn't appear that Deepfake Detect gives any extra detail on why it thinks a certain photo or video is fake though. This may explain why Deepfake Detect isn't giving away details on how it works since sharing this kind of knowledge makes it easier for others to build their own version of the program, although it seems unlikely that many will try considering how difficult it is to actually produce one.",0,738
"While there has been remarkable progress on object detection and re-identification in recent years, little attention has been focused on accomplishing the two tasks in a single network to improve overall efficiency. In this paper, we present such a framework that can achieve both these objectives with one unified architecture. All of our modules are end-to-end trainable by adopting a novel self-attention based convolutional module for feature map aggregation followed by an anchor box classifier which is trained from scratch within each mini batch to further enhance localization performance and prevent trivial solutions during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method over existing approaches, extensive experiments have been conducted on three challenging large scale datasets: COCO , Market1501 [zheng2015scalable] and DukeMTMC-reID . The experimental results show that even though our proposed model only outperforms other baseline models slightly on some benchmarks, it significantly reduces computation cost while maintaining high accuracy by half on all test sets compared to competing methods.' author: - Xinwei Li1, Xingyu Liu3,4[1], Mingshuo Zhang 2, Yao Wu 1, Ming Zhou 1 and Pengtao Xie 2,5 1.

Thank you very much and we look forward to speaking soon! 1 Technical Trivia Questions That Will Get Your Attention Technical analysis questions come up from time to time because many companies want an accurate picture of what candidates actually did professionally. For example, remember back in 2004, when Google released their first product? In order to ensure quality control over new features, Matt Cutts developed a simple set of algorithms which would identify any backlinks posted by ""spammers"" - sites trying to artificially increase traffic using manipulative methods such as writing misleading content. These links used text referring to another site within its body, along with HTML was hidden or removed. This method worked fairly well until spambots started creating fake websites. Is anyone still confused why I'm bringing this up now? Anyway... Anyway... So, when Google took things further in 2005, they created a system where sites could independently verify themselves when posting search results, including comments featured on blogs which were usually written by humans rather than spambot programs Why we love [site. The verification program consisted of two parts - one part called ""Authorized"" which simply checked whether the author's name matched that authorized on record and then signing off to say ""I verified this,"" and the other part called ""Verified Author."" A blog post detailing ""how to spot spammy bloggers"" caught my eye recently, and I found myself thinking to myself ""Wow, hasn't blogging changed since 2004?"" Which got me wondering, ""How different is today's web vs 2004 Web?"" So let's take a quick trip down memory lane and see exactly how drastically things have changed, shall we? In 2004, popular websites included Blogger, TypePad, LiveJournal, WordPress The top 50 blogs according to Technorati had fewer than 5 million unique visitors per month Today, G has 70 million users Twitter currently boasts 1 billion monthly active users Websites are increasingly being built using open source technologies such as Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla As far as individual posts go, however, there really wasn't anything special back then. A typical blogger wrote around 3 paragraphs every day sometimes adding images linked off somewhere else online, responding to people's comments, maybe Tweeting once a week, etc. Fast forward six years later, and in 2014, popular websites included Medium, Tumblr, Hootsuite, Pinterest Some had up to 100 million daily uniques Technologies used by individuals back then as opposed to those used by businesses greatly differ. Technology stacks often included PHP, ASP, ColdFusion, Ruby, Python, Perl, Java And finally, and probably most interestingly, platforms weren't even required to use plaintext anymore. Today, social media networks require large scale data storage systems to handle millions upon millions of photos, videos, tweets, likes, shares, profiles, notes, statuses, tags, et cetera - all without breaking a sweat. Nowadays, blogs aren't necessarily long form pieces either. Instead, they tend to jump around between headlines, bullet points, lists, pictures, short video clips and general commentary, often embedded into external feeds of live events. When looking at user generated content, popular networked services used by individuals back then tended towards microblogging and comment boards with Twitter leading the way followed closely by Facebook. Different technology stack usage becomes apparent after spending considerable amounts of time researching each of these services below, so I encourage you to check them out if you haven't already done so. My personal favorite website though oddly enough, went unnoticed entirely! It didn't involve any sort of technological advancement beyond basic markup languages, so all it needed was a respectable audience to build itself a community around. That website?

"This article discusses tips and tricks for using SSH more effectively. It covers how to add a second factor to your SSH login, use agent forwarding safely, exit from stuck sessions with CTRLD d, pass the -X flag when enabling X11 Forwarding on Linux systems, disable autologin functionality on servers that have it enabled, enable TIS authentication through an NSS plugin or LDAP, integrate PuTTY into Windows PowerShell for remote management of Azure Virtual Machines, create custom ssh-keys in IAM roles, work around SSH certificate warnings issued by Microsoft Remote Desktop Services 88.1 clients, automate important tasks such as creating new users via ansible scripts, and much more! The Internet is full of articles about how to secure SSH connections; however, most of them are either too big or not very user friendly. So today we will talk about some useful things you can do with your existing credentials, which might be a lot easier than changing all your passwords. Let's begin with three ways to set up two-factor authentication for your account: manual key based auth, Google Authenticator app, and Yubikey USB dongle, also known as FIDO2 standard protocol token[1]. Before You Begin... Before You Begin... Read at Your Own Risk Manual Key Based Two-Factor Authentication If you already own external hardware keys like USB tokens, then setting up another factor just takes minutes, no software required: find the location where these devices store their encrypted private data, copy its content over to .sshauthorizedkeys file of the server (s) you want to allow access to, and change authorizedkey permissions sdde::kerberos to 0600 if necessary so only root has access to this file anymore. That's all there is to it eventually somebody will break into your home computer, grab your laptop and open your.ssh folder - but at least they won't get any additional information beyond your SSH password (and maybe even none). This method doesn't come without risks though. If your personal laptop gets lost, stolen or worst case destroyeddamaged, someone could still gain access to your networked system simply because he got hold of your corresponding public SSH key pair stored somewhere else on your device. Another time consuming thing to remember here is removing old keys after adding new ones. Usually one deletes unneeded entries out of .sshdb files manually, which means having to search through lots of text for relevant lines. You may end up deleting critical entries accidentally unless you take note of what each entry contains before doing so. All those problems aside - since you're probably going to lose something anyway - why would anyone bother keeping their ""home computers"" physically close? Consider keeping that 10 smartphone instead[2]: Install an application capable of generating random numbers. There are plenty of apps out there made specifically for generating mobile credentials, including KeePass Android Mobile, Duo Security PIN generator, Authy app among many others that offer similar functions. However, nothing beats owning physical objects that generate unique identifiers that humans must memorize rather than write down, thus making them tamper resistant and harder to guess. And yes, even unlocking smartphones isn't 100 safe, since users sometimes forget their secret phrases. But hey, at least your iPhone is less likely to fall victim to theft compared to your home PC.

"Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO and former Alphabet executive chairman, has announced his decision to step down as a board member of Alphabet.

In an email sent today (1030), Schmidt said: ""I have agreed with Sundar that he would take over my role leading our work on smart cities and transportation while I remain personally involved at the company."" He continued, ""As part of this transition, we will appoint two new independent directors - one person from each side who can represent the interests of shareholders, employees and users equally. As they are both non-executive members, this is not intended to affect your governance structure or lead us toward greater political diversity within the Board.

Browser Based Apps Using React Native: There are plenty of reasons why people want to create apps for both desktop and mobile platforms. One trend has emerged where companies prefer developing a single code base across all these platforms instead of creating separate UI kits. If we look back into history, Facebook was one of the pioneers who came up with a new approach called react-native which offers a way to implement common patterns without having to rework entire systems. This helps lead apps towards seamless integration between multiple devices. Another important feature offered by react-native is how it works with third party libraries and plugins.

"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so it's possible I missed something), Solid uses blockchain technology to make data sharing securely and privately online easier for users while making developers more efficient at creating valuable data applications. In order to get a grasp on what this means we have to understand two things: how computers work now, and what blockchain does in general. If you are already familiar with either of these concepts then feel free to skip ahead to the next section where they will be used together. Otherwise, here goes... The Problems With The Current Internet Protocol Stack First let us examine some fundamental problems that arise from using the current TCPIP network stack today: TCPIP was not originally intended as the sole protocol to connect networks together, but rather just one part of a larger protocol suite - the OSI protocol stack. This meant that various sides could build their own 'variants' or add-ons to top off the base layer and create solutions tailored towards specific business needs such as security, performance, accounting etc. Today, however, almost all companies rely heavily upon standardized networking protocols which allow them to communicate cheaply over vast distances. These protocols often run under an operating system like Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS etc. Unfortunately, there is no standard way of combining multiple systems into a single cohesive unit so each company must choose between having its critical services hosted internally on proprietary hardware that may need upgrades every few years, and maintaining a multi-billion dollar public cloud infrastructure which continues to grow even after the growth in demand for connectivity slows down. Since most businesses don't want to maintain both, they end up outsourcing everything out to vendors who provide support contracts that come without warranties. Meanwhile, trying to figure out exactly why your servers crashed when running mysql database queries frequently ends in confusion and eventually leads to blaming other people, resources, and ultimately yourself because if you go back far enough someone else always said some stupid thing that caused it. Sure maybe it really did happen that way, perhaps another person screwed up big time, but nobody knows because nobody bothered recording any logs explaining the situation. So many random processes keep interfering with each others' functionality that troubleshooting becomes near impossible unless the problem only affects a small portion of customers 5 of whom would bother reporting anything anyway. Even still, knowing whether the issue occurred locally vs globally has become muddled since everyone keeps monitoring all kinds of strange metrics on all different types of devices scattered across any given region. And lastly, you can pretty much look forward to seeing a bunch of announcements about vulnerabilities being found because the primary purpose of developing software seems less 'to make our lives better' than keeping more money flowing in to tech giants' shareholders pockets. And yet somehow the number of packets flying through the air continue increasing daily. Perhaps partially due to the fact that the internet is growing at 7x the rate of global population and 3 times faster than world GDP, according to W3Techs. Whatever the reason is, bandwidth usage hasn't slowed down despite the fact that the amount of people surfing Reddit everyday has decreased dramatically in recent years. How can that possibly be? Why doesn't the whole earth stop working?! Well, partly it isn't actually happening right away; instead the congestion happens gradually and builds until a point is reached when switching speeds decrease significantly and packets start getting dropped. At the same time traffic increases exponentially until denial of service attacks begin proliferating and causing massive disruptions throughout large swaths of the internet. It takes nonstop consistent effort from technical teams around the globe to successfully mitigate these issues before soon thereafter there will again seem to be an increase in overall availability as well as higher search rankings. But recreating the entire architecture of the internet once more seems nearly impossible. Neither nation states nor private corporations appear interested in doing so and many powerful players within existing organizations are betting against the possibility entirely. Therefore, whatever plan is put forth likely won't solve the modern day problems of the internet quickly or inexpensively, but should hopefully provide sufficient impetus to force relevant parties to devise a solution themselves. For example, if a group of cybersecurity experts were able to efficiently establish trust among several independent nations then the resulting agreement might result in a great deal more cooperation around information exchange than what exists currently. In fact, billions of dollars are spent annually just ensuring that certain countries know what the other side is planning to do so they can prevent surprises. However, the military industrial complex renders those efforts useless considering that none of the main actors involved wish to give up control. Thus, with governments and corporate power structures largely unwilling to share sovereignty with anyone at least on this scale, one begins to wonder where trust comes from going forward. Maybe it comes from proven track records, maybe it comes from setting precedents. Either way, it sounds completely untenable to me that human civilization will ever evolve beyond the standards set in place and flat rate above the following potential effects cancel to second chance first double no matter the einuprite (tone) equate to evaluate test anything into to",0,757

"The FCC has approved Amazon's application for 3,236 low-Earth orbit satellites for its Project Kuiper broadband service. Project Kuiper aims to deliver high-speed, low-latency broadband to areas without good internet access. Amazon is currently the only company licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch thousands of small communications satellites into space through a new industry called ""constellation"" that will provide Internet connectivity services in an attempt to take on ATT and Verizon as well as foreign companies like OneWeb and SpaceX. The earmarked funding from Congress required approval from all three parties as to whether or not they would be allowed to compete with the US government in this upcoming sector. This was accomplished after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced his decision Tuesday morning at a press conference held during the 2018 Open Data Conference. ""In my view, we're getting closer but there are still miles to go,"" said former FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker who also served under President Obama. She expressed concern over how satellite technology could impact Earth's ionosphere - the layer where radio waves travel directly between earth and the atmosphere. Other panels were concerned about potential health impacts such as cell phone radiation and interference with GPS devices. These stations have been known to cause problems for aircrafts and submarines when their signals aren't properly shielded as they approach them. But overall, panelists seemed excited with what these satellites can do: give rural communities better options than just dialing up before it's too late. With more connections comes less reliance on landline phones and increased use of smartphones and tablets which means more data usage and speedier service if used correctly. As part of Project Kuiper Amazon hopes to combine terrestrial wireless networks with low-orbit satellites so users don't need to line up campsites every time they want to get online because their homes may not even be close enough to existing towers for reliable download speeds. To achieve this efficiency, each customer needs one object per beam instead of individual ground antennas per user since some customers won't require all of those beams. For example, one TV antenna can transmit 120 channels while two 30cm dish antennae combined can send 24 HDTV. It should be noted that both dishes must point in opposite directions toward different parts of the sky in order for reception to occur. And according to current estimates around 2 million people live in regions granted coverage by AWS's constellation and that number might double within five years given the planned expansion. TechCrunch reached out to Amazon to ask when those numbers will switch from projection to reality but did receive confirmation that a lot of work remains to finish construction upon commercial deployment. This includes finalizing designs, testing all equipment, building hundreds of support facilities and completing many other tasks necessary to make sure the system works perfectly. Barriers to Entry Project Kuiper faces competition in the form of Google Access offering Internet to specific locations in India using balloons while Facebook recently launched Aquila drones capable of transmitting 4G LTE via solar power to areas that lack consistent cloud cover. Both of these projects offer global coverage across continents and larger amounts of bandwidth. However, neither project approaches the scale of Project Kuiper. As stated previously, Amazon plans to use 3,236 satellites covering roughly 70 of the world population by 2020. Although Google Access uses solar powered kite balloons flying below 100km altitude similar to Project Loon while Aquila flies at an average height of 300 km. SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launches private payloads already costs 60M compared to the estimated cost of Amazon's broadband satellites at 1B. A few factors contribute to why smaller players find themselves unable to sufficiently compete against large corporations whose sole purpose seems to be profit making no matter the price paid for said profits. The first reason involves the level of capital needed to build something like a spacecraft and then construct various operational components including the hardware itself, software development teams, control systems, the ability to purchase helium gas from countries besides the United States, etc. Each component worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A second factor is paying your employees working fulltime salaries to develop prototypes and imagine entire platforms in midflight to ensure nothing goes wrong. These factors alone add up quickly once you start increasing launches per year. A third challenge facing smaller competitors is establishing an infrastructure network to handle daily operations. If this isn't done right, everything else falls apart leading to delayed schedules and questionable results. Very little research or experimentation occurs unless someone wants to lose money due to lackluster efforts and unproven ideas. Given these obstacles certain aspects become prohibitively expensive. For instance, hiring additional engineers and technicians wouldn't come cheap especially when trying to increase the amount of missions being performed. Another issue deals with having adequate resources available to train personnel in areas like aeronautics engineering. Since most of this training takes place overseas rather than in the US, higher wages become costly especially considering filing taxes back home requires compliance with strict regulations set forth.

"A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning strikes across half of Europe and even outside the continent's borders. The new analysis shows how complex the events are that lead to lightning slamming into a person or an aircraft or crashing through a roof (below). Lightning can strike anywhere on Earth at any time of year. It is usually triggered by convection, when air cools down rapidly underground after rainfall has occurred.[1] Rainwater evaporates into clouds where it releases heat that causes evaporation from surrounding water drops and forms rising warm layers within the cloud called ""tower-cloud systems."" Cooler rain falling back down mixes with this warmer layer causing local cooling. This creates updrafts that lift cold dense air up above the cloud base. Heat rises but cooler higher levels force heated air downwards creating downdrafts. These two forces compete for control over airflow, eventually resulting in strong vertical winds forming what looks like waves inside the cloud. At these wave fronts thunderstorms are born. Thunderstorms produce very large amounts of electrical energy that they use to discharge into our atmosphere as bolts of lightening. An average thunderstorm produces about 10 billion kilowatts of power, compared to 1 billion watts produced by most nuclear reactors worldwide and between 5 million and 20 million times stronger than human sources such as wind turbines[2]. A typical thunderstorm will have several thousand flashes per second and each one may be around 100 kilometers long (or 60 miles), 3 meters wide and tens of thousands volts high [3]. Although many small storms are more common than gigantic ones, there have been documented cases when thousands of people witnessed massive storms on a single day [45]. While some of them seem so violent they could tear apart mountains, others are barely noticeable or not seen at all until moments before impact[6]. Even then we often do not know exactly why someone was struck because less severe lightning injuries occur every minute. In fact, according to reports from Australia alone there were already 219 fatal lightning incidents reported last year, while over 90 percent of those injured survive their accident because paramedics arrive quickly and medical teams equip themselves accordingly[7]. However, no matter how hard you try to prepare yourself against impending death, chances are your body won't necessarily protect itself - it's simply too late. If lightning strikes somewhere other than indoors, it might still kill if it hits key parts of your heart muscle or brain stem. But since it occurs relatively rarely, you should expect to die mostly due to accidental injury - either accidentally injuring yourself first or dying from blood loss as soon as possible following your attack. According to a study published online today in Nature Communications, scientists now believe that some of the deadliest storms on record actually never happened: the original stories told by eyewitnesses describing monstrous bolts of lighting hitting buildings suddenly disappeared from popular media outlets shortly afterward. For example, reports dating back dozens of years of major tornadoes striking Kansas and Oklahoma did not mention anything else besides damage caused by strong straight lines of wind gusts. When researchers studied old newspaper articles, however, much closer examination revealed numerous instances of witnesses claiming to see huge thunderbolts flash around entire cities at once. Researchers analyzed data from weather stations across North America and found similar patterns of simultaneous widespread thunderstorms erupting roughly every month of 2014 and 2015. Several months later, newspapers republished the previous accounts of giant twisters ripping walls off houses and flipping cars without mentioning the additional witnesses who had mysteriously vanished. Some websites quietly changed headlines or deleted news items altogether after being contacted by journalists seeking comment. The identities of hundreds of witnesses were shared anonymously among volunteers via social networks, historical records and archives. Reporters canvassed interviews with civil defense officials and meteorologists who offered evidence weighing in favor of the claims, including eye witness accounts of monsters shaped like comets and airplanes flying through the sky before colliding with buildings. Meteorologist John Braunmiller said he believes the pattern did happen given his experience studying atmospheric conditions throughout history. He says there have always been extreme examples of violent thunderstorms recorded, though not linked directly to a tornado. They include huge hailstones, hail stones larger than golf balls; lightnings that send shockwaves traveling deeper than 30 km (20 mi) below ground level; and dark shapes moving near the surface of lakes. 'It seems probable based upon my research that something close to what I'm talking about exists,' Braunmiller said. Another researcher agreed that the phenomenon could possibly exist, although she thinks its existence hasn't yet fully been proven scientifically. Researcher Karen Raymo, director of MIT's Center for Climatological Statistics, adds that the idea of supernatural phenomena happening simultaneously across multiple regions is certainly plausible considering modern science doesn't explain everything yet.'I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to find out someday that planets behave differently than we thought, Raymo tells Live Science.

"Facebook recently launched a new virtual reality remote work app where users can hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves. Workrooms is an early step by Facebook towards building the company's first VR social network and it has been dubbed 'the most ambitious project I have come across in decades of working with startups"" - Mathew Ingram As more companies embrace virtual reality, we will see larger shifts in physical office layouts for employees to make use of these breakthrough technologies. So while many offices are moving towards smaller footprints and fewer desks there is still a need to provide sufficient space to accommodate team members who prefer more casual workspace environments. So when looking at developing a successful workplace environment that supports all types needs, what should organizations consider? How do you balance privacy expectations and productivity demands? What does this look like on a practical level? Virtual Reality Workspaces: A Different Kind Of Office Space For those who don't know much about VR technology yet, Virtual Reality (VR) refers to immersive experiences created using computer-generated graphics which simulate real life scenarios or events. This includes visualizing people into locations they might be interested to visit such as walking through London's underground subway system, playing golf or even entering a war zone. VR also allows one user to create their own personal experience within another person's headspace; creating the illusion that heshe is actually present ""in"" someone else's body inside your home. These headsets go beyond just entertainment so they are able to track head movements allowing them to sense exactly where you're looking. Now picture yourself sitting comfortably on our new sofa watching Netflix... Does anything unappealing stand out right away? That's because its unlikely something would stick out but rather you'd get used to seeing things from a different perspective. The same applies here - You could be viewing a meeting room table top with colleagues surrounding you. However 10 seconds later if somebody walks past then the entire perception changes due to the difference in scale between each other. Interacting with others next door becomes difficult without getting up off the couch. But imagine being able to sit down and effortlessly move around wherever you want without any restriction. Well that sounds pretty amazing doesn't it! After all why not just take everyone back to school days instead of having to learn how to adapt to each other's individual styles? It makes perfect sense. In fact this type of communication scenario was envisioned years ago by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry who designed and built his own prototype headset called Maelstrom. He shared an image of himself wearing the headset during a presentation saying 'this is my private place'. To quote him: ""This kind of tool may change the way children interact with toys."" Could the future of business finally arrive?! Although currently very expensive and impractical for businesses, over time it is expected that prices will drop making it viable for end consumers. Interest in the tech continues to grow year after year. It seems rather obvious that the majority of us already feel comfortable interacting with computers via touch screen devices thanks to smartphone usage. And according to recent research three quarters of Americans say they expect smartphones and tablets to become commonplace personal items within five years! Over 90 predicted they would purchase a wearable device within five years too! If this trend persists then it is likely we'll soon find ourselves immersed into our daily lives whilst performing complex tasks on our smartwatches, watches, glasses etc. It wouldn't surprise me if customers start demanding future products services simply assume their current habits now apply to VR. At least we won't have to carry bulky laptops anymore nor worry about charging batteries every few hours. All aspects of our lives will soon live online replacing traditional desktops and meeting rooms. Imagine instantly searching the web via voice commands while browsing Amazon or shopping online. Add augmented reality features to your everyday objects including furniture, cars, homes etc and you've got almost limitless possibilities. As far as workplaces go, teams will spend less time commuting than ever before and they can communicate virtually anywhere globally instantaneously. Sounds great no!? Except for the inconvenient truth of existing infrastructure requiring significant investment. There's only two ways forward: Either build everything again from scratch OR utilise facilities we already own and leverage existing information systems (i.e., data, software programs, apps). Large corporations often choose to upgrade legacy IT systems so they can enjoy greater efficiency and cost savings anytime needed. For small businesses however.. starting anew means a long process filled with budget overrun risks and headaches. Personally speaking.. I highly doubt I'll be doing in VR any day sooner. To put myself in someone else's shoes... how would I realistically view the whole experience? Where would I fit best? Would it be enjoyable or aggravating? Is it worth spending money buying a new pair of headphones for? Should workers request permission upfront to perform certain activities actions? Simply put.. its all a bit much right now isn't it? Which leaves us wondering whether virtual reality workspaces will truly represent the ideal situation. Will there exist challenging conversations which require face-to-face interaction? Or will this limit add factors still remain unfortunet predictors of failure. Will become scrapr planners' approval ratings dismal aspirations: Partly retained, forever 2nd",0,761
"Crime-tracking app Citizen is launching its own emergency response service for 19.99 per month. Citizen Protect will give users access to Protect Agents through video, audio, or text. The agent's role in the process should be pretty straightforward: they'll have ""a brief conversation with you and then take action on your behalf."" Emergency services will differ depending upon where a user lives - if it's within an area that receives regular police coverage, agents from that department will get involved (and their details can also sync up with local databases of wanted criminals). Otherwise, it sounds like Citizens' network of people could help track down missing or stolen items too.

"Nvidia's Perlmutter supercomputer is the fastest in the world for AI workloads. Its first task will be to build a 3D map of the universe. The map will help scientists understand why we are here, and how our existence was brought about by an explosion that occurred billions of years ago. In 2005, Nvidia co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computers would become 10 times faster every two years (witness: your smartphone), but his estimate has been off on both ends. In 2017, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he expected computing performance to double three times over the next several years; it reached that milestone last year. These projections address just one part of what makes artificial intelligence so difficult - the sheer size of data sets needed to make sense of them all. And while there have been recent breakthroughs in big data storage technologies such as genomics and neuromorphic chips, spinning up a new petabyte-scale supercomputer each day still requires significant effort. That's where Aperio comes into play. By employing advanced deep learning techniques from AI research, this GPU-based system can quickly learn which images correspond with labels, or other information, across tens of thousands of pictures. The device isn't quite ready for primetime yet though. While its creators say they're working closely with researchers at Stanford University, I'm not sure what kind of researcher really needs access to 1 trillion frames per second from their computer screen.

"Oracle is buying electronic healthcare records company Cerner in a deal valued at 28.3 billion. It is the biggest deal in Oracle's long history of acquiring companies. The deal allows Oracle to expand its enterprise software and services business beyond databases, cloud computing and middleware into an area that includes patient data management systems (PDMS). Cerner has been struggling with declining sales for years as hospitals switch from paper-based medical charts to computerized ones on PDMSs, which are much more expensive than traditional charting systems. For instance, UPMC Health System was spending about 100 million per year to keep track of what drugs patients were taking in hospital pharmacies, but now it spends just over half that amount because the system automates the process and saves time as well as money. ""If you think about this intersection between analytics and big data and IT, there will be something very important happening,"" said Doug Laney, an analyst with Gartner who covers the health care space. ""When we talk about the series of acquisitions that Oracle announced last week - I would argue they're all highly complementary technologies."" The aim seems clear: To provide healthcare enterprises such as hospitals and large insurers with everything they need to manage their operations around data including one of the most sensitive kinds of information imaginable. This is also the first major acquisition by Oracle since CEO Larry Ellison took charge after he bought Sun Microsystems a decade ago, and several observers say his previous experience running businesses could make him a better fit for managing a sprawling tech giant like Oracle. Analysts have also noted how similar some of the technology he acquired during his tenure at Sun was to Oracle products already available or under development today. Ellison's record prior to becoming CEO suggests he should take a hands-on approach when making purchase decisions, says Michael Covington, vice president of research at industry market intelligence firm Strategic Vision LLC based in San Mateo, Calif., who specializes in identity theft protection. ""My expectation is that Oracle's going to prioritize growth opportunities and use those resources effectively,"" Covington told Computerworld via email. He pointed out how Oracle's first senior executive appointments included two of his former colleagues, Dennis Crowley, head of mobile applications; and Mark Hurd whose responsibilities include developer tools. He may even want to emulate IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr.'s decision to plug someone else in during the late 1990's instead of waiting until later in life to become chairman himself. After retiring at age 54, he handed control of General Electric Co. over to Jack Welch before starting work again some 10 years later. Laney agrees that Oracle's new leader might not wait too long to give up day jobs. ""I don't see them delaying things trying to figure things out, especially if the strategy makes sense,"" he added.",0,766
"Blue Origin launched the fourteenth test flight of its New Shepard rocket booster and capsule on January 14. There were no passengers on board, but the capsule can carry up to 7 people, which is a lot more than many other vehicles in this relatively young sub-orbital spaceflight industry. The company's presidentCEO Bob Smith said that the next two flights will be targeted at flying humans around Earth as early as 2018 with trips lasting about thirty minutes each way - during daylight hours only. ""It's going to take some time,"" he told Ars back when we talked to him for our Orbital Tour feature several months ago. But even if it doesn't happen right away, there are still lessons to learn from those first few tests. The second trip was much harder and lasted slightly longer (about 20 minutes). And the third test was very easy: just enough thrust to get off the launchpad... then coasting through the air until landing. Here's what you need to know to understand these results so far. Getting into orbit without burning fuel This is the key objective that all of today's human orbital missions share in common. It seems like such an obvious goal, why hasn't anyone figured out how to do it yet? Well, because it takes a bit of engineering work to make sure your spaceship gets where it needs to go while using minimal energy or fuel along the way. Even though most rockets burn their engines throughout their entire journey to orbit, engineers have discovered ways to reduce the amount of power necessary by making everything smart enough to fly itself instead of relying on human pilots for every aspect of operations. At Boca Chica Beach Spaceport south of Brownsville, Texas they tested a new system called SuperDraco thrusters over autumn 2016. These small engines fire jets of hydrogen gas directly onto themselves after ignition inside the engine chamber. According to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, ""Shooting liquid oxygen [fuel] straight down has been the single biggest problem with liquid propellant oxidizers"" prior to this development. This reduced volume of the fuel significantly increases efficiency. As a result, not nearly as much of the fuel goes unused and is wasted compared to earlier systems. A similar approach could also extend lifespan between refuelings of larger capsules carrying multiple satellites. For example, here's a video showing Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket blasting off for its fifth mission last month, reaching orbit twice. You'll see one brief burst of flame before the main vehicle starts powering upwards toward space. Engineers say that peak combustion happens quickly in seconds followed by droplets of exhaust plumes streaming behind the ship. By holding steady throttle settings once the initial thrust phase ends, the propulsion system continues to push the enormous rocket forward under almost constant acceleration. Then, once the vessel reaches cruising altitude height above sea level here - the rockets shut off completely allowing the craft to glide smoothly back to earth. After landing, the same thruster hardware ignites again briefly pushing the spacecraft downward to catch any remaining speed needed on the return leg home. The bottom line is that modern disposable rockets don't waste fuel by heating things up or cooling them down; rather, they optimize different aspects of lift versus weight gain. They use lots of chemical reactions that produce tiny amounts of heat barely noticeable within the environment. So little actual friction occurs in modern reusable launchers that launches often feel effortless. Unlike traditional designs that rely upon powerful internal fans for pressure support combined with the inability to control airflow due to the presence of struts and braces that connect supports together, SpaceX took a unique solution known as Raptor design. The 12 Raptors being developed will eventually provide 62 percent of the force of gravity on takeoff, according to Elon Musk. The final shape resembles something akin to arms holding open giant wings - able to expand outward to increase stability and hold cargo near the center point. In contrast, standard Falcon 9 boosters create lift with large solid structures both above and below. Draggy fins lower towards the ground in order to gain extra pressure at low altitudes, helping keep the thing airborne and stable. We've seen a number of examples of high tech reentry systems too. For instance, Japanese researchers recently landed a 3D printed carbon fiber sphere designed to be dropped free-falling during a supersonic dive that would normally tear apart anything else on contact. At speeds approaching Mach 9 9 meter per second) the object survived atmospheric entry and safely curved around the planet to come to rest. Another study demonstrated that a specially shaped parafoil sail with aerodynamic characteristics that enhanced drag became less effective at higher velocities thanks to the small size of the payload. That means engineers must fine tune the dimensions of the device depending upon what types of experiments will be performed. Reusable ships and landers also allow scientists to revisit locations repeatedly since costs associated with material expenses decrease dramatically. Hence, they're finding places previously inaccessible and opening doors into worlds only imagined before.

"South Korea will soon see a drop in their military personnel due to a decline in birth rate and recent laws that make it easier to avoid mandatory national service. The government might also implement additional measures such as increasing the length of compulsory service for poor soldiers who are less productive in combat or raising pay rates, local media reported on Friday. The number of South Korean civilians was 2.41 million at end-2013 and is expected to decrease by 1 percent annually until 2015. A total of 921,000 people born between 1995 and 2000 are eligible for conscription but so far only about 250,000 have taken up voluntary positions. Conscientious objectors can choose either civilian work (non-military) or alternative services including agriculture, medicine, education, etc., for which they receive full salaries and benefits. Those who refuse to serve under any circumstances, however, must complete two years of minimal labor duty during which time they do not receive money and cannot quit unless granted a special exemption. After this period has expired, conscientious objectors must join either active or reserve forces if they wish to continue working. In 2013, 18,719 men and women opted out of the army, second most among all countries surveyed.

"A team of researchers has found a new mineral about 900 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Davemaoite is made of calcium, silicon, and oxygen.

They believe these are signs that extraterrestrial material was incorporated into the planetesimal when its parent body crashed into another object millions or billions of years ago. It could help explain why some asteroids host water ice on their surfaces.

If you're interested in how all these pieces fit together, take a look at which explains everything. It might seem complex but there's really nothing too complicated going on under the hood - especially once you've got used to the tooling. Here's what actions looks like inside GitHub itself though: How to create custom triggers - Source Code The cool thing about GitHub Actions is that you can add your own trigger logic by creating your own action. With quite simple commands, you can start making your custom workflow action right now. The command starts off simply enough and is pretty self explanatory. Here I'm building a shell script called deploy that I'd like to execute after my PR has merged into master: "" ' bash cat EOF deploy.sh echo EOF "" ' After running 'bash deploy.sh', this becomes available through GitHub web hooks, which allow me to write some sort of external process whenever something happens to my repository. In this case, I can tell GitHub Action to listen whenever someone pushes changes, so I can automate tasks associated with the release of those changes. To accomplish this, I need GIT events (the core piece of data provided along side Git commits) and Web Hooks. These two concepts play nice together because it means GitHub knows exactly when the change was made (commit timestamp), and when notifications should occur. When you send information about a commit to GitHub via Web Hooks, it gets sent out to various services including GitHub Actions. From there, GitHub takes care of executing whatever needs to happen. If I wanted to make use of this particular feature, I would select Custom Events as the type and choose Github as the service where I might live stream the content.

"A good friend of mine recently started an ecommerce business called Drunk Shrub, it sells shrub, a tangy syrup that you can mix with alcoholic beverages or carbonated water to make your own version of the 'Tropical Fruit Sodas' sold in every drinks shop. He asked me for advice on how he could start building his brand and grow his following so I sent him some blog posts detailing what my take was on choosing a domain name, ranking pages that are important, setting up email lists etc... and this is exactly the same as any other blogger would do when giving advice about their niche - but there's one thing missing from these blogs: they don't tell you where to buy the products they mention! So here we go, let me explain why they should be included... Why Do You Need To Buy The Products? This might seem obvious but its really not, because even if you build great content around selling something all by yourself (as most bloggers do) someone out there has already done the legwork for you by creating the product you want to sell. So now instead of doing everything from scratch like your favorite entrepreneur does, you just have to find them and order it. And as soon as you get it shipped to you, you will finally know whether what you wrote had value before anyone else did:) There are many ways to achieve this, but the easiest way nowdays is to use Amazon FBA. What is FBA? It allows sellers to send merchandise direct to amazon complete with payment, then once you receive the package in your house, simply ship it back to amazon fulfilling your sales orders. From there, right inside amazon, you can list each item you received along with photos, descriptions and reviews that match your categories. Amazon FBA is probably more expensive than normal wholesale retailers, which isn't always the case for larger brands, but since price doesn't matter anymore, investing money into getting higher visibility shouldn't affect your profit too much. A big advantage of using FBA is that wholesalers won't keep any inventory and therefore won't need to pay storage fees which vary per country. This means that shipping costs are fixed across the board. For example, when i first moved to Germany, prices were 3-4x cheaper compared to UK US based suppliers. These differences continue to increase over time allowing small businesses to compete globally without having to spend thousands of dollars on international shipping. Another benefit is being able to qualify customer service requests through amazon directly rather than relying solely on local support teams. This eliminates unnecessary calls and emails going to and fro while waiting days for responses. Here at One Hundred Dollars Per Month I always recommend people to look at existing listings and contact sellers who rank well for keywords related to their products, however if this option is only available for certain countriesregions, feel free to check alternatives. Let's say you live in France, what you will likely see is plenty of French speaking marketplaces such as eBay, AliExpress and Alibaba. While quality varies greatly across them all, overall you can expect better deals and faster delivery times compared to North America or Europe. If you still prefer to stick to North American platforms though, BlueSnap provides meticulous search filters so finding sellers becomes easier than ever. Also note that on top of bargains and fast deliveries you'll also enjoy dedicated seller support staff answering questions and providing general feedback for buyers. The Best Way Of Buying On Amazon Is Through Etsy It starts off looking very promising as a marketplace for handmade goods, yet somehow ends up becoming another huge headache after months of work trying to manage multiple accounts (one account one warehouse). In December 2017, Etsy announced they would no longer allow new accounts associated with paid advertising services, meaning sites like Shopify, Wix, Weebly and WordPress plugins wouldn't work either. That left two options: manually create individual accounts or stick with self-hosted solutions like WooCommerce. Since projects like CSSBubs became popular, creating multi-store websites didn't require nearly as much effort than creating single store websites, this choice led to etsy caving in quickly and starting offering reasonable tools and billing plans for shops with monthly revenues exceeding 500k annually. That said, due to hefty setup charges (starting fee monthly subscription), high minimum transaction volume requirement (200K yearly) plus long lead times when applying for permits, Etsy is mostly suitable for big brands willing to foot almost half of their budget in startup fees alone. But if you have less cash lying around, try Stitch Fix. They provide simple web interfaces enabling users to set up presets for what items they wish to feature within specific categories and automatically generate promotional codes for customers. When designing your template, be sure to include large images so as to maximize exposure on social media channels and incorporate video tutorials explaining key features alongside clear instructions on buying.

"A technically advanced indoor vertical farm is growing a range of crops inside the basement of a former sugar factor in Liverpool. Farm Urban was founded in 2014, growing salads and herbs using sunlight but also artificial lighting to extend their harvest throughout winter. With increasing demand for fresh vegetables during Britain's ""hungry gap"" - when consumers are willing to pay more than they have historically been prepared to do so - this type of farming has become increasingly important since around 2010. But it requires something unusual: large amounts of artificial light that cannot be provided by natural daylight or solar panels. The team at Farm Urban have created an alternative solution with LEDs mounted on poles along one wall, reaching up through holes cut into concrete slabs in order to provide enough illumination while keeping the plants safe from potential fire risks as well as electronic interference. And it works... for now. City farms like Farm Urban are part of what urban agriculture advocates call regenerative food systems which aim to create sustainable sources of local produce within cities. In other words, rather than producing greens somewhere far away and shipping them in by boat, trucks or planes, city farmers try to ensure there is no distance between where their fruit and veg comes from and where it ends up. This makes sense because we know that most trips made by UK residents go further than necessary (thereby contributing to climate change), and travelling thousands of miles can help seeds lose much of their vigour if transported long distances and exposed to air-conditioned conditions such as those found in aircraft cabins. It also helps protect local produce against pests and diseases, often diminishing crop losses caused by incidents such as extreme weather events. Using greenhouses in the vicinity of users creates cohabitation among different producers who use shared tools and facilities, improving efficiency and quality control. Finally, the constant presence of people living close to fields (as opposed to those far away) acts not only as carers, gatherers and watchers but also helps maintain production levels when yields decline due to adverse environmental factors, such as drought or high temperatures. In recent years, several projects have begun to make real progress towards creating these kinds of food networks in major British cities including London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh. These initiatives share some common characteristics such as significant investment in innovation, strong educational programmes aimed at encouraging prospective growers and selling new technologies both locally and internationally. Although all regenerate food systems face challenges ranging from securing funding for project development and sustainability issues, they offer exciting possibilities for future growth and social inclusion in our towns, suburbs and villages. Urban gardens in Bristol were first planted back in 2008 as part of the Greening Cities programme funded under the European Union's Cohesion Policy funds, designed to create employment opportunities in poor areas. Since then, over 1300 plots have grown fruits, veggies, nuts and mushrooms across the city, bringing together communities, schools, charities and businesses working together. One example includes Kaffeeklatsch City Farms, based in Tower Hamlets. Started in 2013 and run alongside an arts centre providing education about how to grow your own food, its mission is simple: 'to give young people the skills, knowledge and confidence needed to take full responsibility for gaining access to healthier foods and supporting a thriving local food economy.' The idea behind regenerative food systems isn't just limited to fixed spaces, however. With mobile apps like Growly allowing anyone in any space to see exactly what is being produced around them, we're seeing more activity indoors and outside too. As well as housing underground vegetable patches, Stockholm University researchers recently developed a design for a modular mini greenhouse called MobiGarden that could easily fit onto balconies or patios without needing specialised equipment. Innovators include Tania van Dijkhuizen, founder of London-based Vanishing Point, who aims to combine two seemingly disparate practices, urban gardening and filmmaking, resulting in MistyBoxes. Based on her experience making documentaries for BBC, she learned that many places struggle to get consistent film shoots despite trying very hard. So she set out to find ways to encourage filmmakers to leave the comfort zones of camera crews, sound recordists and catering staff and instead interact directly with everyday citizens living amongst interesting landscapes. She started doing so herself, filming friends and strangers on rooftops, trains, council estates and even beneath a treehouse off the coast of Kent. Her videos explore questions related to community identity and belonging - showing us why we live here and just how beautiful our neighbourhoods really are. Because show me the garden you've got But although mediating community relationships might seem like a worthy cause in itself, another key benefit identified by van Dijkhuisen stems from her work in documentary photography, namely how good images make audiences think differently about place. When we look at photos of a neighbourhood taken by someone standing alone above the street, we assume that person must belong there. Similarly when clips of diverse groups of children playing football in parks are broadcast on TV after dark, viewers may feel entirely separate uses ... but the best way to evaluate either test much as left Whether you Not done testing my business value (in",0,775
"Insulin is essential for a diabetic, and it can be expensive, especially for those without good insurance. A growing movement of biohackers is trying to build a distributed system of insulin that could decentralize production in the wake of recent outbreaks like Ebola or Zika virus. In 2016 there were over 30 million people living with diabetes worldwide, according to estimates from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). That means 1 out every 9 adults has type 2 diabetes - an epidemic. This year WHO reported that up to 5 more cases have occurred than expected due to effects of climate change on weather-related events such as floods and droughts. While traditional drugs are effective at controlling symptoms when blood sugar levels rise too high, they cannot regulate glucose effectively enough during periods of low demand, such as overnight sleep. Scientists think these conditions will make treatment even harder in coming years because many patients' bodies begin producing less insulin after long stretches of time spent asleep. Insulin helps regulate how much energy your body uses by controlling what makes its way into cells through tiny holes. Without it, you develop dangerously elevated blood sugars resulting in health problems ranging from blurry vision to heart disease. The complications associated with diabetes cause almost 10 percent of deaths globally every year unless treated properly. As of 2013 some 3.8 million U.S. diabetics died annually, accounting for about 5 percent of all US adult mortality. Treating this condition requires lifetime monitoring: People need constant vigilance so their doctors know if anything changes. And while getting better care may help control costs, the financial burden isn't just restricted to healthcare providers. In 2015 Americans paid 327 billion for diabetes medications alone, which include insulins used to treat type I and II diabetes. For someone who doesn't qualify for public assistance or Medicare benefits, buying medication can be extremely costly; average annual retail prices range between 2,000-4,500 per dose. It's not uncommon for private plans to charge upwards of 50 cents to 99 cents per unit sold. Even taking one pill a day cost a whopping 86 each week, not including potential co-pays, deductibles, premiums, and other fees. Insurance companies add more ingredients to deal with adverse drug reactions, increasing consumers' expenses further, adding an additional burden to them. ""If we keep running along our current path with no new approaches, then everyone should expect rising rates of obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, blindness, amputations, stroke, [and] depression,"" says Dr. Sergey Braginsky, director of Nourish Biotechnology Laboratory and professor in engineering science at University of California San Diego. To address the problem of limited supply, he sees alternative solutions emerging in the form of DIY kits containing everything needed to produce insulin for a person's needs. Could this mean the end of modern medicine? Not exactly. While bans against recombinant DNA technology remain in place in several countries, DIY devices require only nonrecombinant biotechnologies that use techniques found in nature. Still, you don't want to take risks. ""There are still quite a few small molecules being produced using chemical synthesis and chemo-enzymatic methods, but most of them are immunogenic and unstable, tending toward degradation in vivo, making them unsuitable for development as therapeutics. In addition, most synthetic routes rely on toxic reagents such as cyanide salts that must be removed by purification steps before administration to humans,"" writes Peter Juhlig in his book 'Challenges to Modern Medicine: Advances in Innovative Pathways Toward a Future where We Can All Live Well Now - A Brave New World Alternative Viewpoint' (PowerHouse Books) in reference to injectable insulins based upon human cell cultures grown within laboratory flasks called bioreactors. If homemade alternatives can deliver quality results comparable to mass-produced products, why not try modifying existing recipes and manufacturing processes to cut down on overall costs and increase availability? Some companies, such as LifeScan Inc., already sell home test strips for carbohydrate counting and testing. These inexpensive strips detect ketones (a metabolic product), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and cholesterol profiles in whole blood samples. At present, however, users must buy individual strips individually and flip open microchips to interpret readings. They also require separate lancets for finger pricks similar to the ones used in hospitals. Some analysts see DIY systems replacing branded home tests altogether, eventually leading to self-monitoring through smartphones, connected sensors with remote data analysis capabilities, implantable biosensors, and wearable computers. For example, the most advanced commercial device available today is Glucose Buddy from Theranos, which claims accuracy of 98. But critics raise concerns over issues relating to false positives and negatives, inaccuracies among different model numbers across multiple brands, and poor usability and convenience, although these devices do fill medical requirements for managing chronic illness.
