"This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, headed by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, gives hope. Thousands of Rohingya were forced to flee their homes during a military crackdown in Burma's Rakhine state in October 2016. During the crackdown, the army reportedly committed unlawful killings, rape and torture. The security forces have forcibly evicted Rohingya from their homes, carried out extrajudicial killings, enforced arbitrary restrictions on freedom of movement and committed rape and other sexual violence against women and girls. The authorities have also obstructed humanitarian aid to reach the Rohingya. The government has systematically denied Rohingya access to citizenship and restricted their freedom of movement, effectively rendering them stateless. What happened in October 2016? During a security crackdown in northern Rakhine state in response to an attack on border guards, the military burned down whole villages and shot and killed people at random. The military has admitted to killing people in this crackdown, but blamed Rohingya ""terrorists"" for starting the violence and accused them of burning their own homes. Numerous survivors and eyewitnesses interviewed by Amnesty International, as well as satellite images, contradict this version of events. The military has killed and raped Rohingya and destroyed whole villages. Satellite images of three villages in Rakhine State, Burma. The satellite images show how the villages of Chein Khar Li, Chut Pyin, and Rathedaung were burned down in the October 2016 attacks. In a 2014 census, the Burmese government only recognized the ethnicity ""Rohingya"" for those who could provide ""proof"" that their families had lived in the country for generations. Many Rohingya people were unable to do this, and were only allowed to register as ""Bengali."" Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, where they face the threat of being pushed back into Burma. Dozens of Rohingya people have been killed trying to cross the Naf River into Bangladesh. In late 2016, the Burmese government formed an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In March 2017, the Commission recommended a series of measures to address the situation, including urging the government to ensure that all people in the country have equal access to citizenship and to freedom of movement. Calls to end Rohingya crackdown Amnesty International is calling on the government to immediately end human rights violations and abuses in Rakhine State, allow unfettered access to the UN Fact-Finding Mission, and to establish a mechanism for reviewing citizenship. We are also calling on the government to repeal or amend laws that discriminate against the Rohingya. The government must end restrictions on movement and allow people to return to their homes safely, with adequate humanitarian assistance. The authorities must hold those responsible for abuses to account in fair trials without resorting to the death penalty.

"Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related accessories were sent to 30 countries, including at least 13 embargoed nations. Of the 6,700 items that researchers found, about 30 percent were gun parts or related accessories, according to the report, which was written by Armament Research Services, a specialist consultancy. About 40 percent of the items were ammunition, while 23 percent were explosives or chemicals and 10 percent were rockets, missiles or anti-tank weapons. The study was funded by the European Union. Researchers began by identifying more than 100 e-commerce platforms, chat rooms and other websites where people might be selling arms and weapons parts. It found that more than 160 sellers were offering illicit weapons, most of them from Europe. A screen shot of an ad for an assault rifle on Armslist.com, an online marketplace for firearms. The researchers bought 119 items, including anti-tank weapons, surface-to-air missile systems, machine guns, artillery shells, improvised explosive devices, hand grenades, ammunition and components for rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

"Apple Music performed a U-turn over payment policy a day after the pop star threatened to prevent the US firm from streaming her album 1989.

"An altercation broke out between two men inside a fast food outlet about 00:35 BST on Sunday which then continued outside. Police said the suspect is described being aged in his late teens or early 20s, of slim build and wearing a grey hooded top. The moment of the crash was captured on CCTV footage and showed the auto being tossed into the air before landing on its roof in the middle of the road.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he would propose a new asylum package to the European Union in a bid to tackle illegal immigration. Some 1,500 people have gathered in the city of Chemnitz to protest against migrants in the wake of a fatal stabbing , allegedly involving an Iraqi and a Syrian, that took place there on Sunday. The suspect was taken into custody in the 2000 block of Third Street, according to the release. The crash was reported at 5:39 p.m.in the area of East 114th Street and East Boulevard, according to a Cleveland police report. The man is in his 30s and has no prior criminal history, police said. The suspect was last seen wearing a gray shirt and gray trousers. It's unclear why the suspect began shooting. The governor's office said it would convene a special legislative session starting August 28.

"The idea will be looked at as part of a wider study of transport issues across southern Scotland. Campaign for Border Rail spokesman Simon Walton said they would have preferred the study to be more specific to the rail link, but were pleased it was on the agenda. He said: ""The campaign will be submitting a report to the study group. The way it has been set up makes it very difficult to make specific recommendations on the border rail link, but it is important that the government does not ignore the fact that there are more pressing transport issues in the region. ""We have to get this project moving. We have been waiting for 30 years, and there is no reason why it should not be on the agenda."" The study, which is expected to be completed in the summer, will be chaired by the Scottish Government's transport appraisal and strategy division. It will look at the potential impact of the A1 road upgrade and the recently opened Borders Rail project, as well as explore how to tackle road safety issues and improve connectivity between the south of Scotland and the central belt. Mr Walton said: ""We believe there are significant opportunities to develop economic growth through the provision of a dedicated rail link between Scotland and the North East of England."" Scottish Borders Council leader David Parker said: ""We welcome this review and look forward to working with the Scottish Government and all other agencies and parties to bring about real improvements to the transport infrastructure of the south of Scotland. ""The A1 is vital for Scotland's economy and the Borders in particular and it is imperative that the promised upgrade is delivered as quickly as possible.

""It will consider the A1 upgrade, the Borders Railway and other transport projects, such as the reinstatement of the Leadburn Junction and the dualling of the A75, to identify their impact on transport connectivity between the south of Scotland and the central belt.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action. Richard Ratcliffe, husband of detained British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, demonstrates outside the Iranian embassy in London. The British government has been accused of failing to do enough to secure the release of a British-Iranian mother jailed in Tehran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held in the Iranian capital on spying charges, has been on hunger strike for more than two weeks. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has slammed the UK government for not doing enough to secure her release and has called for the British ambassador to Iran, Robert Macaire, to be recalled. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""We have continued to press the Iranians for consular access and for due process to be followed, and to ensure her health and welfare. ""The Foreign Secretary met her husband last week to update him on the Government's efforts. ""The Foreign Secretary again raised Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in New York last week and the Prime Minister met Mr Ratcliffe in July and raised the case with President Rouhani in New York in September. ""The British embassy in Tehran continues to request consular access and we are working to secure her release as a matter of urgency."" Mr Ratcliffe said he was in talks with the Foreign Office but insisted more needs to be done. ""I'm hopeful that the Foreign Office is now actually going to do things and it's not just going to be talk,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""The Foreign Office is trying to get a visit this week, I think they're going to succeed. I hope that they're going to take some more decisive action."" Mr Ratcliffe called for ""a more urgent response"" to the situation, and said it was ""unacceptable"" that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was still in prison. He added: ""It's been two and a half years. They are not providing healthcare for Nazanin and they are not providing her with any legal support. They are not giving us any information. ""I think that it's been a shameful period for the Foreign Office. ""I'm sure that it's a very hard case for them and I'm sure that they're doing a lot behind the scenes, but it's also really clear that they're not taking the steps that are necessary and that they should be doing."" He said the government should be using its leverage with Iran in the form of debts owed to the UK by Iranian state oil company NIOC. Iran owes around 500 million to a UK-based court for an unpaid debt, which was ruled on by the UK Supreme Court and could be seized from the oil company by the British government. Mr Ratcliffe said: ""There's a state oil company debt that the UK Government is owed. ""The UK Government has said that it's prepared to seize that state oil company debt, which is worth half a billion pounds, but it's still not actually done it. ""And so if there's a question of leverage - which the UK Government is saying that there is - then it needs to take that step."" Mr Ratcliffe said Mr Macaire should be recalled ""for a period of time"" to send a clear message to the Iranian government. ""I think the Iranian government has to realise that this is unacceptable, this is an escalation, it's not just an ordinary case,"" he said. ""It's not just a bit of brinkmanship. We can't have a situation where the UK Government is saying that we're going to do something and we're not doing it."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 and is serving a five-year sentence over spying allegations, which she denies. She began a new hunger strike earlier this month to protest her ""unfair imprisonment"" and her husband said the Iranian authorities had threatened to add an extra year to her sentence.",0,10
"Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in the Eisteddfod and as the Eisteddfod is a celebration of all things Welsh, it was fitting that a large number of the acts were Welsh or Celtic-based. The first night saw a fine array of Welsh talent, and the festival opened with the Welsh traditional dance troupe Dawnswyr Bro Cefn, who were followed by traditional Welsh folk band Plu. This year's Eisteddfod is heavily influenced by the 2012 Olympics in London, and the first headline act of the evening was 2012 Olympic torch bearer Angharad Jenkins, who was followed by a beautiful performance from Elin Llwyd, who sang a capella. This year's Eisteddfod is also the first time that the Eisteddfod has been held in Cardiff Bay, and in recognition of this the organisers put on an impressive firework display after Elin's performance.

"Akinfenwa chested down in the box and saw his deflected shot fly past Bobby Olejnik to continue Wycombe's impressive home form - they have lost just one of six league matches at Adams Park this season. Wanderers looked the more likely to open the scoring in a cagey opening period, with Matt Bloomfield and Kortney Hause both going close for the hosts. Danny Hollands and Jake Reeves both failed to hit the target as Wycombe controlled the first half, and their dominance continued after the break. Akinfenwa was the home side's main threat and he should have opened the scoring when he was found unmarked in the box by Joe Jacobson's cross, but his header was well saved by Olejnik. Southend goalkeeper Olejnik was called into action again after the break when he tipped over a swerving shot from substitute Aaron Holloway, before Pigott shot wide from a good position for the visitors. But with 10 minutes remaining, Wycombe finally broke the deadlock. Akinfenwa got the better of Anthony Straker in the box and his shot took a wicked deflection off Olejnik to beat the goalkeeper and find the bottom corner.",0,12

"Transactions carried out in European markets were previously recorded in Luxembourg, with which Amazon had a low-tax agreement. Now sales made through subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy will be taxed in those countries, Amazon said in a statement. The new structure will apply to all sales made by Amazon within the EU, where it has a 29 market share, and means it will pay taxes in each of the countries where it operates. In 2015, Amazon paid 16.5m (14.5m) in taxes on European revenues of 21.1bn, the Guardian reported in February. The change comes amid growing criticism of the amount of tax paid by major corporations in Europe, including Amazon, Google and Apple. Amazon said it was working on the new structure with tax authorities in the four countries and would report its profits in those countries from 2015. Amazon UK Services, its British subsidiary, has made a profit of about 40m in the past two decades and paid 2.4m in taxes. The company said: ""Amazon EU Sarl is also planning to create hundreds of new jobs in Europe, working with its affiliates and third-party sellers to expand and evolve its local website and fulfilment offerings. ""We are working on implementing a new international tax structure and changes in our corporate structure to allow us to serve our customers better,"" said Amazon's European head of public policy, Axel Steinmetz. In December, the European commission proposed an overhaul of tax rules, which would force companies such as Google and Apple to pay taxes in the countries where they make money, rather than the countries where they are based. The commission wants to set a minimum tax rate to discourage firms from channelling profits through low-tax jurisdictions. Amazon's US parent company reported revenues of 107bn (76bn) last year, but paid 162m in taxes in 2012.

Former steelworker Kathleen Roberts said: ""It breaks my heart that we haven't been able to sort this out. I don't think we've done enough for our war heroes."" Five years ago, the memorial, which was moved to its current position in 1935, was deemed to be unsafe and was taken down for repairs. It has not been returned to its plinth. It is believed that, at one point, it was kept in a council storage area in Attercliffe. Council leader Julie Dore said: ""I believe we should be doing everything we can to make sure the memorial is returned to its rightful place on the plinth in Barkers Pool. ""We have raised over PS150,000 to bring it back and I would urge everyone to show their support for the campaign and help us get it back to where it belongs."" A spokesman for the council said the memorial was now being stored in a ""secure place"" in the city centre, adding: ""It is very frustrating for us that the Barkers Pool memorial has not yet been returned to the site. ""It is owned by the council and is being stored in a secure place in the city centre."" The Star understands that the memorial was not stored in the Sheffield Museums Collections Resource Centre, which was destroyed by fire in May 2012.

It is made of Dartmoor granite and features a naked soldier on top. The man, who is wearing a helmet and boots, is looking towards the left and has a rifle in his right hand, with his left hand holding a German helmet. The memorial also has three steps at the front, while the back is inscribed with the battalion's badge. The memorial, which was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1925, originally stood in the Haymarket, but was moved to Barkers Pool in 1935. It is believed to be one of only a handful of war memorials in the UK not to have returned to its plinth following repairs. The Star has contacted the council for more details about the memorial's current location. Barkers Pool has been at the centre of an ongoing row over its future. Members of the public, including the Hallamshire Historic Buildings Society, have criticised plans to pedestrianise the area.

"The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think? No computer has yet passed the Turing Test. The Turing test was proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. The test is designed to measure the point at which a computer passes as a human. The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. In the test, a human judge is asked to interact with a computer and a human being through text-only channels, in order to determine which is the human and which is the machine. The human judge is not told which is which. The computer is considered to have passed the test if the judge is unable to reliably distinguish the computer from the human.

The 2015 series against the Springboks was the first time Ireland had failed to win a Test against South Africa on home soil. Sexton, who has 48 caps for Ireland, was at fault for Connacht's decisive try in the Pro12 final as he missed a tackle on Matt Healy who touched down to put the Westerners 20-10 ahead.

The victim, Derek White, was said to have been beaten unconscious during the assault on Saturday and Sunday. The Ulster Unionist councillor was treated at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. He remained in intensive care last night. Mr White, a father of three, was allegedly attacked after he tried to intervene when a group of men were shouting at his son. Three other men, all from Dublin, appeared in court charged with the attempted murder of Mr White.

"An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago. But the compound ""was not on the radar"" in recent times, he said. It's not quite clear whether the ISI official is saying that the compound was not on the radar in recent times because it had been raided several years ago, or whether it was not on the radar because it was not under surveillance. If the latter, then it implies the ISI did not think the compound was important enough to be kept under surveillance. And if the ISI is saying the compound was not on the radar, then that's another way of saying that the ISI was not monitoring it. But I'd say that it's likely the compound was monitored, and that the ISI is just keeping the details of that surveillance to itself. So if the compound was monitored by the ISI, then it would be logical to assume that the ISI would know what was going on there. In fact, it would be logical to assume that the ISI would know what was going on there much better than the CIA. So it would be logical to assume that if Bin Laden was living there, the ISI would know it. The ISI official also said he did not know who had built the compound in Abbottabad. Well, that's convenient, isn't it? If the CIA knew that Bin Laden was living in the compound, and they informed the ISI of that fact, then you would expect the ISI to say: ""Yes, we know, and we've known for a long time, and we'll help you capture him."" Instead, the ISI appears to be saying: ""Yes, we know the compound, but we didn't know Bin Laden was living there, and we don't know who built it."" But the ISI does know who built it, doesn't it? It is widely reported that Bin Laden's compound was built in 2005. That information is repeated in an AP article today. An AP article from 2006 tells us the following: Pakistani intelligence operatives and civilian residents said the army had a heavy presence in the area at the time of construction, which would have made it impossible for the residents to approach the building. The Pakistani intelligence officials said that the army had first occupied the patch of empty land in 2005, soon after the October earthquake hit the area and the army was deployed to help in rescue work. The officials said that the army continued to occupy the land even after most of the other troops had left the area. They said that the army had built a small compound, comprising two or three sheds, on the land. When residents questioned the army about its continued presence there, they were told that the army was doing relief work in the area and that the land was government-owned. The army left the compound last December, leaving it in the charge of two Pakistani employees, they said. The residents said that foreigners, including Arabs, started visiting the compound in March, adding that the visitors usually arrived in groups of two or three and never stayed overnight. So there you have it: the Pakistani army occupied the land in 2005 and built a small compound there, comprising two or three sheds. The army then left the compound in the charge of two Pakistani employees in December 2005. So we know that the Pakistani army built the compound. But who built the compound? The same article from 2006 tells us the following: The Pakistani intelligence officials said they had been aware that suspicious activity was going on in the compound and that a foreigner had been living there. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information, said they did not know the identity of the foreigner, who is believed to have lived in the house with his family for several months. The intelligence officials said they did not inform the CIA about the occupants of the house because they were more focused on intelligence about al-Qaida suspects crossing over the border from Afghanistan and who were headed to North America or Europe. They said the CIA was also aware of the suspicious activity at the compound. A CIA spokesman in Islamabad, George Little, declined to comment on the agency's efforts to find al-Qaida figures in Abbottabad. So",0,32

The coach also revealed the side will not be invited to Downing Street, following reports that they will be snubbed by the Prime Minister. The British government has ""insufficient time"" to host the squad at 10 Downing Street due to the general election, according to reports. Simpson insisted, however, that he has ""no issues"" with the players not being invited. ""I'm not bothered at all,"" he said. ""We're aware of the political situation back home. We're not the only team who've not been invited to 10 Downing Street. ""I was there when I was with the Under-19s [in 2005] and it was a really nice occasion but it's certainly not something I'm going to get hung up about."" Meanwhile, defender Jake Clarke-Salter insisted the Under-20 World Cup victory will not be the last success for the current crop of England players. ""I think it's the start of something and there's a lot more to come from this team,"" the Chelsea man said. ""Hopefully a lot of them can go on to play for the first team."" Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored the only goal of the final, added: ""We'll look back on it in years to come and be proud of it.""",0,35
"The hosts saw left-back Alex Telles dismissed after two bookings in a 74-second spell, the second after a wild sliding tackle on Stephan Lichtsteiner on 27 minutes. His side spent the rest of the game on the back foot, as Juve probed in vain for a crucial away goal. But there was a moment of controversy in stoppage time, as Cancelo's cross struck the arm of Ronaldo in the area, only for referee Felix Brych to wave away the protests. Ronaldo had earlier been denied by a superb save from Wojciech Szczesny and was eventually substituted on 60 minutes, just after the former Arsenal goalkeeper had made a brilliant stop to thwart Juventus' best chance of the second half, a Joao Cancelo shot. However, he was unable to make a crucial impact in an attacking sense, as his side were unable to find a way through a determined Porto defence. Following Juve's 3-0 home win against Atletico Madrid, the tie is finely poised ahead of the return leg at the Allianz Stadium next week, and they will be confident of progressing to the semi-finals. Porto, who were beaten by Liverpool in the last 16 of the competition last season, have yet to concede a goal in the Champions League this season. Porto will be hoping to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time in their history, after last getting to the last four in 2004, when they were knocked out by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea.",0,36
"William Johnston, of Walsham-le-Willows, Suffolk, admitted dumping the rubbish, described as building material and household waste, last April. Suffolk Police said it was a ""potential danger to motorists and other road users."" Johnston was fined 730 and ordered to pay a 73 victim surcharge at a hearing in Bury St Edmunds on Tuesday. He pleaded guilty to causing or permitting the fly-tipping of controlled waste and was also ordered to carry out 100 hours' unpaid work. Sgt Dave Goodwin said: ""This was a particularly large quantity of waste, which was a potential danger to motorists and other road users in the vicinity. ""Johnston had no proper means to legally dispose of the waste and, when the opportunity presented itself, chose to fly-tip it. ""Suffolk Constabulary takes fly-tipping very seriously and will always investigate reports of this illegal activity. ""I'd like to urge members of the public to report any suspicions or knowledge of fly-tipping to the police.""",0,37
"Voters here have yet to make their choice in the regional election. But already there's something of the victory march in the chancellor's step. It has been years since her approval rating has been so high. She has brushed off the attacks of her opponents, and now says she is ready to show the world how to manage the economy. ""In the whole world today, in every international forum, people are looking to Germany. They are looking for Germany's leadership. We have to show how a stable, democratic Europe can solve its problems,"" she said. The economy is the only issue in this election, and Merkel knows it. Her Christian Democrats have gained from the economic crisis, and they have a 14-point lead in the polls. In the past, Germans have voted in regional elections for the opposition parties that they would not vote for in national elections. Not this time. ""In Germany, people always say, 'You have to vote the Social Democrats in in a regional election because you have to keep the chancellor in check.' But now it seems to be like a new era, that people trust Merkel,"" said Thomas Kliche, political editor of the daily newspaper Rheinische Post. Merkel has turned the crisis into an opportunity to show the world that Germany is a leader, he says. ""She used the crisis to put Germany in the center of the game, with a lot of responsibility, and now it looks like the German economy is the biggest, the strongest economy in Europe,"" Kliche said. But as she runs for re-election, Merkel has also become a target. Her opponents say she's too slow to act. She made a decision to phase out nuclear energy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, but has yet to come up with a new energy policy. And the government has been too slow to help those suffering from the recession. ""We have the highest unemployment in the whole of Europe,"" said Peter Marius Muller of the Left Party. ""We're the only country in the whole of Europe that has a very strong economic growth but the biggest increase of unemployment at the same time."" Muller says that Merkel doesn't take her responsibility seriously. He says the chancellor has ignored the plight of the unemployed and hasn't acted to stimulate growth. ""And that is the reason why the people think we need a change,"" Muller said. Merkel's challengers are having trouble getting their message out. She is so popular that the main candidates for her job have been all but forgotten in the campaign. The German economy may be in good shape, but voters here are anxious. They worry about jobs, and they worry about their future. They have yet to make up their minds on this election, and the polls show that almost half of the voters are still undecided.",0,38
"Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment ""problem solved."" It was shared in 2014, before she was elected to parliament. The Bradford West MP apologised for ""the hurt I have caused"" and said she would be seeking to expand her education on the ""sensitivities"" around the issue. Shah was suspended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the wake of the controversy. In a statement, she said: ""This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused. ""The violence in IsraelPalestine is deeply troubling. ""The loss of civilian life on both sides is horrific. I unequivocally condemn violence and unreservedly apologise for my comments. ""I remain committed to a peaceful solution in the Middle East through dialogue."" The suspension has since been lifted. The graphic was shared by Shah with the comment ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States,"" followed by the hashtags ""problemsolved"" and ""Palestine."" Ms Shah was one of several Labour MPs who had their social media activity probed by the Guido Fawkes political website. In 2014, she shared an image showing a man holding a poster with the slogan ""Jihad is the only solution for Palestine."" Also in 2014, she shared a link to a pro-Hamas blog, and another post which called for the al-Quds Brigade, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, to be considered a legitimate organisation. Shah has also retweeted links to a blog post which alleged that Zionists worked with the Nazis during the Second World War. In a statement released on Thursday evening, a Labour spokesperson said: ""The contents of this post are utterly unacceptable and fall well below the standard we expect of Labour Party representatives. ""We are in touch with Naz Shah MP to offer advice and support.""",0,39
"Chasing 268 in the first Test, Australia were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia - the world's top-ranked Test side - lost 10 wickets for 86 runs in an extraordinary collapse to be skittled for 161 chasing 268 at the Gabba. The Aussies crashed to 8136 at stumps on Day 3. The 18-year-old Labuschagne's inclusion comes after Queensland teammate Matt Renshaw was sent to play for Australia A to get some much needed runs after a lean run in the last Sheffield Shield season. The tourists' spinners kept things tight on a relatively flat Gabba pitch, with Mehedi Hasan (3-58) picking up the key wickets of opener Cameron Bancroft (20) and vice-captain David Warner (44). The final session was one of the finest of the year, with the hosts losing four wickets for 27 runs in the space of 30 deliveries. After losing his wicket in a similar manner, he said: ""I think I should have gone after him, because he had bowled a lot of deliveries to me outside off, so I could have hit him over the top for a boundary."" Mahmudullah took four catches, three off his own bowling, as Australia collapsed to 25-3, 4-68 and 7-94. While Australia will be looking for the services of Steve O'Keefe in the second Test, Bangladesh will not have the services of Tamim Iqbal, who has gone back to his country due to the demise of his uncle. ""I think it was a world record of no runs for 150 balls,"" he said. But he was rewarded when Lyon gloved a catch to Soumya Sarkar at short leg. The highlight of the final session was Lyon's wild celebration after a stumping and caught behind, before the wicket was overturned by DRS. Mominul Haque (37) and Mahmudullah (19) then managed to eke out some runs before Taijul Islam (13) and Shafiul Islam (2) will resume on day four in what is still a competitive game. In the final over of the day, Mehidy Hasan also took the wicket of Mushfiqur Rahim, who had made 68, and left the hosts needing 86 to win.",0,40
"The Slovenian club has knocked Hibernian, Rangers and Celtic out of Europe in recent seasons. Yet McInnes is adamant that his players are not fearful of the quality of the opposition.

"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the figure was up from 7.6 in the year to February. Separate figures showed the amount of money borrowed for home loans in March reached a nine-year high. The ONS said the number of people in work was 31.1 million, 53,000 more than for the three months to February. It is the highest figure since records began in 1971. The number of people unemployed fell by 35,000 to 1.85 million in the period. The unemployment rate was unchanged from February at 5.5, the lowest since August 2008. On the measure preferred by the Bank of England, which strips out those classed as self-employed, the jobless rate fell to 5.8 in the quarter, down from 6 in the previous three months. The number of people classed as economically inactive - those not working and not looking for a job - fell by 21,000 to 8.9 million, giving a rate of 22.2, the lowest since 1991. The ONS said the employment rate for the three months to March was 73.4, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the rate of pay growth remained weak. ""While the rate of job creation has slowed, the figures suggest the labour market remains strong,"" he said. ""The strong pound and weak eurozone recovery are holding back export growth and job creation in the manufacturing sector, and inflation remains very low. ""But a strong labour market is good news for the government, which has faced considerable criticism for the relatively slow pace of economic growth over the last few years,"" he added. The number of people classed as unemployed for more than a year has fallen by 99,000 over the past year, to 603,000, the ONS said.

The transaction will be completed in the first quarter of 2018 and it will include the Scripps' cable network portfolio, digital assets, and its 34 percent stake in the UKTV pay-TV channel. The move was made to boost Discovery's negotiating power as pay-TV companies lose subscribers and the price of programming rights increases. The deal also comes at a time when the Federal Communications Commission is considering easing a restriction on ownership of broadcast stations in a single market. It also comes as the Justice Department is appealing ATT's acquisition of Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co. is buying much of the assets of 21st Century Fox. Scripps' channels include HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel and DIY Network. The two companies are estimated to have 20 percent of ad-supported TV viewership in the U.S. Discovery, whose channels include TLC and Discovery Channel, has been investing aggressively in sports and international markets.

"Authors including The English Patient writer Michael Ondaatje and Peter Carey will not attend the PEN Literary Gala in New York on 5 May. They said PEN - known for its commitment to freedom of speech - was wrong to give the award to Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine that was attacked in Paris in January. Twelve people died in the shooting, including several of the magazine's staff. The gunmen were killed by police in January, while others were arrested. Hebdo had been criticised for publishing cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, and the attack was seen by many as an attack on free speech. The decision to honour it with the award caused some controversy. ""We do not believe in censoring expression,"" said PEN America president Peter Godwin in a statement in April. ""We will be honouring Charlie Hebdo not in spite of the terrorist attack on its offices but, rather, because of it."" Many writers, including Ondaatje, said it was wrong to give the magazine the award. ""There is a critical difference between the satirist and the propagandist, and one must be able to tell the difference,"" Ondaatje said in an email to the Associated Press, one of a group of writers to write to PEN, along with Carey, Teju Cole, Rachel Kushner and Taiye Selasi. ""All this is complicated by PEN's seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its former colonies as having equal status."" The writers said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision and asked the organisation to reconsider it. Carey said it was wrong to equate the magazine's cartoons with Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. ""A hideous crime was committed, but was it a freedom-of-speech issue for PEN America to be self-righteous about?"" he told AP. But Salman Rushdie, who was forced into hiding under a fatwa after his book The Satanic Verses was published, has defended the decision. ""If PEN as a free speech organisation can't defend and celebrate people who have been murdered for drawing pictures, then frankly the organisation is not worth the name,"" he said. ""What I would say to both Peter and Michael and the others is, I hope nobody ever comes after them.""

"The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants ""public good"" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like new drugs - rather than blanket bans being imposed. The CST, which advises the Prime Minister, says it is concerned that a precautionary approach to the technology could damage the UK's economic future and lead to other nations controlling the market. It argues that a more relaxed approach to GM crops could mean the UK grows varieties such as blight-resistant potatoes, which could bring real benefit to the economy, the environment and consumers. The UK government is already being lobbied by multinationals to drop regulations on GM crops and push for greater ""market penetration."" The CST's position could be seen as giving further encouragement to such a move. The CST says: ""The Council does not believe that genetic modification as a whole should be seen as posing generic risks, any more than conventional breeding methods do. It is also clear to us that the precautionary principle, as currently applied in the regulation of GM crops, is too broad-brush and that it would be better if the emphasis was on managing risk on a case-by-case basis."" Such an approach is likely to be vigorously opposed by environmental campaigners, who want all GM crops kept out of the environment. The CST's chairman, Prof John Krebs, has previously argued in favour of the technology's potential benefits. He said: ""We should take advantage of this new technology, where it is clearly in the national interest to do so. In that regard, we believe that GM technology has the potential to contribute to improvements in human health, to the environment and to the economy."" He also defended the government's record on GM crops. He said: ""The government has a good record on regulation in this area. We believe that the system is capable of safeguarding the public from any possible risk associated with the release of GM crops."" The CST's intervention is unlikely to help the government's GM debates, which were launched on Tuesday. The government says the aim is to bring the public back into the debate on GM crops, after the technology was rejected by the public last year. The government has said it will listen to the results of the debates, which are expected to take place in 2004. But a survey by MORI for the Genetic Interest Group (GIG), published on Wednesday, found that 66 of people wanted to see a GM free environment. Only 17 of people said they believed the government was being honest about the GM debate. The GIG's director, Alastair Kent, said: ""The government's problem is that most people don't trust the government to regulate GM and don't believe that there are any benefits to the UK in growing GM crops. ""Because of this, the government's idea of involving the public in a 'GM debate' is likely to fail. People don't trust the government and think the GM debate has already been manipulated.""",0,47
"Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, followed 60 to 80 year olds who did aerobic exercise for 40 minutes, three times a week. They also did short bouts of resistance training, and flexibility exercises. MRI scans showed the aerobic exercise group increased the size of their hippocampus by 2, against an average shrinkage of 1.4 in the control group. The aerobic exercise group also improved their performance on a memory test called spatial memory, which involves being able to remember the location of objects. People with early stage dementia also took part in the study, but they did not benefit from the exercise. According to a report in the BBC, Prof Arthur Kramer, from the University of Illinois, who led the study, said it showed that exercise could build up the hippocampus, and that the effect continued as people got older. ""The results have implications for guidelines for physical activity in older adults,"" he said. ""Current guidelines recommend low-to-moderate intensity physical activity for older adults to improve cardiovascular fitness and help reduce the risk for heart disease. ""Our study provides evidence that exercise training also benefits the brain."" His colleague, Prof Kirk Erickson, said: ""Exercise training increases the production of brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor, or BDNF. ""BDNF helps the brain change and respond to its environment. In other words, exercise may improve the brain's ability to adapt and learn by promoting production of a protein that helps the brain rewire and grow new connections between cells.""",0,48

Van Der Sypt said there was a possibility that the terrorist cell had a connection to the Paris massacre. Al-Arabiya reports that the cell was preparing an attack on Belgian police officers. The arrests in Belgium come days after terror attacks in France left 17 people dead. According to Belgium's public broadcaster RTBF, the people arrested were linked to the man who was arrested in the southern French city of Marseille on Tuesday in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack. That man is thought to have provided weapons to the attackers and was under surveillance by police. Belgian police have arrested a man linked to one of the suspected gunmen in last week's Charlie Hebdo massacre. Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman and four hostages in a kosher supermarket, reportedly had a weapon that was used in a shooting and an attempted robbery in Belgium in 2010. Belgian police have also been searching for a suspect who has been missing since a shooting last week in Verviers, a city about 69 miles from Brussels.

"The US has said the bombing, which took place in the Afghan city of Kunduz, was a mistake and it was attempting to strike the Taliban. MSF wants the bombing to be treated as a war crime. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has said it is not satisfied with the US explanation for an air strike on a hospital in Afghanistan in which 22 people were killed. The US military said the bombing of the hospital in Kunduz was a mistake and it was attempting to strike the Taliban. On Sunday, MSF released a statement saying it would not accept an apology, and called for an investigation into the bombing. In the statement, the group said it would demand an independent investigation of the incident. ""Today the US government has admitted that it was their airstrike that hit our hospital in Kunduz and killed 12 staff members,"" the statement read. ""Their description of the attack keeps changing - from collateral damage, to a tragic incident, to now attempting to pass responsibility to the Afghanistan government."" The US military had previously said Afghan forces had called for air support in Kunduz, and that the attack was in response to that. MSF is calling for an independent investigation into the bombing, which the group says was a war crime. ""We cannot rely on only internal military investigations by the US, NATO and Afghan forces. Their ongoing descriptions of the attack keep changing - from collateral damage, to a tragic incident, to now attempting to pass responsibility to the Afghanistan government,"" said MSF General Director Christopher Stokes. ""We've seen no evidence to support this version of events. We reiterate our initial demand that the US government consent to an independent investigation led by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission to establish what happened in Kunduz, how it happened, and why it happened,"" Stokes said. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said the Pentagon would investigate whether the strike violated the laws of war. In a statement released on Saturday, President Barack Obama apologized and said the US would never intentionally target a hospital. ""The Department of Defense has launched a full investigation, and we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy,"" Obama said. US Secretary of State John Kerry said he was ""profoundly sorry"" for what happened, but defended the bombing as a mistake, and said the US was committed to helping the Afghan people. The US has been carrying out airstrikes in the area to support Afghan forces attempting to regain control of Kunduz from the Taliban. The Taliban seized control of the city a week ago, in a major setback for the Afghan government and the US-led coalition that intervened in the country in 2001. The insurgents had pulled back from the city by Friday, but fighting continued on Saturday. Carter said on Sunday that the US would not stop airstrikes in Kunduz, and called the attack on the hospital a ""mistake."" ""There's a distinct possibility of more civilian casualties in Kunduz because of the fighting there, because of the Taliban, and because of ISIL [IS] ... and we will do everything we can to protect those civilians,"" he said.

"Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would ""seriously undermine"" Britain's ""deterrent."" And he said he would be worried if such a stance became ""widely prevalent"" in the UK. ""In the end I don't think it's a credible proposition,"" he said. ""What I'd hate to see is a debate that was uninformed by the facts or by an appreciation of the deterrent, and led the country to a place where we felt less safe and more vulnerable."" He said: ""I think it's very difficult for me to envisage any circumstances in which I would recommend to the prime minister that we should use nuclear weapons."" ""I've said before that the idea of mutually assured destruction was something that was born out of the Cold War and it's not something that I think we should be pursuing today,"" he said. ""The realities of deterrence in 2015 are very different from the 1980s. ""I am not a nuclear strategist, but I would certainly hope that the concept of mutually assured destruction is not one that we are pursuing in the 21st Century."" He said: ""The great strength of our nuclear deterrent is that the decision on whether to use nuclear weapons would be taken by a prime minister, and not by a general."" ""I've made the point that I don't want to be in the position of being asked the question, because I don't want to be in the position of using nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""The whole point of deterrence is that you don't use them."" His remarks came after a Tory MP, Daniel Kawczynski, called for Mr Corbyn to be banned from receiving intelligence briefings over his opposition to nuclear weapons. He added: ""At least the Soviets paid a heavy price for their nuclear weapons. ""Mr Corbyn is happy to have them for free, paid for by the hard-pressed taxpayer. ""Worse than that, his views are so extreme he would not use them if we were under nuclear threat.""",0,55

"""We save people here every day,"" said the 46-year-old policeman - managing to sound both proud and chiding and the same time. Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to the police station in the Kampung Lumpur area. His job is to protect the 300-odd Nigerians living in the area, as well as the tourists who come to see the old, decaying mansions. ""They're not bad people, just a bit naive. They need protection,"" he said. The article also quotes a Malaysian embassy official in Nigeria saying that they've seen ""at least 10"" instances of kidnapping of Nigerians in Malaysia, including some at the Nigerian High Commission. Malaysia is such a big destination for Nigerians that the local embassy is the biggest in the world after the Nigerian High Commission in London. I'm sure there's a very interesting story here, but it's a bit obscured by the attempt to turn this into a spy novel. So what is happening to all those Nigerian students who come to Malaysia, and do they have a real choice?",0,58
"The 23-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, saved a penalty in normal time and one in a shoot-out when the Chairboys knocked Blackpool out of the EFL Trophy in January. And, in a dramatic contest at Adams Park, he was at it again - this time in the shoot-out with a save from defender Sessi D'Almeida. The Chelsea loanee made a string of important saves in normal time, denying Liam Sercombe, Ryan Seager, Connor Wood and Curtis Nelson before the shoot-out. The Dons striker scored four times as his side put Oxford United to the sword in a remarkable 6-0 thrashing at Stadium MK. The former Northampton Town forward has found the net 19 times in his last 19 appearances and is the League One top scorer. The 24-year-old defender was at the heart of a Bantams defence which held firm in the 0-0 draw at Coventry City. The centre-back's impressive performance helped City pick up their first clean sheet since the middle of January. The 25-year-old striker was the hero as Mansfield Town edged a 1-0 victory at Notts County to move back into the play-off places. The forward found the net in the 64th minute to settle the local derby at Meadow Lane. The 24-year-old midfielder grabbed the headlines in Sky Bet League One as he scored a 20-minute hat-trick in Walsall's 3-2 win at Wigan Athletic.

"Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed across the road leading up to the hospital, preventing vehicles from being able to turn into the car park. The move was part of a 12m project to modernise the hospital's AE department and allow ambulances to access it more easily. It was hoped that the changes would reduce the amount of time it took for emergency crews to get to the department, which is one of the busiest in Wales. It was announced at the time that the measures would take around six months to complete, but one year on, the changes are still not fully in place. Concerns have been raised that the lack of progress could be putting lives at risk. Welsh Conservative AM, Darren Millar, said he had been contacted by an ambulance driver who said he had struggled to get through the barriers when taking a critically ill patient to hospital. He said that ""every minute counts"" when responding to an emergency. A spokesman from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said that changes to the hospital's AE department were ""complex."" ""The changes will be implemented in phases, with each phase requiring a number of sequential steps to be taken to ensure the safety of all,"" she said. The first step of the project has been completed, with barriers installed across the road leading to the hospital and a new ambulance bay.

"Nashat Melhem was tracked down to a mosque in his home town of Arara and killed in a gun battle, police said. The attacks sparked a huge hunt and security forces had arrested five people in connection with the case. ""Security forces surrounded the mosque where he was hiding and opened fire at him and he was killed and two other men were wounded,"" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Melhem, a 31-year-old Arab-Israeli from Arara, was suspected of shooting dead two Israelis and wounding six in Tel Aviv on January 1 and killing a taxi driver a few days later. He was among several Arabs who have carried out deadly attacks on Israelis since last October, in a wave of violence that has raised concern about a possible new Palestinian uprising, or intifada. Amid a flare-up of violence last year, the government ordered a security crackdown on Arab-Israelis, who make up 20 percent of Israel's population, imposing restrictions on their movement and on the residency status of those with family ties to Palestinians in the occupied territories. Melhem was also suspected of carrying out a shooting in the Israeli city of Petah Tikva in early December in which he wounded one person, Rosenfeld said.",0,63
"The inquiry will look at historical abuse of children in care in Scotland. But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, wants to be part of it. ""The abuse I suffered happened in Scotland but the people who abused me came from England. I want to be able to speak out in this inquiry about that,"" he said. He said the inquiry could not be ""effective"" if it did not allow people like him to give evidence. Mr Findlay has written to the former Lord Advocate, Dame Elish Angiolini, who is leading the inquiry, and is urging other people who have been abused while in care in Scotland to contact her. Mr Findlay was abused while a pupil at Aberlour House in Moray, which was run by the Scottish Episcopal Church's Moray Social Services Department. The inquiry, which was announced by the Scottish government in October, will examine the abuse of children in care in Scotland from the 1950s onwards. However, unlike the UK-wide inquiry being led by Professor Alexis Jay, it will not hear from people who were abused while in care in Scotland but who were abused by people who came from elsewhere in the UK. Mr Findlay said: ""The inquiry can't be effective if they are not willing to hear from people like me. We have waited decades to be heard. ""If Dame Elish wants to hear from us and will consider us she has a duty to tell us that."" The Scottish government said it would examine the issue. A spokesman said: ""The Scottish government has committed to introducing legislation to establish an independent public inquiry into the abuse of children in care. ""It is important that the inquiry is effective and delivers the right outcome for those who were abused.

"The blast tore through the crowded Jameela market in the predominantly Shia district of Sadr City. The Sunni jihadist group, Islamic State (IS), said it was behind the bombing and warned of more to come. It was the first major attack in the capital since Baghdad was rocked by suicide bombings on 16 May that left 70 people dead. More than 150 people have been killed in attacks in the Iraqi capital in June alone. IS is under pressure in its stronghold of Mosul in northern Iraq. The jihadists have lost control of most of the territory they once held in Iraq. The bombing was a rare attack in the Jameela district, which is overwhelmingly Shia and regarded as a stronghold of the powerful Shia militia, Saraya al-Salam. The deadliest recent attack to hit Sadr City was in February, when a twin suicide bombing in a crowded market killed at least 73 people. Islamic State has been losing ground to Iraqi government forces and their allies in northern Iraq. Iraqi forces, backed by US-led coalition air strikes, have dislodged IS from Falluja, an important city less than 60km (40 miles) from Baghdad. This week, troops are moving to retake the nearby town of Qayyarah, where the jihadists are still holding thousands of civilians hostage. IS still controls Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The government has been planning an offensive to retake Mosul since earlier this year, but the operation has been repeatedly postponed because of a lack of readiness. Analysts say that by carrying out attacks in the capital, IS hopes to deflect attention from the battle for Mosul.",0,66
"Instead of fees rising to PS9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's an ambitious policy and one that would cost around PS10bn per year to implement, which is more than Labour's annual health budget. Mr Corbyn has said that this money will be found from ""the very people who can afford it,"" but where does that leave people who are already paying back their student loans, who may not have the spare cash to help out? What happens to people who are paying back their student loans? The students who would benefit from a move to free tuition are those who are still at university, and those who are just about to start. For students who have already graduated, it's a case of what you were expecting to pay will be what you end up paying. This is because, in the UK, there is no way of reducing the amount that you pay back in the future. This is because, under current rules, the amount you pay back each year is based on your salary and not the size of your debt. This means that you will keep paying back what you were expecting to. But the abolition of fees could mean that students who are already at university could see their fees reduced in the future. There is precedent for this happening. When the Government decided to raise fees from PS3,000 to PS9,250 per year, it also decided to change the terms of loans for students who had already graduated. But it's still unclear whether this is possible, and whether students who are paying back their loans could benefit from a change in tuition fees. The Tories did it, so can Labour? When the Government decided to raise fees from PS3,000 to PS9,250 per year, it also decided to change the terms of loans for students who had already graduated. The move led to mass protests in the streets of London. The Government was worried that this would mean that some students would find themselves paying back less. To counteract this, the Government extended the length of time that you have to pay back a student loan to 30 years, up from the previous 25. It also decided to change the amount of salary that you have to earn before you start to pay back your student loan to PS21,000, which is a PS5,000 increase. This was done because the Government wanted to keep the amount that students paid back each year the same. This meant that, if you were on a PS21,000 salary, you would pay back the same amount (PS900 per year) as someone who was on a PS15,795 salary. This change to the amount that students pay back was made by the Government retrospectively. This meant that it was applied to students who had already graduated. When the change was made, the Government said that it would cost PS2bn in the first year to make the change, and that it would be revenue-neutral in the long term. This means that the Government is not going to earn any more money by changing the repayment terms, but it also means that students who have graduated are not going to pay back more. It also means that, under current rules, there is nothing to stop the Government from making a change to the amount that you pay back. This would be a fair way to ensure that students who have already graduated don't see a change to the repayment terms for their student loan. But it would also mean that the Government would have to find the money from somewhere to fund it.",0,67

"Notts' 39-run win against Essex at Trent Bridge on Monday sees them return to the showpiece event at Edgbaston for the first time since 2010. Read, who has won a host of trophies since arriving at Trent Bridge in 2012, was understandably thrilled with the way things turned out. ""It feels really good to be going to Finals Day,"" he said. ""When you get to the knockout stages you're there to win it and we feel that we've got a really good chance of winning it this year. ""We had a good result against Essex today, who are a really good team. They've got a lot of international players in their squad and they were on a very good run as well. ""We always feel that we've got a very good squad here and we've got a really good chance of going all the way."" Read, who made 30 as Notts cruised to 156 for three in their 20 overs, was named in England's squad for the T20 tri-series, against Australia and New Zealand, next month. He made his debut in the shortest format against the West Indies in February, and hopes to add to his five caps in the coming weeks. ""It's good to be involved again and it's nice to be recognised for your performances in the domestic T20 tournaments and in the Champions League as well,"" he said. ""I'm pleased to be in there and hopefully I'll be able to push on and get some more England caps."" Read was also keen to talk about Notts' performance against Essex, which saw them chase down their target with six overs to spare. ""We got a really good score,"" he said. ""It was a little bit slow to start with but then the boys really kicked on and put us in a good position. ""Chasing on a ground like this is always difficult. You need to be on the money and hit the gaps but the boys did that today and it worked out well."" Read was also quick to praise the efforts of James Pattinson, who has been in fine form since returning to Notts earlier this month. The Australian paceman took three for 20 from his four overs, before clubbing an unbeaten 18 in the run chase. ""He's been fantastic in the few games he's played,"" said Read. ""He's got three or four wickets in every game and he's been really good at the end of the innings with the bat as well. ""He's a class player and it's been really good to have him in the squad.""

"So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's existence, it was a task which would take some doing. For Robbie Neilson, the task was simple: get the fans on side. After a horror start to his tenure, Neilson has done just that. He's been in the job just three months, but it's clear the fans are beginning to warm to the Scot. And he's done it in his own way. Neilson has made it clear to the media that he will give the supporters what they want. And he hasn't been shy in the past when it comes to being vocal about his opposition, whether that be in the stands, the press box or on the pitch. Following Dons' 3-0 FA Cup first round win at Maidstone United on Sunday, Neilson was asked about the boos from the home fans towards his bench. ""It's probably one of the first times I've had it - I don't get involved,"" he said. ""I've got nothing to say to them. ""I'm a manager. I just want to win the game. And it is this attitude, his steely determination and his commitment to getting MK Dons back on track, which has made him such a popular figure with supporters. Neilson is a football man through and through, and it's clear from his demeanour that he is passionate about what he does. And it's that passion, coupled with his willingness to speak his mind, which makes him an attractive proposition to the average football fan. But it's not just in the stands Neilson has been vocal. On numerous occasions this season, he has been quick to jump to the defence of his players, something which no doubt played a part in them doing him proud against Maidstone on Sunday. With Dons' League One position looking precarious, Neilson is well aware that his side's performance in the FA Cup this season was going to come under the microscope. And when the pressure was on, they delivered. So far, it's been a solid start to Neilson's time in Milton Keynes, with Dons sitting 16th in League One, in the midst of their best run of form this season, and preparing for an FA Cup second round tie against Spurs. But it's a long old season ahead, and the man from Scotland will have his work cut out if he is to turn Dons' fortunes around.",0,70
"A new programme, known as Drive, will be aimed at the most dangerous offenders, BBC News has been told. Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be rolled out nationally. Drive aims to tackle the underlying causes of domestic abuse, rather than simply punish perpetrators. It was piloted in a number of police forces including Hampshire and Lancashire, and has been shown to be effective in reducing reoffending by up to 40. There were 713,000 domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes in England and Wales in the year to March 2018. 'Damaging control' The Drive approach involves specialist police officers working with a domestic abuse practitioner to assess an offender's risk to their partner or ex-partner, and to look at their willingness to change. The programme runs for a minimum of 12 weeks, and involves up to 10 one-to-one sessions with an accredited facilitator, who will assess the offender's level of motivation, and challenge their beliefs and attitudes. The first session, which usually takes place in the offender's home, is conducted by a facilitator and a police officer. And the facilitator will work with the victim to assess the risks they are facing, and put a safety plan in place. The programme is based on an approach called the Duluth model, which has been used in the US for more than 25 years. It is named after the city in Minnesota where the programme was pioneered by social activist Ellen Pence. Duluth focuses on a perpetrator's desire to hold power and control over their partner, and aims to get them to change their behaviour. Psychologist Dr Jessica Eaton, who helped to adapt the Duluth model for the UK, says domestic abuse is all about one person trying to control another. ""This person could be very loving, but as soon as they feel the relationship is being challenged they feel the need to exert their power and control,"" she says. ""It's about a mindset that is based on inequality and dominance."" Dr Eaton says abusers are often not violent, but use psychological and emotional control to make their partners submissive. ""This can involve telling them what to wear, who they can and can't see, what they can and can't do,"" she says. ""In the most extreme cases it can result in a woman not being allowed to leave the house."" Offenders are often given a stark choice: change their behaviour or face jail. Jayne, not her real name, has been an accredited Drive facilitator in Hampshire for the past year. She says many offenders have reached a crisis point and recognise they need to change. ""If they are arrested for a domestic abuse incident and bailed, we will contact them and ask them to come for an assessment,"" she explains. ""They are given a contract that says if they don't come for the assessment or engage with the programme they will be arrested and charged."" The assessment involves a detailed questionnaire that aims to determine how likely a perpetrator is to reoffend, and how much risk there is to the victim. 'Getting even' Jayne says abusers often fear they will lose their partners and their families if they don't change their behaviour. ""They often have a sense of urgency and want to do the programme as soon as possible,"" she says. ""Some of them are really motivated. They realise they are at a crossroads and will lose everything if they don't change."" The Drive approach has been used successfully in several areas of the country, including Hampshire, and is now being rolled out nationally. It is being backed by the Home Office and the police, and will be managed by SafeLives, a charity that aims to end domestic abuse, and Respect, the UK membership organisation for work with domestic violence perpetrators, male victims and young people. A key element of the new programme will be the involvement of specialist police officers and domestic abuse practitioners, who will work together to ensure the perpetrator does not reoffend. The aim is to make sure that support is available to the victim as soon as possible, and to manage the offender's behaviour through the criminal justice system. 'Appalled and ashamed' Domestic abuse charities are welcoming the launch of the national programme. ""We are confident that",0,71

"The head of football's governing body outlined his vision for an expanded tournament comprising 16 groups of three teams earlier this month. The top two teams in each group would qualify for a 32-team knockout stage. FIFA's Infantino wants to make a quick decision to give qualifying countries certainty. But he faces a challenge from UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, who is reportedly seeking a delay until 2026. The Italian says he doesn't like the idea of an expanded tournament. He also dismisses the notion it would generate more revenue for FIFA, which has been rebuilding its finances after years of corruption and overspending under previous president Sepp Blatter. But the 58-year-old believes he can make a success of the World Cup even with 48 teams. ""I'm not saying we have to play 48 teams tomorrow morning, but what I'm saying is that if it's good for football, if it brings 200 million more, it's 200 million that can help to develop football all over the world,"" he said. ""It's the right thing to do. So why not?"" Infantino has also raised the prospect of co-hosting the World Cup, a move that would ease the burden on one single country. He says the 2030 edition could be split between South American countries, while an Asian World Cup could be staged ""from Vladivostok to Jakarta."" ""To have a World Cup in 2030 in various countries is a very interesting, thrilling, fascinating project,"" he said. ""We have to study it seriously and see if it's feasible or not.""

"Joan Ostojic's daughters Katherine, 21, and Alice, 19, were on a boat carrying 25 people that went down between Lombok and the Komodo Islands on Saturday. They sat on the vessel's deck with their friend and survivor Julie, 22, who was holding a large inflatable toy, known as a 'blow-up'. Miss Ostojic, of Bowral, NSW, said the girls had been wearing life jackets but she had told them to take them off for the day. ""Their friend is the one who told them to take the life jackets off and I said 'that's fine, it's hot and it's really uncomfortable to wear them all the time, they'll be alright'. ""They had no chance, they were all in the water without life jackets on."" The vessel was hit by three waves and sunk in just five minutes, Miss Ostojic told the Nine Network. ""It happened very, very fast and the boat was incapable of withstanding the waves it hit,"" she said. Miss Ostojic said she did not want to speak about the tragedy but felt she had to ""to raise awareness about safety in these boats."" She said she had flown to Indonesia to identify her daughters' bodies and bring them home. ""I'm going to identify them and then I'm going to bring them home,"" Miss Ostojic told the Nine Network. It is understood the girls' bodies will be returned to Australia on Thursday. In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: ""A consular officer from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta has visited Lombok today to provide support to the family of an Australian woman who died in the boating accident. ""Consular officials are assisting the families and are liaising with Indonesian authorities to clarify details about the circumstances of the accident. ""The Australian Embassy in Jakarta is working closely with Indonesian police and the consular officials are assisting the families."" Joan Ostojic's daughters Katherine, 21, and Alice, 19, were on a boat carrying 25 people that went down between Lombok and the Komodo Islands on Saturday. Katherine and Alice had been working for a year on yachts in the Mediterranean. They had been planning to spend the next year in Asia, visiting Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. They had been on the island of Lombok for the past two weeks. Ms Ostojic said her daughters were ""the best of friends"" and were ""beautiful and intelligent girls."" ""They loved life, loved people and they were just really generous and loving, kind people,"" she said. ""They had great values and they were a credit to their family. They're going to be sorely missed."" Katherine was a student at the University of Technology, Sydney, studying a double degree in business and communications, while Alice had been studying a double degree in communications and media at the University of Sydney. Her younger sister, Julie, 22, was the only Australian survivor. The boat left Lombok on Saturday morning for the Gili Islands, off Bali, and was expected to reach the Gili Islands in the afternoon. Ms Ostojic said the family had been told the boat had hit rocks and sunk. There were 25 passengers and four crew on board. The boat, owned by Rejoice Travel Services, was built to carry only 20 people, Ms Ostojic said. Indonesian police said yesterday the captain and one of the crew members had been arrested. Officers said they believed the captain and crew were at fault. The captain has been charged with negligence causing death, while the crew member has been charged with negligence causing injury. The company has been closed while the investigation continues. Is this boat too crowded? The death toll from the accident rose to 21 yesterday after two more bodies were recovered. Six Australians, three Britons, three French, two Swedes, two Indonesians, a Dutch and an Indian national are among the dead. ""The captain was supposed to take them to the Gili islands but he decided to go to the Komodo islands. The boat was hit by three waves,"" Agung said. ""It was not a rough sea and there was no rain. They were hit by three waves and sank,"" he said. ""There were 25 passengers on board and the boat was only supposed to carry 2",0,74

""I thought I could have played a bit better but we lost wickets at the wrong time, so we could not have a partnership going,"" said Chopra.

""They've got to be dealt with and I'm sure they will be."" McCall said Millwall players who ran towards celebrating supporters at the final whistle were also guilty of misbehaviour. ""I'm not overly happy about the way the players have gone over, as well, so it's certainly a side of the game that I don't like,"" he said. Millwall manager Kenny Jackett did not agree with his counterpart's assessment, saying the pitch invasion was not his team's fault.

Each of Wales' 37,600 teachers will be given a professional learning passport. The plan aims to help teachers become confident using digital technology in the classroom and improve the use of the Welsh language by teachers and pupils. ""We must be ambitious and bold in our expectations of how our education system can deliver for every child in Wales,"" Huw Lewis said. ""There is no silver bullet to improve the system; it is the interaction of many different elements which can support improvement. ""Our children and young people need a new deal. A deal to ensure that they get the best possible start in life. A deal to ensure that they get the best education possible."" He said the ""professional learning passport"" would be at the heart of the new deal. ""This will be a major step change in how we deliver CPD [continuing professional development] in Wales,"" he said. ""A professional learning passport will help teachers to be confident in their own abilities and their own professional learning. ""Teachers will be able to complete an online self-assessment which will highlight their strengths, skills and knowledge as well as areas for development."" Wales' Education Minister, Huw Lewis, said the new deal would reshape how teachers are trained The plan will also help teachers to apply digital technology, such as tablet computers, to the classroom. The plan also aims to improve the use of the Welsh language by teachers and pupils. A new Welsh medium curriculum will be developed for children and young people in Wales. ""We will ensure that our teachers are confident and capable in the use of Welsh and that they are able to teach through the medium of Welsh in the same way they do through the medium of English,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government will continue to support the professional development of our teachers to enable them to achieve this."" Mr Lewis's statement was criticised by the Welsh Liberal Democrats' education spokeswoman, Kirsty Williams. She said that while she welcomed the minister's statement that ""much of what he said was the same as what he said last year."" ""When the minister talks about a new deal for teachers, he needs to ensure that he is not inadvertently tying their hands behind their backs,"" she said. ""We need a new deal for teachers that involves trusting them to do their jobs. ""We need to make it easier for them to do their jobs."" She said that over the past two years the Welsh Government had introduced more than 100 pages of new guidance for teachers. She said the minister had said that he would reduce the volume of guidance by removing anything which was unnecessary. ""The minister should have said today that the Welsh Government would reduce the number of directives to schools by removing all those that are unnecessary,"" she said. ""Today, we heard yet more promises and yet more excuses.""

""It was an opportunity to announce a real shake-up of the entire system, with the implementation of radical new ideas. ""But instead we have had a rehash of existing policies which simply tinker around the edges, instead of going to the heart of what is needed to ensure our young people are fully prepared to face the challenges of the 21st Century.

""I am also pleased to see the minister is committed to introducing a new curriculum for the 21st century."" The proposals in the plan were drawn up with the support of the profession, the minister said, and their input would be ""integral"" to the delivery of the new deal.

"Lib Dem sources say 30,000 local authority places are being lost as money is diverted to new free schools. They said Mr Gove was ""ideologically obsessed"" about backing free schools. Lib Dem ministers say they are examining ways to ensure enough local authority places are available to meet demand. They are understood to be considering whether councils need more powers to force academy schools to accept children. The latest figures from the Department for Education show that the number of children being taught in ""bulge"" classes of more than 30 pupils has risen by more than 60 in the last year, from 1,703 to 2,763. ""Parents will be shocked at the news that Michael Gove's pet free schools are now taking up so much money that thousands of local authority places are being lost,"" said Mr Laws. ""The Government is spending over 1bn on free schools when many of them are not needed and could be opened at much lower cost by the local authority. Instead, money is being diverted from the classroom to pay for bureaucracy and consultants, with some free schools paying out tens of thousands of pounds to management consultants. ""The Conservatives promised more free schools, but now we see that is being done by cutting the number of local authority places. The result is bigger class sizes and fewer places for parents who want them."" The Department for Education disputed the Lib Dems' figures, saying that the number of new school places created last year was greater than the number of pupils starting school in 2011. It said 117,000 new primary places were created last year, and 166,000 in total since May 2010. Mr Gove has set up 55 free schools so far, and plans for a further 102 have been approved. A further 440 applications are pending. The Lib Dems said that 25,000 places would be lost in the current financial year, and a further 5,000 places would be lost in 201314 as money was diverted to fund new free schools. A spokesman for Mr Gove said: ""The Liberal Democrats claim that they support free schools, yet the reality is that they are in fact trying to strangle them at birth by blocking the money they need. ""Our free schools are offering a first-class education to thousands of children who would otherwise be in failing schools. We will not listen to their ideological opposition to parents setting up their own schools. ""It is now up to the Liberal Democrats to show how serious they are about supporting free schools. They can do this by voting with the Government when the next budget comes before the House of Commons."" Government spokesman: ""Every local authority is responsible for ensuring that there are enough school places for children in their area. But the demand for good school places has been increasing with the rising birth rate, so we are investing billions in new school places to meet that demand. ""In the last academic year, 117,000 new primary school places were created and a further 166,000 new school places have been created since May 2010. We are on track to deliver the 250,000 new places we have promised over this parliament. ""The majority of new school places created last year were in new Academies and Free Schools. It's very disappointing that the Liberal Democrats are opposed to the changes we are making to the education system that will ensure that all children have access to a first class education.""",0,81

"The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has tried to build up its own independent ""special relationship"" with a superpower, as with France in the 1930s or the USSR in the 1970s. I love that it's apparently the Suez invasion that was the disaster. And we all remember the famous Chamberlain-Hitler-Stalin pact, right? Labels: Britain, history, miscellaneous hundreds of thousands of people will find they are not on the electoral register and therefore will not be able to vote Hundreds of thousands?!?!? That's got to be, like, at least a third of the electorate. At 6:55 pm , Peter Hindrup said... So who will be responsible for the greatest foreign policy disaster in the UK: 1997 to 2008? Not the Caledonian Federation? Not the European Union? Not the United Kingdom? But the European Union was responsible for the greatest foreign policy disaster in the UK . At 6:21 pm , James said... I think this is the point he's trying to make: ""The worst thing is, the more we try to build up our own independent ""special relationship"" with a superpower, the more we'll end up looking like this:"" He is being slightly tongue in cheek, I think. At 9:11 am , Paul said... Yes, but if the Suez invasion was a disaster, and we are supposed to learn from history, wouldn't it be a disaster to ignore America again? I think this guy needs to think through his arguments a bit better... How can the Suez invasion have been a disaster? Suez was a disaster for Nasser and the Egyptians. The invasion by Britain, France and Israel destroyed Egyptian military forces and removed Egypt's access to the sea and the Suez Canal. Only the USA's betrayal of its allies and the subsequent invasion of Hungary by the Soviets led to Egypt's military fortunes improving. The Suez invasion was certainly disastrous for the prestige of the British Empire, but Britain would never have been able to hold on to its empire anyway, and the invasion at least showed that the British were not prepared to go down without a fight. The Suez invasion was a disaster for the Conservative Party. However, given that Churchill had been opposed to it, it was clear that the Conservatives would have been opposed to it no matter who was in power. It would be more accurate to say that the Suez invasion was a disaster for the Labour party. A bad choice of words on my part, I suppose. It was certainly a disaster for British imperial prestige and for Britain's relations with the US, and the actions of the Americans certainly played a role in bringing about the disaster.",0,85

"The new charge will be imposed from April 2017 and help ensure that big business shoulders the cost of training workers, George Osborne said. But business groups have described the policy as a ""stealth tax"" on jobs, which could damage productivity. The apprenticeship levy will apply to all public and private sector employers with a pay bill of more than 3m, who will pay 0.5 of their total wage bill into the pot, which will be ring-fenced to pay for apprenticeships. There will be a 15,000 allowance for employers to offset against the levy - so only businesses with a pay bill of 3m or more will have to pay. The government said it will ""top up"" the payments by 10 to ensure the money goes further. The government said it will take the money from the levy and ""top it up"" by 10 to ensure the money goes further. It is expected to raise 3bn annually, which will be used to meet the government's target of creating 3m apprenticeships by 2020. The chancellor said: ""My message to businesses is this: I will support you and help you to succeed. It is a partnership, and we are in this together. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it was a ""surprise"" tax on business that would hit many firms that already have extensive apprenticeship schemes in place. ""The levy is a payroll tax on business and by changing the scope of who pays, the government is changing the internationally accepted definition of an apprenticeship. The money raised should be ringfenced for training to develop the skills vital to our future economic success,"" said Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director-general. The Institute of Directors also criticised the new charge. ""Businesses feel they are being asked to pay for the government's failure to get the training system right,"" said Seamus Nevin, the institute's chief economist. ""Given the government's poor record with apprenticeships, it's hard to see why employers should be expected to shoulder the burden of paying for them through a levy. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education also expressed concerns about the levy, which it said would hit businesses hard and could deter them from training staff. ""For a long time we have argued that more needs to be done to make apprenticeships available to adults who need to retrain. It is disappointing that this Budget has done nothing to address this issue,"" said David Hughes, the institute's chief executive. The apprenticeship levy is the first of its kind in the UK. However, it has proved controversial in other countries, including Germany, where it has been blamed for a reduction in the number of apprenticeships available. In France, the levy has also been criticised, with some saying it has led to an increase in unemployment among young people. However, the chancellor insisted the levy would ensure employers are investing in high-quality apprenticeships. ""The levy will give our young people the quality training that can lead directly to a better paid job,"" he said. The government will consult on the detail of the levy in the next few weeks. As well as the apprenticeship levy, the chancellor also announced a series of other changes to apprenticeships. The government said it was creating a new employer-led body to set apprenticeship standards and ensure quality. It is also launching a new register of apprenticeship training providers, so employers can choose high-quality providers. The government has previously announced that a new apprenticeship voucher system will be introduced from 2017-18, which will provide government funding directly to employers to purchase training from an approved provider. The chancellor also announced that maintenance grants for university students would be scrapped, and replaced by loans. Maintenance grants are currently worth up to 3,387 a year for students from low-income families. Students from families with annual household incomes of up to 42,600 are currently eligible for the grants. The change will come into effect from the 2016-17 academic year.",0,87

Overall, house prices across the United Kingdom were up by 3.1, compared with 3.2 in June. ""The housing market continues to be buttressed by a shortage of stock for sale on the market,"" he said. ""The Bank of England may be breathing a small sigh of relief as consumer credit growth remains relatively subdued, but the ongoing resilience of mortgage approvals suggests the possibility of stronger growth in consumer credit borrowing ahead,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.

London prices are still about double those in the north-east of England, which is the cheapest region in the country. ""The capital is seeing house prices fall over the year due to the slowdown having a larger impact here,"" said Rhian Murphy, head of sales at the ONS.

"Spencer Wilding, who hails from Rhyl, was the guest of honour at a special screening of Rogue One. He had to muster all powers of the force to keep his identity secret as Darth Vader in the new Star Wars movie. Ever since the first Star Wars movie was released in 1977, fans have been wondering who was inside the costume of the Darth Vader character. It has been revealed that the man behind the mask in the latest Star Wars movie is North Wales actor Spencer Wilding. Spencer was the guest of honour at a special screening of Rogue One at Odeon Cinema, Rhyl. He was there to promote the movie and the North Wales Film Academy, which he set up. The 6ft 7ins tall actor said he loved working on the movie. ""It was such an honour to be part of the Star Wars saga and amazing to be in the Darth Vader costume. ""It was a dream come true,"" he said. Spencer, who is from Rhyl, has starred in more than 20 movies, including Guardians of the Galaxy, Green Lantern, Ghost Rider and Batman. He has also appeared in the TV series Warehouse 13, Stargate Atlantis, Atlantis and Doctors. Spencer said he had to muster all powers of the force to keep his identity secret as Darth Vader.

"Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists have yet to rule out the possibility that the object is a comet - a body that is very different from an asteroid. But the orbit has been calculated to show that it is bound to the Sun, and not a freely-travelling comet. ""It does have a comet-like orbit, but we don't think it's a comet because it's so big,"" said Scott Sheppard from the Carnegie Institution for Science, who is part of the team reporting the discovery. ""The diameter of this thing is about 500km, so it's very likely to be a dwarf planet. ""It's really far out; it's about three times further than Pluto, so it's really, really far away. It's probably the most distant object we've ever found in the Solar System,"" he told BBC News. The team first spotted the object in November last year, and then followed it up with further observations in March. These helped them to determine the orbital path, and get a better idea of the object's size. And the scientists say that if it is a dwarf planet - a body that is large enough to be roughly spherical, but not big enough to be a planet under the current definition - then it is the largest one we know of. It is yet to be named, but has been assigned the designation 2012 VP113. The team that found the object has submitted a paper to the Minor Planet Electronic Circular, detailing the discovery. This pre-print version describes the object's orbit and gives more details on the discovery process. The discoverers estimate the diameter of the object to be between 450km and 1,000km. The team had initially used the Magellan telescope in Chile to try to observe 2012 VP113 and to confirm that it was a real object, but bad weather prevented them from obtaining a conclusive answer. But they were then able to follow the body up using the Dark Energy Camera on the 4m-aperture Victor M Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Scott Sheppard said the orbits of the new object and other bodies in the Solar System suggested that there was a lot of material waiting to be discovered in the outer reaches of the Solar System. ""We're thinking that this thing is probably pretty typical of the population of objects in the Kuiper Belt. So there should be hundreds, if not thousands, of these objects out there, and a lot more that are smaller than this one."" ""We're at the edge of our Solar System - we think. We're actually not sure where the edge is, and this is a really good way to try and see how big our Solar System really is."" At the moment, 2012 VP113 is moving away from the Sun, but will come to its closest point in about 300 years. After that, the planetoid will head back into the depths of the outer Solar System, not to return until 4,000 years have passed. 2012 VP113 joins a number of other objects whose orbits are consistent with them being in the far reaches of the Solar System. The best known is Pluto, but the region also includes a number of other objects such as the dwarf planet Eris, and the intriguing Sedna. The orbits of these distant objects are shown on a diagram (above) in which their positions are given in relation to the plane of the Solar System. The plane of the Solar System is the imaginary flat surface on which the eight planets, and many other objects, orbit the Sun. The diagram also shows the orbits of Neptune and the dwarf planet Pluto. Some of the orbits are shown with a slight tilt. These are known as ""eccentric"" orbits. NASA's proposed New Horizons spacecraft is currently heading towards Pluto, and is expected to make a flyby of the dwarf planet in July 2015. The spacecraft will then head on into the Kuiper Belt, to study other objects in the region, if NASA can find a suitable target.",0,93
"Saints' 3-0 reverse at Everton on Monday completed a difficult Christmas period for Claude Puel's side. But Stephens, who made his Premier League debut at Goodison Park, believes a change of fortune can come swiftly in the top flight. ""It has been a tough week for us,"" Stephens said. ""We did not really do enough to get any points from those three games and we could have done a lot better. ""It was tough to take at the end but the Premier League is all about going on runs and if we can get one together then we will be on a different level. ""We have to make sure we do not dwell on this too much. ""We have to put it behind us and move on to the next game. ""We have to get a win, which we know we can do. Puel's team have not won a Premier League game since their 4-1 victory at Bournemouth on December 2. Since then they have drawn two games and lost the other three. ""We have lost to three of the top sides in the league and we are disappointed not to get anything from those games, especially after the second half against Tottenham,"" Stephens said. ""But we have to move on and we will work hard in training. ""We have to make sure we go into the Arsenal game at the weekend with the right mindset and get the win that we need. ""We have to look at the positives and build on those. ""You never go into a game expecting to lose. We were confident we could get a result at Everton.",0,94
"Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to clean it. The iPad, and before it the iPhone, launched a revolution in computing by substituting the conventional keyboard and mouse for the touch-sensitive glass of the screen. The technology has since been adopted by a plethora of rival devices and looks set to become a standard feature of many PCs in the future. But touchscreens are messy. The oil from users' hands gets on to the screen and smears, distorting the image. Users are forever cleaning their devices. Now, however, the fingerprint-free future is in sight. A nanotechnology company based in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, has produced a glass cover that is resistant to oil and fingerprints and which it claims is 100 times harder than steel. The technology, developed by ALD NanoSolutions, is based on aluminium oxide, a compound found in sapphires. The surface has an even distribution of aluminium oxide crystals, which are anchored in a glass layer. The crystals are smaller than a wavelength of light, making them almost invisible, so the glass surface looks and feels like normal glass. The company, which was founded in 2001, has been testing the material for the past four years and has applied for a patent. It has raised 18 million euros (16m) in venture capital to develop the product, which it will begin to market this year. ""You could apply the technology to an iPad screen and solve the problem of fingerprints,"" said Henk Huis in 't Veld, the company's chief executive. ""We are working with a couple of companies on this. I cannot disclose their names yet, but they are big international names."" The technology can be applied to the glass during its manufacture, by exposing it to a plasma of oxygen and aluminium and heating it up to around 300C. If the surface has already been made, it can be cleaned and the aluminium oxide is applied. The coating is only around 50 nanometres thick - about a hundred times thinner than a human hair. While the glass is being coated, the pressure is so high that the crystals are embedded in the glass, making the surface hard and scratch-resistant. The material has other uses, too. It can be used as an anti-reflection coating on solar panels, making them more efficient. It could also be used to coat windows and, eventually, windscreens. ""You could coat the windscreen on your car, for example, and that would make it water-resistant and scratch-resistant,"" said Dr Huis in 't Veld. ""You could also use it to coat glasses, so they would become scratch-resistant. We are also working on applications for mobile phones and other electronic devices."" The company is also working on a self-cleaning window. It is developing a coating that reacts to the UV in sunlight. When activated, it creates a super-hydrophilic surface - one that encourages water to spread out in a thin layer. When it rains, water rolls down the glass, taking dirt with it. ALD NanoSolutions is working with a Belgian glass manufacturer on the technology, and is hoping to bring it to market in the next 18 months.",0,95

"The PRI is set to win about 30, with the conservative National Action Party on about 22, said the head of the National Electoral Institute. On current projections, the PRI could not win the two-thirds majority that would allow it to change the constitution. Lopez Obrador's leftist coalition was set to win about 11 percent, but the former Mexico City mayor said he would not recognize the results. ""I'm not going to recognize any of these results,"" Lopez Obrador said as he cast his vote Sunday. ""They are not going to be legitimate."" Lopez Obrador, who was leading the polls for much of the year, lost the race by about half a percentage point in 2006. He refused to accept the results, claiming there had been fraud and staging massive protests. There was no indication of irregularities in Sunday's vote, but a survey showed 39 percent of Mexicans believe the election will be fraudulent. The PRI, which ruled Mexico from 1929 until 2000, and the right-wing National Action Party, or PAN, have been battling for the presidency. The PRI had been leading in polls since last year, but the PAN's Pena Nieto had been narrowing the gap. The PAN's candidate is the 45-year-old former governor of the state of Mexico, who's married to a telenovela star. He vows to continue the economic policies of the PAN, but his youth and glamorous marriage to TV starlet Angelica Rivera make him stand out from the party's past leaders. The PRI has presented Pena Nieto as the candidate of the past, a man who won't bring change and would protect corrupt PRI politicians still in power in many states. The PRI's candidate is Enrique Pena Nieto, 45, a telegenic former governor of the State of Mexico who's married to a telenovela star. He vows to continue the economic policies of the PAN, but his youth and glamorous marriage to TV starlet Angelica Rivera make him stand out from the party's past leaders. The PRI is presenting him as the candidate of the past, a man who won't bring change and would protect corrupt PRI politicians still in power in many states. The PRI held onto power in Mexico for seven decades through a combination of patronage and rigged elections. It lost the presidency to the PAN in 2000, but the party remains in control in a number of states. The party has been working to rehabilitate its image, but it's been dogged by allegations of corruption and vote buying. The party's presidential candidate, Josefina Vazquez Mota, is the first woman to run for a major party in a presidential race. The 51-year-old congresswoman and former cabinet official also would be Mexico's first female president. Vazquez Mota has tried to emphasize her experience, but the PAN's Institutional Revolutionary Party has hit her hard over allegations of plagiarism. Vazquez Mota has denied the accusations, but polls show them taking a toll on her support. Lopez Obrador, 58, was the front-runner in the polls until a few months ago, when he began slipping behind Pena Nieto. Lopez Obrador has run on vows to fight poverty and inequality in Mexico, a country that emerged from the recession with solid economic growth but where roughly half the population lives in poverty. The former mayor of Mexico City has pledged to increase pensions for the elderly and increase spending on social programs. Lopez Obrador also has vowed not to raise taxes or cut public salaries, and to increase support prices for corn and beans, a policy bound to appeal to Mexico's millions of subsistence farmers. Lopez Obrador is running at the head of a leftist coalition that includes the Labor Party and the smaller Social Encounter Party. The coalition's called the Progressive Movement, and it's presenting itself as the only group that can break the hold of the country's two main parties. This is the second presidential bid for Lopez Obrador, who narrowly lost the 2006 election. He claimed fraud, and led weeks of protest",0,100

The murder, filmed on CCTV, was broadcasted on Chinese state media, with the woman's family being granted a compensation of 4.45 million yuan (about 648,000). China has been battling the cult, which is known as the Church of Almighty God (CAG), since 1995. The group is known to have been founded by a woman who claimed to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. The group has been described as a doomsday cult, with its website outlining plans to take over the world in 2019. The CAG is notorious in China for targeting non-believers, and has been involved in over 300 cases of violence and murder since 2014, according to Chinese media reports. The group has also been accused of kidnapping and torturing individuals who have renounced their beliefs. The group was designated a ""cult"" and banned in China in 1995.",0,104

"Elisa Bianco said she had just months to live and Sally Retallack funded a PS2,500 final trip for the 22-year-old, London's Appeal Court heard. Bianco, of Station Road, Fowey, Cornwall, used the money to fund a high-flying lifestyle of holidays and dining out. The student was jailed for three years after admitting one count of fraud. Judge Nigel Lickley QC told her: ""I'm satisfied you were thoroughly dishonest."" The Appeal Court heard Miss Retallack, who runs a domestic agency, was ""extremely moved"" by Miss Bianco's story after meeting her at a Fowey hairdressers in October 2005. ""She was clearly very ill,"" Miss Retallack said. ""She looked very unwell. She told me she had a brain tumour and had only months to live. ""I was absolutely devastated. I felt extremely sorry for her. I wanted to help her. I said I would try and do something."" Miss Retallack raised the money through sponsorship from her work colleagues, friends and family. She gave Miss Bianco the cheque in February last year, as well as a PS100 Christmas present. But Miss Retallack was suspicious and discovered the girl was a liar.

"The mutation was also present in our evolutionary ""cousins"" - the Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it is not found in humans' closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. As early humans evolved, the mutation, which had a negative effect on the immune system, would have been weeded out. ""Normally, mutations that are bad for you die out. This one didn't and we wanted to know why,"" says Dr. Dustin Penn from the University of Vienna, one of the senior authors of the study. The researchers suggest that the answer lies in the increased risk of infectious diseases due to the high population densities and poor sanitation that were the hallmarks of early cities. ""When populations became dense, you had a higher chance of surviving infectious diseases, but only if you had the right immune response. As the Bronze Age progressed, it may have been like a long experiment in which the most beneficial immune versions survived,"" says Dr. Penn. The mutation, which is still present in people today, is involved in regulating inflammation. In some people, it leads to an overactive immune system that can increase the risk of heart disease and other disorders. However, the flip-side is that it can also protect against infection. ""This mutation is involved in our defence against bacteria, viruses or parasites. In the past, when you didn't have antibiotics, if you were able to control infection better, you had a better chance of surviving and passing on this immune response to your children. As a result, the mutation became more common in the population,"" says Dr. Penn. ""In the modern world, it's not very beneficial - it probably increases our risk for diseases that are related to chronic inflammation, like cardiovascular disease. But in the past, it might have been much more beneficial to have this mutation because it could help you deal with infection."" The genetic data used in this research comes from the 1000 Genomes Project. The researchers analyzed the genomes of 1077 people from 14 different populations. ""This is an exciting paper that shows the power of large-scale ancient DNA analysis,"" says Dr. Johannes Krause, a senior author of the study. ""We wanted to understand why this mutation was so common in people today and to do so we needed to rewind back to the past and see how it evolved."" The researchers' findings show that the mutation has been around for a long time and that it became more common as populations grew. It was only when humans reached high population densities in cities that it began to become a fixed part of the genome. ""I think it's interesting to consider that our immune response may have evolved in the direction of being very strong because it was advantageous to protect us against infections when we lived in close quarters with others,"" says Dr. Penn. ""We now live in a different environment, but our immune system hasn't changed very much, so now this same strong response can have detrimental effects."" More information: A.

"Guy Hedger, 61, died in the early hours of 30 April after intruders reportedly broke into his home in Ashley, near Ringwood, and opened fire with a shotgun. Marine officers were called to the scene at 3:02am. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The Old Bailey heard that Hedger, who was in a same-sex relationship with his partner of 18 years, Charlie Hedger-Cooper, was asleep when two men entered his bedroom and demanded to know where the safe was. ""The two defendants threatened him, grabbed him and shouted at him to tell them where his safe was,"" said the prosecutor, Brian O'Neill QC. ""They demanded the code for the safe. The safe was opened, a substantial amount of money was removed. Mr Hedger was then shot. ""The two defendants fled the scene, leaving Mr Hedger on the floor of his bedroom, fatally wounded."" Hedger-Cooper was asleep in another room in the house at the time, the court heard. It took police a week to arrest the pair. In that time the pair had been spotted in a BMW 330D at the Travelodge in Bournemouth at around 9:30pm on 30 April. They were also spotted on CCTV at a branch of Santander in the town centre at 11:45am on 1 May. The prosecutor said the pair had been captured on CCTV at the bank at the time of the crime. ""The two defendants are in the bank at the very same time as the 999 call made by Mr Hedger-Cooper,"" O'Neill told the court. Anthony Williams, 19, of Bournemouth, and a second 19-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, both deny murder. The court heard the killers had taken 20,000 from the safe as well as a computer and a Panasonic camera. Opening the case for the prosecution, O'Neill told the jury that the victim was a marketing manager for Aviva at the time of his death, having previously worked in the insurance industry for 30 years. He was a keen cyclist and a member of the Southampton Cycling Club. He had recently taken part in the London-to-Brighton bike ride in aid of the British Heart Foundation, raising more than 1,200. A postmortem examination found the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the face. ""This is a case where there was no need for a gun to be used, nor any suggestion that Mr Hedger was in any way a threat to the two defendants, who were both armed with shotguns,"" the prosecutor said. The jury was told that after the shooting, Williams and his accomplice, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were caught on CCTV at the bank in Ringwood. ""Both of the defendants were seen on CCTV in the bank at the very same time as the 999 call made by Mr Hedger-Cooper,"" O'Neill said. He told the jury they would hear the full 999 call made by Hedger-Cooper to the police. ""You will hear his anguished voice as he tries to tell the police what has happened,"" the prosecutor said. ""He is a man who has just found his partner of 18 years dead in their bedroom. A man who has been shot in the face."" The court was told that the two men were caught on CCTV at a branch of Santander in Bournemouth, where they attempted to withdraw a sum of money that had been taken from the safe. The jury was shown CCTV footage from the bank, taken at 11.45am on 1 May, showing Williams and his accomplice making the transaction. The court heard that the pair, who had been living in a tent in the New Forest, were arrested at a Travelodge in the town on 6 May, having booked into a room at the hotel at 1.21am the previous night. O'Neill said a search of their room revealed clothing, including gloves, which they had taken from Hedger's home, as well as a shotgun, ammunition and the Panasonic camera that had been taken from Hedger's home.",0,110
"The City Council wants to add an extra 700 spaces to the east of the Seacourt site, which currently has 794 spaces in an attempt to ease congestion. Proposals include the building of a new multi-storey car park or raising the height of existing ones.

The County Council in December 2017 announced its plans for a 11.5m plan to increase the capacity of the Seacourt PR site. These include plans for a new 3-storey car park with 700 extra spaces to be built in the area between the existing Seacourt car park and the railway line and they are also considering the option of doubling the height of the existing car park to provide extra spaces. The County Council is now consulting on these proposals and are looking for feedback on the three main options they are considering.

"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites now promote the illegal sale of the drugs, which can have dangerous side effects. The MHRA says some students are taking the ADHD drugs in the hope that they will help them to concentrate and stay awake for long periods of time. The use of these medicines is most common around the time of exams. Cases of the illegal sale and supply of the ADHD drugs have been on the increase over the past three years and figures show that 112 websites have been closed down by the MHRA since 2013. The use of the drugs is illegal and can have serious side effects. What are the side effects of the ADHD drugs? All medicines can cause side effects, but the ADHD drugs can have more serious side effects than most. Some of the side effects of the drugs can be deadly. For example, you can suffer a stroke if you take the drug. This can lead to brain damage or even death. If you do not have ADHD, you can suffer confusion and hallucinations if you take the drug. What are the symptoms of ADHD that the drugs are supposed to treat? People who suffer from ADHD may find that it is difficult for them to sit still, concentrate and pay attention for long periods of time. This can make it difficult for them to perform well in exam situations. The ADHD drugs can improve the concentration levels of someone with ADHD, but they will not help people who do not have ADHD.

"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, and to get young people on apprenticeships, only to have them crushed by the next political shift, or starved of funding. There has been a realignment of our political parties, with both the Greens and the Nationals now championing local food production and manufacturing, and the Liberals and Labor more open to trade liberalisation and the free market. The recent Productivity Commission inquiry into the workplace relations system has been another forum for advocacy for and against changes to the enterprise bargaining system, which is increasingly regarded as a barrier to employment. But one big change that is not often discussed is the pervasive influence of human rights ideas and the language of human rights on how we conceive of and discuss problems. The most influential ideas of the 20th century were the philosophical developments around human rights. The post-war human rights project was very simple and uncontroversial in the beginning, but has now developed into a complex and contested conceptual framework for public life. The idea was that, because human rights are universal, and are meant to protect each person from coercive state power, the human rights framework could be used to prevent or restrain the power of the state. This was a noble and historically important idea. It was a rejection of the totalitarianism that had been unleashed in the first half of the century. It was a rejection of the idea that the state could be a benevolent force that could create utopia. But the human rights framework has now become a complex and totalising social ideology, and, like all ideologies, it has a dark side. The dark side of the human rights ideology is that it sees any form of inequality or social difference as illegitimate. Because human rights are said to be universal, they are conceived of as a blanket constraint on the exercise of state power, and the power of other institutions, and as a way to promote equality and enforce uniformity. As the human rights framework has been pushed into every aspect of life, it has become increasingly difficult to talk about inequality or difference, and the legitimacy of our most important social institutions, such as the family, has been eroded. This human rights framework has come to be seen as a progressive, left-wing project, which overlaps with the idea that the state has an ever greater role in social and economic life, but the human rights idea is actually a rejection of both the individualist right and the collectivist left. It is a rejection of the individualist right, because it sees inequality as a form of oppression; and it is a rejection of the collectivist left, because it sees the state as oppressive. The big problem is that, because of the conceptual confusion created by the human rights idea, it is difficult to have any discussion about inequality or difference, or about the legitimacy of our institutions, without being seen as reactionary or oppressive. It is clear that a lack of engagement between the vocational education sector and employers is a big part of the problem. But when employers try to work with vocational education providers, they are sometimes told that what they are asking for is discriminatory. The human rights framework, which was originally a rejection of state coercion, is now used as a tool of state coercion, and a justification for more state power. It is not easy to see a way forward. The human rights framework will not go away. But I think we have to be aware of the conceptual framework we are using, and the unspoken assumptions behind it. The idea that all inequality and difference are illegitimate is a recipe for failure. The big challenge is to rethink our idea of what is good for individuals and society, and to reconsider the role of our institutions. We have to be able to talk about difference and inequality without being seen as reactionary or oppressive. This is a big task, but we should not be daunted by it. It is not impossible to challenge the human rights framework. The workplace relations system has been a crucible for challenging the human rights framework. The most basic democratic idea is that there should be different institutions in society, each with their own legitimate powers. These different institutions should not be subordinate to the state, but should be co-equal and independent. The human rights framework leads to a conceptual confusion about the workplace relations system, which is often seen as just another form of state power, and so a constraint on the power of the state is seen as il",0,123

"The Lord Advocate said he had informed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of his intention to quit the post after five years in the job. He said it had been a privilege to serve in Scotland's most senior law officer post and paid tribute to the ""professionalism, integrity and commitment"" of the Crown Office staff. Mr Wolffe, 59, will stand down on November 30, the Scottish Government confirmed. Mr Wolffe was appointed Lord Advocate in June 2016, a role he had previously held from 2007 to 2011. He was appointed to the bench in 2001 and was an appeal court judge from 2012 to 2016. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1982.

"Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian economy was in a much better condition. It said the board will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on April 8 to remove Ghosn as director. The company's CEO Hiroto Saikawa said on Monday that the partnership between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi ""remains unchanged"" despite the arrest of Ghosn in Japan. Speaking at the Tokyo Motor Show, Saikawa said that the alliance has been ""irreplaceable"" for Nissan but that it would try to minimize the impact from the scandal. ""Since the arrest of Ghosn, people inside Nissan have been in a state of shock, and cooperation among departments has been hindered,"" he said. Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and Renault, the three companies in the alliance, all showed electric cars and other futuristic concept vehicles at the motor show. Ghosn's arrest casts doubt over the future of the alliance, which he helped to forge. He has been credited with turning around Nissan from near-bankruptcy in 1999. Ghosn had been expected to continue in his role as CEO, but plans for a leadership change were already under discussion, Saikawa said. ""We need to really look back at what happened, take it seriously and take fundamental countermeasures,"" Saikawa said. He declined to be more specific about the case. He said he couldn't comment on whether other people had been involved in the misconduct. ""I don't think there is anyone in the company who was not shocked by this incident,"" Saikawa said, adding that it would take time to recover. ""This is a negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn,"" he said. ""It's been 19 years. This is an achievement in a way, but it's the negative outcome of having a regime for a long time."" Ghosn has not been able to defend himself publicly since he was arrested last week. Nissan has said it uncovered years of wrongdoing by Ghosn, with the help of an internal whistleblower. Nissan said Monday that it was creating a special committee to beef up its governance in the wake of Ghosn's arrest.",0,126
"The Public Health Wales study looks at adverse experiences in childhood (ACEs) which include parents separating. Children with four or more ACEs, around 14, are three times more likely to be in care than those with no ACEs. ACEs are traumatic events that a child or young person may experience in their childhood. ACEs have a serious impact on the health of the child, often leading to poor physical and mental health in adulthood. The Public Health Wales report ""Adverse Childhood Experiences and their impact on health-harming behaviours in the Welsh adult population 2013"" shows that the more ACEs an individual has experienced, the more likely they are to have poor physical and mental health in adulthood. The Welsh Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study was carried out by Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government in 2015. It asked people about their experiences of childhood trauma. The findings show that adverse experiences in childhood, like abuse or neglect, have a lifelong impact on people's health and wellbeing. The survey found that one in seven of the 3,300 adults who were asked about their ACEs had experienced four or more of them as children. It showed that the more ACEs a person had, the more likely they were to have a wide range of negative health outcomes, including problems with mental health, violence, and substance use.",0,127
"Diana Sacayan, a well-known activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, was found dead in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. It is the third violent transgender death in the city in the last six months. Sacayan, 40, was found at a hostel in the Almagro neighborhood at 11:50 a.m., according to the city's state prosecutor's office. Police said there was no sign of forced entry, and that it appeared she had died from a drug overdose. Sacayan was a well-known LGBT rights activist and former president of the Buenos Aires Transvestite, Transsexual and Transgender Association (ATTTA). Last year she became the first openly transgender person to be appointed to a cabinet position in Argentina when she was named secretary for transvestite, transsexual and transgender affairs in the Ministry of Social Development. The appointment was part of a push to get transgender people to participate in politics, said Sergio Sanchez, an ATTTA spokesman. ""We've got to create a space for our community in politics, so that we can influence public policies in our favor,"" he told the Herald at the time. According to Sanchez, Sacayan's death should not be considered a suicide, because there was no suicide note, and the cause of death is still unknown. Sacayan was one of three transgender people found dead in the city in the last six months. ""The violent deaths of transgender people in Argentina represent a serious concern for human rights organizations,"" said Mauro Cabral, director of the Global Action for Trans Equality, in a statement Tuesday. Buenos Aires City legislator Daniel Lipovetzky also reacted to the death, asking police to investigate the case and to provide a comprehensive report to the city legislature. ""The violent death of a transgender person should be considered a hate crime and be investigated as such,"" Lipovetzky said. In 2011, Argentina passed a law to allow people to change the gender on their identity card. ""We are very worried because transgender women are being killed in Argentina at a rate of one every 23 days,"" Cabral said. ""It is urgent to start an investigation about the reasons behind these deaths, and to stop the murders of transgender women, most of whom are black or of mixed-race,"" he said. These murders, he said, ""are part of a global context in which violence against transgender people is increasing, and the numbers in Argentina are among the highest in the world."" According to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which monitors reports of transgender people killed around the world, 1,612 people were murdered between 2008 and 2014.",0,128
"A report commissioned by Food Standards Scotland found that in-store promotions were heavily weighted in favour of food with high levels of salt or sugar. The Stirling University academics behind the research recommended a ban on multi-buy offers and promotions on unhealthy foods and drinks in shops and supermarkets. We have long called for action on promotions of unhealthy foods in supermarkets and convenience stores. In 2013, we worked with the Food Foundation on a report which showed that unhealthy foods and drinks are the most price-promoted food categories in the UK. We found that just 2.5 of products were on promotion in 2013 - but these accounted for 40 of all sales. This report found that promotions on unhealthy foods in supermarkets and other stores can increase purchasing by up to 30 compared to standard prices. A recent report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research for the Food Foundation showed that the majority of UK consumers support measures to restrict price promotions of unhealthy foods and drinks and replace them with promotions on healthier products. In 2015, the Government committed to ""consider action to end buy-one-get-one-free and other multi-buy promotions of food and drink that is high in fat, sugar and salt."" This was part of the Government's response to the first chapter of the Childhood Obesity Strategy, which focused on promotions and marketing of unhealthy foods.

"Jason Van Dyke was heckled as he arrived at court where he denied six counts of first-degree murder. Video released earlier this year showing the shooting of Laquan McDonald sparked protests and calls for the city's police chief to quit. McDonald was armed with a knife but it was not raised when he was shot 16 times. The graphic video was only released after a judge ordered the footage to be made public. It shows the teenager walking away from police officers when he is shot, prompting questions from his family about why deadly force was used. The teenager's family has called for a murder conviction for the 37-year-old officer, who was released on bail. ""Today we made a crucial step on the road to justice,"" said Marvin Hunter, McDonald's great-uncle. ""We have a long way to go, but today was a victory."" The video released in November appears to contradict official police statements at the time that the black teenager had lunged at police officers with a knife before he was shot. Officer Van Dyke was arrested last month after a grand jury found enough evidence to warrant a murder charge. The graphic video was released by city officials a day before the footage was due to be made public by a judge. The release of the footage led to protests in the city and calls for the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who was sacked by Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ""McCarthy himself bore responsibility,"" Mr Emanuel said in a statement at the time. ""I'm grateful to him for his service,"" the mayor said.

"Sharnford Traffic Action Group (STAG) said some motorists were clocked at ""eye watering"" speeds topping 100mph. It has campaigned against dangerous driving on Aston Lane and the B4114 in Leicestershire. The group, which has raised more than 10,000 to pay for speed watch volunteers, said 144 drivers had been caught going too fast, but that only four had been prosecuted. It said many were avoiding detection by using agricultural lanes or rat runs to get to the M69. ""Those lanes are not suitable for a 40-tonne lorry at 80mph, never mind a car going 100mph plus,"" said spokesman Mike Biltcliffe. The group said it hoped the police's new ""section 172"" powers would help to ""put a stop to these dangerous, anti-social and selfish drivers who think they are above the law."" Leicestershire Police said the new powers allowed officers to request details of the identity of a driver from registered keepers of vehicles where they had been detected committing a speeding offence. ""This is an excellent tool for targeting the small minority of people who believe they are above the law by flouting the speed limits,"" said Sergeant Dan Eveleigh. ""If someone is caught speeding, we will be writing to them to ask them who was driving the vehicle at the time, and if we do not get a reply we will prosecute them for failing to provide that information."" Insp Jenny Coates, from the force's safer roads team, said the force used mobile speed cameras to target speeding drivers. She added: ""It is very disappointing to hear that there are drivers who are travelling at speeds of more than 100mph on country roads. ""This is simply too fast and they are putting themselves and other road users at risk.""",0,132

We've all seen it hanging on the wall, but we never thought it would be worth much. I always thought it would be a shame for it to go abroad. It's got to be kept in Wales."" The flag, which will be auctioned at Bonhams in London on April 23, was brought back from Tahiti by the Reverend John Williams, a 19th-century missionary who was killed and eaten by cannibals. It was given to his grandfather, also named John Williams, by his father, William, who was a missionary in the South Seas. ""It is an important document of the 19th century,"" said Katherine Schofield, textile specialist at Bonhams. ""It shows how important religion was to people at the time. They were very determined to convert people to Christianity, and they were very patriotic, too. ""The Union Flag is the most important symbol of Britain.

Celtic boss Neil Lennon condemned the incident and urged the club's supporters to behave responsibly. ""It's a bit of a sore one for us because it's obviously the supporters of ours,"" he said. ""I would appeal to them, and we will certainly be working with the club, to cut that sort of stuff out because it's not fair, really. ""There's a lot of people who have worked very hard to build a good atmosphere in the stadium and it's a little bit of a blot on the landscape for the club, so we're not very happy about it, to be honest. ""I would appeal to our own support to behave and cut this sort of nonsense out. ""We don't want it and it's dangerous for other supporters, as well.""

"The Murrayfield side are seventh in the table and face a difficult run-in as they seek a top-four finish. ""We have five huge games coming up and I think we'll have to win them all to get in the top four."" ""The run-in is tough,"" the Scotland head coach said. ""The fact is we've got five tough games left and we'll need to win them all to get into the play-offs."" ""We have to do our best to get into that top four, but also make sure we do our job."" ""We have to get into the top four, it would be great to get there but if not, we need to be competing in the European Cup."" ""I don't think anybody should be looking at anything other than the five games in front of us."" Munster head coach Johann van Graan was disappointed with the performance of his side, but did praise them for their fight in the second half. ""We did what we had to do to get a win, and that's what we'll be looking to do from here on in."" The South African said: ""We came here to win, we weren't coming to draw."" ""I think we've been in every game, we've played some good rugby and been a bit unlucky here and there."" ""I think the best way to put that to bed is to move on and we've got three big games now before the play-offs."" ""We knew that Edinburgh would be a tough side to beat at home, we've done that."" Munster captain Peter O'Mahony said that his side's second half performance was not good enough, and they will have to be better against Zebre on Saturday. ""We have to be more clinical and, if we get that opportunity to score, we have to score, because the conditions, playing against 14 men, we should have had a bonus point out of it."" ""We played well in the first half, a couple of things didn't go our way but they were more clinical than us."" ""It was hard to get into that game when we had 14 men on the field."" ""But the most important thing is that we are still in there fighting,"" he said. ""We're not going to give up.""

The drone carried a flag of the separatist movement in the region of Catalonia.

"Prime Minister David Cameron announced the deal as he started a Jamaica visit. The project has been agreed to break the deadlock in negotiations over a prisoner transfer deal between the two countries. David Cameron has announced a 25 million prison reform package for Jamaica as he arrived in the Caribbean nation to start a three-day visit. The project has been agreed to break the deadlock in negotiations over a prisoner transfer deal between the two countries, which has been held up by Jamaica's lack of modern facilities to replace its 19th century prisons. He will make a keynote speech in Kingston later in which he will urge all Caribbean nations to end the ""utterly indefensible"" practice of banning homosexuality. Mr Cameron is to visit Jamaica today and Trinidad and Tobago tomorrow before ending his tour at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Perth, Australia. The Prime Minister is expected to face tough questions from Caribbean leaders after his government's decision to deport a number of Caribbean-born people who arrived in the UK as children and have spent most of their lives in Britain. Mr Cameron is to hold a bilateral meeting with Jamaican prime minister Bruce Golding and hold a joint press conference. Later he will deliver a keynote speech on the future of the Commonwealth in which he is expected to say the ban on homosexuality in many Caribbean countries must be lifted. The UK will provide 25 million over four years to help Jamaica build a 1,500-place prison to replace the ageing and overcrowded Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre in Kingston. The deal is expected to lead to the transfer of 300 prisoners - including many Jamaican nationals - from jails in Britain to serve their sentences on the Caribbean island. But Jamaica's gay rights campaigners have warned the PM not to ""lecture"" Caribbean leaders. Lindy Rodney of Jamaica's gay rights group, J-Flag, said she was ""apprehensive"" about Mr Cameron's trip. ""I'm apprehensive because I don't know how he will address the issue,"" she said. Homosexuality is illegal in Jamaica and is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison. Ahead of his visit, Mr Cameron said: ""The Caribbean has the highest murder rate in the world and serious and organised crime is having a chilling effect on investment and tourism.",0,147

"Jamie Spendiff's attack on Craig Logie, who was out with friends on a stag night, was captured on CCTV. Spendiff took part in a further assault on other men with a machete. Jailed: Jamie Spendiff. Picture: Contributed A man who brutally kicked an innocent stranger to the head as he lay unconscious in the street has been jailed for four years. The victim was left with life-changing injuries after Jamie Spendiff attacked him in the early hours of the morning. The 28-year-old kicked Craig Logie in the face after he had fallen unconscious during a brawl outside a fast food restaurant. Mr Logie, who was out with friends on a stag night, was captured on CCTV as he tried to get up to his feet after the attack. The victim, who works as a personal trainer, was rushed to hospital and was later diagnosed with a bleed on the brain, a fractured skull, eye socket and cheekbone. Spendiff, who has 23 previous convictions, later went on to take part in a further assault on other men with a machete. He has now been jailed for four years for the attack on Mr Logie, which happened near McDonald's on Leith Walk, Edinburgh on May 18 last year. Spendiff had denied the attack but was convicted by majority verdict following a trial at the city's Sheriff Court. Sheriff Frank Crowe told him: ""The court has taken into account the serious injuries caused to the complainer and the impact that it has had on him and his family."" Earlier prosecutor Cheryl Clark said Mr Logie, who was 25 at the time of the incident, had been out in the city centre with friends. She said: ""He had been on a stag night and had consumed some alcohol that evening. ""They decided to get some food and travelled to the McDonald's on Leith Walk, where they were waiting for their food when they saw another group of men at the counter. ""They didn't pay them any attention, but they were then approached by the accused, who swore at them. ""The complainer tried to calm him down, but the accused continued to swear and was aggressive. ""It was clear he had a weapon, a machete, which he took from inside his jacket. ""He swung it at the complainer, who put his hands up to protect himself and managed to grab the machete. ""As he was doing so he was struck to the face by the accused. ""He fell to the ground and the accused continued to strike him on the head, causing him to lose consciousness. ""The accused then stabbed the complainer's friend to the leg. ""As the complainer lay on the ground unconscious, the accused approached him and kicked him to the head."" She said Mr Logie was eventually helped up by friends, who took him to the nearby Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The court heard that the victim has been left with life-changing injuries as a result of the attack and has been unable to return to work. In a victim impact statement, Mr Logie said: ""I used to work as a personal trainer and I have lost my confidence as a result of my injuries. ""I find it difficult to focus and often feel dizzy and sick. ""I have been unable to return to work and I am worried I will not be able to return."" He told how he has been left with a scar on his cheek from the attack. The court heard that Spendiff, of Edinburgh, went on to take part in another incident where men were attacked with a machete. Ms Clark said: ""The accused was detained by police on August 12, 2018. ""He was taken to a police station and was interviewed in relation to both incidents.

"The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their accommodation and the training exercises they had to undertake, but it was not the first time such an incident had taken place. Mutinies in the British Army during the First World War were not unheard of. There were a number of small-scale mutinies at the front, but also some larger ones. These incidents were rarely reported, however, because of the censorship of the press. The 1918 mutiny by the 14th Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment in Calais, for example, was not reported at the time. According to the account of one of the men, Albert Rochester, they had not had a rest since the beginning of the war and were often fed up with the monotony of their diet and the conditions they had to put up with. Another major mutiny in 1917 was of the 29th Division in Etaples, near Boulogne. Some 1,000 soldiers were involved. By 1918, the majority of men in the army had been in uniform for three or four years, and the strains of war were beginning to show. There was a huge demand for manpower on the Western Front, and this meant that it was not possible to grant leave to all those who wanted it, which further contributed to the men's discontent. The mutiny by the 14th Battalion was not the only one that took place in Calais. The 14th Battalion of the King's Own (Yorkshire Light Infantry) also mutinied in September 1917. The mutiny began when an orderly officer came to tell the men of the battalion that they were to go out on fatigue duty. The men refused to go. He then told them that if they did not go they would be court martialled. At this, the men stood up, turned their backs to the officer and started singing 'Keep the home fires burning'. The following morning, the men still refused to go on fatigue duty, and the commanding officer of the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel R.J.H. Cain, came out to speak to them. The men told him that they were not going to work as they did not want to have to do any more fatigue duties. A court martial was convened and the ringleaders, two Corporals and a Sergeant, were sentenced to one year's penal servitude. The mutiny by the 14th Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment in 1918 is usually considered to be the last major mutiny during the First World War. The battalion had been in France since February 1917 and had been involved in several battles on the Western Front, including Messines. In the summer of 1918, the battalion was sent back to England to rest and refit. On 14 September, the battalion left Southampton, arriving in Calais on the 15th. A fortnight later, the battalion was ordered to move to the front line. The men were unhappy about this, as they had not been granted home leave. Before the men were due to leave, there was a rumour that some of the men had written a petition to the King, asking for leave to be granted. As a result, the battalion was ordered to fall in on the parade ground. As they stood on the parade ground, the men were ordered to stand at ease. They refused to do so. They were then ordered to stand to attention. This they also refused to do. The men were ordered to fall out and go to the guard room. When they did not do so, the order was repeated. The men still refused to obey the order, so the battalion was marched back to its billets. The following day, the men were again ordered to fall in. They once again refused to do so. As a result, the battalion was ordered to stand to attention on the parade ground. The men still refused to do so. Some of the men were sent back to their billets, but the ringleaders were arrested. The following day, some of the men were sent to other battalions, while some were given three days' field punishment. The battalion returned to England in October 1918 and was disbanded in January 1919.",0,153
"Wales international Huws, 23, is a Manchester City academy graduate. Samuel, 22, came through the ranks at Reading and has two goals in 16 senior appearances for the Championship side. Boss Marco Silva had been keen to bring in new faces to bolster his squad after an injury to Richarlison and the suspension of captain Phil Jagielka. ""We're pleased to welcome two young players to our club,"" Silva said.

""We believe working here with our first team staff will give them the opportunity to grow and prove their worth."" Everton host Cardiff City in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30 GMT). Everton boss Marco Silva has been linked with a move for a striker in the January transfer window and Southampton's Charlie Austin is one player being mentioned. The 29-year-old, who has scored six goals in 19 league appearances this season, has struggled with injury this term and has not played for Saints since suffering a hamstring problem in December. Everton are looking to strengthen their attacking options after losing Richarlison to a three-game suspension, while Yannick Bolasie has joined Aston Villa on loan. The BBC's Simon Stone says there are doubts over a deal for Austin because of his fitness concerns. Everton have joined the race to sign West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool and Manchester United. The Toffees are believed to be weighing up a summer move for the 19-year-old, who has represented England and Ireland at youth level. Rice has made 23 appearances for the Hammers this season, but is yet to sign a new contract with his current deal set to expire in 2020. Everton could be set to make a move for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool and Manchester United. Rice has made 23 appearances for the Hammers this season, but is yet to sign a new contract with his current deal expiring in 2020. Celtic have made an enquiry about signing Everton's 17-year-old forward Fraser Hornby on loan for the rest of the season. Hornby scored 14 goals in 15 games for Everton's U18 side last season and netted six times for the U23s this term. He has been linked with a 2m move to Leeds United, whose former Everton manager Paul Heckingbottom was a regular spectator at the youngster's U23 games. Celtic are also looking to sign Scott Allan from Hibernian and Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna. Everton have sent scouts to watch Porto striker Moussa Marega, according to Sky sources. The Toffees have been keeping an eye on the 27-year-old, who has scored 15 goals this season in the Portuguese top flight, and was part of the Malian side that made it to the semi-finals of the African Nations Cup in January. Everton have been heavily linked with a move for Richarlison's former Watford team-mate Abdoulaye Doucoure, and now Sky sources understand the Frenchman has asked to leave the Hornets.

"Not sure what we're on about? Australia has run through a slew of prime ministers in recent years and is holding a federal election on 2 July. You can read our explainer here. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd is not running in the election, but is campaigning for Labor in the Brisbane area and nationally. Rudd says it was the idea of his former chief of staff, Amanda Lampe, who is now Labor's national secretary, to run a campaign focused on climate change. ""It was her idea, in fact,"" Rudd told HuffPost Australia. ""She just put it to me, 'Look, we've got to do something different this time. We've got to try and get through to the folks out there, and this is the best way to do it. Rudd was prime minister during the 2010 election, which saw a huge swing against Labor amid fears of a carbon tax. Now, as Labor opposes the government's carbon tax repeal, Rudd is trying to change the narrative on climate change. The video is a departure from the negative, personal campaigning that has been the hallmark of the election so far. ""We've had a lot of muckraking, a lot of personal stuff that's gone on,"" Rudd said. ""We've decided to try and lift the discourse in the campaign. I think the Australian people are pretty sick and tired of the muckraking stuff."" The video has a clear target audience: young voters. Rudd said the video was aimed at a ""younger audience, particularly 18 to 35, where we're trying to break through to them on the issue of climate change and the long-term future of the planet."" Lampe told HuffPost Australia that the video is ""a way of connecting with people in a language that's familiar to them."" ""We're using a format that's very popular with young people to try and engage them in the policy debate,"" she said. Lampe said the idea of a rap video came from the younger staff in the campaign office. ""Our younger staff had the idea of a hip-hop video, and I was very keen to do it,"" she said. ""I wanted us to be able to use a popular format to engage with people in a new and different way."" Lampe said she had spoken to Rudd about the video, and he was ""very excited about the idea."" The rap video has been the subject of much discussion on social media, and Rudd said the response has been ""amazing."" ""I've been quite surprised at the reaction,"" he said. ""It's gone viral, in the proper sense of the word, and people seem to like it."" Rudd said the video had even attracted attention from overseas. ""There's a particular American audience who've picked it up,"" he said. ""It's gone ballistic in the US. I've had phone calls and text messages from people in the US saying, 'You're all over the internet. The Americans are all talking about it. The video's release comes as the Coalition government struggles to deal with the fallout from a government-backed campaign against Labor's climate change policies, featuring former Labor leader John Howard. The Liberal Party has been trying to distance itself from the ""Ditch the Witchstyle campaign, which was created by a group of Liberal Party volunteers. Lampe said the video was not created in response to the ""ditch the witch"" campaign, but it was a ""very unfortunate campaign that the Liberal Party is now trying to walk away from."" ""It's unfortunate that they're running a campaign based on personal attacks and misinformation,"" she said. Lampe said the Coalition had ""form"" on ""very nasty campaigns"" aimed at Labor women. ""They've done it to Julia Gillard, they've done it to Tanya Plibersek, and they're doing it to Bill Shorten,"" she said. Rudd's video has attracted widespread attention and a huge amount of social media discussion. It has also been the subject of a number of remixes, and Rudd said he would be happy to see more. ""I think we're going to see more of this stuff emerge over time,"" he said. ""It's not something I've been involved in, but I think it's a reflection of the nature of social media.

"As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday. Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that had been done. The firm had said it would build a new 180m plant if it was successful in securing the work. The contract to provide the rails for the line was awarded to Celsa in March, but later delayed. AMs were also told that Celsa could provide the steel for 10,000 tonnes of rail. And in a letter to Mr Roberts, the Economy Secretary Ken Skates asked for assurances the firm had the ability to supply the steel required, given that it had not met a deadline to build the new saw line. He asked for confirmation that the plant would be built and an assurance that the firm had the ""capacity, capability and supply chain to produce the steel rails and deliver the contract."" In response, Mr Roberts told AMs that the company was ""ready to deliver"" and could meet the deadline for the contract, which would begin in October 2019. He said he was ""confident"" the saw line would be completed by the end of the year, with the rails being supplied from the firm's Spanish mill. Mr Roberts said the saw line would be built in Newport or Cardiff. In 2016, the Welsh Government provided a 36m loan to Celsa for its new plant. It has also provided grants of 1.7m, while a further 45m loan was approved in April. The firm, which employs 1,400 people in the UK, had been expected to start work on the new plant in September 2017. But Mr Skates told AMs it was ""indefinitely postponed"" after a fire at the firm's Spanish plant. Conservative AM Russell George said there were ""more questions than answers"" over the deal, and the Welsh Government had ""failed to deliver."" He claimed Celsa had ""already missed two deadlines"" and asked if Mr Skates would be seeking repayment of the loan. But Mr Roberts said the company's other UK plants were ""performing to plan,"" with the firm ""continuing to invest and expand"" in the UK. Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price claimed the Welsh Government had ""rolled over"" and said he was ""astonished"" at how the situation had been allowed to develop. But Mr Roberts said the government had been ""proactive"" and had ""created a great opportunity for Wales."" He added: ""This is a hugely successful company and we are happy to support them. ""There is nothing negative about this, this is a good news story for Wales. Responding to the letter from Mr Skates, Mr Roberts said the Welsh Government had been ""fully aware"" of the fire at the Spanish plant and how it had affected the firm. He said the Welsh Government had ""worked constructively and collaboratively"" with the firm, which was ""still very committed to Wales."" Mr Roberts said the firm had ""never reneged"" on its commitments to Wales, and the government was ""not planning to take action against Celsa.""",0,157
"It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about math, not emotion, and the arithmetic was clear: the Right and the Orthodox had together garnered 65 seats, while the Left and the Arabs had won a mere 55. The first Right-wing government in Israel's history had been born. It was also the first government in the country's history to be the fruit of a direct election between two opposing national leaders. For the first time, Israelis had voted not simply for the party of their choice but for the head of that party. And with Netanyahu standing at the head of the Likud's electoral list, and Labor's Yitzhak Rabin at the top of his party's list, the vote had been unmistakably for Netanyahu. At the same time, the election was a huge personal success for Netanyahu. The Likud under him had more than doubled its strength in the Knesset, winning thirty seats to Labor's twenty-four. In the process, Netanyahu had become the country's most popular politician, overturning a long-standing tradition of deference to the founding generation of Labor. But the job of prime minister had eluded him. His attempt to put together a broad right-wing government had failed, and the results had handed Rabin the premiership. The truth was that Netanyahu was nowhere near to being a household name when the elections to the Thirteenth Knesset were announced. He was simply a young, ambitious politician with a taste for controversy and the ability to create a buzz in the media. It was the 1992 elections that catapulted him into the national limelight. The Israeli electoral system is unorthodox, to say the least. The country's 120-seat Knesset is elected once every four years by a single national constituency. Seats are allocated proportionally according to each party's percentage of the total vote. The number of candidates within each party who win a seat is determined by the percentage of votes won and the order of the candidates on the party's list. The head of the party that has won the largest number of seats is automatically invited by the president to form a new government. In Israel, this process is called ""national elections."" In 1992, Netanyahu was a thirty-three-year-old Likud backbencher. He had been in the Knesset for six years and had a relatively unremarkable career behind him. His family had immigrated to Israel from Philadelphia in 1967, when he was eighteen. His father, Benzion Netanyahu, was a renowned professor of medieval history. His mother, Tzila, was a trained graphic artist. He was born in 1949 and had lived in Israel for most of his life. In 1972, he married his first wife, Miriam Weizmann, who was from the same area of Jerusalem as he was. Her father, an eminent gynecologist, had been one of Israel's leading experts on venereal disease. But in 1972, he was already a senile old man. Netanyahu's first child, Yair, was born in 1976, and his second, Avner, in 1978. For a while, the Netanyahus lived in a modest apartment in the Jerusalem suburb of Givat Ze'ev. Netanyahu had studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was active in the campus Likud organization and was known as a strong debater. It was said that he used to arrange his lectures so that they did not clash with those of the leading campus left-wingers, enabling him to attend their lectures and challenge their arguments. He completed his studies in 1975, but was unable to find work as an economist. Instead, he found employment in the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem. It was a job that he came to loathe. He was also anxious to move to the center of the country. In 1976, Netanyahu took an exam to become an Israeli diplomat and was accepted. In 1978, his first wife, Miriam, died of cancer. The following year, he married Fleur Cates, a British woman whom he had met in London while he was serving in the Israeli embassy",0,158
"The UK must go further to ensure those settling learn English ""so they can be more integrated into our country."" Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said ""it is not acceptable"" that there are 190,000 people in the country who ""can't even speak a basic level of English."" He said the Government was introducing a range of measures to tackle the problem, including a new language test for those applying for spousal visas, so they can join their partners in the UK. Mr Cameron was responding to a question by Labour's Keith Vaz, who said the Government's plans were ""a major step in the right direction."" The Government is also ""requiring those seeking to extend their stay to have a minimum standard of English"" and extending the requirement to those applying for permanent settlement, the Prime Minister said. Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ""This is a major step in the right direction. The ability to speak English is essential to integrating into the UK and is key to ensuring that immigrants can contribute to our economy. The Government's proposals will make sure that all new immigrants will have a basic level of English from the outset.""",0,159
"As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will always be one in particular that will remain with him. Ron, now 92, was a Royal Artillery gunner when he was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany in 1945. His job was to help remove the dead bodies and burn them on bonfires. ""I'll never forget my first sight of the camp,"" Ron recalled. ""It was indescribable. There were bodies everywhere, just piled up. The smell was horrendous. We were given petrol-soaked rags to hold in front of our faces to try and block the stench out. ""There were also little children who hadn't died yet, but there was nothing we could do for them. It was absolutely terrible."" Ron, who was 21 at the time, was there for a few days. ""It was the worst thing I saw in the whole war,"" he said. ""It was hell on earth. It was horrendous, I had never seen anything like it and I'll never forget it. It was dreadful."" More than 70,000 prisoners died at Bergen-Belsen, where Nazi guards evacuated the camp just weeks before the Allies arrived, leaving the remaining prisoners to die of starvation, disease and exhaustion. Ron said: ""I was there just to get the bodies out of the way. ""It was the most horrific thing I have ever seen in my life. ""I don't talk about it much because I don't want to, but Holocaust Memorial Day is an important day to remember what happened. ""We must never forget."" Ron, who has four children, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, worked as a dock labourer after the war and is a member of the Royal British Legion. He is still active, getting involved in community events in Newport, where he has lived for 50 years, and also makes regular trips to the gym.",0,160
"Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane. About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's 2017 brochure, including a six-day trip to the famous Chiang Mai zoo in Thailand that costs 787. The company said it was also ""carefully reviewing"" another dozen tours to establish whether they are ""ethical and positive for the animals involved."" A typical zoo-themed trip involves a visit to a wildlife sanctuary or national park. They are a popular feature of holiday itineraries in Asia, where companies such as Explore Worldwide, and G Adventures, offer trips to national parks and sanctuaries, including the world-famous Tiger Temple in Thailand. The tours often include a visit to a sanctuary to see how the animals are cared for and then a chance to feed or pet them. Many travellers are increasingly concerned that elephant parks, sanctuaries and other animal attractions - particularly in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos - are abusive and are turning their backs on elephant rides, animal circuses and visits to zoos. In the UK, tour operators are adapting to the change in demand. Responsible Travel says its decision was partly influenced by the TV series ""Blackfish,"" a documentary about SeaWorld, which was broadcast in the US and the UK in 2013. The film shows how captive orcas become psychologically damaged and hurt or even kill their handlers. Steve Reid, the co-founder and marketing director of Responsible Travel, said the firm had a policy of never promoting ""sea parks or the like"" and that its decision was based on ""considerations of animal welfare."" In June, an investigation by the charity World Animal Protection revealed that more than 100,000 wild animals are being held in captivity in Thailand, with many being subjected to cruel treatment. It found that some tourists were abusing animals for entertainment and selfies. More than half the tourists surveyed admitted to taking a selfie with a wild animal. The charity, which monitors animal welfare in the tourism industry, said: ""Travellers and tour operators must think carefully about the activities they engage with abroad.",0,161
"Radical preachers will be banned from posting material online and anyone with convictions for extremist activity will be barred from working with children. Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for terrorists released from jail on licence. So, if you are a preacher, radical or not, and you are preaching peace, you will still be barred from speaking or publishing. What's really radical is banning people who have been convicted of terrorism from working with children. Why are they out of prison if they are a danger to children? The headline reads like a threat from a mobster, ""make sure your children know the correct history or they won't get a job."" I'm not sure I agree with the approach of telling people what is and isn't ""British""; I think you can have a free society where people believe what they like and still all coexist. That said, I think the government have a point about teaching children about British values. I think it's very important that children are taught that being British is a bad thing. For years, we've had governments, usually Labour, telling us that being British is a bad thing. Being proud of Britain is a bad thing, being proud of British history is a bad thing. When I was at school, we were taught that Britain was an awful place because of our history of slavery. Now, I don't deny that Britain had a role in the slave trade, but when I studied history later, I found out that nearly everyone was involved in the slave trade. Britain was by no means the only or biggest slave trader, yet that is what we were taught at school. Slavery has been around for thousands of years, and was only abolished in the 19th century. So it took Britain less than 200 years to abolish slavery. Meanwhile, there are still slaves in Africa today. I think we should teach children about British history and British values so that they can understand what makes Britain a great country, and the world a better place. I think we should teach children about British history and British values so that they can understand how great Britain once was, and how we can get back to being a great country again. We can start by electing a party that believes in Britain, and will take us out of the EU. And we can end by electing a Prime Minister who will take Britain forward and make it great again. Are you a patriotic Brit? Do you agree that it's time we stopped bashing Britain, and started being proud of it again? If you want to have a say in making Britain great again, join the Libertarian Party today. This entry was posted in News, Opinion and tagged Conservative Party, Elections, UKIP by AJ.

"Venera Minakhmetova died when she was struck by lorry at Bow Roundabout, on Wednesday. The Russian, who had been on the Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) just before the collision, was the fifth cyclist to die in London this year. The death of Ms Minakhmetova, who was 24, sparked protests at the Bow Roundabout yesterday, with cyclists blocking traffic in both directions. The protesters have called for a safer redesign of the roundabout, which is currently used by 10,000 cyclists every day. Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said: ""My deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of this young woman. We will do everything possible to establish what happened and prevent further tragedies in future. ""There is clearly more that can be done to improve the superhighways, and we will be looking to see what measures could be put in place to make them safer."" Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, who is campaigning to make the roads safer for cyclists, said: ""There is no way of making the roads safe for cyclists. There are more and more cyclists on the road, yet the number of cycling accidents is increasing. ""Everyone has the right to feel safe when they're going to work and returning home. ""Cyclists have as much right to be on the road as any other road user. The time for action is now."" A TfL spokesman said: ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the cyclist's family and friends at this very difficult time.

"Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute, failed to return from a plant-hunting trip to the northern mountainous area. He has not been seen since 2 November, when his rucksack and some personal effects were found by a stream. He was last seen heading for Shaksgam village in the mountains of Xinjiang. Friends and family are mounting a rescue operation in a bid to find him. Taggart, 33, a landscape gardener, had told friends he wanted to visit the village to get a guide to take him to the village of Shimshal, home of his hero, the explorer Eric Shipton. He had planned to follow in the footsteps of Shipton, who explored the area in the 1930s. Taggart's sister, Claire, said her brother, who is a keen climber, had been in the region for a month and was well prepared. ""He is not the type of person to get lost,"" she said. ""We are really concerned about him."" The Foreign Office said a consular official had met the family and given them advice on how to organise the search. It said: ""We remain in contact with Mr Taggart's family and are providing consular assistance."" Taggart's family and friends have raised 1,000 to pay for a search party and are trying to raise more. ""We have a very short window of opportunity to find Jamie,"" Claire said. ""We are not people who usually ask for help, but Jamie would do anything to help us. We know that it is only a matter of time before he will need us to help him. We are appealing to the mountaineering community to get involved, or anyone who might be able to help."" Xinjiang borders Tibet, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. It is a hot and dry desert region with dramatic peaks. The Chinese government claims a large swath of territory, which has never been ruled by Beijing. The Karakorum mountains are home to some of the world's tallest peaks. Taggart is a keen climber and skier. In July, he made a solo expedition to the North Pole. He is reported to have suffered frostbite and was unable to find a radio signal to tell his family of his progress. He has climbed Everest and in 2004 completed a solo trek across Greenland.",0,164
"In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra PS84m annually. Economist Gillian Paull said she was surprised the estimate was so low. The Welsh Government has said it will provide free childcare for working parents for 30 hours a week for 48 weeks of the year. The offer will be available to parents with three- and four-year-olds in state-funded early years settings and will come into force from 2021. The Welsh Government said the move will support more parents to work and more families to stay in work. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""This is a fantastic offer for Welsh parents. ""Parents who work can expect to save around PS9,000 per child, per year if they are using full-time childcare. ""We are investing in our children and in our communities to ensure they thrive and prosper."" The policy will be funded from the Welsh Government's block grant from the UK Government, so will not cost the taxpayer more. The offer is part of a wider package of support for children and families in Wales.",0,165
"Alistair Spagnoletti, 21, of Luton, and Curtis Walker, 23, of Watford, pleaded guilty to controlling a child at Harrow Crown Court. Callum Ward, 19, of Watford, was found guilty of two counts of controlling a child in Watford and one count of controlling a child in Luton. The trio were sentenced to a total of 17 years in jail. In addition to the three men sentenced to jail, a further three defendants were handed community orders or suspended sentences. A further three were found not guilty. The investigation began in 2014, when a 14-year-old girl disclosed that she had been sexually abused by a number of men. The investigation was led by Hertfordshire Constabulary's Child Online Safeguarding Team (COST). The victim, now 16, was groomed by the offenders online and then met at a Watford hotel where they sexually abused her and other girls. Walker and Spagnoletti were both jailed for seven years, and Ward was sentenced to three years. Sentencing the men, Judge Andrew Bright QC described the victim as ""an exceedingly vulnerable child who was groomed and then repeatedly sexually abused by you."" ""The evidence in this case was extremely harrowing. You were all involved in the systematic and organised sexual abuse of children. You were part of a group that preyed on the vulnerability of children and you encouraged and coerced them to participate in the most degrading and depraved activities. ""I have no doubt you will remain dangerous and a risk to young people for a very long time. Ward was also given an extended licence period of seven years. Walker and Spagnoletti were both made subject to Sexual Harm Prevention Orders and were both placed on the sex offenders register for life. After sentencing, Detective Constable Phil Raikes said: ""Today's sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences committed by these men. They have been held to account for their actions and will face the consequences of their crimes. I hope that this gives some closure to the victims and their families, knowing that these men will be behind bars. ""I would like to praise the victims for their bravery in coming forward and reporting this abuse. This has been a long and difficult process for them and I hope today's result will bring some comfort to them and their families. ""I want to encourage anyone who has been a victim of a sexual offence to come forward and speak to the police. We take all reports seriously and will investigate thoroughly. There are specially trained officers who can offer support and advice.""

"Mencap president Lord Rix urged the speaker of the House of Lords to push through legislation allowing those in his situation to be assisted to die. He had previously opposed a change in the law, but said that his experience of motor neurone disease had forced him to change his mind. In 2016, Conservative MP Rob Marris tried to put a bill into Parliament to permit assisted suicide. The bill was heavily defeated. He withdrew it. In February 2018, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords, proposing to legalise assisted suicide. The bill was introduced by the cross bench peer, Lord Charles Falconer. The Assisted Dying Bill was defeated in the House of Lords in 2006. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. The House of Lords is unelected and has no law making powers. The House of Lords can debate bills passed by the House of Commons and suggest changes. The UK House of Lords has now rejected the Assisted Dying Bill. This is the second time the House of Lords has rejected an assisted suicide bill. The Assisted Dying Bill was defeated on Friday by 184 votes to 134. The debate lasted almost seven hours. The Bill was brought by Lord Falconer, a former Labour Lord Chancellor. The House of Lords will now debate other bills. The UK House of Lords will debate the assisted suicide bill on Friday January 15 at 10 am. The UK media is reporting that the Lords will reject the assisted suicide bill, based on the vote in the Scottish Parliament on the same issue. The British Medical Association has voted to maintain its opposition to assisted suicide. This is great news. The vote to maintain opposition was passed by a majority of 2 to 1. This was a vote to reject the motion. The UK House of Lords Select Committee on Assisted Dying published its report today concerning the assisted suicide bill that was introduced in the House of Lords by Lord Falconer. Last week the Scottish parliament debated assisted suicide. The majority of MSPs who spoke to the assisted suicide bill urged parliament to reject the bill. Last year the UK Supreme court dismissed the appeal by Tony Nicklinson and Paul Lamb, who were seeking to overturn the prohibition on assisted suicide. The Supreme court unanimously upheld the law and recognized Parliament's right to decide social policy. Paul Lamb, a 58 year-old man from Leeds in the UK, who was seriously injured in a car accident, has lost his latest bid to have a legal assisted suicide. In April 2012, Lamb lost his case at the High Court in London, England. The three judges who heard the case agreed that the current law, which prohibits assisted suicide, is incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but they stated that they had no power to strike down the law, which would require parliament to change the law. On Thursday, February 27, 2014, the UK Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by Tony Nicklinson and Paul Lamb, who were seeking to overturn the prohibition on assisted suicide. The Supreme court unanimously upheld the law and recognized Parliament's right to decide social policy. The BMA will be debating a motion to go neutral on assisted suicide at their Annual Representative meeting in Edinburgh Scotland on June 26. The British Medical Association (BMA) will debate the issue of assisted suicide at their Annual Representative meeting in Edinburgh Scotland on June 26. Dr Shane Mac Giollabhui, a spokesperson for the Irish Catholic Doctors' Association, has challenged the Irish Medical Council's position on assisted suicide. Mac Giollabhui will be debating the issue at the annual meeting of the Irish Medical Council on May 31. Today the UK Supreme Court, in a unanimous ruling, upheld the assisted suicide law. The Supreme Court also recognized parliament's authority to decide social policy. Earlier this week, the UK Supreme Court heard the Nicklinson - Lamb assisted suicide case. The case is seeking to overturn the assisted suicide law in the UK. The claimants in the case are Tony Nicklinson, who is paralyzed after suffering a stroke, and Paul Lamb, who was paralyzed in a car accident.",0,167
"Tandridge District Council leader Martin Fisher gave planners a shortlist of five areas for such a scheme. He said one new Surrey village is better than ""scatter-gunning"" homes and cramping existing communities. Cllr Fisher, who is leading a review of the green belt, said: ""We need to consider whether it is feasible to develop one large sustainable new settlement in one location in Tandridge, rather than to continue to scatter housing growth across a number of small villages. ""This would provide opportunities to offer the new residents the facilities they need, such as schools, healthcare and employment, and would avoid the risk of damaging the character of smaller villages. ""If we continue to look at the green belt in this way, there may be potential to develop a new settlement of around 1,500 homes within the existing boundaries of Oxted."" He added: ""We're not proposing it would be within Oxted's town centre, but we're looking at a number of different sites around Oxted. ""It would be in one large site, rather than scattered across a number of sites."" Mr Fisher, a Conservative, said a new settlement would offer people a ""proper village"" with all the necessary services, rather than the current trend of building smaller developments of 100 homes, for example, which he described as ""scatter-gunning."" The former leader of Tandridge District Council, David Hodge, who is also Surrey's county council leader, has raised concerns about the review and described Mr Fisher's comments as ""disappointing."" Cllr Hodge, who is a Conservative, said: ""I am disappointed that Martin Fisher has suggested that he may be considering the use of green belt land to build 1,500 homes in Oxted. ""The green belt is one of our most important planning tools. It is vital we protect it from development and ensure that it is used for agriculture, forestry or recreation. ""I would prefer to see us focus on the use of brown field sites before we consider taking any green belt land out of the planning system."" Cllr Fisher is investigating five possible locations for a new settlement, which are: In and around Oxted; Around Redhill; Around Horley; Around Edenbridge; Around Lingfield. The review will look at building new homes and community facilities, such as schools and health centres. Cllr Fisher said: ""This is a long-term project. I'm not sure we will find one location suitable to take all the housing we need to take. ""We could have one or two new settlements, but I think the likelihood is that there will be a number of smaller sites."" The councillor said building on green belt land was ""a last resort,"" but added: ""We need to review the green belt and see if there is potential to use some of it for housing."" The review, which has been criticised by some residents, will look at Tandridge's ""housing supply and infrastructure,"" including transport, water and sewage. Cllr Fisher said: ""We're not pre-empting the outcome of the review. We're not saying we're going to build on the green belt. ""We want to do this review and consider the options. We have to plan for the future, not just for tomorrow."" A public consultation on the review will take place in September and October.",0,168
"The incident on 23 April involved a Russian SU-27 Flanker fighter and a US intelligence-gathering RC-135U. The US plane was flying a routine mission in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk, off Russia's east coast, when the Russian interceptor approached it from the side then pulled sharply in front of it, CNN reports, citing an unnamed Pentagon official. ""The SU-27 conducted a barrel roll from the left side of the aircraft, across the nose of the RC-135, to the right side of the aircraft,"" the official said. The US plane's crew determined that the barrel roll was deliberate and ""demonstrated a level of aerial aggressiveness that is highly unusual, and potentially dangerous,"" the official said, adding that the maneuver endangered the crew and aircraft. The incident comes on the heels of a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft buzzing a US guided missile destroyer in the Baltic Sea, just days after another Su-24 came within 500 meters of the USS Donald Cook destroyer in the same area. Last week the Pentagon condemned those incidents as ""provocative and unprofessional,"" adding that they will not be ignored by the US. ""These actions have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions between countries and could result in a miscalculation or accident,"" Navy Capt. Danny Hernandez said. In November 2015, Russian Defense Ministry officials said that the number of provocations against Russian warplanes by the US has reached ""a boiling point"" in the past few months. A Russian spokesperson said that the US jets intercept Russian warplanes at least once a week, and called the practice ""unsafe"" and ""harmful.""

"The 32-year-old has agreed a two-year contract with the Rams and is the first signing by manager Gary Rowett. Davies made 29 appearances for Hull last season as they were relegated from the Premier League, having joined the Tigers from Birmingham City for an undisclosed fee in September 2013. Davies, who was born in Derby, began his career at Tottenham and has also played for Southampton and Stoke. He played 17 times on loan at Derby in 2009-10, when they won promotion to the Championship. He has won 20 caps for Wales. Marcus Olsson has signed a two-year contract extension with Blackburn.

Rovers announced on Tuesday that goalkeeper Jason Steele had signed a contract extension, while 18-year-old striker Daniel Butterworth has signed a two-year professional contract. Everton are close to signing Manchester United defender Phil Jones for 12.5m, according to reports.

Coentrao, 28, spent the second half of last season on loan at Monaco and is looking for a new club this summer. ""We are looking at players and he is one of the players on our list,"" said Karanka. ""He is one of the players we are looking at."" Boro have signed midfielders Marten de Roon and Viktor Fischer this summer and Karanka is also interested in Valencia centre-back Shkodran Mustafi, with reports in Germany claiming the club are in talks with the German. West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis says the club have turned down an offer for striker Saido Berahino from Stoke City. Stoke have had two offers rejected for the 22-year-old England player, who has scored 20 goals in 81 appearances since making his debut for the Baggies in 2010. Pulis said: ""They've made an offer and we've turned it down. That's as far as it's gone. He's our player and we'll work with him.""

"23 May 2016 Last updated at 18:35 BST He's been given the boot after two years. United finished fifth in the Premier League this season, which means missing out on the Champions League. Van Gaal arrived in 2014, winning the FA Cup in his first year. But United finished fourth last season and there were reports he'd been fighting to keep his job. Van Gaal's replacement will be Jose Mourinho, who left Chelsea in December. Manchester United have sacked manager Louis van Gaal two days after the club won the FA Cup. Van Gaal met executive vice chairman Ed Woodward on Monday after United finished fifth in the Premier League. United will play in the Europa League next season. Van Gaal's former assistant Ryan Giggs, who played at Old Trafford for 24 years, has been appointed caretaker manager. A United statement said the club thanks ""Louis and his staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a record-equalling 12th FA Cup for the club (and securing him a title in four different countries)."" The statement added: ""He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage. ""Everyone at the club wishes him all the best in his future career."" The Dutchman leaves the club with the second best win percentage (52.4) of any manager who has been in charge for more than one season. He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan. Van Gaal's United side beat Crystal Palace 2-1 after extra time in Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley. But his side struggled in the Premier League and won just two of their final 10 matches. Van Gaal's United career Van Gaal's first season at Old Trafford brought a fourth-place finish in the Premier League and qualification for the Champions League. It ended in victory as United beat Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup for the 12th time. The former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss struggled to implement his favoured 3-5-2 formation during his second season at the club, with a series of injuries hampering his plans. United have spent in excess of 250m during Van Gaal's two seasons at the club. He leaves United with the seventh best win percentage of any permanent manager in the club's history. His final game in charge was a 3-1 win over Bournemouth at Old Trafford, in which United took the lead three times. ""It's not a good feeling. We have won, but after the match, Louis van Gaal has left the club. He did very well here. It's very sad for us,"" United captain Wayne Rooney said after the game. Mourinho, who was sacked by Chelsea in December, has been heavily linked with the Manchester United job. The Portuguese has managed Porto, Chelsea (twice), Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

"Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun. He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as terrorists, online. He said that he would be targeting Shia Muslims but denied being an ISIS supporter. Syed pleaded guilty to the offence at the Old Bailey on Thursday, and will be sentenced next week. The defendant contacted MI5 officers online in July and August last year, and began to ask them about the weapons he could buy and the ""best way to carry out an attack."" He said that he wanted to carry out a ""martyrdom operation"" and would target Shia Muslims in the UK. After being arrested, he told police that he had been in contact with the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISISISIL) and that he had been in the ""right mind"" to carry out the attack. He said that he wanted to kill up to 100 Shia Muslims in a gun and bomb attack on an Eltham mosque or the Shia Imam Hussain mosque in Greenwich. However, he later told police he was not an ISIS supporter and would never harm other Muslims. Syed appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh prison wearing a black prayer cap and a blue prison tracksuit. He pleaded guilty to one charge of preparation of terrorist acts between July 9 and September 20, 2015. Judge Charles Wide QC said Syed should be sentenced next Thursday at the Old Bailey. He said he would adjourn the case to allow Syed's defense team to prepare ""further evidence."" The judge also allowed the publication of the defendant's name, and revealed details of the charges he was facing. At the hearing, it emerged that the defendant was previously convicted of robbery in 2010 and had been released on license from jail in February last year. He was arrested by counter-terrorism officers in September 2015 and was charged in December. Source:",0,183
"Most MSPs on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked protections for religious institutions or for freedom of speech. The equal opportunities committee published its stage one report on 16 November, which included the views of the committee members. Three MSPs on the committee, who are members of the Conservative Party, abstained from voting on the bill at stage one. They were Graham Simpson, Jeremy Balfour and Liz Smith. Their party colleague Annie Wells, who is also a member of the committee, voted against the bill at stage one. Wells said she was not convinced that ""the Scottish people want to change the definition of marriage, as the Scottish Government is proposing to do."" She also highlighted a concern that the bill did not have sufficient protections for those with religious objections to same-sex marriage. Wells also raised a concern about freedom of speech. ""The bill should make clear that the proposed change in the law does not in any way prevent people from holding and expressing religious or philosophical beliefs about marriage,"" she said. ""People should be free to argue that marriage is between a man and a woman, and to oppose same-sex marriage, without fear of being accused of homophobia. ""Similarly, those who hold the view that marriage is between a man and a woman should not be prevented from expressing that view in the same way as others are allowed to express their view that marriage should be extended to same-sex couples."" Graham Simpson, the Conservative MSP for Central Scotland, said the definition of marriage was ""a long-standing and well-understood concept that has been accepted in most civilisations for thousands of years."" ""A consequence of this bill is that it will make it much more difficult for those who hold to the traditional view of marriage to express their beliefs,"" he said. He also raised concerns that some people would feel ""pressured to change their views, simply because the law has changed."" Simpson also said the bill ""does not provide sufficient protection for those who hold to the traditional view of marriage, and because of that, the law should not be changed."" Jeremy Balfour, the Conservative MSP for the Lothians, said he had voted against the bill at stage one because ""it does not protect the rights of those who disagree with the redefinition of marriage."" He said the bill ""does not provide protections for people who hold the traditional view of marriage and want to live their lives in accordance with that view."" Liz Smith, the Conservative MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, said she had concerns that the bill ""would not provide sufficient protections for religious institutions that do not wish to participate in same-sex marriages."" The bill ""does not provide sufficient protections for individual believers who, for example, work in the public sector but whose view of marriage is based on their religious convictions,"" she said. ""I cannot support the bill unless those concerns are addressed at stage two."" The report also said that Colin Smyth, the Labour MSP for the South of Scotland, ""has concerns about the bill but is supporting it at this stage."" However, he said he believed ""the Scottish Government needs to give further thought to the question of protecting religious groups from litigation if they do not wish to solemnise same-sex marriages."" ""The committee has made a number of recommendations to strengthen protections for religious groups, and Mr Smyth will consider the Government's response to those recommendations before deciding whether to support the bill at stage three,"" the report said. The Scottish Parliament will continue to debate the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill at stage two on 20 November. John Lamont, the Scottish Conservative chief whip, said: ""This is a bill which has been rushed through the parliamentary process. ""That's why many of my colleagues, including myself, abstained at stage one and made clear that we would consider the bill at stage two and three. ""The equal opportunities committee has now made a number of recommendations which strengthen protections for religious groups and, as the report sets out, Mr Smyth has concerns which he will consider the Government's response to before deciding whether to support the bill at stage three.

Kyrie Irving Says He Intends To Re-Sign With Celtics Boston Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving has reportedly decided where he will play for the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association season. On the surface, this feels like it could be the most flawless fit for Irving and the Celtics. The 26-year-old has two years remaining on his contract with the Celtics and would become a free agent in the summer of 2020. Pelicans Want To Sign Kemba Walker Add A Second Star Walker had a career-year in 2018-19, averaging 25.6 points, 5.9 assists, and 4.4 rebounds while shooting 43.4 percent from the field. If Charlotte wants to keep Kemba Walker , they'll have to pay him 190 million over five years. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith says Kyrie Irving is 'most likely' staying in Boston The New York Times' Marc Stein reported the Lakers were also interested in the point guard. The Boston Celtics are set to be a major player in free agency this summer, but one of their own free agents is reportedly already out of the picture. Irving, who averaged 23.8 points and seven assists per game in 2018-19, spent the first six seasons of his career with the Cavaliers. The Celtics will likely give him a maximum contract, which would be four years and 141 million. Should Irving remain with the Celtics, his 21.3 million cap hit for next season will be his largest for the foreseeable future. According to Wojnarowski, there will be no commitment on Irving's end, however, until he sits down with Ainge and Stevens and has a face-to-face conversation with them. The Celtics' season ended with a Game 5 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference semifinals.

"Whether or not he is on the formal menu, Mr Snowden will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows. Ms Merkel's trip to the US is markedly different from the previous ones in 2011 and 2007. Her visit this time has been reduced to a day and a half. A Russian MP and former KGB officer who is wanted by Latvia for war crimes said he intends to start a campaign to rename Moscow's Cosmonauts Alley after Edward Snowden, a source in the State Duma told Interfax on Friday. ""The Latvian government should abandon its attempts to look tough and, instead, should take care of its own people, not of foreign citizens,"" Slutsky said. He said he would appeal to the heads of the legislatures of other countries to initiate renaming their streets after the whistleblower. Slutsky said he intends to appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a request to rename Moscow's Cosmonauts Alley after Snowden. In late December 2013, then-Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said he would seek the extradition of Snowden if he visited Latvia. In response, the Saeima's Human Rights and Public Affairs Committee said that the Interior Ministry should not extradite Snowden if he travels to Latvia. According to the paper, Slutsky will also urge European lawmakers to address Russia's State Duma with a request to discuss in plenary the situation with Snowden. ""This is an issue of concern to all countries of the world, and the stance of the Duma will be a stance of the Russian state,"" he said. On January 16, 2014, the State Duma's International Affairs Committee unanimously adopted a statement on Snowden. ""The State Duma fully and unconditionally supports the stance of the Russian authorities and personally President Vladimir Putin, who made a decision on granting political asylum in Russia to Edward Snowden and on refusal to hand him over to the authorities of other countries, which have placed him on international wanted list,"" the statement says. The International Affairs Committee was supported by the leaders of all four State Duma factions. The statement was initiated by United Russia deputy Leonid Slutsky, who also heads the Duma committee. The State Duma's international affairs committee has been known for its anti-western stance and its track record of promoting legislation to punish those who criticise the Russian government. In December, the committee supported a bill to blacklist ""unfriendly"" foreign organisations that the Russian authorities deem a threat to Russia's constitutional order, its defence capabilities or its national security. Human rights defenders said at the time that the bill was designed to prevent criticism of the authorities.

The BND president said that he had seen no evidence that Mrs. Merkel's phone was tapped and that he had not been asked by the U.S. to tap it. In an interview with German television on Thursday, Mrs. Merkel said Mr. Snowden's actions had done ""great damage"" to Germany.

"Couples have been decorating the Ponte Milvio bridge on the river Tiber with locks for several years. They are meant to symbolise the locking of hearts, inspired by a story in a novel by Federico Moccia. Violators risk a fine of between 50 and 250 euros (43 and 215), the Italian capital's new mayor Virginia Raggi said in a statement on Sunday. The locks are seen as a hazard to the city's architectural and environmental heritage and are already banned on two other bridges in the capital, Ponte Sant'Angelo and Ponte Sisto. ""We have started the process to remove the padlocks on the Ponte Milvio,"" the mayor's office said. Ponte Milvio, a stone's throw from the Foro Italico sports complex, was built in 206 BC to cross the Tiber. Raggi said the removal of the locks was part of a policy to keep the historic heritage of the capital intact. ""The padlocks on Ponte Milvio are just one of the many forms of senseless damage that the city of Rome must face up to,"" she said. The left-wing mayor of Rome, who won a landslide victory in a municipal vote in June, is also battling to eradicate graffiti, reduce traffic, and make the public transport system more efficient. She said the city council had started an awareness campaign against the posting of stickers and graffiti on public transport, and would hire 500 people to clean up the subway trains and buses. Raggi, a 37-year-old lawyer who has no previous political experience, has also announced plans to restrict access to the historic centre of Rome for polluting vehicles, excluding residents. She has come under criticism for her handling of the city's crisis, including a rubbish collection problem that has forced officials to scramble to find temporary storage and sorting facilities. Rome is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and has been particularly popular with Britons since the Brexit vote.",0,193
"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) missed a deadline to name a squad for the tournament after the International Cricket Council (ICC) changed its revenue-sharing model. However, the new administration under former captain Sourav Ganguly has given an assurance to the ICC that India will participate in the tournament. ""They are very keen to have an ICC event in India,"" ICC chief executive David Richardson told reporters in New Delhi. ""We will work out a suitable window in the calendar for that to happen.

Work on Portsmouth's jetty, built in the 1920s, is essential to accommodate the 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers.

"But Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says the process to close such schools is ""inadequate."" Where there is such ""illegal activity,"" he says, the ""full force of the law"" should be used to shut them down. Many of the unregistered schools are faith schools teaching a narrow range of beliefs. And what is the government doing about it? As for the Government, it says it will not tolerate any school that is operating illegally and has commissioned Ofsted to investigate further and report back. More than 800 places in unregistered schools in England have been identified by Ofsted in the past two years, Sir Michael said. If the Government is investigating, why is it not closing these schools down? Why is it not using the ""full force of the law""? It is a curious situation. The majority of unregistered schools are faith schools. Now, faith schools are allowed to operate in the UK - as long as they are registered. According to the BBC, the government won't tolerate unregistered schools, but it will tolerate registered faith schools - the difference being, of course, that they are registered. This is a legal technicality. In my view, all faith schools should be illegal, but they are not, because they are registered. When we ask for a secular education system, we are often accused of being hostile to religion. This is not true. We are hostile to faith schools - which are legally religious schools. In my view, all faith schools should be illegal, because they are religious. Faith schools are anathema to a secular education system, which should provide good quality secular education for all, free from the indoctrination of religion. Instead, our children are being indoctrinated with religious beliefs. In the case of these unregistered schools, children are being indoctrinated with religious beliefs that are illegal, because they are unregistered. In the case of registered schools, children are being indoctrinated with religious beliefs that are illegal, but the government allows them to continue, because they are registered. We don't need this confusion. The law should be clear. I think it is an outrage that any children are being indoctrinated with any religious beliefs in any school that receives government funding. What we should be doing is closing down all faith schools, whether they are registered or not. A secular education system should be providing good quality secular education for all.",0,196
"Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was handed over to a delegation of tribal leaders. He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end his isolation in the Saudi capital. The Saudi-backed president's government said it was committed to implementing the deal. Awad bin Mubarak has been under effective house arrest in Riyadh since Hadi arrived in the city in March last year after escaping from the southern port city of Aden, where the Houthis had seized the presidential palace. In return for his release, Awad bin Mubarak agreed to stop obstructing the work of the cabinet and not to interfere in the appointment of new officials. Awad bin Mubarak's release was meant to have been the first step in implementing the Riyadh agreement, which is aimed at ending a power struggle between Hadi and the vice president and his supporters. That has delayed the appointment of a new prime minister and a new central bank governor in Yemen, which has remained in political and security turmoil since 2014. The Houthis seized much of northern Yemen including the capital Sanaa in September 2014, forcing Hadi to flee. Their advance forced Hadi to flee first to Aden and then to Riyadh. A Saudi-led Arab coalition has been fighting since March last year to restore Hadi's government and drive back the Houthis. The Riyadh deal envisages forming a new government and an advisory body to help the president restore security in the country. But Hadi's decision to appoint his son Nasser to command Yemen's special forces last year has been a source of contention, with Awad bin Mubarak saying the move was unconstitutional. Hadi has not been able to return to Aden, a city which his government still nominally controls, due to security fears and opposition to his presence there by Awad bin Mubarak's supporters.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The hosts had the better of the chances against their League One rivals and were denied three times by the woodwork in the first half. The Seagulls got on top of their Premier League opponents and could have been ahead before the break, but for a number of brilliant Mat Ryan saves. The European Union (EU) on Wednesday announced that it will ban single-use plastics like straws, plates, cutlery, and cotton buds by 2021. The commission aims to reduce the use of the products by 50 percent by 2030. ""We have in Europe some of the best ideas and innovation, but unfortunately they often stay on paper, and we don't see them on the market."" The EU's executive branch has proposed banning plastic straws, plates, and cutlery, among other items, in order to reduce the 25 million tonnes of plastic waste produced in the EU each year. Environment ministers will get a first look at the plans at a meeting in Brussels on December 5. The European Commission has unveiled a new strategy for plastics, aiming to have all plastic packaging in Europe recyclable by 2030. The commission will also put a new 90 recycling target for plastic bottles by 2025, and a target to recycle 60 of other plastic packaging by 2025. The Commission plans to launch a voluntary pledging campaign, which will be supplemented by EU-wide rules on packaging and labelling that are to be proposed by the Commission later this year. The plan will also ""explore the feasibility of using the funds generated from extended producer responsibility schemes for investment in the circular economy,"" the commission said. The EU wants to cut plastic in half by 2030. ""This is an opportunity for Europe to lead the way, creating products that the world will demand for decades to come, and extracting more economic value from our precious and limited resources."" ""Every year Europeans generate 25m tonnes of plastic waste, but less than 30 is collected for recycling."" ""And in order to protect the health of European citizens, it will propose new rules on single-use plastics."" ""Tackling the plastics problem is a must and it can bring new opportunities for innovation, competitiveness and job creation,"" said Jyrki Katainen, vice-president responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness. The UK already has a number of restrictions on plastics including the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags which was introduced in 2015.

"The deal will see the firm taken over by holding company Cheil Industries, another part of the Samsung group. The merger is strongly opposed by some of Samsung CT's shareholders, who are against the takeover by a non-South Korean company. Cheil Industries, which is owned by Samsung Group's chairman Lee Kun-Hee, first proposed the merger in August this year. Samsung Electronics, a subsidiary of Cheil Industries, wants to use Samsung CT's IT services unit S1 to boost its e-commerce platform. S1 is South Korea's largest card payment processor and already provides back-end payment processing for Samsung's online marketplace, Samsung Mall. The deal will see Cheil Industries acquire a majority 84.2 stake in Samsung CT for around 2.4 billion. The takeover is set to be completed by January 2016, according to Reuters. Samsung CT had previously been involved in a series of mergers with Cheil Industries in 2013, but the deal was blocked by the South Korean government. The current deal would have to receive approval from the country's financial regulator, but the agency is currently without a head due to ongoing political strife. Samsung CT's shareholders are mainly local South Korean firms, and have previously been vocal about the deal, which will see a foreign company take over a domestic South Korean business.

"The US-owned retail firm, which processes hundreds of thousands of online orders each week, could have put millions of transactions at risk, security expert Paul Moore estimates. He first noticed the firm was vulnerable on 11 September. The company has since blocked access to the information from the internet. However, Mr Moore said he was unsure whether or not the data had been stolen. Asda has apologised for the breach. The data contained in the logs included: customer names and addresses payment card type, number and expiry date CVV (card verification value) number - the three-digit code on the back of cards customer order details - including product names Mr Moore, an information security consultant from Leicester, said he was searching for data that had been left accidentally exposed on the internet when he found Asda's cache. ""It's hard to know if someone has had access to this data before I found it,"" he told the BBC. ""The logs were being uploaded every day. They were already 10 days old when I discovered them."" Mr Moore said he had found the data using a freely available search tool. ""I just typed in the terms I was searching for and the data appeared in the results. Anyone in the world could have found this information."" The leak was particularly serious as it would have been easy to steal the information in bulk, Mr Moore said. ""It was just a case of sending a link to a file and then it could be downloaded. There was nothing to stop someone downloading the entire database."" He said the database was an ""absolute goldmine"" for cyber-criminals. ""This type of data would be worth a lot of money on the underground market. ""You could use the information to clone payment cards, buy goods online, create a profile of someone to steal their identity or even blackmail someone."" Asda has said it does not believe the data was ""accessed or compromised"" but has not said how it came to be accessible. ""We take our responsibility to protect customer data extremely seriously and have a number of technical and physical controls in place to prevent unauthorised access to customer information,"" a spokesman said. ""We are very sorry for any concern this may have caused."" He added that the supermarket had reported the breach to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The ICO said it was investigating. Asda has now secured the data and closed the breach. The Asda leak was discovered just weeks after the personal details of 130,000 Virgin Media customers were exposed online. It is the latest in a series of security breaches involving large firms. In June, the ICO fined the Carphone Warehouse 400,000 after hackers stole the personal details of more than three million customers and 1,000 staff. A month earlier, the UK's data protection watchdog fined NHS Surrey 200,000 for losing the personal information of more than 3,000 patients. In April, the ICO levied a 400,000 fine on TalkTalk after a cyber-attack which exposed the personal data of 157,000 customers. The company's chief executive Dido Harding was subsequently questioned by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee about the breach. Earlier this year, Experian, a credit check company, was fined 160,000 for sending direct marketing emails to millions of people who had explicitly opted out of such messages. The ICO has the power to impose a maximum fine of 500,000 for serious breaches of the Data Protection Act. After this cap was introduced in April, the watchdog said it would consider implementing further measures, such as issuing penalties based on a company's global turnover.

She turned to the man who had been standing in the shadows at the end of the hallway, just outside the door to her office. ""Wouldn't we, Jack?"" she asked again, when he didn't reply. The vicar cleared his throat. ""Oh, yes, yes, of course."" He stepped forward, his face grave. ""It's too bad about the organist's job, but the Canon is right. There will be other opportunities. And we're very glad to have you as Canon Morgan's assistant, Ms. Kendal. You do a wonderful job for her, and she depends on you."" He put out his hand. ""I'm sorry, my dear."" She took his hand and shook it. ""Thank you, Vicar. It's kind of you to say so."" ""Yes, indeed,"" said the Canon. ""We're very glad to have you."" She smiled. ""But then, you couldn't have known, could you, dear? You couldn't have known that I'd already decided to recommend Mr. Doyle for the post."" ""Oh, well, then, it's all right,"" she said, forcing a laugh. ""I mean, I would have been disappointed if it had gone to someone else."" ""Of course you would,"" said the vicar, patting her arm. ""We quite understand,"" said the Canon. ""Quite understand."" She glanced at the clock on the wall. ""Oops,"" she said, looking at the young woman. ""I'm afraid I have an appointment, Ms. Kendal. I wonder if you could be so good as to show Mr. Doyle to my office?"" ""Of course, Canon Morgan."" ""Thank you, dear."" The Canon turned to the vicar. ""Jack? Will you stay?"" The vicar looked at the woman, who was already halfway down the hall. He sighed. ""I think I'd better not,"" he said, and followed the young woman out the door. The Canon watched them go, a smile spreading across her face. ""Oh, yes,"" she said aloud. ""I think I'll have great fun with this one."" There was a certain satisfaction to be found in a job well done. And what Catherine Kendal had just accomplished was something of a masterpiece. Oh, it was true that she had murdered her husband, but that was all right. The man had been a brute, and deserved to die. But what was most important to her, most satisfying, was what she had done to the Canon. That had been a work of art, and Catherine felt a sense of pride as she",0,209
"Mourinho, 52, is halfway through a four-year deal signed on his return to Stamford Bridge in June 2013. And further talks are expected in the coming weeks with the club's technical director Michael Emenalo. However, they have won just two of their last eight games in all competitions and last month suffered the heaviest home defeat of Mourinho's career when they were beaten 5-3 by Arsenal. But the Portuguese has reiterated that he is planning for a long future at Chelsea and wants the club to build a dynasty of success over the coming years. ""I want to stay,"" said Mourinho. ""I don't know about the contract, the club knows I want to stay, the club wants me to stay, so the only thing to do is to find a way."" Mourinho added: ""I am not in a position to be asking for things because the club gave me in my first day back here, everything I asked for. They gave me conditions for success, so now it is my job to try to get it. ""I want to stay because I am in a club that I love, I want to stay because I want to build something. I have started something and I want to finish it. I want to build something for the future."" Mourinho revealed he and Emenalo have already had preliminary talks over the new deal. ""We are speaking with the club about the contract, but the most important thing is I want to stay,"" he added. ""And the club wants me to stay. So I think sooner or later we are going to find a way. ""I don't think we are speaking about a contract for two more years, or one more year. We are speaking about the project, and about the continuation of the project, and I would say a long-term project. So let's see."" Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has been criticised for his constant changes in managerial staff, but Mourinho believes the Russian now wants to build a dynasty at the club. ""I think that in this moment Mr Abramovich doesn't want to change the manager every year,"" said Mourinho. ""I think Mr Abramovich doesn't want to keep changing and to keep paying millions. I think he wants to find a manager, give him a chance to work, to give him a chance to build something. ""I think that this is his new perspective. I think he wants to have stability and I think he wants to support. ""I don't say for many years, but he wants to have stability and to support his manager, to support the project and I think he wants to build something. ""In this moment Chelsea's football club is a club without debt, a club with a fantastic squad, a club with a good Academy, a club that wants to build something that is not just about spending and spending, but about building. ""I think we are going in a very good direction and I want to be a part of this project."" The former Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss is enjoying life in west London but insists the role at Chelsea is not his last job. ""I think it is not my last job, but I think I want to stay for many years,"" he added. ""It is not my last job but I want to stay for many years. I want to stay, I don't know about the contract, the club knows I want to stay, the club wants me to stay, so the only thing to do is to find a way."" Mourinho says Chelsea must get back to winning ways when they take on Tottenham on Wednesday. ""I think we have to win,"" he added. ""I think we have to get points from the game to go back to the top of the league. ""The defeat against West Ham was disappointing, and the draw against Sunderland was disappointing. ""We need to get points, we need to win matches to be top of the league again."" Mourinho also revealed that Thibaut Courtois is a doubt to face Spurs with a hamstring injury, while Diego Costa is struggling with a niggling hamstring problem of his own. The Chelsea boss said: ""Courtois has a little chance to be fit for tomorrow, a small chance, and Diego is training with the team and getting better, so hopefully he is also going to be ready for tomorrow.""",0,210
"Conservative-run Bath and North East Somerset Council is holding a presentation of initial concept pictures of the redevelopment. Banes recently agreed it had to save PS2.6m from its PS351m budget, and the cuts will be revealed in March. Conservative councillor Cherry Beath (Batheaston), cabinet member for children's services, said: ""I'm sure there will be some sadness because people have had to be moved out, but this is going to be an amazing facility for Bath and North East Somerset. ""It is going to be a fantastic learning centre for children with special educational needs. ""I think people will be really pleased when they see the plans and what is being developed. ""We have to be realistic in these financial times. ""I'm sure people will see that the new facilities are far better than the ones that we have at present. The old buildings on the site have been empty since last summer, and will be demolished and replaced with a new block. Council bosses are exploring different options for the sale and relocation of the school's nursery. The former children's centre building is being retained by the council to provide services for young children and their families. The new facility will include 210 primary and secondary school places for children with special educational needs and a 52-place nursery. The school, which is run by the council, is currently based in Locksbrook Road. The council has already held two public drop-in sessions at the school where it showed early concept pictures to parents and carers. Teachers at the school have been heavily involved in the planning process, and some of the students have provided feedback on the proposed plans. The council plans to consult on a planning application later this year, with the aim of starting work on site in early 2019. The planning application will be subject to a statutory consultation process. The redevelopment is expected to be complete in time for the start of the 2020-21 academic year. The council is working with local charity the Sirona Therapeutic Horsemanship Centre in Radstock, and the charity hopes to be able to provide its services from the new facility. Mr Baxter said: ""We are delighted to be working with Sirona as we plan the redevelopment of Three Ways School. ""Sirona is a fantastic local charity which makes a real difference to people's lives. Jess Spurrell, chief executive of Sirona, said: ""We are very excited to be working with Three Ways School and Bath and North East Somerset Council on this project. ""We believe the new facility will provide a wonderful opportunity to develop the partnership working between the school and Sirona. ""The new location and facilities will help us to extend our services to support more people who are facing life-challenges.",0,211
"Towell, 25, was knocked down twice during the bout in Glasgow on Thursday and died in hospital on Friday night. His partner Chloe Ross revealed he had been suffering migraines for weeks before his death. The Irish athlete, who was born in Coalisland, Co Tyrone, was rushed to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital following the fight with Scottish fighter Mike Zambidis at the SSE Hydro. Ross, who was at ringside with their daughter, told BBC NI she believed the migraine medication he was taking may have been a factor in his death. She said: ""He has been complaining the last few weeks that he's been getting headaches and just putting it down to maybe the gym and different things. ""He's been taking tablets recently to see if it would help, but it didn't seem to."" Towell's father Tommy told BBC Scotland: ""This is the first time he has been stopped by a doctor. ""I don't think it was a hard fight, he has had harder fights. ""This was a fight that was going to get him well known. He was so happy. He was making a name for himself."" Police Scotland said they were investigating the circumstances of his death and an autopsy will be carried out. A spokeswoman said: ""Around 11.15pm on Friday, police were called to reports of a 25-year-old man having taken unwell within the SSE Hydro arena. ""Emergency services attended and the man was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where he later died. ""A post-mortem examination will take place in due course to establish the exact cause of death, however, early indications are that he died of injuries sustained during this fight."" Earlier on Saturday, Ross wrote on Facebook: ""My baby has gone, I am absolutely heartbroken. ""I love you so much baby, your my world forever and always."" Fellow boxers and fighters across the world have paid tribute to the fighter, with UFC star Michael Bisping posting a picture of him on social media, and former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury writing ""rest in peace little man."" Scottish boxer Ricky Burns said: ""Sad news about Mike Towell, thoughts with his family at this time."" Towell, known as ""Iron Mike Towell,"" was undefeated going into Thursday's fight. He was the former Thai boxing world champion, winning the World Boxing Council (WBC) title in his 13th professional bout in March. In the fifth round of the fight, Towell was knocked to the canvas before the referee stopped the bout. Stephen Lomas, head of Boxing Scotland, said Towell's death was ""devastating for the whole boxing community"" and his death was the first in a boxing ring in Scotland since 1975. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""This is the first time in my 30 years of being involved in boxing where we have had a fatality. ""It's a dark day for us, a really dark day, and everybody is totally devastated by what's happened. ""He was a young man with a young family, he has a partner, he has a wee girl of a few months old.

"Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal. His name is associated with a different part of the club's past, a part that was not glamorous but no less important. By 1964, Wallace had been at the club for 10 years and had a solitary First Division game to his name. His story is one of hard work and persistence and he is the sort of player you would want in your team. Liverpool were struggling at the time and were without a win in six games, scoring only six goals in the process. Their opponents were the German champions and they boasted a glittering array of international stars including Uwe Seeler, Klaus Sturmer and Hans Nowak. A 70,000 crowd packed into Anfield for the first round, first leg tie and they were to witness a goal that changed the club's history. Wallace, playing in a deep midfield role, fired home a left-foot shot past German goalkeeper, Gerhard Kleppinger, to open the scoring in the 13th minute. The goal was the only score of the game, which finished 1-0 to Liverpool. Wallace's 11th minute strike was the club's first ever goal in European competition and it has been celebrated ever since. The return game in Hamburg finished in a 3-2 defeat for Liverpool and they went out of the competition but Wallace's contribution was a significant part of the club's history.

"Artis Sterkis, 37, collapsed on the Peterhead-registered Starlight Rays. He was taken to hospital by rescue helicopter after the incident in August 2011, but he never regained consciousness. James Thoresen, 41, died in 2008 after being hit by a falling door on the Ocean Way, registered at Fleetwood. A report from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said both tragedies were the result of poor maintenance and safety standards, and criticised the regulatory system. The MAIB said neither of the fishermen would have been at risk had the doors been secured. The men were working on the vessels in the Clyde, near the mouth of the Firth of Clyde, when the accidents happened. The report said that there was no record of the doors being maintained or serviced, with the result that they were not working properly. A spokesman for the MAIB said: ""The crew were not aware that the heavy doors could unexpectedly drop due to the internal mechanisms breaking and allowing the doors to run under gravity. ""It is likely that both accidents would have been avoided had the doors been regularly serviced."" The report also said that both vessels had not been maintained in accordance with the Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels. The MAIB criticised the regulatory system, saying there was no inspection of smaller fishing vessels by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The report said: ""The MCA has previously stated that its inspection regime is not able to ensure that all vessels over 12m (39ft) in length meet the requirements of the Code of Practice. ""The MAIB considers that the current inspection regime is ineffective in identifying vessels with sub-standard safety standards."" The MCA said: ""We fully accept that more needs to be done to improve the safety of small fishing vessels."" ""The MAIB report acknowledges the work that is under way to implement the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Fishing Safety. The work to improve safety standards on board smaller fishing vessels is ongoing and we are making good progress."" The report into the two deaths at sea also recommended that the MCA introduced a programme of inspections and regular maintenance of smaller fishing vessels, and that the Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels was reviewed.

"Ties have sharply deteriorated in recent years, and the government in Warsaw has sharply criticised Russia's conduct in Ukraine. But Mr Andreyev's interpretation of history brought relations to a new low. Poland's ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski, said his country ""firmly"" rejects the ""distortion of history."" ""The Polish state played no role in the extermination of Jews during World War II. It was our people who were the main victims of this unprecedented genocide,"" Mr Magierowski said in a statement. Media captionA Polish parliamentarian's microphone was cut when he spoke out against a bill that made it a crime to suggest Poland was complicit in the Holocaust. ""We will not accept any attempt to distort historical truth and we will defend ourselves against any such attempt. We want the memory of the Holocaust to be preserved as it was."" Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said that he could not ""remember ever hearing anything like that from a Russian diplomat before,"" and urged Mr Andreyev to ""clarify or apologise for this unfortunate statement."" ""To compare the crimes of the Nazis to the death of one man is insulting to the memory of the six million Jews who were killed in the Holocaust,"" Rabbi Schudrich told AFP news agency. The US ambassador to Poland, Georgette Mosbacher, called Mr Andreyev's remarks ""outrageous."" ""This kind of reckless rhetoric is totally unacceptable and sows division and discord in Polish-Russian relations,"" she wrote on Twitter. Russia's foreign ministry later said it was ""bewildered"" by the Polish reaction, adding that Mr Andreyev's comments had been ""taken out of context."" The diplomatic row is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the new Polish law. Israel's foreign ministry summoned Poland's ambassador to demand a change to the ""distortion of historical truth."" The ministry added that the envoy had been told that Israel ""is strongly opposed to the legislation."" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also warned against ""attempts to rewrite history."" Some critics of the legislation fear that it could allow the government to prosecute anyone who accuses Poles of being complicit in the Holocaust. Polish President Andrzej Duda, however, has stressed that the law does not amount to a ""ban on talking about the Holocaust."" In a televised address, he said he would ask parliament to amend the legislation so that it only applies to the actions of the Polish state or Polish citizens ""to remove all doubt."" But if the law is passed in its current form, the European Union could take legal action against Poland. The European Commission said that ""restrictions on the freedom of expression without an independent judiciary to assess them are incompatible with European values.""

Leslie said Forde did not state that the late PM was a client and that she did not state that she was going to expose him if a prosecution against her was continued. Leslie said Forde told him that she did some work for Manning, and that she had a personal relationship with him, and that she was going to expose him. ""I do not recall that she said she would expose the Prime Minister if the matter was not dropped,"" Leslie said. Leslie said he could not recall the exact date of the conversation but it was prior to his departure from the law firm of Gillian Ramphal-Hackett, which was in July 2012. ""I do not recall the exact date of that conversation but it was prior to my departure from the law firm of Gillian Ramphal-Hackett in July 2012,"" Leslie said. Leslie said he met with Forde twice, once in June 2012 and once in July 2012, and he was of the view that she was a credible witness. ""In my interview with her, I formed the view that she was a credible witness. I felt that she was wrongly accused and I was interested in pursuing her case further,"" Leslie said. Leslie said at the time he did not believe that Forde would have made any false allegations. ""I did not believe that she would have made any false allegations against the Prime Minister at that time. I felt she was a genuine person,"" Leslie said. Leslie said at the time Forde did not appear to be a person who would embark on a scandalous attack on someone. Leslie said he did not feel that Forde was a person who was inclined to make false allegations. Forde was sentenced to a six-month suspended sentence after she defrauded an elderly woman out of 43,000. She was represented by attorneys, led by former Attorney General Ramlogan, at the time of her sentencing.",0,223
"The announcement of the coaching changes at Surrey on the day of the Australia-Sri Lanka Champions Trophy game at The Oval meant juggling meetings and phone calls with stints in the press box and trips to the players' balcony. The news, that Alec Stewart and Chris Adams would no longer be in charge of first-team affairs, broke in the morning and was greeted with surprise. In the ensuing weeks the story has been that Stewart, the former England captain, had been pushed. The fact he did not attend the game that afternoon added fuel to that fire. But on the day, as I waited in the press box for the team to be announced, I was told the opposite by Surrey staff. Stewart had, I was informed, resigned. I wrote as much in my match report for The Cricket Paper. There was some confusion in the Surrey camp, though. Adams was still speaking to me as club captain and coach, even as he was having to field a whole host of calls from players - some asking what had happened and others asking if they would be playing that day. The fact that Adams was left to deal with the fallout from the decision that he was to be removed from the coaching role he had held for 10 years, and Stewart had left after five, had not been taken particularly well by some at The Oval. Adams was given the dreaded vote of confidence by his employers in the days following the game, but the writing was on the wall. Surrey now have a new director of cricket, the South Africa great Alec Bedser, and a new coach, Graham Ford, the former South Africa coach. Ford's appointment has been greeted with enthusiasm by Surrey players, but the manner of his predecessors' departures has been questioned by many. Adams, in particular, had made his mark at Surrey. He had begun to turn around the club's fortunes and was immensely popular with players and staff. Stewart, too, had a successful tenure as coach, winning the County Championship and One-Day Cup in consecutive seasons. Yet the decision was made by the club's hierarchy that they would not be the men to take Surrey forward. It is no secret that there had been growing pressure on Adams and Stewart, from both inside and outside the club. The club's financial model is far from sustainable, with big-name players brought in on huge salaries, only for them to leave after a season or two. There had been talk of an unsustainable debt of 1.2 million, though the club has disputed that figure. The club's owners had been unhappy with the team's performances in the T20 competition, having reached the quarter-finals in both 2016 and 2017, but lost in both to the same opposition, Somerset. Adams, in particular, had borne the brunt of that pressure, as he was responsible for the T20 team. The club had become accustomed to success in T20 competitions, having won three in a row before missing out on qualification in 2015. They have now had two disappointing campaigns, and the owners had decided that something had to change. The question many people are asking is, though, is whether that change should have been at the top. Adams, for one, is of the opinion that he should still be the coach, and that Stewart should still be director of cricket. In the days after the announcement, he had made it clear that he would fight the decision, and he duly did. While Stewart had had enough and decided to walk away, Adams had planned to stay. He has worked tirelessly at Surrey for 10 years, and wanted to see out the next two years of his contract. The club had other ideas, though, and Adams has now been placed on gardening leave for the duration of his contract. He is still being paid, but is not allowed to coach elsewhere. It is a sad state of affairs for Adams, and one that should be a cause of concern for those who want the best coaches in the game to remain in the game. Adams, now 48, had been a bright and innovative coach, and had been groomed by the ECB for a role within the England set-up in the future. Now, though, he is on the outside looking in, and will have to wait until 2019 before he can apply for a new role. There had been talk of him taking over at Hampshire, should Giles White decide to",0,224
"At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims. It has called on the government to make the rental market more professional. In a report, Rics says the private rental sector (PRS) will have to grow substantially to meet future demand. By 2025, there will be an additional 1.8 million households looking to rent rather than buy, it predicts, making up 24 of all households in England, up from 21 today. The report comes as the government published its much-anticipated housing white paper, aiming to address the nation's housing shortage and make it easier for more people to own their own home. However, the white paper also says the government will help to ""deliver more homes for rent,"" suggesting it is wary of over-relying on home ownership to solve the housing shortage. Rics says the government must ensure the PRS is more fit for purpose by making the market more professional and working to raise standards across the industry. The rental market has seen rapid growth in recent years, with a 15 increase in the number of households renting privately between 2011 and 2015. Rics says this is partly due to increased flexibility in the labour market, as more people are now working on short-term contracts or in the gig economy, where they are self-employed and move from job to job. It says there has also been a shift in social attitudes towards renting, with young people now seeing it as a more attractive option than owning a home. Rics says the private rental sector is now larger than the social rental sector for the first time since the 1960s, and it predicts that the PRS will continue to grow in the future. Over the next 10 years, the organisation predicts there will be an extra 1.8 million households looking to rent, making up a quarter of all households by 2025. It says this increase will be driven by the rising cost of buying a home, which will mean a greater proportion of households are priced out of home ownership. Rics says that with such high demand for rental properties, more people will be living in the private rented sector for longer, with the average rental period expected to increase from 20 months in 2016 to 29 months by 2025. It says this will create a new group of 'super renters' who will be renting for the foreseeable future and may never buy a home. Rics says the government must now take action to ensure the PRS is fit for purpose and can meet the needs of this growing group of renters. The organisation has called for a new PRS regulator to be established to raise professional standards and help to improve the quality of rented properties. It says the regulator would also have the power to enforce mandatory qualifications for agents, which is something Rics has long been campaigning for. The government should also introduce a standardised tenancy agreement to give greater security to renters, Rics says. This would help to prevent revenge evictions and ensure that renters are not evicted without good reason.",0,225

"Aiden Hughes, with an address of Balmoral Road, Bangor, posed as a teenage boy before meeting his victim in a Belfast park. During the meeting, he touched the girl over her clothing. At Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday (20 November), he was sentenced to three years in prison and handed an extended licence of three years. The 40-year-old was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years and a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) was imposed for five years. Detective Sergeant Karen Mullan said: ""This man was a married father of two children and a religious elder in his church. His actions have destroyed the life of his victim and devastated his family. ""Aiden Hughes initially denied his guilt, forcing his victim to undergo the trauma of a trial. Thankfully she had the courage to stand up to him and give evidence in court, which ultimately led to a guilty verdict. ""I would like to pay tribute to this brave girl and her family for their courage and resilience throughout the ordeal. I hope that today's sentencing provides them with some comfort and helps them to rebuild their lives. ""I would also like to commend the officers who worked tirelessly to bring Hughes to justice.

"Radwan Hamed collapsed during a game in Belgium in 2006. Last year a judge ruled Spurs breached its duties to him. In a screening prior to signing for the club, doctors found he had a heart condition. The club however failed to relay this information to the player. Hamed took his case to the Royal Courts of Justice and it was heard by Mr Justice Jay. The judge found that Spurs breached its duty of care to the player by failing to advise him of the results of the screening test. The club therefore owed him a duty of care and the judge awarded him 518,000 for loss of earnings and future pension. The judge further ordered Spurs to pay the player's costs. The club has however appealed against the decision. If you have been affected by the actions of your employer and feel you have a claim, contact us today.",0,230

"General Vladimir Padrino tweeted that the ""leaders and masterminds of the paramilitary and terrorist assault"" had been arrested. The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and 31-year-old ex-sergeant, Jefferson Alexander Perez Vargas. They have been charged with treason, attempted murder and use of war weapons. The pair have also been accused of seeking ""destabilisation,"" ""civil war"" and ""intervention by a foreign power."" ""We need to be prepared because the US empire, through proxies inside the country and outside the country, is looking to generate destabilisation in our nation,"" said Padrino. ""We must be very careful."" The pair have been held at the Directorate of Military Counterintelligence in Caracas. It is not clear if they have been granted legal representation. There was no immediate response from the Trump administration to the accusations. Saturday's attack saw two police officers killed and several others wounded when grenades were dropped from a stolen helicopter in an attack on the supreme court and interior ministry. Venezuelan security services said the men later escaped in the stolen helicopter. But they were quickly found, along with the helicopter, at a private residence in Higuerote, 17 miles (27km) east of Caracas. In the wake of the attack, the supreme court sentenced the helicopter pilots to 18 months in prison and banned them from working for the armed forces. ""The supreme court of justice imposes on the defendants 18 months and 10 months in prison, for the commission of serious crimes, sentences that are to be immediately executed,"" the court said in a statement. The court also barred the pair from holding public office, practising a profession and travelling abroad, while freezing their bank accounts. In 2014, Caguaripano was detained along with several other members of the national guard for allegedly plotting a coup against Maduro's government. The arrests came amid a wave of unrest that left 43 people dead and hundreds more injured in anti-government protests across Venezuela. The US said the attack on the supreme court was not a coup and called for the ""full restoration of democratic order"" in Venezuela. Meanwhile, a local human rights group called for an independent investigation into the use of force by police during demonstrations. ""The number of people injured by firearms shows that there is a deliberate intention to injure them seriously,"" the Venezuelan Penal Forum said in a statement. The group also criticised the use of ""bullets that expand or break up in the body"" which make it difficult to remove them from those wounded. At least 10 people have been killed, 120 injured and more than 1,000 arrested in protests since the supreme court dissolved the national assembly in a ruling on 29 March. The court reversed its decision, but the move has done little to quell unrest among those who blame Maduro for an economic crisis that has caused shortages of food, medicine and basic supplies. The president has refused to grant general elections that could potentially see him voted out of power. He said the protests were a violent attempt by the opposition to overthrow him.",0,232
"Media playback is not supported on this device Drogba, 39, has not played since leaving Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact in November. He will start out as a player but also take on ambassadorial and promotional duties for the club. The Ivory Coast international, who scored 10 goals in 14 games in the MLS last season, has been without a club since leaving Montreal Impact in November. But the Chelsea legend will now return to Stamford Bridge in a new role. In a statement, the club said: ""Didier is coming back to Chelsea, his home. He's one of the most successful players in our history, a true legend at the club and we hope he'll play a big part in our future success."" Drogba, who won four Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time with Chelsea, has been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League. But he will instead return to Stamford Bridge, where he is sure to receive a hero's welcome. Drogba will start out as a player but also take on ambassadorial and promotional duties for the club. Didier Drogba is set to return to Chelsea to take up a player-coaching role under Antonio Conte. The 39-year-old will be a player-coach, with his duties also extending into the club's commercial and marketing operations. The ex-Ivory Coast international striker, who scored 164 goals in 381 appearances in his first spell at the club, has been a free agent since leaving Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact in November. He had been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League, but will now take on a new role at the club where he won four Premier League titles and the Champions League. Didier Drogba is a Chelsea legend - but where does he rank among the club's all-time greatest players? Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest-ever player in a 2012 poll of more than 20,000 fans and has been linked with a return to the club for months. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has been desperate to strengthen his forward line in the January transfer window. He has already signed midfielder Ross Barkley from Everton for 15m, but the Italian is still looking for more options in attack. The club have also been linked with a 44m move for Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud and a 60m move for Roma's Edin Dzeko. The 39-year-old striker is to join the coaching staff at Stamford Bridge as well as continuing to play. Drogba made 381 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 164 goals, and will link up with the club until the end of the season. He was part of the side which won the Premier League four times, as well as four FA Cups and three League Cups. He also played a key role as the Blues won the Champions League for the first time in 2012. He scored nine goals in 14 Major League Soccer games for Montreal Impact last season. Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo said: ""Didier's return is a special one for so many different reasons. ""We all know his past contributions and the impact he had here but he has also made a significant contribution to us in his role as an ambassador. ""He is a great example of how we want our Chelsea legends to contribute to the wider work of the club and the foundation. ""He has done fantastic work in the community and he is a very popular figure with our supporters and staff alike.

"No, President Xi Jinping of China isn't back for second helpings from the Buckingham Palace banquet, this time it is the Indian prime minister who is stopping by. India has long had a complex relationship with the UK but for the first time in a long while, the Indians are coming with a real swagger. Britain is on a charm offensive with India but, as the largest democracy in the world, India has options and it is not afraid to play hard to get. In terms of India's economic relationship with the UK, the Brits have some catching up to do. Much of this is to do with Britain's post-colonial hangover. India, on the other hand, has had an extraordinary time in the last decade, perhaps the most extraordinary period in its history. The number of Indians living below the poverty line has fallen dramatically from 455 million to 270 million in the last ten years. There are more than 300 million Indians who are now considered middle class, with that figure expected to reach 600 million by 2025. Even if you remove the top 1 and top 10 from that figure, the size of the remaining Indian middle class is still larger than the entire population of the United Kingdom. That said, India is still a developing country with about 600 million Indians still living below the poverty line. The UK has a long history of trade and cultural ties with India and it is also one of the largest investors in India. But despite that, the UK is not one of India's top trading partners. In 2014, the UK was India's 13th largest trading partner with two-way trade at 15 billion. While that is small compared to China, it is still larger than trade with the Netherlands, a country with a similar population size to that of the UK. The British are now pitching to become India's number one partner in Europe. The UK also wants India to be the largest foreign investor in Britain. The UK already has the largest number of Indian companies in the world outside of India and is the largest foreign investor in India. Britain is also India's second largest source of investment and Britain has asked India to invest in its new infrastructure projects. The UK is planning to invest 500 billion in infrastructure over the next few years. There are plenty of other signs of a relationship on the up. This week, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation. But India is looking for a more balanced relationship and it is not afraid to play hard to get. In the last decade, India's relationship with the UK has changed. India is no longer a recipient of foreign aid. Instead, it is now a donor country. India is now also donating funds to the UK to help improve the lives of British citizens. India has also given aid to countries in Europe that are going through economic difficulties. Greece has received a line of credit of 5.4 billion and Hungary has received a line of credit of 300 million. One of the major issues that has come up in recent years is visas. India has made it clear that it expects better access for its citizens traveling to the UK. India has also been pushing the UK to speed up the extradition of criminals, especially those involved in financial crimes. The UK is also looking to get involved in India's ""Make in India"" program. This is the Indian prime minister's flagship program to boost local manufacturing and help India become a global manufacturing hub. The UK is also looking to get involved in India's plans to build 100 new smart cities. The UK is now actively seeking to attract Indian companies to invest in the UK and also to encourage UK companies to invest more in India. There are also discussions about India cooperating with the UK on its nuclear power program. India is looking to invest heavily in this sector in order to address its growing energy needs. A number of British universities are also looking to expand their presence in India. The UK is also looking to help India's space program and help it get a manned mission into space. India has been trying to get the UK to help it out with defense exports. Indian companies often look to get their products made in the UK. The Indians then sell them to the Indian government and pocket the difference. India has also been pushing the UK to give it a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The UK has been pushing for an expansion in the number of permanent seats on the UN Security Council but it is not clear that there is enough support for this. At the",0,236

Ms Anderson and her new husband Danny Glass, 29, from Margate, Kent, were travelling in Thailand when they were involved in the crash on 8 May. The couple had been married less than a month when the accident happened, with Mr Glass escaping serious injury. Ms Anderson's mother, Michelle Anderson, paid tribute to her daughter, who she described as a ""true angel.""

"Once Kyle Abbott dismissed Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for 59 in the third over of the day in Port Elizabeth, the tone was set. Abbott (2-38), Kagiso Rabada (3-77) and Imran Tahir (4-58) made life uncomfortable for the visitors and kept them under pressure throughout the 85.3 overs they batted. After a rain delay of 10 minutes, Rabada and Abbott were on target. Rabada was rewarded with the wicket of Kusal Mendis, who edged a short-pitched delivery to AB de Villiers at gully. It was the first time that Mendis had fallen in a Test in South Africa in five innings. He was the first of seven wickets to fall for 56 runs, which set the tone for the rest of the day. De Villiers took another catch at gully to dismiss Niroshan Dickwella for 20. His dismissal was the third in quick succession as Sri Lanka lost three wickets for 14 runs. Tahir struck two blows in his first over, dismissing Upul Tharanga (36) and Dhananjaya de Silva (2) in the space of three deliveries. Tahir's first wicket was a result of a poor shot selection by Tharanga. The batsman, who was on 36, attempted a sweep shot to a full delivery which was also outside leg stump, but only succeeded in gloving a catch to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. It was a poor shot from a senior batsman, considering that Sri Lanka was reeling from the loss of three wickets in quick succession. Mathews and Dickwella showed some fight with a partnership of 56 runs before the captain's departure. Tahir struck again when he dismissed Dinesh Chandimal (4) and Lahiru Kumara (0) in the space of two deliveries. Tahir, who is the leading wicket-taker in the series (13 wickets in two Tests), completed his fourth five-wicket haul when he dismissed Rangana Herath for a duck in the final session of play. The right-arm leg-spinner took a total of 5-58 in 18.3 overs. Sri Lanka lost their last six wickets for 36 runs to be bowled out for 205 in 59.1 overs. The Proteas reached 17 without loss in the three overs before the close of play. In the first session of play, South Africa struck twice, courtesy of a superb catch by De Kock and a brilliant direct hit from de Villiers. Kusal Perera (2) had a lucky escape on 12 when he was dropped by de Kock off a delivery from Rabada. De Kock was also responsible for the dismissal of Perera, when he took a low catch, also off Rabada, in the fourth over of the day. Perera scored 16, before he was dismissed with the total on 45. South Africa struck again when de Villiers ran out Mathews with a brilliant direct hit from long-on. Mathews had scored 59 off 89 deliveries. He was the only batsman to put up some resistance. The third Test match is in Johannesburg, starting on 12 January.",0,239
"The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to ""reduce significantly"" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the home secretary is still waiting for a response from the Ministry of Justice. In a letter to Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, which Newsnight has seen, Mrs May said she wanted to limit the use of Section 60 searches. These searches are carried out without reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Mrs May said the powers were ""highly contentious"" and could be ""counter-productive."" The letter, which was also sent to Prime Minister David Cameron, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and communities secretary Eric Pickles, said: ""I am writing to you to seek the support of cabinet colleagues in a proposed reduction in the use of section 60 stops and searches. ""The power, which allows officers to stop and search people without the need for reasonable suspicion, is highly contentious and, in my view, could be counter-productive in the fight against serious violence."" Mrs May said the powers could ""undermine public confidence in the police and divert resources from other, more effective tactics."" In the last two years, the number of section 60 searches has risen by 10 from 110,500 in 20089 to 121,600 in 200910. The home secretary set a deadline of 12 December for a response to the letter. But Newsnight has learned that the Home Office is still waiting for a response from the Ministry of Justice. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are currently working on a robust evidence base to reduce the use of section 60 without reasonable suspicion stop and search and are consulting with a number of stakeholders, including the police and civil liberties groups. ""The findings of this work will inform our next steps in this important area."" Figures from the Home Office show black people are seven times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched. They are also more likely to be stopped and searched than people of any other ethnic group in the country. Asian people are stopped and searched at twice the rate of white people and people from mixed race backgrounds are three times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. The Home Office said: ""Any use of stop and search must be intelligence-led and carried out in a way that is proportionate, accountable and targeted. ""The government is committed to ensuring that police powers are used fairly, responsibly and transparently."" It is not the first time Mrs May has tried to reduce the use of section 60. In April, Newsnight reported that she had written to all police forces in England and Wales calling on them to ""significantly"" reduce the use of the controversial searches. In the letter to police chiefs, she said ""the balance between protecting the public and ensuring fair and equal treatment for all has tipped too far towards the former."" But a Newsnight investigation in September revealed that most forces had actually increased their use of section 60. The Metropolitan Police Authority has just launched a review into its use of section 60 searches. Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said: ""I am pleased that the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) has decided to carry out a review into section 60 and I look forward to working with them to help shape their recommendations. ""The MPA is the body that represents the views of Londoners and this is an important opportunity to work with them and to share their findings across the country. ""The Met is committed to ensuring that stop and search is used fairly and proportionately.""",0,240

"Jon Schueler, who died in New York in 1992 at the age of 75, created many of his pieces from a studio in Mallaig in the Highlands. He was inspired by the Scottish landscape, which he found beautiful, challenging and scary. Born in Milwaukee in 1916, Schueler was the son of a Lutheran pastor, and was influenced from an early age by his religious upbringing. He was also strongly affected by the deaths of his parents during his childhood, and by the Second World War, in which he served as a pilot, flying missions over North Africa. He later claimed that he owed his artistic career to these two terrible events. In 1949 he moved to New York and enrolled at the Art Student's League. He soon began to show his work, and in 1951, aged 35, he had his first solo exhibition. This was followed by a trip to Paris, where he befriended the painters Sam Francis, Joan Mitchell and Robert Motherwell, who were to be important influences on his work. Returning to New York, Schueler took up a job as an art director in a TV advertising firm, and spent his spare time painting in his studio. He found commercial art unsatisfying, however, and continued to paint at every opportunity. In the mid-60s Schueler had a life-changing experience which was to affect the course of his art. He went to Iona, a small Hebridean island off the west coast of Scotland, to visit the grave of the late Abstract Expressionist painter, Robert Jensen. While he was on the island, he met the owner of a small hotel, who asked him if he would paint a mural on the wall of the bar. Schueler agreed, and as he worked, he began to realise the enormous effect of the sea and the sky on his artistic vision. He returned to New York, where he worked for some time on the Iona mural, but he continued to be obsessed by the Scottish light and colours, and by the effect they had on him. In 1969 he rented a house in Mallaig, and set about painting the Scottish landscape. Much of his work was inspired by the small isles of the Inner Hebrides, especially by the island of Skye, and he was particularly fascinated by the light, the rain and the atmosphere of the place. The weather, which is so changeable in this part of the world, was reflected in his paintings. He created misty, moody scenes, filled with colour, light and movement. The dark storm clouds seemed to hover over the sea and the land, but the sunshine was always there, just around the corner. Schueler's paintings were filled with drama, passion and emotion, and although the scenes he painted were often stormy and dark, they were also filled with beauty and hope. The mists and the clouds, the shadows and the light, all played their part in his paintings, and created the emotional impact which is so apparent in his work. Schueler described his art as ""a communication of my inner self to the outer world."" He said that he worked in the hope that his paintings would be looked at and studied, and that they would speak to people, helping them to express their own thoughts and feelings. Jon Schueler's work has been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A number of his paintings are on permanent display in galleries in Scotland, including the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness, Orkney. Jon Schueler left a legacy of beautiful paintings, which show the changing moods of the Scottish landscape. His work is a tribute to the strength, vitality and endurance of the natural world, and a celebration of the power of nature.",0,242
"She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her new bosses, Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole. But right now, Cher Lloyd is all about the music. After stealing the show on The X Factor with her unique voice and attitude, the 17-year-old from Malvern, Worcestershire, is gearing up for the release of her debut album. 'I'm really proud of it,' she says. 'It's quite gobby, but the thing about my music is that it's real. It's all about stuff that's happened to me. 'I'm a bit of a geek and I don't think I'm very attractive - I'm a little bit of an oddball,' she laughs. One of the tracks on the album is about bullying. 'When I was younger, I had some trouble, but I'm over it now,' she says. 'I just wanted to write about it because I know that a lot of people have been bullied. She's also been working with rapper Busta Rhymes on her debut single, which is released on August 14. And she's got a new hairstyle - a short crop - which she admits is a tribute to her idol Rihanna. 'I've always liked short hair, but I was a bit scared of it because it's quite edgy,' she says. But Cher knows how to make an entrance - in fact, the first time she met Cheryl, she was so nervous that she didn't realise who she was. 'I was in the toilet, thinking, ""I'm going to be sick! she says. 'And then I walked out and there was this girl with a Geordie accent who looked like Cheryl. I said, ""Oh my God, are you her?"" and she was like, ""Yeah."" 'I thought she was going to say I looked like a little squirrel and that my song was rubbish. But she was really nice. She said she loved my song and that I looked like a little angel. 'Cheryl's like my big sister. She knows everything about me and my life, and she just helps me through it all. 'She's been through it herself, so she knows what I'm going through. She's such a good friend, and she's taught me so much. She's helped me to be more confident in myself and my decisions. As for Simon, he's taken Cher to his heart - and she's almost a little in love with him, too. She laughs: 'I remember the first time we met. He said, ""I'm Simon Cowell and I'm going to make you a star."" I was like, ""Who the hell is this?"" I thought he was just saying it to be nice, but he was serious! 'It was weird at first, because I'm such a fan of his. I've got his autobiography and I've watched him on TV for years. I even recorded him on TV, so I can watch him over and over again! 'He's been so good to me. He's always been there for me. 'I've got his number and I can text him or call him whenever I like. He's very good at texting back and he takes time to speak to me. 'Sometimes, when I'm in the studio, I'll think, ""I can't do this, I can't do this!"" and I'll send him a text. Then he'll call me and say, ""Just get it done."" 'He knows that I'm always worrying about what people will think and if they'll like my music. He says he has to do that, too, because that's how you get better. 'He's got my back, and he's so protective of me. When we're together, he's like my dad. 'We have some really good banter, though. He's really funny. We'll be having a serious conversation and then he'll say something that's completely out of the blue and it will make me laugh. 'I love spending time with him.

"Councils are relying on agency workers to cover nearly 4,000 out of 5,500 otherwise empty posts. Social workers say they are under constant pressure because of media coverage and criticism of the profession. The number of children taken into care has increased in recent years, with more than 68,000 in care in England and Wales at the end of March 2007. The British Association of Social Workers said children's services were in crisis. The association's director, Nushra Mansuri, said: ""The number of children in care has increased significantly and this has been compounded by the recruitment and retention crisis in child care social work. ""The situation is dire, with councils resorting to using agency workers and consultants to plug gaps."" Ms Mansuri said there needed to be an independent review of how the profession was functioning. ""It is no good doing another public inquiry into another tragedy, it is time to look at the profession and ensure that social workers have the time and resources to do their job properly,"" she said. Social workers are under increasing pressure following a number of high profile cases in which children have been killed or abused. Recently, the government announced new proposals to give social workers and other professionals the right to know about cases of child abuse and neglect in other families. It also announced plans to create a new agency to attract and train staff for children's social work, to be known as Frontline. A spokesperson for the Children's Workforce Development Council, which was set up by the government to improve recruitment, retention and development of staff in children's services, said the number of vacancies in the sector had dropped. ""Since the creation of the CWDC, we have seen the number of vacancies fall significantly from 9 to 4.8,"" he said. ""We have also seen a sharp increase in the number of social work students entering training. ""The workforce is becoming more stable and the picture is improving, but we recognise that there is more work to do."" But the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said the shortage was real and urged the government to invest in recruitment and retention. Children and young people's board chairman Cllr David Rogers said: ""There is a shortage of child protection social workers in local government and this is a major concern. ""We have raised this issue with the government and they have acknowledged that there are real difficulties. ""It is essential that the government invests in the recruitment and retention of child protection social workers.""",0,244
"All four opposition parties at Holyrood want to repeal the football act. But the Scottish government says it will not do so without a ""viable alternative"" being put in place. And although all parties agree that the act must go, a consensus on what should replace it has yet to be reached. The football act is a ground-breaking piece of legislation which aims to tackle sectarianism and unruly behaviour in Scottish football. It was passed in 2011 by the Scottish Parliament, which at the time was run by a minority SNP administration. It gives the police greater powers to take action against individuals who shout sectarian abuse or make religiously aggravated threats of violence at matches. It also gives football clubs the power to ban supporters from matches and confiscate their season tickets if they repeatedly engage in unruly behaviour, such as running on to the pitch. Police in Scotland do not routinely monitor how many of these football banning orders are issued, but campaigners say that over 200 people have been banned from football grounds under the legislation. The act has also been used to target sectarian singing, although only 30 people have been charged with singing sectarian songs since the legislation came into force. The SNP's James Dornan, who was a member of the party's working group on sectarianism, said that the act was designed to combat ""the worst excesses"" of sectarianism in Scottish football. ""Sectarianism was banned by legislation in the 1970s,"" he said. ""I think that if the people who had been campaigning to stop this had spoken to people in Scottish football at the time, they would have said that they would have thought that the legislation was unnecessary, because sectarianism wasn't really a problem. ""But then, over the years, it became a problem, and it got to the stage that the authorities felt that legislation was necessary to tackle this. ""The legislation wasn't the end of it. It was just one stage in the fight against sectarianism in football."" But the act has been controversial from the start, with critics claiming that it infringes upon civil liberties and threatens freedom of speech. In 2013, human rights campaigners lost a court case at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg when they attempted to argue that the football act violated their right to freedom of expression. Scotland's only Tory MSP, Murdo Fraser, has long been a vocal critic of the football act. He believes that the police and the Crown Office should have been given more powers to tackle sectarian behaviour, without the need for a specific football act. ""I think that the legislation is totally unnecessary,"" he said. ""We already have legislation in place which can be used to address sectarianism and unruly behaviour, so I think this was a missed opportunity. ""I think that the police could have been given additional powers to crack down on this issue, but I don't think that we needed new legislation."" Several high-profile legal figures have also spoken out against the football act. These include Glasgow's chief prosecutor David Harvie, who said in 2015 that it had not made a ""significant impact"" on the problem of sectarianism in Scottish football. Lord Bracadale, the former Solicitor General for Scotland, also said in 2015 that the act had ""not had the desired impact."" The Scottish government says that the act has been ""useful in sending a strong message"" that unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated. But it also said that the legislation was ""never intended to be the sole solution"" to the problem of sectarianism in Scottish football. ""The Football Act and existing legislation, along with education programmes and the efforts of the clubs, police, prosecutors and others, have all contributed to a general improvement in behaviour and a reduction in instances of unacceptable conduct,"" said a government spokesman. ""The Scottish government would not support the repeal of the Act without a viable alternative."" All of the opposition parties at Holyrood want the football act to be repealed. Labour MSP James Kelly, who has been campaigning on the issue for several years, welcomed the fact that the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have joined his party in calling for the legislation to be scrapped. But he said that a consensus on what should replace the act is still to be reached. ""Every",0,245

"Friend, who cut his face, was treated in the tunnel before being taken to hospital, where he stayed overnight. The incident happened as the first half came to an end, and it was announced at half-time that the match would be abandoned. It is the latest in a series of incidents of violence at British football grounds. It is the second time this season that City's Carabao Cup match has been stopped by crowd trouble. Their game against Preston North End was briefly held up by home fans throwing objects on to the pitch as they protested against owner Trevor Hemmings. Meanwhile, a man was arrested after being shot in the leg outside the Emirates Stadium before Arsenal's game against Tottenham. The match at City's Etihad Stadium was halted in the 44th minute after the fan appeared to run onto the pitch. He was apprehended by stewards and police officers. A City fan who was at the game said the supporter was carrying an inflatable banana. The fan was then thrown to the ground by a steward, before being punched in the face by a police officer, said Gary Jordan, 33, who was sitting near the pitch. He said the fan had a ""bloodied nose"" and that he had been ""knocked out"" during the incident. ""It was nasty,"" he said. He said there was ""shock and confusion"" as fans and players were left in the dark over what was happening. ""There was a lot of commotion. No one knew what was going on,"" he said. He said that the atmosphere in the ground had been ""rowdy,"" with Leicester fans chanting and City fans responding. ""It was aggressive but nothing out of the ordinary,"" he said. Mr Jordan said that the incident did not appear to be targeted at any player. ""There was a lot of running around but it was not directed at anyone,"" he said. A statement from Greater Manchester Police said: ""A man has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer after he ran onto the pitch at Manchester City v Leicester.

"Former Newmarket Town player Shaun Whiter lost both his legs when he was hit helping his friend Joey Abbs to change a tyre near the Suffolk town.

The appeal hopes to raise 100,000 for a new house for his friend, who has been left paralysed. Whiter was 19 years old when he was hit by a car whilst changing a tyre on the A142 near Newmarket. He had just started his second season with the Jockeys. He said: ""It was my first time changing a tyre, I'd had my licence for a couple of years. ""We were in the middle of the road and I had my back to the traffic, so I didn't see the car coming. ""I remember hearing the engine, but the next thing I remember is waking up in hospital. ""There were a couple of months where I didn't know what was going on. I thought I was going to die, I thought I was in hell. Whiter's family were told that if he survived, he would be paralysed from the neck down. He managed to overcome the odds and lived, but had to have both his legs amputated as a result of the collision. He was in intensive care for four days after the crash, and spent a total of 13 days in hospital. ""I don't remember anything about being in hospital, but I was told my mum was on the phone to my dad saying 'he's going to die',"" he added. ""I was really lucky that I wasn't paralysed.

"The 42-year-old had regained the lead from Frenchman Armel Le Cleac'h, but was second as he passed the halfway mark just off New Zealand's south island. Thomson's next milestone is Cape Horn. The Vendee Globe is the most challenging sailing race on Earth and this year's event has already seen one sailor forced to retire after his boat was badly damaged and a second dismasted. Spindrift 2 was 15,858km from the finish at 1300hrs UTC. The 11th edition of the round the world race, dubbed the Everest of sailing, began in France on November 6. Le Cleac'h has been in the lead since December 3, when he overtook Britain's Alex Thomson. His rival was 500 nautical miles ahead but his lead dwindled to just 18 miles on Thursday, according to live tracking data. Le Cleac'h, 39, is seeking to become the first French victor of the race in its current non-stop format. Gabart was not only able to get his vessel moving again, but also made up a fair bit of ground, and at 16:00 GMT he had made it into third place, 271 nautical miles behind Le Cleach. A self-confessed ""water baby"" who grew up sailing around the coasts of Scotland, Thomson is attempting to become the first British victor of the Vendee Globe. While Thomson and Le Cleac'h may be first and second, there is plenty to fight for further back in the fleet. In third place is Frenchman Jeremie Beyou (Maitre CoQ), some 400 miles from the lead, while Britain's Alex Thomson (Hugo Boss) is 80 miles adrift of Beyou in fourth. Last year, he was forced to retire from the Barcelona World Race with electric problems, and in 2012 he was dismasted in the Vendee Globe. Sixth-placed Yann Elies (Queguiner - Leucemie Espoir) was the latest to pass the Cape of Good Hope, which he did this morning. The first four boats are expected to cross the finish line in Les Sables d'Olonne, France, in about three weeks. ""I would love to make it onboard this boat but, in fact, I can't imagine how I would do that,"" Gabart said, according to the race's website.",0,256

"The group, a mix of students and activists, were arrested while taking part in a protest two weeks ago against a new education bill. They face possible jail terms on charges including illegal assembly. There have been growing concerns for their safety and welfare since they were arrested, with Amnesty International saying they were ""victims of an unlawful police operation."" Ms Macron and Mr Xi were joined by their spouses, Brigitte and Peng Liyuan, for the dinner at the Elysee Palace in Paris. She said the French president had told his Chinese counterpart ""that human rights should be guaranteed and that the right to demonstrate should be protected."" The rights group also called on China to ""release immediately and unconditionally"" the students. ""The Chinese authorities must immediately end the crackdown on students and activists protesting in support of workers' rights, and release those detained for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,"" said William Nee, China Researcher at Amnesty International. ""While Xi Jinping was enjoying French cuisine and wine, Chinese authorities were violently arresting and detaining student activists. ""The students and activists are now at risk of torture and other ill-treatment,"" he added. Mr Nee also said that, rather than arresting the activists, the Chinese authorities should be ""investigating allegations that state security officers beat and injured student protesters in early June."" Meanwhile, the UK government is said to be ""deeply concerned"" by the arrests. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""We have raised our concerns about the detentions with the Chinese authorities and we will continue to monitor the situation closely."" The arrests have been strongly condemned by Amnesty International, with China researcher William Nee saying they showed ""a chilling disregard for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest."" ""The authorities have tried to present the arrests as evidence of a foreign-backed conspiracy, but the simple truth is that these activists have been detained solely for peacefully standing up for workers' rights."" He added: ""These are just the latest examples of the authorities' relentless assault against human rights activists in China, where bravely standing up for human rights can mean arrest, torture, and years of imprisonment.""",0,258

"The county has received PS1bn of aid over the past 15 years with more than PS400m in the pipeline until 2020 because of its relatively weak economy. Cornwall Council leader Adam Paynter welcomed the new deal but said it must be about ""more than just cash."" ""We are determined to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it,"" he said. The British government said Tuesday it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, saying that that would help the country to uphold the 2015 Paris global climate agreement. The government also announced that it plans to invest more in charging infrastructure for electric cars. The UK's move to ban new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 has been labelled ""a step in the right direction"" by the country's biggest motoring organisation. ""We can't carry on with diesel and petrol cars,"" he said. ""If electric cars are to be more accessible to households without off-street parking, it's important that the Government now work with local authorities to ensure that the necessary charging infrastructure is put in place."" The UK already has the largest market for ultra-low emission vehicles in the European Union, worth an estimated 2 billion, and the fourth largest in the world, the department for transport says. But critics said the ban should come earlier - and should target hybrid vehicles too. The National Infrastructure Commission has predicted that by 2050 the United Kingdom would need between 23,000 and 30,000 new rapid charge points - compared with just over 12,000 now. ""It's fantastic that the government has finally recognised the importance of clean air, but 2040 is too late - air pollution will continue to prematurely kill thousands of people across the United Kingdom, and leave many more choking on dirty fumes,"" he said. The government is also set to roll out a new Clean Air Fund worth around 220 million to support local authorities' work to reduce emissions. Jesse Norman, the junior Transport Minister, told the BBC that hybrids would still be allowed under the proposals. The Volkswagen scandal could also help convince consumers to move to electric cars. The Conservatives originally announced their intention to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2015, but the party's manifesto for the 2017 General Election did not include a specific date for the ban to come into force. The UK will also establish an worldwide ""Centre of Excellence"" to help developing countries reduce their emissions. Asked if the Government's plans were ambitious enough, he said: ""We are on the right path."" ""The High Court must force the government to deliver on their commitment to reduce illegal air pollution."" The government's move follows a similar announcement in July by France, which said it would also end the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 as part of a plan to become carbon neutral by 2050. But environmental groups have said the plans do not go far enough. A ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040 will be announced in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday, according to reports. ""It is not just the public that needs to take action to prevent air pollution, it is a collective responsibility of government, industry and individuals. We want nearly every auto and van on United Kingdom roads to be zero emission by 2050, which is why we've committed to investing more than 600m in greener transport.""

"Intense negotiations are under way between political parties amid public anger at a one-off levy of up to 10 being imposed on savers. President Nicos Anastasiades said refusing the bailout could lead to the collapse of the banking sector. In 1974, the island was divided when Turkey invaded and occupied the north of Cyprus in response to a Greek-inspired coup. The country has been run as a single entity since then, with the Republic of Cyprus controlling the southern part of the country and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus the northern part. Earlier, the government issued a decree to limit cash withdrawals to 100 euros per day, to prevent a run on the nations banks. Banks have also been ordered to remain shut until Thursday, at the earliest. Thousands of students marched on the presidential palace on Monday to protest the levy, which will be applied to all bank balances above 100,000 euros (85,000) as a condition of the bailout. The deal is expected to be ratified in the Cypriot parliament by Tuesday afternoon. The deal, which was agreed with eurozone finance ministers, will see Cyprus receive 10bn in bailout cash from the EU and IMF. In return, depositors with more than 100,000 euros in Cypriot banks will be taxed at 9.9, while smaller depositors will be taxed at 6.75. Those who have money in Cyprus bank accounts will see 10 of their deposits over 100,000 euros automatically go to the government. In addition to the levy, Cyprus will also make changes to the way its banks are run. One of the countrys biggest banks, Laiki, will be restructured and another, Bank of Cyprus, will also be subject to a major overhaul. The 10bn bailout will also be used to help recapitalise the countrys banks. The BBCs chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym said that the levy would take money from the richest in Cypriot society and make a contribution to the cost of the bailout. The deal was agreed in Brussels on Sunday night, following a week of intense negotiations between Cyprus and the eurozone. The discussions were prolonged by Cypriot efforts to protect the wealthiest Russians who hold deposits in Cypriot banks. The BBCs Gavin Hewitt, in Brussels, said that by imposing the levy on savers, the EU was breaking a fundamental taboo in eurozone bailouts. When other countries have been bailed out, the emphasis has been on the so-called bondholders - those who lent money to the stricken country. Mr Anastasiades said Cyprus had been left with no choice but to accept the levy on depositors. ""This solution we reached tonight is not what we wanted, but its the least painful under the circumstances,"" he said. Mr Anastasiades said his government had fought until the end to protect small deposit-holders, who will now be exempt from the tax. ""We held a tough, decisive negotiations... where the EU and the IMF insisted on the deposit levy,"" he said. ""We are not shutting the door to any discussion or negotiations."" Mr Anastasiades said he had also fought to retain the countrys 10 corporation tax - a key selling point for foreign investors - but had ultimately lost that battle. The levy on deposits will be applied to all Cypriot accounts in all the countrys banks, including the second largest, Laiki, and the co-operative credit sector. The deal was described as a bad deal for Cypriot savers by the UKs Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. ""I think anyone listening to this programme will find it extraordinary that the suggestion is that the people with the biggest deposits - the Russians, who have the biggest deposits in Cyprus - will end up having to make fewer sacrifices than the people with smaller deposits,"" he said. ""Im sure that is not a tenable position. ""In the end, Cyprus is a sovereign nation. Its the Cypriot government that needs to make these decisions. ""But I think its very clear that the",0,262

"Samuel Walker was fatally injured in a hit-and-run as he crossed a road in Chorlton, Manchester, in February 2003. Joyrider Nawnee Mackin, 35, was jailed for nine years in November 2004 for killing the student in the crash. Mackin had been involved in a police chase and was driving a stolen car at more than twice the speed limit when he hit Samuel. The following February Samuel's father, Michael, was charged with a section 3 offence under the Road Traffic Act, for failing to ensure that his son wore a seatbelt. This offence carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a 5,000 fine. The prosecution came about because of a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Manchester to apply to magistrates for a summons, following the death of Samuel. RoSPA was disappointed to learn that the CPS has decided not to take this prosecution any further. It is clearly not appropriate to prosecute parents for not restraining children properly in cars if there has been a fatal crash, where the child was not in control of the vehicle. On a wider level, however, RoSPA believes that there are many other cases where the CPS is failing to use the law to hold parents to account. There have been several cases where people have died in car crashes involving unrestrained children, and the parents have not been prosecuted. This is despite the fact that the Government's own statistics show that in the past five years, 80 children aged 12 and under have died in road crashes while not wearing a seat belt. RoSPA is currently calling for the CPS to make it a policy that all parents who fail to restrain their children in cars are prosecuted. We believe that this will encourage more parents to buckle up their children, and will therefore prevent more needless child deaths and injuries. We are calling on the CPS to review its policy on prosecuting parents who fail to restrain children in cars.",0,265

"You can contact your local police, who are the only people with the proper powers to assess criminal allegations. However, the Metropolitan Police, which is leading the Savile investigation, is unlikely to get involved in a historical allegation unless it can be linked to a contemporary crime. The Savile investigation is also understood to have been scaled down, with the number of detectives involved reduced from about 30 to about a dozen. The Met has said that it has no intention of chasing every allegation made on the internet. Allegations of sexual assault are notoriously difficult to investigate and police officers will need to be convinced that it is in the public interest to investigate what are, in effect, historical allegations. A file would have to be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service for it to determine whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. The BBC is not the right body to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour. It can, however, investigate allegations of misconduct, but only by people who are current employees or BBC trustees. If you want to make a complaint about a BBC employee, you should contact the BBC and provide as much detail as you can.

Almost a third of the 2015 claims were made in the Central African Republic, where a UN mission began operating in September 2014. ""I express my profound regret at the resurgence in the number of allegations in 2015 and the very fact that any such exploitation and abuse occurs,"" the UN's deputy secretary-general, Jan Eliasson, told the UN General Assembly in New York. Alleged abuses by peacekeepers have included rape, sexual assault, exploitation and the abduction and trafficking of women and girls, Eliasson said. The UN says it works to strengthen discipline, but it has limited power to investigate or prosecute troops who commit crimes while serving in peacekeeping missions. ""The United Nations has no enforcement power over these troops and no legal authority to investigate and prosecute crimes,"" Eliasson said. ""This is an area where we need to work with the troop-contributing countries and it is a work in progress."" Most of the troops accused of abuses are from African countries. The UN has said it has a zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse. Eliasson said the UN needs to actively follow up on each allegation of misconduct, to support victims of sexual exploitation and abuse and ensure their rights are respected and to strengthen discipline and accountability.

"Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would ""address the consequences"" of this. ""I am fighting against selective solidarity,"" the European Commission president told the BBC. David Cameron is to hold a cabinet meeting later to discuss the migrant crisis. He has promised to deal with ""the causes of the migration crisis,"" including the push factors encouraging people to leave their home countries. European leaders have been divided on how to respond to the crisis. Asked about the prime minister's argument that the UK has borne the brunt of the crisis, Mr Juncker said: ""I do not accept the argument that the UK was not aware of the consequences of the decisions it was taking in 2004. ""That is a joke, a complete joke."" He said the UK had opted out of the 1997 Schengen agreement that allows free movement around the EU's passport-free zone, and had always had the option of imposing migration controls on the eight states joining the EU in 2004. ""I'm not in a blaming game, I'm not in a guilt game, I'm in a game trying to find a solution,"" Mr Juncker added. ""The British have to know that there is an impact on Britain if freedom of movement ends,"" he said. ""If the British want to limit freedom of movement they have to know this would have serious consequences. ""You cannot destroy the fundamental principles of the EU and still want to have the economic advantages of the EU."" Mr Cameron is holding talks with other EU leaders this week on migration - including German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday - ahead of a summit of EU heads of state and government on Wednesday. On Thursday he is to meet the leaders of the four Visegrad Group countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - which have seen the biggest increase in refugees. He will then head to Denmark for a meeting with Nordic and Baltic leaders. The UK has offered to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years but Mr Cameron said the UK was already doing ""a huge amount"" to help those fleeing conflict in Syria. Leading businessmen have signed a letter to the prime minister urging him to back a more ""humanitarian"" approach to the refugee crisis. Sir Richard Branson, who organised the letter, said ""we're all agreed that this refugee crisis is the biggest humanitarian crisis of our lifetime."" The letter, signed by 103 UK entrepreneurs, urges Mr Cameron to expand the number of refugees the UK will accept and to take in more of those refugees who are seeking safety from the conflict in Syria. The group also suggests the UK should offer to take 10,000 refugees a year for the next two years.",0,277

Parry saved again from Dobbie after the break, but the hosts were still able to grab a 2-1 victory. ""It's disappointing we didn't win the game because we had the chances,"" said Parry. ""When you go 2-0 down to a team like Swansea it's going to be difficult. ""We had enough chances to win the game, but you can't give them two goals. ""It was a good game. It was physical, it was quick, it was end-to-end. ""But we have to defend better and take the chances we get."" Everton had a man sent off in a 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham but the red card was not the major talking point after the game. A scuffle between the two teams after a bad challenge by Everton's Jack Rodwell on Aaron Lennon overshadowed the result. ""It was a nasty challenge. It's as simple as that,"" said Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas. ""It was out of order, but I don't think he's like that. He's a young boy. ""The referee has to do what the referee has to do. He booked him and then he sent him off. ""You can understand the frustration from the lad, but when you do something like that you have to pay for it.

You have to have that determination. But it's not nice when you see one of your team-mates get hurt like that."" Villa beat Arsenal 2-0 at Villa Park to ease their relegation fears, but midfielder Stiliyan Petrov played down the importance of the result.

""We have to show the same commitment and mentality in every game and we will be fine. ""We've got to make sure we don't get too carried away, but we have a massive game against West Ham on Sunday."" Manchester United came from behind to beat Hull 4-3 in the weekend's most exciting game. Wayne Rooney's 83rd-minute goal settled the game after Geovanni had given Hull an early lead. But United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was unhappy with the performance of referee Alan Wiley, who sent off Darron Gibson and Paul Scholes for two bookable offences. ""I didn't think it was a sending-off,"" said Ferguson of Gibson's dismissal. ""He's a young boy, playing his first game in the Premier League, and he's got a terrible decision against him. ""I don't think it was a booking. I think it was a very poor decision by the referee. ""When you see young players making their debut in a derby game and getting booked, then you're asking them to play the rest of the game not committing themselves and that can be very difficult."" Liverpool beat Blackburn 4-0 at Anfield to move ahead of United at the top of the table on goal difference. Javier Mascherano scored twice and Steven Gerrard and Ryan Babel also netted as the Reds took full advantage of United's defeat at the KC Stadium. ""We knew we could take advantage of Manchester United losing and we did that,"" said Mascherano. ""We played well and deserved to win."" Liverpool play at home to Chelsea next weekend in what could be a crucial clash at the top of the Premier League. ""It will be a good game,"" said Mascherano.

"Correspondents said the atmosphere at schools was subdued and many pupils had not returned. They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with immediate effect. Children in rural areas are unlikely to return to school on Monday because of the logistical challenge of getting them back to school safely. In the capital, Freetown, children are expected to return to school on Monday but correspondents say it is not clear if all of them will go back. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital says some parents have told him they are still too scared to send their children back to school. Sierra Leone's education ministry says that 5,957 children have been orphaned by Ebola, and 1,665 teachers have died. The World Health Organization (WHO) says more than 10,000 people have been infected with Ebola, and 4,951 have died. The WHO said on Friday that the number of people being infected with Ebola was declining and it was ""realistic"" to hope to end the epidemic within a few months. ""We are beginning to see some reversal in trend in the epidemic,"" WHO assistant director general Bruce Aylward told a news conference in Geneva. ""We are seeing significant reductions in incidence in the three worst-affected countries,"" he said. The figures indicate the trend is being reversed but it is too soon to say the crisis is over, our correspondent adds. ""Based on what we know about how humans respond to these outbreaks and the current response efforts, it is reasonable to hope that this epidemic may be brought to an end soon,"" he said. ""We have stopped the exponential growth but we are still, in the three hardest-hit countries, we are still increasing in terms of the number of cases we are seeing."" He said there had been ""a significant drop"" in Liberia, the country worst-hit by the outbreak. Meanwhile, the UN's special envoy for Ebola, David Nabarro, said 80 of people who contracted the disease were surviving. He said that getting more health workers to the three worst-affected countries was the key to ending the epidemic. A UN mission to Ebola-hit countries in West Africa is expected to be launched on Monday. The UN mission's 200 volunteers will be drawn from the UN, World Bank, IMF and Red Cross. Ebola, which causes massive internal bleeding and organ failure, has killed more than 4,900 people in West Africa. The three hardest-hit countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - have reported more than 10,000 confirmed and suspected cases. Cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States. The death toll in Guinea has risen to 1,126, health officials say, and 1,519 in Liberia. Sierra Leone has reported 1,397 deaths, but the figure is likely to be higher as many families bury bodies without consulting the authorities.",0,280

"The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while under the care of the Belfast Trust. The review said the trust had been wrong to believe the children had been trafficked, and failed to spot warning signs of sexual exploitation. The children were taken into care following allegations of neglect and abuse. They were then placed in residential care homes across Northern Ireland. The review found that none of the children had been properly assessed before being placed in care. This meant that the trust did not have an understanding of the risks they faced. A number of concerns were raised about the children going missing but these were dismissed. The review said this was wrong and it was clear the children were at significant risk. One of the children, a 14-year-old girl, went missing on 21 separate occasions, at times returning with older men. The review was critical of the fact that the children's social workers were not told when they went missing or if they had been found. Police officers who came across them while they were missing were not told that the children were in care. This meant that an opportunity to protect them was missed. The review said that the children's needs were not properly met because they were not properly assessed. All of the children were placed in care with unrelated children, even though they had all experienced abuse in their homes. The trust believed the children had been trafficked for prostitution, but the review found no evidence to support this. A spokesperson from the NSPCC said: ""These children were incredibly vulnerable and should have been properly looked after. It is shocking that those responsible for their care failed to protect them from abuse and instead dismissed concerns and put them at further risk. Councillor Pat Convery, from Belfast City Council, said the council and the trust must now act on the review's recommendations. He added: ""This report is a damning indictment of the way in which the Belfast Trust failed to protect some of the most vulnerable children in its care.""

"While its existence has become a source of controversy on both sides of the Channel, some are also angry at attempts to destroy it. This includes the Football Lads Alliance, a UK group formed in response to the terror attacks in London and Manchester, which has now lodged a complaint with the Crown Prosecution Service over the matter. ""It is also in the public interest to ensure that political correctness is not being placed ahead of the rule of law,"" it said in a statement. Some in Britain have called for the arrest of the driver after the incident, which took place on August 14, was first reported in the French media. In response, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""We have received a number of third party reports in relation to this incident, however we have not received a complaint. ""We will not be taking any further action."" It comes after an article in the Mail on Sunday claimed the driver had left Britain, while a spokesman for the Foreign Office said in a statement: ""We are aware of reports of the arrest of a British man in France. ""Our staff are providing assistance to the family and remain in contact with the French authorities."" Meanwhile, a spokesman for the French prosecutor's office in Calais said the driver has been released on bail and is due to return to court in the city on October 23. The spokesman said the driver has been charged with ""endangering the life of others."" It is unclear what happened to the man who was hit by the car. The Mail on Sunday said the driver was ""well known in football circles,"" and that the family of the man hit by the car are ""connected to the football world."" The Football Lads Alliance, which describes itself as ""a diverse movement of ordinary people brought together by a love of football and a desire for a safe and inclusive game for all,"" also accused the Metropolitan Police of failing to act because of ""political correctness.""

"Confessions had been forced from the Muslim men after they were beaten up in custody, a rights activist said. They were among a group of people arrested late last year. At least four men were beaten to death in prison in the past month, Amnesty International said. The city authorities said that the men had been planning attacks on hotels and foreigners. The authorities said they were in possession of a large amount of ammunition, and had been plotting to kidnap foreigners and attack luxury hotels. The detained men were held for questioning and a court was told that confessions had been forced from the suspects after they were beaten up in custody. This is the latest in a series of incidents in the country in which police have been accused of brutality. A recent report by Amnesty International said that at least four people had been beaten to death in prison in the past month. ""We are appalled by the abuses committed against these men, who were tortured, detained in secret and denied access to lawyers, family members and medical care,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""The Egyptian authorities must immediately order an independent and impartial investigation into these abuses, and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice in fair trials."" He said the authorities must also ""order a prompt, independent and impartial investigation into all allegations of torture or other ill-treatment in detention, and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice in fair trials."" Mr Luther said the authorities must also ""publicly condemn torture and other ill-treatment and take effective steps to prevent it."" The Ministry of the Interior said that on 30 August the men were arrested in possession of ammunition and plans to carry out attacks in the city. The statement said that the men had been in possession of an ""arsenal of weapons and ammunition, maps of the city's hotels, money in a number of currencies, prepaid mobile phone cards and computers."" They were said to have been planning to kidnap foreigners and attack hotels. The men were in custody for two months before they were brought before an emergency state security court on 31 October. The statement said that 21 people were arrested. Some of the men have been named by rights organisations as: Kareem Mohammed Abdel Aziz, Ahmed Abd El Fattah Abu El-Gheit, Abdel Fattah Mohamed Abd El Fattah, Mohammed Abdel Aziz Mohamed Omar, Osama Sayed Abd El-Aziz and Mohamed Osama El-Sayed. ""We believe that they were tortured in order to force them to confess to charges that they had not committed,"" said Mr Abdel Fattah's lawyer, Ragia Omran. She said that she was told by her client that he had been electrocuted. ""They were beaten and tortured by the police to force them to confess and they were threatened that if they did not confess, they would be raped,"" she told the BBC. Ms Omran said that the men had been kept in secret detention for 50 days. She said that the men were not allowed to see lawyers until they were presented before a court, and that they had been denied access to medical care. They were denied the right to see their families for 50 days, she said. ""We believe that these are very serious charges and the way the police have conducted this case is also very serious,"" Ms Omran said. Rights group Amnesty International has said that the men were beaten while in custody. ""The men were beaten and given electric shocks, and were threatened with rape to make them confess to the charges against them,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. He said that the ""death sentences followed grossly unfair trials"" and that the men had been tortured in order to force them to confess.

She wanted to demolish her Kensington house to make way for a basement. But neighbours objected and a bitter row erupted. Westminster council said the red and white stripes, which were visible from the street, ""reduced the value of the property and were detrimental to the visual amenity of the conservation area."" Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring denied painting the candy stripes and claimed that she had been a victim of vandalism. During the hearing, the council also claimed that the owner had also painted the doors and window frames of the house, which she denies. The magistrates found her guilty of painting the stripes and also of painting the doors and window frames of the property, saying that the case was proved beyond reasonable doubt. The court was told that the painting of the stripes and the doors and window frames would have cost in excess of 500, which is the starting point for prosecutions under Section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. After the hearing, the council said in a statement: ""The owner of the property was also found guilty of painting the doors and window frames of the property, an offence which she had not admitted and was not the subject of a summons.""

"It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout. Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for Hibs, firing wide in the opening minutes. Hearts had won the first leg 1-0 at Tynecastle through a Kyle Lafferty goal. And he might have done so again in the opening minutes when he found himself in space in the penalty area. But he pulled his shot wide of the post. And Mallan's miss was the closest either team came to scoring in a first half that was anything but a classic. Neither side really managed to gain any sort of ascendency and the match was low on excitement. The crowd of 20,000 - down on the 31,000 who were at the first leg - reflected the lack of quality on show. The second half did not improve and Hibs manager Neil Lennon admitted his side had been well below par. ""I can't really explain why,"" he said. ""There was no energy or zip about us and that's the disappointing thing. ""But we'll take it and it's another cup final which is a great position to be in."" Hearts, who have not won the Scottish Cup since 1998, have the consolation of securing a place in next season's Europa League qualifiers.

"The price of West Texas crude sank to 37.65 (PS24.99) a barrel, a drop of 5.8, while Brent Crude fell 5.3 to 40.73 a barrel.

The FTSE 100 was down 2.7 per cent in early trading, after falling 2.2 per cent on Monday, while Germany's DAX shed 3 per cent and France's CAC 40 was down 2.6 per cent.

""In China, the slide in the stock markets is something we've seen before, but the yuan slide is a new element, and it's the one that really spooked the markets."" The price of crude has fallen steadily since Opec decided against cutting production in December. Since then, the price of oil has fallen 20 per cent, with analysts predicting it could drop as far as 20 a barrel. While the drop in the oil price should help boost global economic growth, it has forced oil companies to slash jobs and slash their spending. ""The oil price is the most important asset price in the world, because it affects everybody,"" said David Buik at Panmure Gordon. ""The sharp fall in the oil price is a reflection of how quickly the world is slowing down. The oil companies are now forced to lay off thousands and cut spending.""

"It says increases will be needed if current trends in teacher recruitment and retention continue. Nevertheless, the STRB has recommended a pay rise of just 1 for teachers in England and Wales, with a higher increase of 2 for experienced teachers, including advanced skills teachers, special educational needs coordinators and lead practitioners. This is despite the fact that the teacher recruitment crisis has deepened. We now have one of the biggest shortfalls of teachers on record. Some 35,000 teachers left the profession in the year to November 2016. As a result, nearly 20 of schools now say they have at least one unfilled post. This is a direct consequence of the Government's decision to ignore the STRB's recommendation last year that teachers should receive a 2 pay rise. The Government has frozen teachers' pay awards for four years, and has restricted the annual uplift for most teachers to 1 in 2016.

"However, the report concluded there had been ""no overarching state conspiracy."" Sir Desmond de Silva's review confirmed that agents of the state were involved in the 1989 killing and that soldiers and police had carried out ""investigative failures."" But it said there was no evidence of state agents carrying out ""further acts with the intention of preventing the investigation of the perpetrators."" The report was commissioned in 2011 by then prime minister David Cameron and was published after a court fight with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It said the murder had been carried out by the IRA, but that it was ""very likely"" that its leadership did not sanction the killing. The report said there was ""no overarching state conspiracy"" to murder the Belfast solicitor. The 1999 inquiry into the murder concluded that the soldiers had deliberately set out to murder the 29-year-old and that their officers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had conspired to cover it up. The De Silva review confirmed that there was no direct evidence of involvement in the murder by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. Mr. De Silva said: ""This is a case where the perpetrators of the murder were not within the ranks of the security forces but were men who were members of, and who were being controlled by, a terrorist organization, namely the Provisional IRA, and I conclude that there was no overarching state conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane.""

""I believe that the De Silva review is a significant step in bringing about the necessary truth and justice which his family has sought."" Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said: ""The De Silva review has failed to fully and independently investigate the role of the British state in the murder of Pat Finucane. ""The review's acknowledgement that members of the RUC, Special Branch, the UDA and British army were involved in the murder of Pat Finucane raises the issue of collusion. ""However the review has failed to acknowledge the extent of collusion and the pivotal role of the British state in the murder of Pat Finucane."" Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said: ""It's deeply disappointing that the De Silva review has concluded that there was 'no overarching state conspiracy' to murder Patrick Finucane.

Haldane's remarks echo the view of many other policy makers who have been taken aback by a recent slowdown in China and emerging markets, combined with a fresh intensification of the banking crisis in Europe. The BoE has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent for more than six years and most economists polled by Reuters do not expect rates to rise until the first quarter of 2017. Haldane said the central bank's forecasts for wage growth had turned out to be too optimistic and the BoE had ""failed to pick up this slowdown in the strength of wage growth as the labour market has recovered. ""As a result, inflationary pressures have been lower than we forecast,"" Haldane said. He said the slowdown in wage growth was likely to be a combination of lower productivity growth and weaker demand for labour due to the rise in self-employment and zero-hours contracts. Haldane said this meant Britain's recovery from the financial crisis was likely to be ""long and drawn out"" as household spending was likely to be weaker than in past recoveries. ""These headwinds to household spending growth are likely to persist for some time,"" Haldane said. Haldane said the current recovery from the financial crisis was ""solid, but not spectacular"" and there were risks to the outlook including a potential ""brittle recovery."" ""On the upside, there is the possibility of a swift and self-sustaining recovery. On the downside, the risk of a long and drawn-out expansion,"" Haldane said. Haldane said he expected interest rates to be higher in three years' time than they are today, but this was conditional on a ""smooth exit"" from unconventional monetary policy. ""Should the exit be bumpier than hoped, the path for interest rates could be shallower and the point at which interest rates rise could be later,"" Haldane said.",0,311
"Critics say the new contract involves pay cuts of up to 30, with ""normal hours"" extended to include 7am to 10pm on every day except Sunday. The British Medical Association has written to health minister Ben Bradshaw urging him to stop the contracts being signed. But despite the opposition, the Royal College of Nursing said yesterday that the new contracts have been accepted by nurses in 168 of the 247 trusts where they are being piloted, and that more than 3,000 staff are working under the terms. The NHS is also backing the new contracts, saying that they will help to cut staff sickness rates and improve recruitment and retention. However, the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has issued a legal challenge, claiming that the new contracts have not been properly negotiated. The RCM also wants a guarantee that the new contracts will not be extended to the NHS at large. BMA chairman James Johnson has written to Mr Bradshaw to express the concerns of doctors who work in hospitals which are adopting the new contracts. ""The contracts are forcing doctors to take a pay cut in exchange for working more than the agreed hours of service, with a significant proportion of doctors facing a pay cut of up to 30 per cent,"" the letter reads. ""This has led to a further demoralisation of the medical workforce, a situation which is not conducive to the delivery of high quality patient care."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health defended the new contracts, saying that they were the result of months of negotiation and consultation with nurses and doctors. ""The modernising nursing and midwifery contracts are about better patient care,"" she said. ""They will reduce bureaucracy, reduce the need for overtime and free nurses from unnecessary tasks, and give nurses more control over their working lives. ""They will not save money in the long term and will mean that thousands more nurses and midwives will be available when patients need them most.""",0,312
"It could be over in hours - or it could take weeks. That's how unknowable an acute counter-terrorism investigation can be for MI5 and the police. While there is a well-known '77-type' threat of a spectacular attack by suicide bombers, there is also the 'low-tech' danger of gun-wielding jihadis, with only a handful of targets, who are much harder to detect. For the last decade, Britain has been on a terrorism alert that is 'severe'. The public are regularly advised to be 'vigilant', but what does that mean? What do the police and MI5 really know about the threat? What are they doing about it? Is Britain any safer now than it was in 2005? In this rich and authoritative account, BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera brings together the full story of the jihadis who have threatened and attacked Britain. He shows for the first time how the 'war on terror' has been fought in the shadows at home - in the ranks of MI5, at the desks of GCHQ, in the UK's two most controversial counter-terrorism operations and on the streets of Britain's major cities. Security forces now have more powers than ever, but are they winning? And if so, at what price?

"North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said a so-called ""fix room"" could reduce drug deaths and the spread of infection. He said the proposed plan came in response to an increase in drug-related deaths across the UK. Mr Jones said he would like to hear the views of communities across the region. The Police and Crime Commissioner for North Wales, Arfon Jones, said he has received an application from a leading drugs charity to run a safe injecting room in Wrexham. The PCC said he is now inviting the public to share their views on the application by CAIS (Cais) to run a so-called fix room for the first time in Wales. Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru, Mr Jones said he is willing to listen to both sides of the argument. He said he has already taken the time to speak to the head of the Police Federation in North Wales, Geraint Lloyd Evans, who has expressed concern at the proposed facility. The PCC said he wanted to know what the people of Wrexham thought about the scheme. He also said that he had received letters from local residents who were in favour of the facility. ""Drug-related deaths in Wales are increasing, and the situation is especially acute in North Wales,"" said Mr Jones. ""We need to do everything we can to ensure we don't lose any more lives to drugs and I am certain that a safe injecting room will go some way to achieving this. ""I have received an application from CAIS, who are well-respected in this area, to open a safe injecting room in Wrexham.

A public meeting will be held at the Guildhall in Wrexham on September 12 from 7pm to 8pm. It is understood that the consultation will also ask for views on the location of the proposed facility. The commissioner added: ""It is clear that there is no single answer to the problem of drugs in society and this is one initiative that I hope will make a difference. ""It is my responsibility to listen to all points of view and to be open and transparent in my decision making."" Police and Crime Commissioner for North Wales Arfon Jones has announced a public consultation on a controversial plan to open the UK's first drug consumption room.

"The Labour authority voted in favour of changing 2,700 contracts from 52 weeks to term time-only. The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers in the area on term-time contracts. However, the GMB union said the decision was ""an absolute disgrace."" The council has pledged to give staff in the schools a pay rise of 2.2 to reflect the change in contracts. Leader of the Labour group on the council, Councillor Sue Murphy, said the council had ""gone out of its way"" to make sure staff did not lose out. She said: ""The only issue is that the school year is 190 days and the working year is 260 days, so clearly that's a loss of a quarter of the year's wages. ""We have found a way to make up that quarter of the year's wages - this is not a cost-cutting measure. But the GMB union said the authority should not be able to make the move without consulting staff first. The union's regional officer Karen Leonard said: ""I think it's an absolute disgrace. ""Members of the public won't realise that if their child breaks their leg on the last day of school, they won't be able to go to the nursery, they'll have to find a place.

"Leeds, 15th in the Championship table, looked vulnerable at the start of the season, particularly at set-pieces. But central defender Bartley has formed an impressive partnership with Pontus Jansson in the heart of the defence. The Swede, who joined from Torino last year, is a brute in the tackle, while Bartley is the one who uses his brain. Bartley, 26, made his debut for Arsenal in a Champions League tie against Olympiacos back in 2011. But he never made it into the first team on a regular basis and made just 18 appearances in four years. The defender enjoyed loan spells at Sheffield United and Birmingham before joining Swansea on a permanent deal in 2012. He spent five years at the Liberty Stadium, making 168 appearances, and he played in the 2013 League Cup final defeat to Bradford City. In 2015, Bartley won his only cap for England, when he came on as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat to Holland in the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley. Bartley was part of the Swansea side that lost 4-1 at Elland Road last November. And United boss Thomas Christiansen will be hoping he can keep the striker quiet tomorrow.",0,318
"27 August 2016 Last updated at 12:34 BST The restaurant began serving puppy platters after a new law was introduced allowing dogs to eat at restaurants - as long as the food is safe for human consumption A restaurant in Seoul is offering special menus for canines, which include ""beef bulgogi"" and a ""puppy-tail,"" the Korea Times reports. The owners said they introduced the menu for dogs after a law was passed allowing them to dine with their owners at restaurants. Dishes are priced from 9,000 won (8; 6) and a dog beer is also available for 5,000 won. According to the Times, dogs dining at the restaurant will be able to choose between beef and tofu dishes, with each containing a mix of rice, vegetables, tofu and the meat. The menu is available to all dogs, with or without their owners. Seoul's new law states that dogs are allowed to eat at outdoor restaurants if the food is safe for human consumption. The restaurant's owners said they were inspired by the new law and decided to take the opportunity to add a menu for dogs. ""We can't eat together with our pets at restaurants, so we decided to open a restaurant where pet owners can eat with their dogs,"" the restaurant's owner told the Times. ""There are not many places in Korea where pets can dine together with their owners at restaurants. We hope to make a space where pet owners and their pets can enjoy a meal together.""",0,319

The Home Office has launched a review of the police and MI5 after the Manchester and London Bridge attacks, which will report in the autumn. May's government has a majority of 13 in parliament with the support of the small Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), but there are signs that Conservative MPs are increasingly becoming restless over their leader's Brexit strategy. Former leader Iain Duncan Smith said she had a ""fantastic"" speech and was not in any danger, while another former leader William Hague said the criticism was coming from ""one or two people"" who do not represent wider opinion in the party. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was among Tory MPs who expressed unhappiness with the PM's approach to Brexit. ""My feeling is that we need to have a clean Brexit, we need to have Brexit that enables us to take back control of our borders, take back control of our laws, take back control of our money - that is what people wanted, that is what they voted for.""

The Queen's Speech, which was scheduled to be delivered on Monday, will set out the Government's legislative programme for the coming year. The Queen's Speech, due on June 19, will be delayed by a few days to give her a greater chance of securing a deal with the DUP. On the Queen's Speech, Mrs May said: ""We'll be setting out a number of bills on a whole range of issues ... a lot of those things that we had set out in our manifesto have got widespread support in the country and I think that's what people want to see.""

But fellow Conservative MP John Redwood said Mrs May could form a government without the support of the DUP.

"Trapped by disadvantage are more than 730,000 youngsters, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). It laments a ""national shame,"" and its research suggests about 13 of the 14 million Australians under the age of 25 are at risk of falling behind. The report, titled ""Trapped and Travelling,"" identifies high-risk groups, such as children in sole-parent families and those in regional areas. It says children who are not doing well in school, and those from low-income households, are also at risk of being left behind. ACOSS says its report shows young people are becoming more diverse in their backgrounds, with a greater number born overseas and with at least one parent from a non-English speaking background. Its research shows those from lower-income households are more likely to have left school early, without a higher-level qualification, or to be unemployed. The report recommends the federal government to take a ""whole of government"" approach to improving the wellbeing of young people. Its suggestions include developing a national strategy for early childhood education, building strong family relationships, strengthening the welfare system, and delivering services at a local level. ""We need to make sure that our young people get the support they need to fulfil their potential, to lead happy and healthy lives and contribute to their communities,"" the report reads. It is now more important than ever that the federal government commit to delivering better futures for young Australians, ACOSS president Cassandra Goldie said.

"The Labour leader told the New Statesman his party opposed government plans to lower the overall household cap, introduced in the last Parliament. And his spokesman confirmed he was ""very clear"" that the party ""would oppose any reduction in the overall household cap."" The government has not yet unveiled plans to lower the cap. But the Budget Red Book does say that it intends to ""amend the household benefit cap to ensure it continues to incentivise behavioural change."" Labour has been attacked for failing to oppose the cap - a key part of David Cameron's pre-election attack on ""welfare scroungers."" But a spokesman told Politics.co.uk: ""Ed was very clear in the interview that we are not going to support any reduction in the overall cap, and that's the current position."" Balls also told the New Statesman he opposed the government's planned cuts to working tax credits, which will see the benefit withdrawn from households where the main earner is on over 3,850 a year. ""I'm not going to get into the politics of it. I'm not going to get into the politics of it. But we are not going to support the overall household benefit cap coming down,"" he said. ""We are not going to support the cuts in working tax credits that George Osborne has announced. That's a very clear position."" Balls's comments mark a significant softening of the party's approach to welfare reform. At the start of the last Parliament the Labour leadership appeared to agree with the Conservatives that the welfare system needed radical reform. It voted in favour of the welfare cap, and also backed changes to housing benefit which will see the mainstream rate of the benefit cut to the level of the lower-value local housing allowance (LHA). The government's housing benefit plans will come into effect in April. Campaigners are warning they will devastate people's lives. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves caused anger among Labour supporters when she told the Fabian Society in 2012 that Labour had been ""defensive about welfare"" and should ""stop the something-for-nothing culture."" She later tried to clarify her comments, saying she was referring to the ""something for nothing"" culture in the City, rather than welfare claimants. Reeves has also suggested that she would be open to a lower household benefit cap than the current 26,000 a year, although she insisted that any such move would be ""carefully thought through."" Labour's approach to welfare reform is now seen as a key test of the party's economic credibility. In his New Statesman interview, Balls admitted that Labour ""didn't get everything right"" on the economy before the 2008 crash. ""I have never been somebody who has thought you can spend your way out of a recession, I have never thought that,"" he said. ""I actually said in the pre-budget report debate in November 2007, 'we must beware of fiscal laxity' and 'we must beware of just spending our way out of a difficult economic situation'. ""So I was saying that at a time when Gordon Brown was being urged to do just that. So I have never been that kind of person."" He added: ""In retrospect, it's very clear that there were people who were saying, 'you need to raise interest rates to head off inflation'. And I think there were people who were right about that, who said, 'look, there's a real danger of inflation here and we should be doing more to head it off'."" He said that he accepted the financial crisis was ""a global crisis"" but added: ""I think there are things we should have done differently."" ""I have never believed you can spend your way out of a recession. I actually said that when I was in government, and the speech I made at the Fabian conference last year was very clear that it is not possible to spend your way out of a recession,"" he said. ""If we had had the deficit at the level it had been when we came to office, we would not have had the financial crisis. But it's also true to say that if we had had the kind of deficit levels in 2005 that the Conservatives inherited in 2010, we would not have had the financial crisis either.""",0,328
"Funding given to the charity, which collapsed in August, included at least PS28m from the Department for Education, the National Audit Office said. It received the money despite warnings about the organisation's finances and quality of care. The DfE commissioned a financial assessment in 2014, which found the charity's budget was ""not sustainable."" The NAO said the charity's finances were ""under pressure"" for several years, yet the DfE continued to provide funding. The report said: ""The department had significant contact with the charity during its years in operation and, from 2013 to 2017, it paid PS39 million for the charity to deliver alternative provision for excluded pupils and other programmes. ""The department did not commission an assessment of value for money until 2017, after the charity had ceased to operate. ""However, the department had received other information, which it did not act on, that raised questions about the charity's financial sustainability and the quality of provision."" The charity's collapse affected 11,898 students at 175 schools, of which 114 were state-funded and 61 were academies. The NAO report said the DfE could not give assurances that the students affected continued to receive education or alternative provision. The report said: ""The department was aware of the charity's financial position from at least 2014, when it commissioned a financial assessment of the charity which highlighted significant financial pressures and found that the charity's budget was not sustainable. ""In 2016, the department's area review programme for children's services raised concerns about the quality of the charity's alternative provision."" The report added: ""The department's budget for alternative provision has increased substantially since 2010-11, when it was PS15 million, to PS66 million in 2016-17. ""However, the department did not commission an assessment of value for money until 2017, after the charity had ceased to operate."" Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ""The collapse of the Wave Trust exposed the chaos and confusion that too often occurs when public bodies commission services from charities and other non-state providers. ""It is appalling that the Department for Education and the Education Funding Agency allowed the Wave Trust to continue to provide services despite mounting evidence of its failure.

A DfE spokesman said: ""We are determined to learn lessons from the closure of Wave Trust and are already taking action to ensure this cannot happen again.

Loganair, a franchise partner of Flybe, operates the only scheduled air service between Orkney and the Scottish mainland, with the 35-minute journey linking Kirkwall to Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The work was carried out by Airbase at Norwich Airport and saw the interior of the 34-seat aircraft re-trimmed and re-upholstered with new carpeting and curtains installed and the overhead bins repainted. Staff from the Orkney-based airline joined the workforce at Airbase in the two-week project and enjoyed a trip to the medieval Norwich Lanes and a tour of the city's ancient cathedral. Murray Urquhart, Loganair's engineering manager, said: ""Everyone at Airbase was exceptionally accommodating and made us feel very welcome. It was a great experience for the Orkney-based staff involved and they worked really hard alongside their colleagues in Norwich to get the job done. The new-look aircraft will make a big difference to our passengers and it's exciting to see our service to the islands with a fresh new look."" John Sharkey, managing director of Airbase, said: ""This is the first time we've worked on a Saab 340 so we were delighted to be able to get involved in this project. It's been a great success and we look forward to working with Loganair again in the future."" The aircraft will return to the Orkney Islands this weekend. Loganair is Britain's largest regional airline and operates a comprehensive network of services in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Norway. Loganair carries around 700,000 passengers each year and works in partnership with leading airlines including British Airways, bmi regional, Flybe, Aer Lingus and Air France.

"Footage secretly filmed by France 2 TV shows Francoise Olcay selling dinghies and life jackets to migrants hoping to reach the Greek islands. The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores from Turkey last year. She is the only person to have been convicted by a Greek court in the country's crackdown on migrant trafficking. But Francoise Olcay, 65, is far from alone. Secretly filmed footage broadcast by France 2 TV shows that as many as 100 migrants can be found at any time on the beaches of Kas, a popular Turkish holiday destination on the Aegean coast. It is here that the Greek island of Kastellorizo is only five miles (8 kilometres) away. Migrants can be seen queuing on the beaches to buy dinghies and life jackets from the smugglers who can be found all along the seafront. Ali, a Syrian from the war-torn city of Aleppo, tells the France 2 journalists that he is about to pay 1,500 euros for a dinghy that will be able to take him and his family of four to Greece. ""They are in a hurry, but I am trying to give them some advice,"" the journalist says. ""I tell them that they need to take their time and not to leave the Turkish coast before nightfall."" The migrants are aware of the dangers of the journey. ""I've been on a boat four times already, and I had to turn back,"" Ali says. As soon as the smugglers see the journalists' cameras, they scatter in all directions. Olcay's arrest on a beach in Kas last May, along with her husband and son, marked the start of an unprecedented crackdown by the Turkish authorities. The Olcays were accused of having helped around 150 migrants to reach the Greek island of Kastellorizo in one night alone. On 28 October, Olcay was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison for people trafficking. Her husband and son were cleared of all charges. According to the UN's refugee agency, 124,000 people reached Greece from Turkey by boat last year. Many of them are fleeing war and persecution. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNHCR said there had been a 45 percent rise in the number of migrants arriving by sea in Greece since the beginning of January, compared to the same period in 2014. The statement urged Greece to set up reception centres to deal with the migrants' arrivals. The UNHCR also said that migrants were increasingly using the islands of the eastern Aegean to reach Greece. In November, the European Union opened an office in Izmir, Turkey's third largest city and the starting point for many migrants hoping to reach Greece. The office is designed to help the Turkish authorities deal with the problem of illegal immigration. In January, the EU announced that it would spend 3 billion euros over the next five years to help Turkey deal with the 1.7 million Syrian refugees currently living in the country. Greece says 800,000 migrants have reached its shores since the start of 2015.",0,331
"The PS230m development consists of 11 wind turbines. Mr Trump claims they would spoil the sea views for golfers on his course at Menie. He responded: ""We will put our money where our mouth is in order to protect Scotland's heritage for future generations. ""Scotland, if it goes offshore wind, is going to have the most serious problems that they have ever had."" He added: ""I think you would be doing yourself a massive disservice if you destroy sites of such beauty and importance to the country."" He said the decision to approve the development was ""inexplicable."" Plans for the wind farm on the Aberdeenshire coast were rejected by Scottish ministers in 2007. But a public inquiry into an appeal of the decision led to the approval of the development in 2013. The plans for an 11-turbine scheme were rejected by the Scottish government in 2007, but were given the green light following a public inquiry in 2013. The US presidential candidate is opposed to a number of wind farm developments in Scotland. The tycoon is currently pursuing a legal challenge against the Scottish government's decision to grant permission for 11 turbines off Aberdeen. He is expected to give evidence in person at an inquiry in the Scottish capital later this month. Mr Trump claimed the turbines, which are planned for Aberdeen Bay, would spoil the sea views for golfers at his course in the north-east. He has previously said the decision to approve the development was ""inexplicable."" Last year, Mr Trump's lawyers said the inquiry could be his last chance to block the offshore wind farm. Mr Trump has previously said he will withdraw his entire investment from Scotland if the wind farm goes ahead. But the tycoon is now being taken to court by Aberdeenshire Council for failing to build an access road at his Menie golf resort. The council has asked for 238,000 for breaching a planning agreement to build the road, as well as 5,000 for failing to apply for an extension to the deadline.

"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school. Police officers have said he may have had a ""personality disorder."" A former teacher has said: ""He kept himself to himself and was the quietest person in the class."" A former schoolmate, who asked not to be named, said he remembered him as a ""very polite, very shy boy."" Police have been at the address in Buckinghamshire where Michael Adebowale is believed to have lived. He studied at a school in Woolwich and was still living in the area. Earlier this year, Adebowale was living with his mother in a flat in Greenwich, south-east London. The property is part of a large, redbrick estate. Adebowale's mother, who is estranged from his father, works as a probation officer, according to a neighbour. She is said to have lived in the flat for about 20 years. The mother and son moved out about three weeks ago, the neighbour said. The neighbour said Adebowale's mother had been very worried about her son, who she said had been radicalised. She said she had not seen him for about a year and he had been kicked out of the family home. Adebowale's mother had been on holiday when the Woolwich attack happened. The neighbour said she had received a call from the police and had been told that her son was one of the men involved. The neighbour said she had not seen Adebowale since he was a teenager. He had been ""a nice boy"" when he was younger. Another neighbour, who declined to give his name, said Adebowale had been living in the flat with his mother, brother and sister until three or four weeks ago. He said the family were very friendly and had not been any trouble. ""He was very polite and would say 'hello' if you passed him in the corridor,"" he said. ""They didn't really stand out, to be honest. I don't think he was into religion at all. I've never seen him in any religious clothes and I've never seen him with a mosque. The neighbour said the family were originally from Nigeria and Adebowale's father did not live at the flat. He said the family had not been in the flat for long before moving out and he thought they had only been there for about two years. Adebowale's aunt, Julia, said the family was shocked by what happened. ""I don't know what's going on. I can't really comment at the moment,"" she said. In 2008, Adebowale posted a comment on a Guardian story about discrimination faced by Muslim women who wear the veil. ""That's why I hate people. They're just animals at the end of the day,"" he wrote. The second man arrested in connection with the attack has been named as Michael Adebolajo, 28. He was born in Lambeth in 1985 and grew up in Romford, Essex. His family moved to Harold Hill, Romford, when he was 10. He attended Marshalls Park school in Romford until 2001. A former classmate has described him as a ""big lad"" who was ""popular"" and ""well known,"" but who often got into trouble. Adebolajo is understood to have converted to Islam while at the school and at one point changed his name to Mujahid. He was a member of the school football team and was talented at the subject. Adebolajo's parents, who came to the UK from Nigeria in the early 1980s, are both believed to be practising Christians. His father, Anthony, is a nurse and his mother, Catherine, is a social worker. They split up in 2001 and both are remarried. Adebolajo went on to study at Greenwich University, where he gained a 2:2 in information and technology, and the University of Greenwich, where he studied for a master's in conflict and security. Adebolajo's sister, Blessing, 25, is a student at Cambridge University, where she studies medicine. She is also a member of the university's gospel choir, which has performed at Westminster Abbey, the Royal Albert Hall and the Royal Festival Hall. In 2007, Adebolajo was arrested along with five others in the Kenyan city of Mombasa on suspicion of planning to fight for al",0,334
"The court in Novorossiysk gave two of the dancers 10 days in jail each, a third 15 days and two others received fines on charges of petty hooliganism. Prosecutors had sought three-year prison sentences. The case was seen as part of a wider crackdown on dissent after Putin returned to the presidency in May and as an example of how a draconian new law on public protests can be interpreted by the authorities. The law, signed by Putin in June, bans protests except at specially approved sites and was seen by the opposition as an attempt to stifle dissent after the biggest protests of his 12-year rule. Their defense lawyer, Nikolai Polozov, said the dancers had been detained without grounds, beaten, and that one of the girls, who he said was not part of the Pussy Riot group, had her fingers broken in police custody. The dancing group, which has staged a number of unauthorized performances, usually in bright outfits and knitted masks, has become a symbol of protests against Putin's rule. A video of the performance in a church in February showed members of the band high-kicking and shouting the lyrics to their ""punk prayer"": ""Virgin Mary, Drive Putin Away!"" Three members of Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in jail for hooliganism motivated by religious hatred in August. One of the members had her sentence suspended and another member, who has a young child, is being allowed to stay with her family during the day. Putin, a former KGB spy who has cultivated close ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, has said the band members got what they asked for. The Russian Orthodox Church said on Tuesday the court had shown leniency in the latest case. ""The Church has repeatedly spoken out against the politicization of the punk prayer,"" it said in a statement. ""The Church is praying that the Lord will not let the actions of those who have insulted millions of believers across Russia and the whole world go unpunished."" (Editing by Michael Roddy)",0,335

Ms Griffith said: ""Labour will give you investment, versus cuts from Westminster. That is a very simple choice for the people of Wales.""

""He's been quite clear that he doesn't want the Severn Bridge tolls abolished,"" Ms Griffith said. ""He doesn't think that's a good idea. He's been asked to support that, he's been asked to support the abolition of the Severn Bridge tolls, and he has said no.""

"Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease. But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), this method is to be banned. Farmers Weekly, 10 June 2011 Tags: FSA, pigs, Pig carcasses will be opened at the abattoir only after a post-mortem examination by a vet. It's claimed this will reduce the risk of foodborne diseases like salmonella and E coli, which can be present in pig carcasses before they are cut open. But for the past few weeks, FSA inspectors have been told not to cut open pig carcasses, despite some veterinary experts claiming this is a more accurate way of assessing pigs for disease. Farmers Weekly understands that FSA inspectors have been told to make visual assessments of pigs. This has caused concern among some pig farmers and vets who fear visual checks are less reliable and that problems may be missed. A spokeswoman for the FSA told Farmers Weekly that inspectors were not being told to stop opening pigs. However, she admitted there was some confusion over what inspectors should be doing. The spokeswoman said: ""There has been some confusion about the changes to procedures. We are now working with our inspectors to clarify the situation and ensure the new procedures are understood. ""The new procedures should not affect the inspection of pigs at the abattoir and there is no change to the standards set out in legislation."" The FSA spokeswoman said that, in 2010, 28 of pig carcasses showed signs of salmonella contamination. The FSA is currently testing for salmonella on pig farms and in abattoirs. Some vets have questioned the reliability of visual inspection. ""The number of pigs slaughtered in an abattoir in a day could be in the hundreds, sometimes more. It is difficult to thoroughly inspect so many pigs visually,"" said Pip Rayner, a vet and director of pig disease surveillance company AHVLA. ""I'm not convinced a visual inspection is as reliable as cutting open a pig. Someone may miss something important."" The European Commission's legislation will not be implemented in the UK until the end of 2011. But it is understood that the FSA has already instructed its inspectors to stop cutting open pigs, in preparation for the new rules. ""We have no problem with the new rules,"" said NPA chairman Richard Lister. ""It's just a shame the FSA did not wait until the end of the year before making the change.""

"The pages from a 13th Century text of the holy book of Islam were purchased by the council in 1951. Conservator Richard Hawkes said: ""This is the earliest example of the Qur'an ever discovered and it's been in the archive for some time. There's been a lot of interest in it."" The pages, which are thought to be a chapter from the Koran, were found among the archives of the University of Birmingham by researchers who are cataloguing all of the manuscripts held by the university. The manuscript is written in an early form of Arabic, known as Hijazi, on parchment and is still legible. The Koran is the Islamic holy book that Muslims believe contains the words of God revealed to the prophet Mohammed. In the Islamic world it is treated with huge reverence and never aloud to touch the floor or be damaged in any way. The manuscript is believed to have been written between 568 and 645 and is thought to be one of the oldest in the world. Researcher Mingana Collections at the University of Birmingham, Dr Alba Fedeli, said: ""The two leaves, which were radiocarbon dated to the early part of the seventh century, come from the same codex as a manuscript kept in the Mingana Collection of Middle Eastern manuscripts in the University of Birmingham's Special Collections. ""The discovery of this manuscript is significant in that it is thought to be the earliest fragment of the Koran, which dates back to the time of the Prophet Muhammad or shortly after. ""This means that the Qur'an is about 1,370 years old."" It was purchased by the University of Birmingham in the 1920s. It is part of the Mingana Collection, which was assembled by Alphonse Mingana, a Chaldean priest born near Mosul in modern-day Iraq. The collection is kept in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts on the university's campus. ""The Qur'an, which is the most sacred text in Islam, has previously been dated to the later part of the seventh century, but this fragment establishes that it actually goes back to the early part of the seventh century,"" he said. ""The person who actually wrote it could well have known the Prophet Muhammad. He would have seen him probably, he would maybe have heard him preach. He may have known him personally - and that really is quite a thought to conjure with."" The discovery was made during a joint project by the University of Birmingham and the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany, to catalogue and conserve all the known fragments of the Koran. Dr Fedeli said the text will be displayed at the Barber Institute of Fine Arts. ""We are thrilled that such an important historical document is here in Birmingham, the most culturally diverse city in the UK,"" she added.

"The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days.

"Sales volumes increased by 1.7 in November from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared with the same month last year, sales were up by 5. However, in the three months to November, volumes were up by just 1.2, and it was the weakest three month performance since April. Analysts had forecast a rise of 2.4 in November from the previous month, and of 6.6 from November 2010. The ONS said that non-food stores showed the biggest monthly jump, with sales up 6 on October. Food stores saw a monthly increase of 1.3. Sales volumes at department stores were up by 2.6 month-on-month, and by 7.8 on November 2010. In November, the value of retail sales rose by 1.6 from October and was up by 5.4 on the previous year. The ONS said that the increase in November was the largest since March, and was driven by a rise in both the prices and volumes of goods sold. Although most retailers saw a rise in sales volumes, some of the most significant sales gains came from department stores, household goods stores, and non-specialised stores. The ONS said that November saw the biggest year-on-year rise in retail sales values since August. The biggest increase in retail sales values came from food stores, where prices rose by 2.7. Average store prices, including petrol stations, rose by 1.9 in November, compared with a 1.8 rise in October. But the volume of goods sold, and the value of goods sold, fell in November compared with the previous three months, suggesting a slowdown in the sector. Ian McCafferty, chief economic adviser at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said that there was a ""slowdown"" in the sector, and that retailers faced ""a tough year ahead."" He added: ""These figures show a continued slowdown in retail sales, following on from the flat November CBI Distributive Trades Survey. ""After a disappointing Christmas period, retailers are braced for a tough year ahead, with consumers likely to keep a tight rein on spending as they cope with high inflation, squeezed household incomes and continued uncertainty in the wider economy."" The ONS said that its data was the first since it began measuring sales volumes using the Retail Sales Index, a new method for calculating the amount of goods sold. It is used to calculate gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of goods and services produced in the UK. The ONS said that the new method ""provides a more comprehensive coverage of the retail sector and provides an improved estimate of its contribution to the UK economy."" However, it added that the new data meant that the UK had experienced its ""first negative quarterly growth since the start of 2010,"" with sales volumes falling by 0.4 in the three months to October. It said that there had been a ""substantial downward revision"" to previous estimates, and that the revised data showed that retail sales volumes had been flat in the second quarter of 2011, not 0.4 higher as previously thought. The ONS said that the revision meant that the quarterly fall in GDP in the three months to September 2011 was the largest since the quarterly fall in the three months to June 2009, when the UK was in recession. It said that the revised data for the second and third quarter of 2011, which would be published later, would be ""in line with the observed weakening in the retail sector."" David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that the new method ""will make the data more reliable."" He said: ""However, we are concerned that the new methodology will be used as an excuse by the government for any disappointing GDP growth in Q4. ""While there may be a statistical revision to GDP, the underlying weakness in the economy is very real, and the government must recognise this."" He added: ""The economy is facing a number of serious challenges that have been ignored in recent months, including the Eurozone crisis and the slowdown in the emerging world."" Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the new method ""may just be a better reflection of the underlying trend, rather than the start of a sharp downt",0,344

"Prison inspectors discovered the average period of stay at the facility near Gatwick Airport had risen from 28 to 48 days. Twenty-three people were held for more than a year. In the report, HM chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said that staff had been ""removed"" from Brook House, which is used to hold those who have been refused entry at the border, after a 2017 BBC Panorama investigation. At the time, the programme showed staff members ""mocking, abusing and assaulting detainees,"" and it led to the dismissal of more than a dozen employees and an investigation by the Home Office. In the report, Mr Clarke said: ""Brook House is a place of national concern. ""At the last inspection in 2016, inspectors said it was unsafe, and now, two years on, it is even more unsafe. ""The number of detainees being held without mental health problems when they entered Brook House but who developed symptoms while detained there was a matter of real concern. The average length of stay at the centre had risen from 28 days to 48 days, and 23 detainees had been held for more than a year, said Mr Clarke. He added: ""Many staff lacked the skills, knowledge and confidence to work effectively with the most vulnerable detainees. ""Despite the Home Office's willingness to fund the necessary mental health staff, the necessary skills and experience were not always available. ""The lack of meaningful activity was particularly acute at Brook House. Mr Clarke said staff at the centre lacked the skills and knowledge to work effectively with detainees, and recommended the time detainees spend in the facility should be reduced. ""This should be a short-term, transit facility, not a prison,"" he said. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""As the report acknowledges, there have been significant improvements at Brook House since the previous inspection in 2016. ""The welfare of detainees is of the utmost importance, and we will carefully consider the findings and recommendations made in this report. ""We will continue to work with G4S and NHS England to ensure that detainees' health needs, including mental health, are met throughout their detention.",0,350
"A defence official said in a statement on Wednesday that its nuclear programme had ""long been in the full-fledged stage of miniaturisation."" However, analysts say while there is evidence the North has continued its development of miniaturised nuclear warheads, it's likely the country has not achieved a high level of technical sophistication. ""It is possible that North Korea has developed miniaturised warheads, but it is unlikely that they have achieved a high level of technical sophistication,"" said Duyeon Kim, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. ""The statement may be a bluff, but they could be developing these capabilities very quickly."" Akira Kawasaki, a professor at the Research Center for Nuclear Weapons Abolition at Nagasaki University, said the North has likely developed a warhead small enough to fit on a missile, but it probably hasn't mastered the ability to protect the warhead from the intense heat and vibrations of a missile launch. But Joel Wit, founder of 38 North, a website that specialises in analysis of North Korea, said the nuclear programme is not the biggest threat. ""The nuclear programme is moving along, but the development of these other capabilities is probably a more immediate problem,"" he said. ""The idea that they would use these [weapons] against South Korea, where we have thousands of American military personnel, I think that's the real threat here."" ""The threat is that they're trying to develop weapons that would prevent the United States from coming to the defence of South Korea.""",0,351

"Moat Brae in Dumfries has been a private house, a nursing home and harboured hopes of being turned into a themed hotel. It has gone to the brink of demolition and is now being restored. It is best known as the childhood home of Peter Pan author JM Barrie. The house has been empty for 20 years. But it is a Dumfries landmark, with distinctive castle-like towers, and is thought to have been designed by William Burn, one of the 19th Century's most influential Scottish architects. The property was owned by the Crichton family and in the 1860s they built a house for their son James, who was a close friend of Barrie's and an inspiration for the Peter Pan character. It is believed the young Barrie and other boys played in the woodlands around the house, which later became the setting for Peter Pan. It is this heritage that is attracting attention now. A new charity has taken over the building and aims to turn it into a national centre for children's literature and storytelling. The Moat Brae Trust has raised 2.5m and received a grant of 2m from the Heritage Lottery Fund. One of the trustees, Mr Neilson, said: ""It's going to be a national centre for children's literature and storytelling. It'll have a cafe, it'll have a small gift shop and bookshop, a theatre space and exhibition space. ""There'll be a number of programmes for children, for schools, for young people, for adults, that will be based on literature and storytelling.

"New figures show the total number of teachers across Scotland has risen, but 12 council areas saw numbers fall. Mr Swinney said the stats were ""good news"" in light of a ""challenging"" economic climate. Campaigners say the government has failed to meet its pledge to increase teachers by 1,000 between 2011 and 2016, but the government insists it has met the commitment. The figures for 2014 show there were a total of 50,959 teachers working in publicly funded primary, secondary and special schools in Scotland. This was an increase of 541, or 1.1, compared with 2013, and an increase of 1,189, or 2.4, since 2011. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""The teacher numbers announced today are a disaster for our schools. ""Nick Clegg and I won the pupil premium for Scotland but the SNP have botched its implementation and now we know that teachers are leaving the profession in their droves. ""The SNP promised 1,000 more teachers in the classroom but we have fewer teachers now than when they came to power in 2007. ""This is a terrible start for John Swinney as education secretary and he has to urgently get a grip on the situation."" But Mr Swinney said: ""These figures show that we are getting more teachers into our classrooms and we are supporting our teachers to stay in the profession. ""That's good news for pupils, teachers and parents in the face of an ongoing challenging economic climate. ""The statistics show that the total number of teachers in Scotland has increased by 1,189 or 2.4 since 2011, and there are now 3,206 full-time equivalent probationer teachers in post across Scotland."" Labour's education spokesman, Kezia Dugdale, said: ""This was a pre-election pledge that the SNP have not delivered. ""When it came to the crunch, the SNP failed to deliver the number of teachers our children need. ""Scotland needs more teachers in our classrooms to meet the needs of pupils.

Mr Swinney announced the figures as he visited the Forth Valley College in Stirling to meet students studying for a post-graduate diploma in education.

"While 7 of people underpay and could be fined, 13 are paying too much. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy the wrong ticket. If you think you've been overcharged, try the train company's website first. If you can't get a refund, contact the train company. If that doesn't work, try the independent rail ombudsman. If you've been overcharged for more than a year, you can still try to claim back the money. If you get a penalty fare, you can appeal. You can't appeal if you were caught without a ticket. Train tickets can be confusing. Many people pay too much when they don't need to, or accidentally underpay, risking a penalty fare. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train companies, says that rail fares are complex because they have to reflect different customer needs and the cost of running services. ORR figures show 3 of passengers overpaid or underpaid on their journey in 2016. That means that 1 in 13 paid too much, but 7 in 100 paid too little. Many passengers don't realise they're underpaying, but if they're caught, they could face a penalty fare of up to 20. If you're not sure if you're paying the right fare, ask a member of staff. If you think you've been overcharged, you can try to claim back the money from the train company. If you can't get a refund, you can ask the independent rail ombudsman to investigate. If you've been overcharged for more than a year, you can still try to claim back the money. However, you'll need to show you paid a higher price than you should have. If you're not sure if you paid the right fare, ask a member of staff. If you've been caught without a ticket, you can still appeal. The Rail Delivery Group says the ticket inspector will usually look at your previous journeys. If you've paid the right fare on your last journey, you'll get a warning and the chance to pay the difference. You'll also be able to appeal. You can appeal if you were caught without a ticket, but only if you can show you paid the right fare on your last journey. If you appeal, the rail company has 28 days to make a decision. If you're unhappy with the decision, you can appeal to the independent rail ombudsman. Can you get money back if you've been overcharged? If you think you've been overcharged, try the train company's website first. Many have online forms you can fill in. If that doesn't work, try contacting the train company by phone or email. You may be able to get a refund. If you can't get a refund, you can ask the independent rail ombudsman to investigate. You must give them evidence, such as receipts or tickets. The ombudsman will look into your complaint for free and will make a decision on your case. You can't appeal a decision made by the ombudsman, but you can complain to the rail regulator. If you've been overcharged for more than a year, you can still try to claim back the money. However, you'll need to show you paid a higher price than you should have. Some train companies allow you to claim back overcharges for up to 28 days. This is usually for season ticket holders who didn't get the discount they're entitled to. If you think you've been overcharged, contact the train company.

"Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012. Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012.The couple, from Bridgwater, had been married for 14 years and had a child. Sital Sibery, 35, died shortly afterwards, the coroner at Taunton in Somerset heard. He had a 50 times higher than normal concentration of the drug in his blood. Mrs Sibery had no idea that her husband, an electrical engineer, had been taking heroin. She was arrested and charged with murder but the charge was later dropped to one of administering a noxious substance. She pleaded guilty to the charge and was given a two-year suspended jail sentence at Bristol crown court. Mrs Sibery told the inquest she was extremely angry with her husband and ""just wanted him to feel something."" She said: ""I wanted him to feel the same pain as me."" She told the inquest that when she confronted him about the drugs, he was like a ""man possessed."" ""He was sweating, shaking, and saying 'what did you do, what did you do'."" Mrs Sibery said she had been a heavy drinker before the incident and the pair had fought a lot. She told the coroner that she had confronted her husband in the past about his drug use but he had always denied it. She said that on the day of the incident, she saw him take heroin while she was in the shower. After confronting him about it, he got a lighter and ""just kept burning me, burning me, burning me."" The coroner, Tony Williams, said Mr Sibery had been given a ""substantial"" dose of heroin and there was no evidence he had taken it himself. He said Mrs Sibery was ""in a very disturbed state"" and that it was ""very difficult to determine what exactly happened at that point in time."" Mr Williams said Mrs Sibery had taken a ""calculated risk"" in giving her husband the drug, but he did not believe she intended to kill him. ""She was clearly trying to punish him. It was only a matter of a couple of minutes between her having confronted him and having given him the heroin. It is difficult to imagine she was trying to kill him."" Mr Williams recorded a verdict of drug-related death. Taunton Deane borough councillor Vanessa Sims said she knew Mrs Sibery and her husband and they were a lovely couple. She said: ""Everyone who knows them are devastated by what happened. They were a really lovely couple. She [Mrs Sibery] has been through a lot and is just trying to get her life back on track.

"It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia for fans and the arguments can rage on forever. But computer scientists are putting an end to all that. A new study has found that there is one player who is the greatest of all time. The findings of a statistical model that calculates the ability of every player in the Open era (since 1968) and rates them against their peers has been published in a paper titled ""Quantifying the Evolution of Performance in Tennis"" by The Royal Society. The model was devised by Moshe Levy, a professor of statistics and operations research at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and his doctoral student, Eliahu Katz. It uses data that includes each player's performance in every match played in the Open era, and applies a statistical model known as dynamic factor analysis. The result? Rafael Nadal has been declared the greatest of all time, with an average Elo rating of 2113.9. ""Nadal is the greatest of all time, the best player we've ever seen,"" the authors wrote in the paper. ""This finding is extremely robust."" Jimmy Connors is second with 2109.8 and Roger Federer is third with 2097.8. The study found that the sport has become much more competitive since its professional era began 50 years ago. ""Tennis has experienced significant changes over the years, and the game today is significantly more competitive than it was in the past,"" the authors wrote. ""We note that our findings are in line with expert opinion: for example, Tignor et al. claim that since the start of the Open era in 1968, 'tennis has become deeper and more competitive'. ""They report that in the 1970s, 20 players won 82 per cent of the Grand Slam singles tournaments, whereas in the 2000s, 21 players won 86 per cent of these tournaments. ""In terms of the number of players that accumulate high-ranked results, we agree with the conclusion of Deroche et al. that the level of competition has increased significantly in the last few years."" The authors added that the model could be used in other sports, and for other purposes, such as selecting players for teams or analysing the effect of rule changes.",0,363
"Forest Green, promoted from the National League, will host MK Dons in their first appearance in the competition, while FA Cup giant-killers Lincoln will be away to Rotherham. The 35-year-old, a Champions League winner with Real Madrid in 2014, is leaving the La Liga giants this summer. As you can see from the graphic below, only three other clubs have won as many Champions LeagueEuropean Cup trophies as Real Madrid. Real Madrid's long pursuit of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea is not over, according to the Telegraph. According to a report from Spanish outlet Diario Gol, the French striker is the main target for Zidane and Perez and they are willing to break the world record fee of 105 million euros paid for Paul Pogba by Manchester United a year ago to land their target. Former Germany worldwide Matthaus, who is now a columnist for Bild, believes Real will go to all lengths to sign Lewandowski, but it will not be easy. Ronaldo was suspended for the second leg of the Super Cup last year, a match that Madrid won 2-1 despite a red card for Sergio Ramos. Real have won the Champions League three times in the past four seasons and they will be looking to defend their crown again next term, so the summer transfer window is likely to be busy for Zidane.

"The men, identifying themselves Andreas Richter and Piotr Koper, appeared on the country's TVP public television. In a statement they said they had ""irrefutable evidence"" the train existed, but failed to provide any. This is the first time anyone has publicly claimed they have access to the lost treasure. A German army train was forced to flee the city in 1945 as the Red Army advanced. At least two other people have claimed to know the location of the train. One of them is an Italian treasure hunter, Marcello Trovato, who has said he has obtained information from a German who helped hide the train. The other is the 34-year-old Pole, Grzegorz Wydra, who claims he knows where the train is because of his late grandfather, who was an engineer on the train. He said he would not reveal its location unless he was paid 10 of the train's value. The BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says the two men who claim to have the missing documents are thought to be originally from Hungary. They are suspected of being part of a group of gold-diggers, who have been looking for the train for years, he adds. The men's lawyer said they would provide details of the location of the train if the Polish government agreed to let them search for it and keep 10 of its value. But he said they were not giving up the documents. ""They have two sets of documents, one that can be presented to the government, the other that is kept in a safe place,"" he said, without revealing what the documents are. There are two trains to be found, really. One was a steam locomotive in the Second World War that was meant to carry looted valuables to the Third Reich. The other is a modern-day locomotive that has been shunting around eastern Europe for a couple of years, carrying the hopes and dreams of treasure hunters, local officials and get-rich-quick companies. The first train is a myth that may or may not be true. The second train is very much real. It has been dismantled and rebuilt over the last 70 years, gathering to it the latest technology, the most up-to-date intelligence, and a large number of people who have a vested interest in keeping it alive. The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Easton, who has been following the mystery for some time, believes it is unlikely that the men have access to the train, but that they are part of a group of gold-diggers, who have been looking for the train for years. ""It's a bit like the Holy Grail,"" he said. ""People are convinced it exists, but there's never been any conclusive proof."" The treasure hunt has been going on for decades. In the 1970s, a Polish man claimed he found the train in a mountain tunnel near Wroclaw in the south-west of the country. The Polish army began drilling through the mountainside but failed to find it, our correspondent says. This time, a team of experts led by archaeologists will use the latest technology, including ground penetrating radar, to find the train, if it exists, he adds.",0,365
"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave them feeling trapped inside their own home. We know that people with profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD) can find communication difficult. They may be unable to talk or have very limited speech and they may also have difficulty understanding what others say to them. It is thought that there are at least 250,000 people with PMLD in the UK. The difficulties that they face with communication mean that they are at risk of being unable to access key services and activities that others may take for granted. But people with PMLD have the right to a good quality of life and the ability to make decisions about their lives. They have the right to an education and access to health and social care services. With the right support and information, we can help people with PMLD to overcome the barriers they face and communicate more effectively. The PMLD Hub is a website providing information and support to people with profound and multiple learning disabilities, their families and carers. The site includes information on communication, behaviour that challenges, daily living, health and social care and more. There is a lot of information about communication, how to communicate, what to use, where to get it from, and how to get support. Communication is at the heart of everything we do and every interaction we have with others. Communication is a two-way process. It is not only about being able to express our wants and needs, but also being able to understand what others want to tell us. Good communication is the foundation of all our relationships and is key to having choice and control over our lives. It is important for our safety and wellbeing and is central to having a voice. For someone with PMLD, communication can be even more important. It can enable them to make choices about their lives and express their preferences, wants and needs.",0,366

"The Spaniard, whose opening round in Munich contained six birdies, trails leader Wade Ormsby of Australia by two shots and Belgian Thomas Detry by one. England's Tommy Fleetwood, who finished second at the Masters last week, is one shot further back after carding a four-under-par 68. With the sun shining and barely a breath of wind, players were able to take advantage of perfect scoring conditions at Eichenried Golf Club. The Spaniard made five birdies in the first six holes, before adding another on the 15th. He did drop a shot on the 17th, but his birdie on the 18th left him in a good position heading into Friday's second round. ""It was a great day, very happy,"" said Campillo, whose previous best finish in the event was a tie for fifth in 2014. ""I played very solid, with six birdies and a bogey. It was a good round of golf. ""My putting was very good and I hit a lot of fairways. It was a very nice day of golf. I hit a lot of fairways and that gives you a lot of opportunities to make birdies."" The 31-year-old was pleased to be leading the home challenge in the absence of Sergio Garcia and Jon Rahm, and he is confident he can challenge for his maiden European Tour victory this week. ""It's a good week to try to win,"" he added. ""I've been close in the past, so I hope I can give myself an opportunity to win. ""I've been playing good for a long time. I've been very solid, making a lot of cuts and top-20 finishes. I hope to try to keep the same way and try to win this week."" Ormsby, meanwhile, is in his first season as a European Tour member and a maiden title in Munich would lift him into the world's top 200. The 37-year-old's round got off to a poor start with bogeys on the opening two holes, but six birdies on the front nine, and two more on the 13th and 16th, helped him to the top of the leaderboard. Detry, who won his maiden European Tour title at the 2016 Shot Clock Masters, also had a strong start to his round. After reaching the turn in 31, the 24-year-old added birdies on the 12th and 15th holes. Fleetwood, who finished 12th at Augusta, carded five birdies, an eagle and a solitary bogey to move up the leaderboard. Clement Sordet is a shot further back on five under, while a group of six players, including France's Raphael Jacquelin and Germany's Maximilian Kieffer, are a shot further back.",0,369
"Burnley Empire Theatre defaulted to the care of the Duchy of Lancaster as an ""owner of last resort"" after the ownership could not be established. Last used as a bingo hall, the building is currently derelict. The Duchy of Lancaster has completed the transfer of the freehold of the former Burnley Empire Theatre to Burnley Borough Council. Plans are now being developed to restore the building for use as a theatre for performing arts and as a venue for conferences, events and functions. The Duchy of Lancaster was informed by the local authority that it intended to compulsorily purchase the former theatre and the building has now been transferred to the Council by way of a vesting order. The Duchy was appointed to act as the ""owner of last resort"" by the Ministry of Justice in December 2012, following the collapse of the previous ownership in 2010 and the dissolution of the theatre's company. In 2011, the Duchy of Lancaster commissioned a detailed viability study to establish whether the Empire Theatre could be redeveloped and sustained as a theatre. Although it was clear that restoring the Grade II listed building would be a significant undertaking, the study concluded that with the right level of funding, a viable and sustainable business could be created. Since then, the Duchy has actively marketed the building to interested parties and was delighted to learn that the local authority was keen to develop a community asset on the site. The Burnley Empire Theatre was built by theatre architect, Frank Matcham in 1894.",0,370

Reports say that soldiers from Lesotho have been placed at the South African border to stop him from returning. The prime minister's wife was shot dead on Wednesday. The 73-year-old, who had been in the capital, Maseru, was reportedly due to be questioned by police over the murder. Ms Lipolelo Thabane, 58, was travelling home with a friend when they were both shot dead earlier this week. The attacker then fled the scene, the police said. The couple were together when the attack happened, police have said. The friend who was driving the car has been identified as a prominent businesswoman. Mr Thabane, who had been in South Africa, announced his wife's death on Wednesday, but did not say how she had died. ""All I can say is that she has died,"" he told a press conference, adding that he was devastated by her death. Ms Thabane and the prime minister were going through divorce proceedings, which she had initiated, at the time of her death, according to court documents. The police have not named a suspect, but said they had ""a clear picture of who we are looking for."" ""All I can say is that there is a suspect whom we have not arrested,"" deputy police commissioner Mokete Paseka told AFP news agency. ""I cannot give a name of the suspect. It's a very sensitive matter and the prime minister is himself part of the investigation."" Mr Thabane, a former member of the clergy, is a prominent figure in Lesotho. He was first elected prime minister in 2012 and later again in 2017. He was due to be questioned on Tuesday, but was out of the country at the time, reported South Africa's News24. The police have not said what they were planning to ask him, but his spokesman told the BBC he believed the police wanted to question the prime minister about the murder. Those who had worked with the prime minister's wife described her as a ""sociable, hard-working and very dedicated person."" The couple have two daughters, but it is not clear who is taking care of them. Lesotho is a country of about two million people who live in the mountainous region.",0,372
"It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer, and was originally called the Elder Shipyard, Govan. In 1868, John Randolph Thomson became a partner in the company and in 1871 the company was renamed the Fairfield Shipbuilding Engineering Company, Ltd. The company took its name from Fairfield Park in Govan, on the site of which the shipyard was built. The yard was rebuilt after a fire in 1887 and became one of the most famous shipyards in the world, producing a wide variety of ships, from liners to tankers to naval vessels. The yard was a byword for quality and became a world leader in the design and production of liners, including the famous Cunard liners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. The yard also produced a number of revolutionary naval ships, including the Royal Sovereign-class battleships which were launched in 1892. The yard was also the first yard in the world to produce a true aircraft carrier in 1916 and also built the world's first oil-burning turbine-driven warship, the Kent-class cruiser, HMS Aurora in 1913. During both World Wars, the yard produced a large number of ships for the Admiralty and was one of the few yards in the UK to be allowed to continue building ships after the end of the Second World War. Fairfield's last ship was the 22,880-ton British India Line liner SS Nevasa, which was launched in 1956. The famous Fairfield yard finally closed in 1965.

"On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of 282m (PS195m) up from 154m last year. The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that the carmaker will ramp up its production has boosted shares by 6 in pre-market trading in New York. Tesla's stock has risen by 34 this year, which is quite impressive when compared with Ford's 26 drop. The company reported a 69 year-on-year rise in revenue to 2.7bn, fuelled by the sale of 10,030 Model S cars - well ahead of the 8,763 it sold in the same period last year. Mr Musk told analysts that the company has made ""a dramatic improvement in our manufacturing efficiency,"" and that it was ""producing roughly 700 vehicles a week, which is pretty close to the theoretical maximum that we can achieve with the existing equipment and manpower."" The CEO also confirmed that the company's forthcoming Model 3 - which will cost from PS35,000 - would be unveiled in late March. He added that it would be ""very different"" to its current Model S. In its results, Tesla said the first quarter had been ""a great one for us, with record numbers of deliveries and orders for both our Model S and Model X."" The Model X - a sports utility vehicle - was launched in September last year, and Tesla said it was on track to sell about 80,000 cars in 2016.

"The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check the chutes from the cockpit. The evacuation of a Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. The chute failed to inflate after a smoke warning light in the baggage hold was triggered on flight LS785 to Alicante on Saturday. It came after the pilot was unable to check the chutes from the cockpit. A report into the incident said: ""The flight crew had been unable to check that the escape slides at the overwing exits were armed and in the event one slide failed to inflate on deployment and there was an insufficient number of available fire fighters."" It was also discovered that the jet's evacuation slides were not properly deployed, with a number of passengers having to evacuate using the wing. The report said that the slide for the overwing exit was not properly inflated as it was found that there was a ""lack of sufficient training for the correct method of arming the slides."" The report added: ""The crew were trained to use a ramp for the overwing escape slide which was no longer available in the new fleet, but the aircraft manuals were not updated. ""The cabin crew were trained to use the revised method of arming the slides and the pilots had been informed of the change but had not yet been trained in the new procedure."" The report added that as there was ""no indication of fire or other hazard in the baggage hold"" the cabin crew could have ""disregarded"" the warning light. But the report also said that in the event of a real fire there would have been ""insufficient time to evacuate passengers from the aircraft in the event of a fire."" The report added: ""The sequence of events that took place following the indication of a warning light in the baggage hold of this aircraft resulted in a number of problems which could have been prevented by different actions."" The incident happened as the aircraft was preparing for take-off and was waiting for a taxi clearance, when the co-pilot noticed a warning light in the baggage hold and an associated aural warning. The report said: ""The co-pilot recalled that he had received an emergency training session on the previous day which had included a demonstration of what would happen if a warning light was activated in the baggage hold. ""The co-pilot recalled that if a warning light was activated there was a procedure to disarm the system and check the baggage hold for a fire using a thermal imaging camera and an oxygen mask. ""As the co-pilot had not received any training on how to use the thermal imaging camera, or an oxygen mask, he decided to inform the captain who initiated the emergency evacuation procedure."" The captain carried out a precautionary evacuation as the flight crew had been unable to verify that the overwing escape slides had been correctly armed. An investigation into the incident by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found that a ""malfunction of the hold fire detection system"" had caused the warning light.",0,382
"Galvani Bioelectronics hopes to bring a new treatment based on the technique before regulators within seven years. GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences, are behind it. Animal experiments have shown that inserting tiny electronic devices into nerves can help treat a variety of diseases, including arthritis and diabetes. One of the trials showed that by stimulating a nerve in the brain, the food intake of rats could be reduced by up to 40. The team, from the University of Melbourne, used a device similar to a pacemaker to stimulate the lateral hypothalamus, part of the brain linked to feeding. The animals still ate enough to meet their nutritional needs, the team says, but not enough to become obese. The technique could help to treat eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, the researchers suggest. The other study, led by scientists at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York, used a similar technique to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers inserted an electronic device into the vagus nerve of mice with the condition, which stimulated the nerve to release a protein called tumor necrosis factor, which is linked to inflammation. The technique reduced inflammation and swelling in the joints, and improved the movement of the animals, the study showed. Galvani Bioelectronics is a joint venture between UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences. The company is investigating ways to miniaturize the implants used in the studies, so they can be used in humans. They hope to bring a treatment before regulators for approval within seven years. This is a very promising area of research. Another vagus nerve stimulation device, the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator, was given breakthrough status by the US Food and Drug Administration last year. The technique has also been shown to be effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease in animals, as well as a condition similar to multiple sclerosis, the researchers say. ""This is a very promising area of research,"" says Professor John Hardy, of University College London. He adds that there is growing evidence that electrical signals in the nervous system are important in regulating the immune system. ""I'm sure that in the next few years we will find more ways of treating disorders of the immune system with electrical devices rather than with drugs,"" he says. Dr Srivastava says the approach is not without risks, however. One of the studies was published in the journal Nature Communications, while the other was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",0,383

Miss Walker, who was an assistant manager at the Tesco store in Darlington, had been a mother for the first time just 11 days before her death. Gowling, of Hundens Lane, Darlington, had denied murdering her but was convicted in April after a trial at Teesside Crown Court. Gowling was jailed for a minimum of 23 years and six months. In a statement read out to the court, Miss Walker's mother Marilyn, described her daughter as ""a loving and caring mother, a very kind person and had a great sense of humour."" She said: ""I was very proud of her, she had a good job and a lovely home. She had everything to live for. ""She will be missed by her daughter and us as a family. ""My granddaughter will grow up without her mother. ""The family will never forget this and have to live with this the rest of our lives."" Miss Walker's sister Tracy, 41, said her death ""has had a massive impact on our family."" She said: ""Charlene was a fantastic mother to her daughter who she adored. She was also a fantastic sister to myself. ""We had a very close relationship and talked to each other most days. ""She was also a great auntie to my children, she had such a great relationship with them and they adored her."" Gowling also admitted perverting the course of justice, preventing the lawful burial of her body and criminal damage. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC said: ""This was a deliberate and sustained attack on a defenceless and vulnerable young woman. ""You were manipulative, controlling, aggressive and violent towards her. ""You killed her for your own selfish reasons. ""It is clear you are an extremely dangerous woman. ""You are in my judgement a very dangerous and manipulative person who poses a high risk of harm to others."" The judge described the case as ""truly shocking and disturbing"" and said Gowling's behaviour following the attack was ""calculated and callous."" Following the conviction, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Young said: ""While this was a complicated and sensitive investigation, we have always believed that this was a case of murder. ""It was clear that Charlene was a vulnerable victim who was under Julie Gowling's control. ""Charlene was a young woman who was about to embark on the next chapter of her life with the birth of her first child, and the world was her oyster. ""Unfortunately, she will never have the chance to fulfil her dreams and I'm pleased that we have been able to bring her family the justice they deserve.""",0,389
"It was the 29-year-old Spaniard's first Grand Tour stage win and Movistar's first at this year's Giro - still led by Jungels, with Geraint Thomas second. Thomas' Team Sky team-mate Landa was third, 17 seconds back, with Nibali fourth, 19 seconds behind. Defending champion Nibali, seeking a third Giro title, has a 50-second lead over Thomas and 1:12 on Landa. Earlier, 2014 winner Nibali of Italy had been second to Mikel Landa of Spain at the top of the climb before dropping back to fourth. Nibali, who was second to Landa on the climb and was fourth overall this morning, finished ninth on the stage and is now 36 seconds ahead of Esteban Chaves in the general classification. There are still plenty of mountains to come, however, with two more summit finishes in this year's race, with the Colle dell'Agnello on Friday and the Piancavallo on Sunday. ""There's still a lot of racing to come,"" Nibali said. Dumoulin is now 14th, 2:11 behind Jungels, but the Dutchman will be more concerned about the time he lost to Nibali, who is now the biggest threat to his hopes of winning the pink jersey in Turin on May 28. ""I'm going to enjoy this victory and not think about what will happen tomorrow,"" he said. ""I was expecting to lose time to the other guys."" ""I am very happy to win my first stage at a Grand Tour, especially at the Giro,"" said Amador. ""It's not a bad thing, we're only on stage 10 and I know that we've got a long way to go.""

"Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust was criticised by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March 2015. A re-inspection in April this year found it had made ""positive progress"" in some areas and said that ""staff were committed and caring."" The CQC said patients and staff reported improvements to the wards at Peter Hodgkinson Centre, Lincoln County Hospital, where staff said they felt valued. Improvements had also been made to the flow of patients through the service, and there were improvements to patient care and treatment. In addition, the CQC said patients could be assured that there was a system of checks to ensure that the service provided safe care. However, the report also highlighted a number of areas where improvements were required. The CQC said that the ""culture and environment"" of the service was still ""challenging"" and the patient's views did not always inform care and treatment. There were also some staffing issues and the CQC said there was a ""lack of understanding and awareness of how patients' mental health needs should be assessed and met."" The CQC has told the trust to address these issues. CQC Deputy Chief Inspector of Hospitals (and lead for mental health), Paul Lelliott, said: ""We were pleased to see that a number of changes had been made and improvements achieved since our last inspection in March 2015. ""The trust has worked hard to improve the quality of the service it provides for people using the services and staff we spoke with felt valued and supported in their roles. ""People using the service were being supported to access care in the community and a new service had been introduced to help people move from hospital to their own homes, or other community-based accommodation. ""However, we have asked the trust to take action to ensure improvements continue to be made. ""In particular we want to see improvements made to the environment in which patients are cared for, better access to services in the community and an improvement in the way staff assess and meet patients' mental health needs.""",0,391

"Rafael Esquivel admitted receiving bribes in connection with the sale of marketing rights to tournaments. He was among seven officials arrested at a luxury hotel in Switzerland last year. More than 40 others have since been indicted. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who is not among those indicted, announced his resignation in June after FIFA's ethics committee suspended him amid a separate corruption investigation. Prosecutors in the United States have indicted 40 soccer officials and sports marketing executives on charges that include racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. A former FIFA official from Guatemala pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. federal court to racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, admitting he took bribes in exchange for his help selling marketing rights to soccer tournaments. Rafael Callejas, 72, a former Guatemalan president and former president of the Guatemalan soccer federation, appeared in Brooklyn, N.Y., to enter the plea. He's among more than 40 people charged in the U.S. with corruption. Callejas admitted that between 2009 and 2015, he received at least 175,000 in exchange for his help selling marketing rights to tournaments. ""As a former president of the Guatemalan soccer federation, Rafael Callejas's guilty plea to racketeering conspiracy demonstrates his willingness to sacrifice the integrity of the game to accept tens of thousands of dollars in bribes,"" U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers said in a statement. Six of the 40 people charged are in the U.S. and are under house arrest. The rest of the indictments are against officials in Latin America. The charges stem from an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into corruption at the world soccer body, FIFA. The probe began after the Swiss government arrested several officials staying at a luxury hotel in Zurich last year. The U.S. alleges that the officials were taking bribes for their help in selling marketing rights to the world's most popular sport. The Justice Department says the conspiracy ""robbed the FIFA of honest services by taking undisclosed bribes and kickbacks and then, in exchange for those bribes and kickbacks, agreeing to use their influence as soccer officials to provide favorable treatment to companies and other soccer entities."" The probe has also led to an indictment of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who said he would step down after his organization's ethics committee suspended him. He has not been arrested.",0,393

Mr Cameron told the MP for North West Hampshire: ""My honourable friend is right that the president of the European Commission, Mr Juncker, has said very clearly, 'Out is out', and that he will not entertain any special status for Britain. ""My honourable friend is also right to say that the only way we will get a deal that will be good for Britain and keep us in a reformed European Union is to be very clear that this is a referendum, it is a choice, and that we need to deliver that reform for Britain.""

"Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required. The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. When the body was lifted off the aircraft, it was in an al-Qaeda-designed body bag. This fact would later be used to question the identification of the body. The funeral was conducted by an imam at a US military base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. The body was washed and buried in a white sheet in a grave facing Mecca. The imam recited the Fatiha (opening verse of the Koran) and the Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer). The body was placed into a simple plywood coffin and transported to the airstrip, where it was flown to Kuwait aboard a US C-17 Globemaster. While in Kuwait, a DNA sample was taken from the body. In the early morning of 1 May, the body was flown by a VC-25A (a military version of a Boeing 747) to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The body was taken to the Dover Port Mortuary and identification was confirmed by DNA testing. It was then washed again, wrapped in a clean white sheet, and taken to a mosque on the base for Salat al-Janazah. A senior US military officer read verses from the Koran at the mosque and the body was placed in a simple plywood coffin. The body was flown to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on 2 May, accompanied by members of the US military, where President Barack Obama formally confirmed the death. Osama bin Laden was buried at sea from the deck of the USS Carl Vinson. The body was washed again and placed in a white sheet in a weighted coffin. A military officer read religious remarks that were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. The body was placed on a board, tipped up and the board was tipped into the sea. Osama bin Laden's body was buried at sea less than 24 hours after his death because Islamic tradition required it, but the speed of the burial sparked speculation and conspiracy theories, with some suggesting that it did not happen at all. The US military said that it wanted to avoid bin Laden's grave becoming a shrine for his followers. However, the question of why the body was buried at sea, rather than in the ground, was difficult for US officials to answer. Osama bin Laden's body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet, and placed in a weighted coffin with an American flag over it. A military officer read religious remarks that were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. At 10:10 pm EST, which was 4:10 am local time (UTC3), the body was placed onto a white table at the rail of the ship, and tipped up so that it would slide into the sea. The US government said that the body was disposed of in the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, which would have been possible by wrapping it in a weighted shroud and dropping it into a tiled sea. The body was taken to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where a pathologist confirmed Osama bin Laden's identity. The body was washed and placed in a white sheet in a simple plywood coffin, which was then flown to the USS Carl Vinson, a US aircraft carrier in the North Arabian Sea.",0,395

""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom."" Mr Stefanek said the sum paid to the hackers was 40 bitcoins - approximately 17,000 (12,300). The FBI had earlier confirmed it was investigating the incident. ""The biggest issue for hospitals is not just that they become unable to access data, but that they can't share it,"" said Dr Robert Wah, president of the American Medical Association. ""Patient data needs to be available in an instant - lives are at stake."" Hackers encrypt computer files until a ransom is paid Files can only be unlocked via an encryption key Hackers demand ransom in digital currency Ransom demands typically range from hundreds to thousands of dollars Computer users are often advised to pay up - losing data may be worse Malware can be introduced via spam emails or ""malvertising"" on websites Security experts advise backing up data to avoid being held to ransom ""You have to ask yourself: what's more important to the hospital, paying the ransom or not being able to access files for a long period of time?"" A spokeswoman for the hospital said staff could now ""communicate more easily with one another"" via email. She said the authorities were investigating the source of the malware.

"The Wikileaks co-founder sought asylum at London's Ecuadorean embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. UK officials said the bill for policing the embassy, which stands at PS12m (18.8m; 25m), was ""unacceptable."" Jeremy Hunt said the Met's funding would be reduced by the sum, which was ""quite disproportionate."" ""What we will not do is use taxpayers' money to pay for a choice that Mr Assange has made,"" he said. Mr Hunt said the UK had been generous in its offer to fund half the policing costs, and would not accept footing the bill for the entire operation. The Wikileaks co-founder has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge since June 2012. Mr Assange, 45, claims his human rights could be violated if he is extradited to the US. He is also concerned he could be sent to Guantanamo Bay or given the death penalty. Last week, the Wikileaks founder lost a UK court bid to have an arrest warrant issued against him in 2012 overturned. He could be sent to Sweden if he leaves the embassy to face an inquiry over a rape allegation, which he denies and has never been charged with.

"It has emerged that an original crash barrier was removed, even though the Roads Service could not find out why it had been put there in the first place. It seems that the barrier was removed in 2003. The Roads Service confirmed that the barrier was removed during the resurfacing of the road in 2003 but that it could not find out why the barrier was there in the first place. ""Given the undulations in the road, it was a safe decision to remove the barrier,"" a Roads Service spokeswoman said. Nevertheless, it is hard to understand how a barrier was removed on a bend in a road without anyone knowing why it was there in the first place. It is known that the barrier was removed because of the damage it caused to cars which impacted on it. It was also removed because it was thought that it might have been a distraction to drivers. The issue is still being investigated by the Road Service. Speeding is a serious road safety issue and one that continues to cost lives on Northern Ireland's roads. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of people convicted of speeding. Latest statistics from the Department of the Environment show that 105,963 speeding tickets were issued in Northern Ireland in 2004, a rise of 10 on the previous year. Following recent research by the Department of the Environment and the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy, it is clear that speeding is a major cause of concern for the public. Drivers of all ages continue to speed and this is a particular problem among young drivers. It is a common misconception that younger drivers are more likely to be involved in a collision than older drivers. However, young drivers are at a higher risk of being killed or seriously injured. The Department of the Environment has set up a website at which is full of information on road safety. The speed limit in Northern Ireland is 70mph on motorways and dual carriageways and 60mph on single carriageways. On rural roads the speed limit is 50mph. In towns the speed limit is 30mph, unless otherwise stated. The road safety authorities have made it clear that if you are convicted of speeding, you will lose your licence. Speeding does not only endanger the lives of other road users. It also endangers the life of the person speeding. The Department of the Environment has revealed that of all the people who were killed on our roads in 2004, 38 were killed in speed-related collisions. I welcome any move to address the speeding issue and reduce the number of deaths on our roads. I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Seamus McElvogue in a road accident. I know this is a very difficult time for the McElvogue family and they are in the thoughts and prayers of many people.

""I would now be in favour of having a proper review of the state of the British film and TV industry, to ensure that we are competitive internationally."" Hunt's comments come after his rival for the top job, Boris Johnson, expressed his support for the film industry during a speech at the British Film Institute. Johnson said: ""I love the film industry. I love it. It's a great industry.

"The stricken robot, made by Knightscope, was spotted by passers-by whose photos of the aftermath quickly went viral on social media. For some, the incident seemed to sum up the failings of contemporary Silicon Valley - an over-ambitious, overpriced, much-hyped piece of technology that spectacularly failed to live up to its promise. To others, however, it was a more sinister portent of a dystopian future, in which out-of-control robots patrol our streets, battering passers-by at will, like the Daleks in Doctor Who. The reality, it turns out, is a little less alarming. The 300lb robot in question was not, after all, a military-grade security device, bristling with weapons, but a five-foot-tall automated sentry, designed to help shopping mall cops spot ne'er-do-wells. The Knightscope K5, as it is known, is the flagship product of a Silicon Valley startup, whose founders have raised 17.5m in venture capital funding. The company says it has already sold 25 of the machines, which are priced at 6.25 an hour, or 70,000 a year. ""They don't have any weapons. They are security guards with wheels. We don't manufacture terminators,"" said William Santana Li, Knightscope's chief executive and chairman. Knightscope says the robot wasn't harmed in the incident and is back on patrol at the Stanford shopping center in Palo Alto, where it took its famous tumble. Li declined to comment on the details of the mishap, which he described as a ""freakish accident,"" but said the robot had already proven its worth to the mall's security team. It] has prevented a number of crimes in the last year. It has improved security and served as a visible deterrent to criminals, something no security guard could do on their own,"" he said. The robot had only been in service a few days when it ran into trouble, as it patrolled the parking lot of the shopping center. The machine's sensors detected a fast-moving object coming towards it and instructed it to stop and then back away. Instead, it reversed into a heavy planter, which it couldn't see because of its narrow field of vision, and toppled over, knocking itself out. It then lay on the ground, motionless, in a kind of robotic coma, until a human member of the mall's security team came to the rescue and rebooted it. The incident is a rare public setback for Knightscope, whose robots have generally been well-received by the public, Li said. However, some observers have raised questions about how useful the machines are for the price. For 6.25 an hour, or 70,000 a year, customers are getting a robot that patrols a predefined area, sending back video and audio to a security team, and is supposed to recognize ""suspicious behavior"" such as loitering. It's also supposed to detect known criminals by scanning their faces and comparing them to a database of suspects. The company, which has 40 employees and is based in Mountain View, California, is now working on a ""version 2"" of its robots that will have a much broader field of vision, enabling them to see up and down as well as side to side, Li said. However, he admits there is one thing the robots cannot do - climb stairs. Knightscope is not the only company developing robots for security. Last month, the security company ADT announced a partnership with a Massachusetts startup, Robotnik, to develop security robots for businesses, including an ""autonomous indoor robot"" that is supposed to detect intruders and alert security guards. A public information officer for the Palo Alto police department said that it was not involved in the investigation of the robot's mishap.",0,403

"The artists wrote graffiti reading ""Homeland is racist"" and ""Homeland is rubbish,"" among others. They say they were asked to write the graffiti in June to ""lend authenticity"" to a scene. The crew was not told what the graffiti said or what the context was, according to the artists. They say they asked to see the script and have it translated but the production company refused. They say they eventually agreed because they were told by the art department manager that the ""writing on the wall"" would be changed in post-production. In Monday's episode, the graffiti is seen in a scene in which an Arab man is being tortured in a CIA prison in Iraq. The graffiti has sparked a backlash online, with many questioning why the writers would allow their work to be used in that manner. Some questioned whether the artists were aware of the context. ""Homeland is not a show known for its sensitivity to Arabs and Muslims. Did you really have no idea that it would be used in this way?"" wrote one Twitter user. The show's writers and co-executive producers, Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon, defended the use of the graffiti. ""We wish we'd caught these images before they made it to air,"" they said in a statement. ""However, as Homeland always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can't help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.""",0,406

"Edinburgh Airport said more than 781,000 passengers passed through its doors last month, a year-on-year increase of 11.7. Glasgow saw its traffic rise by 8.4 to nearly 600,000. Meanwhile, Aberdeen saw its numbers dip by 2.8 to just over 336,000. The three airports have more than 200 new routes and services on offer this summer. Edinburgh Airport said it had enjoyed its busiest May on record, while Glasgow Airport recorded its busiest May since 2008. Aberdeen International Airport said it had seen a 2.8 drop in its passenger numbers for the month, although that was offset by a 1.8 increase in its international traffic. Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: ""We've welcomed 2.5 million passengers through our doors since the start of the year, which is a strong performance and one which we hope to build on in the coming months.

"Fifty sheep were stolen from a farm in Ammanford and the farmer spotted a flock two weeks later at a livestock market in Llanybydder. After the ewes gave birth, paternity tests revealed that the DNA of 45 of the lambs belonged to a ram owned by a farmer in Llandybie. The farmer from Llandybie, Mr A, pleaded guilty to sheep stealing at Llanelli Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 11 October and was fined 150 with 1,350 costs. The farmer from Llanybydder, Mr B, who owns the ram, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting sheep stealing and was fined 150 with 1,350 costs. In November 2015, Mr A bought a ram from Mr B and agreed to return it by the end of the lambing season. After the ram was returned in May 2016, Mr B noticed he was missing five ewes, so he collected the ram to check if it was healthy. In September 2016, Mr B then noticed that five of his ewes were missing again. As a result, he brought the ram back to his farm and inseminated all of his ewes. The Ammanford farmer realised he was missing sheep in February 2016, so he contacted the police who carried out an investigation. The farmer recognised his ewes at the livestock market in Llanybydder and he was given a receipt for them. The farmer collected his ewes from Mr B's farm and discovered that 45 of the ewes had given birth to lambs. The farmer took blood samples and paternity tests revealed that 45 of the lambs belonged to Mr B's ram. Rural Crime Officer PC David Rosser said: ""Mr A allowed Mr B to collect the ewes from his farm, which was a mistake. The farmer had to spend 2,000 on paternity tests and the DNA results proved that Mr B's ram had fathered the lambs. ""This case demonstrates that if you allow your livestock to leave your property, then there is a high chance they will end up in another farmer's flock. Farmers must take the necessary steps to keep their livestock safe.""",0,410

"Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup. Morocco, meanwhile, were banned from the 1998, 2006 and 2012 World Cups for their refusal to play in qualifiers against Israel. These were among several irregularities, Caf says, which included the ordering of the preliminary draw for the Nations Cup and the World Cup to take place in Dakar, Senegal on 25 January - a move which Caf says undermined its authority.

"The draft legislation was approved by 494 votes to 122, and now moves to the House of Lords. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis was one of 52 Labour MPs to defy the party whip and vote against the EU Withdrawal Bill. The government's majority of 372 is the largest since 1997. EU Withdrawal Bill (Third Reading) - 8 February 2018 Source: Department for Exiting the European Union The government's majority of 372 is the largest since 1997, when Tony Blair was elected in a landslide. It also means that the EU Withdrawal Bill will have passed through the Commons in 15 months. The bill will now pass to the Lords, where peers will debate it for a week before its second reading on 21 February. The bill is designed to ensure the UK has a functioning statute book when it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. MPs were given a free vote on the amendment to the bill, which sought to enshrine in law the date of Brexit, but it was defeated by 315 votes to 295, a majority of 20. Labour backed the amendment, but 17 of its MPs voted against it. The Scottish National Party, which had argued that the government should not be allowed to ""plough on"" with the bill until it had an agreed deal with the EU, also backed the amendment. The amendment was defeated with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs, who backed the government. The government is expected to face a tougher challenge in the Lords, where a number of peers have said they will seek to amend the bill. The bill is designed to ensure the UK has a functioning statute book when it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. It will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which took the UK into the then European Economic Community, and convert all existing EU laws into UK law. It will also end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. However, it will give ministers the power to make changes to EU laws, without consulting MPs, to make them work once they are part of UK law. MPs have previously voted to remove this power - known as Henry VIII powers - but the government won a second vote on the issue. A further concern for some MPs is that the government will not be able to seek an extension of the transition period after 2020, when the UK and EU are expected to agree a free trade deal. The government had planned for the two-year transition period to finish at the end of December 2020, but the BBC understands officials are preparing for a delay of a few months to allow more time to finalise a free trade deal. The government says it has not asked for an extension, but Brexit Secretary David Davis has said it would ""probably"" need more time. The bill has already been through a number of amendments in the Commons. MPs backed the government's plan for the UK to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, rather than 00:00. They also voted against an amendment requiring the government to report to Parliament on the progress of Brexit negotiations every two months. In December, MPs voted to reject an amendment seeking to keep the UK in the EU's single market during the post-Brexit transition period. They also rejected an amendment to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal, a compromise that was tabled after a rebellion by Tory MPs in December. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the bill would provide ""the maximum amount of certainty to businesses, workers and consumers as we leave the EU,"" adding: ""We look forward to continuing the debate in the House of Lords."" Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: ""It is a shame that so many Tory MPs have been unwilling to protect Parliamentary sovereignty and have failed to back Labour's amendments which would have prevented ministers' power-grab on our rights and protections."" Scotland's Brexit minister, Mike Russell, said the bill was ""fundamentally flawed"" and would allow the government to ""use Brexit as an excuse",0,414
"Mr Poots made the comments on the BBC's Nolan Live on Wednesday night. Speaking to Sinn Fein's Alex Maskey, Mr Poots said: ""We'll do business with you because it's in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland."" But he did not rule out the possibility that the DUP would go into a formal coalition with Sinn Fein. ""I'm not saying we're going to sit down with Sinn Fein and form a government,"" he added. Sinn Fein's Conor Murphy said that his party had no ambition to go into a formal coalition with the DUP. ""I don't think there's any appetite for that whatsoever,"" he said. ""I think the people of the north are quite happy with the fact that we've got the Executive. We don't need to go any further than that. ""And I think the example in Scotland and Wales shows that. So if you're not going to do it in Scotland and Wales, then why would you do it in the north?"" Murderers don't get pensions, but terrorists do? It should also be remembered that while serving a minimum of 14 years in prison for the murder of nine Protestant workmen, each of the killers has been earning at least 12,000 per year in tax-free pensions. In addition, the families of the 10 terrorists receive a minimum of 40,000 every year from the state in 'special widows' pensions'. Although the IRA terrorists receive money and pensions, this has not been the case for the victims. The mother of a teenage workman shot dead by the IRA at Kingsmills, Margaret Wilson, said that she had never received a single penny from the state. Mrs Wilson said that the pension payments to the killers and their families was ""a kick in the teeth"" for the victims and the families of the dead. ""We had no money. I've never got a penny and I don't want a penny from the government,"" she said. ""But I just feel that the people who were responsible for our loved ones' deaths are now getting a lot of money, that's what upsets me. ""It's all wrong, it's a kick in the teeth. They murdered my son and other innocent people and now they're getting a pension. It's disgraceful. It's wrong."" According to the government, a number of other terrorist groups are set to receive huge pension payments. Republican terrorists released from jail under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement are also due to get a minimum of 375 per week tax-free pensions. Around 180 terrorists are receiving huge pensions while another 300 ex-terrorists are also due to receive pensions. The terrorists who receive pensions have been convicted of a series of murder campaigns during the Troubles. The Provos were responsible for 1,815 murders, while the UVF and UFF were behind 1,024 killings. The INLA was responsible for 114 murders, while the UDA was behind 259 killings. The terrorists will also receive a lump sum payment of 10,000 when they retire. Although the terrorists receive pensions, this is not the case for the vast majority of their victims. Between 1971 and 1998, a total of 3,532 people were killed in the Troubles. Over 1,900 of the Troubles victims are Protestants who were murdered by Republican terrorists. A total of 1,911 soldiers and police officers were also killed in the Troubles. In most cases, the families of the terrorists' victims do not receive any pension payments from the state. Many of the Troubles victims' families are also still waiting for compensation from the state. The Good Friday Agreement, which provided for the release of terrorist prisoners, was signed 15 years ago. It is believed that Sinn Fein demanded the huge pension payments for terrorist prisoners as part of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations. It is also believed that Sinn Fein insisted that the taxpayer should foot the bill for the terrorists' pensions and not the IRA",0,415

"Mr Kalashnikov had been involved in the ""anti-Maidan"" protests in support of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych. It is not clear if he was murdered or committed suicide. Police say an investigation has been launched. Mr Kalashnikov was a member of the Ukrainian Communist Party, the largest opposition force in parliament. His death comes amid ongoing anti-government protests against the policies of the new administration of President Petro Poroshenko. His body was found on the ninth floor of a building in Kiev, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko wrote on Facebook. ""He was a witness in a criminal case over the events at the Maidan,"" he said. Anti-government protests in Kiev's Maidan (Independence) Square toppled President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. Mr Kalashnikov, 52, was a former member of the Ukrainian parliament. He was also a candidate in snap elections held in October 2014. According to the Ukrainian Communist Party, Mr Kalashnikov was going to fly to Moscow on Thursday. The party's deputy chairman, Alexander Bondarenko, told the Tass news agency he had been threatened, adding that his ""name was found on one of the lists on Maidan of the so-called pro-Russian saboteurs."" In an interview with the online publication Ukrainskaya Pravda in December 2013, Mr Kalashnikov had said he would fight against ""the Maidan until the end."" ""I've been fighting against these [pro-Western] bastards for 23 years. I know their faces. I will do all I can to stop them. If they [the Maidan activists] try to attack the [Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament], I will be the first to grab a Kalashnikov and fight them to the end,"" he said. Mr Kalashnikov was a defendant in a high-profile trial over the storming of the Ukrainian parliament by protesters in 2010. He was convicted of organising a mass riot and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. He appealed against the verdict, but fled to Russia after being released on bail.

"John Fell, from Cumbria, is confident his 1.5kg ostrich egg covered in meat will earn him a Guinness World Record. The existing record was set in 2008 in a London pub by a Scotch egg weighing just 340g. Mr Fell's mother, Lesley, said: ""He likes to try different things. He's always been that way. ""He was taught to cook by his father, who is a chef."" The egg was boiled for 15 hours before being wrapped in a whole pig, then lamb and then beef. Mr Fell has sent off his entry to the Guinness World Records and expects to hear if it has been successful in the next three weeks. To win the title he must have the biggest egg - but also the biggest filling. Mrs Fell said: ""It's about three and a half feet long, but weighs about 30kg when it's finished."" She added: ""It has the pig in the middle, with the lamb wrapped around it, then the beef. It's all been matured and seasoned."" Mr Fell runs his own catering company and took inspiration for the massive egg from his friend Ross Keightly, who has the world's largest Scotch egg, which weighs about 6.2kg.

"The Yellows dominated possession but were caught on the break by Lenell John-Lewis who fired in spectacularly from 25 yards just before the interval. Pat Hoban rewarded Oxford's dominance when he levelled midway through the second half, but the visitors took all three points when Craig Stanley headed in a corner at the near post. The Mariners made one change to the starting line-up that beat Aldershot last week, as Craig Disley came in for the suspended Danny East. Town started on the attack, with Hoban shooting well over from a tight angle inside the opening minute, and a couple of minutes later a cross from the left was met by the head of Shaun Pearson, but again the Town striker was unable to hit the target. The visitors were looking dangerous on the counter-attack though and a run by Asa Hall down the right led to a shot from 20 yards by John-Lewis which was saved by McKeown. The first corner of the game came on eight minutes and after a short ball was played in by John-Lewis, Oxford had the ball in the net but it was ruled out for offside. Another Oxford corner came soon afterwards and this time, the visitors took the lead when the ball was played out to JOHN-LEWIS on the right. The forward cut inside and fired into the far corner of the net, giving McKeown no chance. Town's first corner of the game came in the 20th minute, after a long throw had been headed away by Tom Newey, but Pearson was penalised for climbing on the defender as the ball came in. McKeown had to be alert soon afterwards to keep the score at 1-0, as he made a save at full stretch to keep out a low shot from Sean Rigg. Good play by Pearson and Hoban on the left led to the latter crossing for Disley but his header was comfortably caught by visiting keeper Ryan Clarke. The Mariners were starting to enjoy more of the possession but they struggled to create clear chances as Oxford looked to keep their lead intact until half-time. A foul by Oxford's Jon Meades gave Town another chance to put the ball into the danger zone and this time, McKeown was able to get to the ball ahead of a defender to head it goalwards. Clarke made the catch but it was an encouraging sight for the home supporters. Soon afterwards, a long throw from Magnay was headed on by Pearson for Hoban but he could only head wide, then after a low cross from Magnay was cleared, the ball was played back in by Thomas and Hoban headed wide. One added minute was signalled to be played at the end of the half and Town had a free kick after a foul by James Clarke on Thomas. The ball was played towards the far post but a good block by Oxford defender Joe Riley prevented a shot. That proved to be the last opportunity of the half and Oxford retained their lead at the interval. No changes were made before the restart and the first attack of the second half brought a chance for the visitors, as John-Lewis had a shot blocked for a corner, which came to nothing. Town then had a good spell of possession but were unable to find an opening in the Oxford defence. A foul on Magnay gave the Mariners a free kick on the right on 55 minutes. It was pumped into the box and Rigg was penalised for a push on Thomas. From the second free kick, Disley shot wide. Another free kick came on the hour but this time, it was Oxford who were given the opportunity to put the ball into the box and it was headed away by Pearson. Town's dominance of possession was finally rewarded with a goal on 67 minutes, when Hoban got the ball from Disley on the edge of the box and fired a low shot past Clarke and into the far corner of the net to make it 1-1. Town had a let-off soon afterwards, when a shot from the edge of the box by Hall was deflected over the bar for a corner. It was punched clear by McKeown and Hoban's low shot from 20 yards was caught by Clarke. Oxford made a double substitution, with Jon Meades and Josh Ruffles making way for Callum O'Dowda and Tyrone Barnett. A foul by Rigg on Magnay gave Town another free kick around 30 yards from goal but it",0,420
"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must be changed. The authors say the school, college and university game must be made safer, or the young will abandon it. Head injuries and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a form of brain damage - are associated with rugby. In the paper, in the British Medical Journal, the authors suggest a range of steps to make the sport safer. These include changing the rules to ban dangerous play, abolishing the ""scrum"" where players come together head first, and using synthetic pitches, which reduce the impact of collisions. Sport governing bodies and policy-makers must give a clear commitment to prioritise player safety, and to put their health and welfare before the need for winning. The authors, from the Institute of Health and Society at Queen Mary, say the drive to win needs to be balanced by a focus on safety. They cite the example of the 1966 England captain, Martin Peters, who was concussed and helped off the pitch during a game - only to return to the field of play. Prof Pollock says that was a ""horrendous"" example. She also refers to studies of professional players in Australia, who donated their brains to science after they had died. They were found to have had CTE, a condition usually found in boxers. This is the only way the safety of players can be assured, as changes to rules and practice alone will not be sufficient. There is no suggestion that rugby should be banned completely - that is not what the authors want. They say they want the sport to be played in a safer way, with better equipment and fewer injuries. The BBC contacted the Rugby Football Union, which said the sport was ""in a strong position"" in terms of player safety.",0,421
"The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The White House said North Korea should ""focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations."" Satellite imagery showed that the reactor was shut down five days after the North's April 25 rocket launch, 38 North reported on Friday, adding that the move was ""most likely"" for maintenance and upgrades. ""We assess that the most likely reasons for this shutdown are for either an upgrade to install or test the cooling system for the operation of the new reactor, or to remove fuel rods for possible reprocessing,"" it said. The report comes after the North's leader Kim Jong-Un told a ruling party congress last month that Pyongyang had the capacity to mount a nuclear attack if it was provoked by Washington. Pyongyang says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against the threat of invasion, and regularly cites the US military presence in South Korea.

The occupants of the other car were taken to hospital for treatment. The death of the woman in the single-vehicle crash is the second fatality on roadways in the capital region over the weekend. On Saturday evening, police said a 60-year-old woman was found dead in a car after it hit a pole on Bay Street. Ottawa police said the woman was the only person in a northbound vehicle that collided with a car occupied by two adults and two children at about 10:50 a.m. The occupants of the other car were taken to hospital for treatment. The crash closed a section of the roadway between Carling Avenue and the Queensway, as police investigated the collision. Ottawa police asked drivers to avoid the area as they investigated. Just after 6 p.m. on Saturday, police were called to a report of a collision between a car and a pole at the intersection of Bay and George streets. Paramedics were first to arrive and pronounced the woman dead at the scene. The fatal crash is the city's 25th traffic-related death of 2018.",0,423
"Age Scotland says official figures suggest that each year about 8,640 people in Scotland wait longer than six weeks for a council care assessment. The average ""worst case"" is between 354 and 423 days. However, only half of Scotland's 32 local authorities have responded to Freedom of Information requests seeking this information. Age Scotland called on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to tackle the problem. The body's Charge campaign manager, Lynsey Kilgour, said: ""The Scottish Government's own care strategy 'Reshaping Care for Older People' calls for no one to wait more than six weeks for an assessment. ""In reality, people are waiting far longer than that, with some waiting over a year, and this is unacceptable. ""Age Scotland believes that older people should never have to wait longer than 28 days for an assessment and that the Scottish Government must take urgent action to ensure that councils are working to meet this target."" Ms Kilgour urged the Scottish Government to make the availability of community-based care a priority and ensure that councils have sufficient resources to enable older people to stay at home. The government was also urged to develop ""appropriate mechanisms"" to hold councils to account to ensure they are meeting statutory obligations. A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""The government's Reshaping Care for Older People strategy calls for no one to wait more than six weeks for an assessment. ""We have increased spending on free personal care by 17.5 million this year, taking total spending on free personal and nursing care to more than 400 million. ""Local authorities have the flexibility to provide services in the most appropriate way for their residents. ""We are working closely with councils to help them deliver the changes in the strategy, including the piloting of new approaches to assessment."" Age Scotland says the following councils have said the worst wait for a care assessment is less than 20 days: Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Midlothian, Moray, North Lanarkshire, Orkney, Perth Kinross, Scottish Borders, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian and West Dunbartonshire. Those which say the worst wait is 21-30 days are: Argyll Bute, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Highland, North Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.

"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that a bird's decision to stand on one leg rather than two is actually a simple balancing act. The finding is reported in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Jonathan O'Neill and colleagues from the University of Manchester found that standing on one leg reduces the stress on the bones of birds when they are standing in their natural upright pose. In contrast, when the birds are perched on their heels, as they do when they are asleep, standing on two legs is more efficient. Previous work by the team has shown that the position of a bird's centre of mass, and therefore the forces it generates when it stands, are dependent on the bird's pose. For example, when a bird's centre of mass is above its feet, it can balance itself using a minimal amount of muscle activity. However, the problem of balancing becomes more difficult when the centre of mass falls in front of the feet, because the bird needs to exert muscular effort to keep itself upright. Birds, like people, have two basic poses. In the ""active pose"" they are standing upright, with their body more or less vertical. In the ""passive pose"" they are perched on their heels with their thighs and upper legs horizontal and their toes pointing to the rear. The researchers show that when the centre of mass falls behind the feet, as it does when the bird is in the active pose, it becomes more efficient for the bird to stand on one leg. However, when the centre of mass falls in front of the feet, the birds should stand on both legs to maximise their stability. The researchers argue that this is why most birds sleep with their bodies in the passive pose. The one exception to this rule is the ostrich, which sleeps in the active pose. The team suggests that because ostriches are so large, they need the extra stability that comes from standing on two legs. The team carried out experiments on dead birds as well as a live pigeon. The birds' leg bones were subjected to forces equivalent to their body weight when they were standing on one leg and then on two. The results showed that when a bird stands on one leg, the bones in its standing leg are subject to significantly less strain than when it stands on both legs. The researchers also investigated the mechanics of how birds stand on one leg. They found that the secret is to tilt the upper body forward and the hip joint back. This ensures that the centre of mass falls behind the feet. ""When a bird stands on one leg, it has to shift its centre of mass towards the leg it is standing on to avoid falling over,"" says O'Neill. ""This makes its upper body lean forward and its hip joint bend backwards. The result is that the bird is more stable and the strain on its leg bones is reduced."" The researchers conclude that the one-legged stance is a simple way of reducing the stress on a bird's legs. O'Neill believes that the research has implications for the design of robots. ""We can use the same principles to make more efficient robots,"" he says. ""If we can make a robot that is stable and can recover its balance after being knocked over, we can make it perform better and use less energy.""

"The ""surprising find"" in Avebury, which is 30m (98ft) wide, is thought to be one of the site's earliest structures. The square of megaliths appears to have been erected around 3,600 BC, hundreds of years before a prehistoric stone circle was built at the site. The stones in the structure, which form a cove, are each up to 4.5m (15ft) long and weigh up to 40 tonnes. The experts say that each was dragged to the site from up to 20 miles (32km) away. ""The discovery of this major new stone monument, which has been preserved to its original height, will completely change the way we think about the Avebury landscape, and about the stone monuments of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages,"" said archaeologist Dr Mark Gillings. The site is a World Heritage Site and contains the largest stone circle in Europe. ""This discovery is likely to change how prehistoric Britain is viewed, and the discoveries are likely to be nationally, if not internationally, important,"" said Dr Joshua Pollard, from the University of Southampton. ""The Avebury monuments are known to be some of the most spectacular and mysterious megalithic monuments in the world. ""The discovery of a major new stone monument within the Avebury landscape is incredibly rare. Any stone monument found at Avebury is a major national and indeed international discovery. ""This new monument could well be contemporary with the major stones circles and avenues of Avebury, which are around 4,500 years old."" The site was discovered by the National Trust, which manages the area, as it was carrying out a survey of the area. The stones, which are buried up to a metre (3ft) below ground level, were found using a high-resolution ground-penetrating radar. The site appears to have been built in a style associated with the earlier Neolithic period, while the stone circle was built in the later Neolithic period. ""This discovery is the latest stage of a project which has been investigating the archaeological landscape of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site for the last three years,"" said Dr Nick Snashall, from the National Trust. ""We started this project to try to answer some key questions about the archaeology of the Avebury landscape, one of which was why the monumental assemblage of megalithic monuments - the stone circles and avenues - are distributed in such a haphazard manner. ""Our investigations have revealed that the area surrounding the monuments was far from being a barren, windswept landscape, as we have been led to believe; instead, it was a place that people not only settled, but also modified and exploited to produce food."" The archaeologists believe that the site was later deliberately concealed and only rediscovered when an aggressive strain of Maize started to grow through the site. ""The realization that the area surrounding the Avebury monuments was densely occupied during the Bronze Age has been a significant surprise,"" said Mr Snashall. ""The discovery of this new monument is a further indication of the rich archaeological potential of the area, which has been radically transformed by the application of new prospection techniques over the last few years."" The experts are now hoping to carry out a further geophysical survey of the site, followed by excavation, to uncover the true extent of the site and the archaeological treasures buried beneath the surface. ""This monument could well be one of the real core monuments of the area,"" said Dr Snashall. ""We have a monument that no-one knew existed, which could well be one of the real core structures of the World Heritage Site. ""We are hoping that what we have discovered will rewrite the archaeological map of this World Heritage Site."" The site at Avebury is around 20 miles (32km) north of Stonehenge. Avebury was constructed in several stages between around 3,000 and 2,400 BC, during the Neolithic period. It contains the largest stone circle in Europe, which is 331.6m (1,088ft) in diameter and originally consisted of 98 stones, some of which were 6m (20ft) high and weighed 40 tonnes. The stones were thought to have been dragged from a site 25 miles (40km) away. Within the circle was a large oblong",0,426

"In recent months, state media have been stressing the waters have been China's ""since ancient times."" Now, state media are rolling out masses of fresh material aimed at discrediting The Hague's tribunal and its decision. The decision of the arbitration tribunal on the South China Sea dispute will be an even bigger blow to China's diplomacy and the ruling Chinese Communist Party than the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown was, according to Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at Harvard Law School. China to refuse ruling China, which boycotted the hearings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, has already said it will not abide by the ruling. The court has no enforcement powers but a ruling against China would allow countries to take legal action to ensure it abides by it, such as by blocking Chinese ships from its waters. The court has said it will issue its ruling on July 12 in the case brought by the Philippines in 2013. The case contests China's claim to an area shown on its maps as nine dashes stretching deep into the maritime heart of Southeast Asia, covering hundreds of disputed islands and reefs. South China Sea dispute. Praise for The Hague tribunal ""I hope and believe the ruling will make China understand that the international community is not happy with its claims, and they will have to recognize the ruling and give up their illegal claims in the South China Sea,"" Teng told RFA. ""It is likely that the tribunal will rule against China, because China's claims have no legal basis."" ""The tribunal is likely to rule that the nine-dash line has no basis in law, and that the islands around it don't make up an exclusive economic zone,"" he said. He said the tribunal's ruling would be binding on China under international law. ""China's leaders, who are all lawyers, are the ones who can least afford to refuse the ruling,"" Teng said. ""If they refuse it, they will be totally stripped of all credibility, and this will be far more serious than Tiananmen,"" he said. Teng said China is likely to respond with a military buildup in the disputed waters. ""China is likely to use military force to intimidate the international community, and to show the international community that it has no choice but to accept the status quo,"" he said. ""But this will only bring China further international isolation."" ""It will also escalate the danger of war, and further endanger China's stability,"" Teng said. 'Lawfare' According to the official Xinhua news agency, the tribunal is ""a publicity stunt pulled by the Philippines and some Western countries,"" and the ruling will be ""nothing more than a piece of paper."" China has repeatedly said it doesn't accept the case, and the Philippines has breached an agreement between the two countries to seek resolution through bilateral talks. ""The award, to be made on July 12, will be illegal, invalid, and unrecognizable from the start,"" Xinhua said. It said Beijing had not taken part in the proceedings, nor had it accepted the panel's authority. China has carried out massive reclamation work around the islands it controls, and reports suggest it is building military installations on them. The Philippines and other neighboring countries, including Vietnam, which also claims sovereignty over some of the islands, have expressed concern over China's reclamation work and military build-up, as well as the impact on fishermen and merchants plying their trade in the area. ""Lawfare"" In a commentary on Sunday, the Global Times newspaper dismissed The Hague's tribunal as ""lawfare."" ""No matter what kind of verdict the court will issue, it will not stop the construction of China's islands,"" the paper said. ""The only thing the ruling can do is add to the pile of trash in the court's bin."" The paper said China is ""not worried in the slightest"" about the ruling. ""We have prepared for the worst,"" it said. But Teng said the ruling should prompt a rethink of China's claims, which would be ""very hard for the regime to do.""

"It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos. But there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home, the songwriter and singer Elizabeth Ziman, the heart and soul of the band, struck up a conversation with a stranger. ""He was a young man, maybe 18 years old, and he was a big fan of our music,"" she says. ""He was like, 'Oh my God, I love that song, 'Hey Doreen,' so much. But Ziman was still in disguise and the young man had no idea that he was speaking to the person who had written the song. ""It was this really incredible moment where I got to hear what someone had to say about my music without having any idea who I was,"" she says. ""He was like, 'It's this song about abuse, and I hear that in there, but to me it's this song about how I feel alienated in this world. Ziman paused, then looked up at him. ""That's exactly what I was going for,"" she said. ""I was so glad it came across that way."" ""He had no idea it was me,"" she says. ""It was amazing."" Soon, however, the band will be stepping out of the shadows. Today, Echosmith reveals a new album, Inside a Dream, and a slate of new tour dates in support of the record. And on Friday, they will release a new video for ""Dear World,"" which features the vocalist's two siblings, Jamie and Noah Sierota, as well as violinist Lindsey Stirling. ""This is the story of two people who fall in love and the one thing that they are missing is someone to share their love with,"" Ziman says of the video. ""So they try to create another person, but they can't, so they just decide to dance. ""There's something really beautiful in that,"" she says. ""The whole record has a theme of hope and love and acceptance of romance, in a world right now that's pretty chaotic."" ""Dear World"" is the fourth song that the band has released in advance of the album. The first was ""Future Me,"" a propulsive, synth-driven song that seemed to nod both to the '80s and to the burgeoning electropop movement. In January, they followed that with ""Goodbye,"" a wistful breakup song built around Ziman's piano. And last month, they released ""18,"" a love song built around acoustic guitar, cello and shakers. ""I've been really trying to push myself as a songwriter and as a singer to get out of my comfort zone,"" she says. ""I think I've really grown as an artist and I'm excited for this to come out and for people to hear it."" Indeed, she says, the goal is for the album to tell a single story. ""What I'm going for is a concept album, but I feel like it's almost like the score for a movie that hasn't been made yet,"" she says. ""I'm trying to create this movie in your head. It's a story of how one falls in and out of love and it's told in a nonlinear fashion."" And as the album progresses, she says, the songs move forward in time. ""The album begins with meeting that person and falling in love with them and realizing that they are the love of your life,"" she says. ""It's the story of being with that person and then things start to go wrong, and the story is about splitting apart and realizing that you have to say goodbye to that person, even though you thought that you'd be with them forever."" The final track, she says, is called ""The Only One."" ""That is the song that tells the story of realizing that you have to be the love of your own life,"" she says. ""You have to love yourself before you can love someone else. It's realizing that you are going to be OK and that you are the only person in charge of your own happiness.

Mr Peres, who was one of the last of a generation of Israeli leaders present at the new nation's birth, was given a state funeral. President Barack Obama will represent the United States at the funeral, which will be held at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem. The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, has been holding a memorial service. In a tribute to Mr Peres, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""He was a great man of Israel's rebirth, a visionary and pragmatist, a warrior and a diplomat, a public servant and a man of the people."" In a letter to Mr Peres's family, US President Barack Obama wrote that his country ""lost a true friend"" with Mr Peres's death. He described the former president as ""the essence of Israel itself - the courage of Israel's fight for independence, the optimism he shared with his wife Sonya as they helped make the desert bloom, and the perseverance that led him to serve his nation in virtually every position in government across the entire life of the State of Israel."" Mr Obama added: ""A light has gone out, but the hope he gave us will burn forever."" Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas spoke of Mr Peres's ""brave way"" and called him ""a partner in making the brave peace with the martyr [former Palestinian leader] Yasser Arafat and prime minister [Yitzhak] Rabin."" Mr Peres's family were by his bedside when he died, the hospital said, without giving further details. Mr Peres had suffered a stroke two weeks ago and been placed into an induced coma. His condition had improved briefly before a sudden deterioration on Tuesday. Mr Peres won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier. He held almost every major office in the country's history, serving twice as prime minister and also as president, foreign minister and finance minister. Mr Peres had been in the hospital near Tel Aviv since 13 September, when he was taken to hospital feeling unwell. A subsequent brain scan revealed the stroke. His office said at the time that the stroke had caused no paralysis, but he remained sedated and on a respirator in intensive care. He is the latest in a string of prominent Israelis to die in the past few years. In 2014, former prime minister Ariel Sharon - a former political ally and, later, rival of Mr Peres - died after spending eight years in a coma caused by a stroke. Former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Mr Peres, was assassinated in 1995. Mr Peres was born in Poland in 1923 and moved to what was then British-ruled Palestine with his family in 1934. He joined the Zionist struggle and met David Ben-Gurion, who would become his mentor and Israel's first prime minister. When independence was declared in 1948 Mr Peres became director of Israel's navy, and over the next 66 years he was at the heart of every major event in the nation's history. He held almost every major post in the cabinet, serving twice as prime minister and also as finance minister and foreign minister. He won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier. He had won the Nobel Prize before becoming president in 2007. Mr Peres once said the award moved him deeply. ""Society wants to honour people who devote their lives to increasing the wellbeing of their fellow men,"" he said. In June 2014, Mr Peres completed his seven-year term as Israel's ninth president, after declining to stand for re-election. He once said: ""I'm not just a dreamer. I'm a realistic dreamer."" He added: ""I may be 90, but I still have a brain that is 17 years old. That is the biological age of the brain.""

Police have found a headless torso in the water near the site where a missing Swedish journalist disappeared. The submarine is one of three constructed by Madsen and one of the largest privately built ones in the world. The submarine was sunk on Friday morning and then salvaged later that day. The New York Times reports that Wall was on the submarine to report a story on Madsen, and that he claimed to have dropped her off on a Copenhagen island shortly before the submarine sank. The Swedish Embassy in Copenhagen has been in contact with Danish authorities and has relayed information to her family, the embassy said.",0,439

"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, General Lord Dannatt said it was wrong to ""talk up"" the incidents. Five Afghan soldiers died in an assault on the British base in Nahr-e-Saraj on Tuesday. He said the ""vast majority"" of the Afghan forces were ""doing a good job."" He said: ""We must not talk up the seriousness of the insider threat. It's a very, very small part of the overall problem that we face in Afghanistan and indeed part of the overall problem in Afghanistan is to create Afghan security forces capable of taking over security responsibility in the country."" He added: ""I think that's what we've got to keep our eye on. We've got to keep a sense of proportion. There is an insider threat, but the vast majority of the Afghan security forces, whether they be army or police, are doing a good job."" He said the attacks should be seen in the context of the ""very high level of casualties"" the Taliban were suffering in the current fighting season. He added: ""I think they're ramping up the propaganda, the Taliban. That's the sort of thing they do."" He said the situation was ""not a disaster by any means"" and there had been a ""huge surge in recruitment"" in the Afghan army in the last year. Speaking at the Nato headquarters in Brussels, Secretary of State for Defence Philip Hammond said: ""While we have seen an increase in the number of incidents this year, the vast majority of our interactions with Afghan security forces are positive. ""The levels of cooperation, the levels of trust between our soldiers and the Afghan forces are very high. ""We have seen significant and effective action taken by the Afghans themselves to deal with this problem. ""We have had very good cooperation from the Afghan authorities, we have had good access to the facilities that the Afghans use to process recruits to their forces, we have had a very close cooperation with them in improving the vetting procedures and I'm confident that they are doing everything they can to deal with this problem."" But he said that the Afghan authorities had made ""little or no progress"" in improving the vetting process for recruits to their forces. ""We have had very good access to the facilities that the Afghans use to process recruits to their forces, we have had a very close cooperation with them in improving the vetting procedures and I'm confident that they are doing everything they can to deal with this problem,"" he said. The Afghan Ministry of Defence said it had tightened security and vetting procedures to try to prevent similar incidents. Ministry spokesman General Mohammad Zahir Azimi said: ""The number of insider attacks have been on the increase and it is a major concern for us. We have been working on this issue for almost a year and have put in place new measures to mitigate it. ""Afghan security personnel undergo rigorous background checks before being recruited. ""The documents that are submitted by the applicants are checked thoroughly by various government departments."" He added: ""Before any applicant is allowed to join the Afghan National Army or the Afghan National Police, they undergo a series of physical and psychological tests to assess their character. ""There is a three-month probationary period for all recruits before they are allowed to join an operational unit. ""They are also monitored closely once they join a unit."" It is not the first time that Lord Dannatt has expressed his concern over the insider attacks. Speaking earlier this month, he said: ""I do think that we are losing too many troops. ""There have been something like 16 so far this year from within the Afghan forces. That is really worrying."" And in June, he said the military commanders and politicians would have to take a ""cold, hard look"" at the situation if the number of attacks continued to increase. ""We've got to just be careful that this doesn't get out of control,"" he said. ""And, you know, if it does, there will be a moment - and it will probably come in the next year or 18 months - when the military commanders and the politicians are going to have to have a cold, hard look, yet again, at the strategy.""",0,442

The session was briefly red-flagged when Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso stopped at the entry to the pit-lane, with smoke billowing from the rear of the car. The Russian was taken back to the pits on a truck, and the session restarted after 11 minutes. Rosberg had already set a 1m 26.047secs lap that was comfortably the quickest of the weekend, but Hamilton was unable to beat it. The world champion made a mistake at Turn 10 and ran wide on his quickest lap, which was 0.318secs slower than Rosberg. Raikkonen had a trouble-free session, but his Ferrari lacks the single-lap pace of the Mercedes and he was nearly a second and a half slower than Rosberg. Sebastian Vettel, who had a troubled session, was fourth fastest, 0.379secs off Raikkonen and 0.396secs ahead of Williams driver Felipe Massa. The Brazilian made a late improvement on his final flying lap to sneak ahead of Vettel's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who was sixth. Ferrari's Vettel and Williams' Massa had a close run-in during qualifying Ricciardo had been ahead of Massa after the first runs in the top 10 shoot-out, but was unable to improve after the second runs.

Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was 11th, ahead of the McLarens of Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso. Hamilton was fastest in all three practice sessions on Friday and Saturday. Rosberg said he was ""delighted"" to beat his team-mate in qualifying. ""It was a really good lap,"" he said. ""I had an OK lap the first time and I knew I had to improve. I'm really pleased that it all worked out. ""It's going to be a long race tomorrow, but I'm hoping for a good one."" Hamilton said he had made a ""big mistake"" on his final run, when he ran wide at Turn 10. ""I was really happy with my lap before that,"" he said. ""The mistake I made is something I have not done all weekend. I just didn't put the car where I needed to. ""We'll see what we can do tomorrow."" Vettel, who was fourth, was less than satisfied with his performance, saying he had been ""a bit stupid"" on his final run. ""I think we could have got on the front row but we did a mistake on the last lap, so it was my fault,"" he said. ""I was a bit stupid in the last corner, so I lost some time there.

""His bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten,"" he said. ""It's a miracle,"" said Dana McKay, who was 15 when her father died. ""I'm just so thankful to have him home. To have his name and his service be recognized. It's been a long, long time."" Jocelyn McKay said she never doubted that her husband would be returned home someday.

""I will never forget when Jocelyn said, 'We need to bring my husband home, Feinstein said. ""I hope this ceremony gives you a sense of closure and peace."" Her husband, Richard, also a pilot, survived the war. He died in 1992. For the past 10 years, Jocelyn McKay has been living in an assisted living facility in the San Fernando Valley. Her son, George McKay, a lawyer in Sacramento, said he hoped his mother's story would be a reminder to Americans that the nation's longest war is still claiming lives. ""This war isn't over for the families,"" he said. He said his mother and father were married for just 26 days before he was sent to Vietnam. His father, who grew up in Portland, Ore., was a member of an Air Force helicopter rescue squad. On Nov. 8, 1969, McKay was piloting a HH-3E ""Jolly Green Giant"" helicopter that was dispatched to rescue two downed airmen in Quang Binh province. McKay and four crew members located one of the men but came under heavy enemy fire. They managed to extract the airman, but as they flew away, the helicopter was hit by ground fire and crashed, killing McKay and two of the crew members. The two surviving crew members were taken captive and held as prisoners of war until 1973. McKay's remains were not recovered, and he was officially declared dead in 1974. He was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross, the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. George McKay said he has not yet decided whether he will bury his father's remains in Arlington National Cemetery. ""It's such a beautiful ceremony,"" he said of Friday's service.

"Protesters hung a sign over the city's famous Rialto bridge and some carried suitcases to symbolise having to leave. Locals say they are being forced out by high rents, housing shortages, and an invasion of tourists. ""We are living a period of mass exodus,"" said Davide Busato, head of campaign group We Want Venice. ""In the last 10 years, 30,000 Venetians have moved out of the city. ""We want to give a voice to all the Venetians who don't agree with what's happening to the city but don't express it because they're afraid of the consequences."" Venetians say their city is being ruined by the huge numbers of visitors - about 30 million a year. ""The message we want to send is that the Venetian population, which has fallen by 30,000 over the last 10 years, matters,"" said Busato. ""We want to make our voice heard by the institutions, the politicians and the citizens. It's not just a protest. We're doing this to draw attention to the fact that we have no more housing and jobs and that the city's infrastructure cannot support so many tourists."" The rally was timed to coincide with the anniversary of the death of the last Doge, or ruler, of the Venetian Republic, Ludovico Manin, 220 years ago. The city-state lost its independence to Napoleon in 1797. The organisers called on Venetians to hang the flags of the former republic from their windows. ""We want to remember the history of the Venetian Republic and the illustrious men and women who have animated the life of the city, and we want to do it in a non-violent and non-confrontational way,"" Busato said. The tourism industry is a vital part of the local economy but residents complain that large cruise ships endanger the city's architectural treasures.

"Daniel Bragg, 37, hit Julie Cook, 44, so hard he broke her left eye socket in the assault, police said. Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, causing a bleed on the brain. A woman who was savagely beaten by her partner after she posted an image of her new puppy on Facebook, leaving her with a fractured skull and broken eye socket, has been denied a restraining order against him. Julie Cook, 44, was attacked by her partner Daniel Bragg, 37, after he was annoyed at a photo she had posted on her Facebook page of their new puppy, a court heard. Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, causing a bleed on the brain. Bragg was sentenced to a year in jail at Plymouth Magistrates Court in August, but Ms Cook was denied a restraining order against her violent ex at the same court on Thursday, the Daily Mirror reported. Her defence barrister said the victim had ""told the probation service she would not like a restraining order,"" as Bragg's defence team said he had been remorseful and had no intention to harm her. Judge Simon Carr said: ""I am concerned about the fact she has been the victim of domestic violence but that she does not want a restraining order. ""She is a strong-willed and independent woman. Ms Cook, who lives in Plymouth, Devon, had met Bragg through mutual friends at the pub and the couple moved into a house together last year. But the relationship quickly turned sour when Bragg became jealous and would accuse Ms Cook of having affairs with other men, the court heard. Bragg's violent outburst came when he saw an image of the couple's new puppy on her Facebook page. Ms Cook suffered a fractured skull, broken eye socket and cuts and bruises to her head and body in the assault. In a statement she said she was left traumatised by the attack.

"It comes after Swansea City FC's American owners revealed they are in talks with the council over increasing capacity at the ground. The Swans want to add 12,000 seats but the discussions are at an early stage. The report says the stadium could be expanded to 40,000 by adding a third tier to the East and West stands. The Liberty Stadium was built in 2005 to replace the Swans' old Vetch Field ground. It has a capacity of just over 20,500 with a record crowd of 20,750 at the opening league match against Wigan Athletic. A Swansea Council spokesman said: ""Talks are continuing with the owners of Swansea City FC and the Ospreys over the future of the Liberty Stadium. We are very hopeful that a positive outcome can be achieved, but no deal has yet been done."" Alongside the stadium, the report identifies three other development sites within the city centre. Plans are already being drawn up for the 5.5 acre former St David's shopping centre site next to the Kingsway, which is being vacated to make way for a new 25m Tesco superstore. The council wants a new 500-bed student accommodation block there and a hotel, alongside other commercial space. ""This will be an exciting development for the city, which is set to be a catalyst for further regeneration and development,"" said the council spokesman. A new state-of-the-art theatre complex could be built on the car park next to Swansea Grand Theatre on Oystermouth Road. It will be ""designed to be flexible and respond to the demands of the market,"" said the report. The council is also looking at building a new leisure centre next to the existing Morfa leisure centre, in Morfa. No decisions have yet been taken about where or when the new centres would be built. Council leader David Phillips said the proposals would ""create new jobs and new investment in the city."" ""These projects will contribute to our aspirations for the city and Swansea's vision for the future,"" he said. ""We now look forward to hearing the views of local people and their ideas for the future of Swansea. ""The consultation will also help us identify how we can deliver these projects and where they should be located."" The council says the plans are not affected by the 30m cuts it has to make over the next two years. It said the development plans would be self-financing, using income from letting commercial property to pay for the projects. Last year the council sold Swansea Leisure Centre, which was refurbished for 10.5m in 2001, to a developer for 1m. Swansea Council chief executive Jim Harries said the decision to sell the centre was because it was ""inefficient and inappropriate"" for use as a leisure centre. ""The council's decision was not based on the amount of money that could be raised from the sale of the site,"" he said. ""The site would have been sold for 1 regardless of the amount of money the council had in its reserves.""",0,448
"His rival Yvette Cooper has called the war ""wrong"" while Andy Burnham has referred to it as ""an incredibly difficult period"" but said respect should be given to those who served. The Chilcot report, published on Wednesday, concluded that the UK chose to join the invasion before ""peaceful options for disarmament"" had been exhausted and that intelligence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) was presented with ""certainty that was not justified."" The 2.6 million-word report, which took seven years to compile, has been described as a ""damning indictment"" of Blair's decision to commit British troops to war. Corbyn said: ""The decision to invade and occupy Iraq in March 2003 was the most significant foreign policy decision taken by a British government in a generation. ""I believe that decision was wrong and that the war was contrary to international law. ""Those of us who opposed the war did so because we did not believe that Iraq posed a danger to the UK or that it had weapons of mass destruction. ""We feared the war would increase instability and extremism across the region and that it would leave Iraqis worse off - and those fears were well founded. ""The war has devastated Iraq, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the forced displacement of millions and the fragmentation of the country. ""The country is now a fertile ground for the rise of extremism. ""I am grateful to Sir John Chilcot for his meticulous and rigorous inquiry. ""We now know that the invasion and occupation of Iraq was a catastrophe. ""Unfortunately, however, we still do not know when or how that catastrophe will end. ""We have not seen an end to the catastrophe in Iraq and we are now seeing a new and terrible catastrophe in Syria."" The Labour leader went on to repeat his call for the UK to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia and focus its diplomatic efforts on finding a political solution to the Syrian conflict. He added: ""The Iraq inquiry report makes it absolutely clear that the UK's policy in relation to Iraq was based on flawed intelligence and assessments. ""It was not underpinned by proper planning or a coherent or acceptable legal basis. ""The report also makes clear that the policy was not deliverable. ""The UK's participation in the invasion and occupation of Iraq was a foreign policy disaster. ""And it has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions of refugees. ""We now know that the invasion and occupation of Iraq has ultimately strengthened Iran. ""And it has increased the threat from terrorism and ISIS. ""Our priority now must be to do everything we can to contribute to a lasting peace in the Middle East."" Cooper, who voted in favour of the invasion, tweeted: ""I voted against the Iraq War. The Chilcot report shows it was wrong."" She added: ""We must now make sure we learn the right lessons and never again repeat the mistakes of the past. ""The report makes clear that the invasion of Iraq was a grave mistake, which has caused huge suffering and ultimately made Britain less safe. ""The report makes clear that we were not just misled, but that the policy was made on the basis of assumptions that turned out to be incorrect and that the risks were not properly assessed or prepared for. ""This is not just a matter for the politicians who were in power at the time. ""It is a matter of profound importance for our country. ""We need to learn the lessons now in order to do everything we can to ensure we do not make the same mistakes again."" Burnham, who also voted to support the war, said it was ""the worst foreign policy decision in a generation"" and praised Corbyn for his opposition to the invasion. The Shadow Home Secretary said: ""As one of the MPs who voted in favour of the invasion in 2003, I understand the anger that many people still feel about the decision to go to war. ""The Iraq War was the worst foreign policy decision in a generation. ""The Chilcot report is a damning indictment of how the decision was taken.

New deals have been offered to goalkeeper Rouven Sattelmaier, defenders Matthew Lund, Anton Rodgers, Stephen Darby and Timothee Dieng. Not that he was eager to give too much away about his strategy for the 2018 season. ""When I start in January and February, it's always to try to win."" The 33-year-old is now concentrating on the task ahead at the All England Club this week, but he has already made the decision to alter his schedule next year. This year's biggest Grand Slam champion is now the victor of Wimbledon for the eighth time and is now just two major wins shy of tying the all-time record of 24 major titles held by Margaret Court. ""She's a great person,"" Muguruza said of Williams. ""I don't know if you can call it ""unfinished business,"" per se."" The 37-year-old American was hoping to win a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title but was blown away in straight sets by a fearless Muguruza. The 29-year-old added that he was hopeful that the club could bring in some exciting players during the summer transfer window. Although the club has already made one signing in the form of defender Sead Kolasinac , they are now being linked with a number of other top players. The 26-year-old, however, insists he is happy to stay at Goodison Park and help the club push for silverware in the coming years. The Toffees have endured a mixed summer so far, with the high of Rooney's return to the club being tempered by the disappointment of missing out on the signing of Olivier Giroud. Their first match is against New Zealand on 28 June before they take on Bangladesh , India and South Africa over the next three weeks. But their batting remains the weakest link, and in conditions that are expected to aid bowlers, the onus is on their batsmen to come good. Having recently been elected to the NBA's Board of Governors, it's understandable that the Warriors are hoping to avoid fines for their players and coaches whenever possible, and Green's comments are undoubtedly the most incendiary of the group. The Toffees have been active in the transfer market this summer as they look to build a squad capable of breaking into the top four in the Premier League next season. The 28-year-old has had three operations on the knee since suffering the injury in March and he is not expected to return to action until the end of the year. James has been named to the All-Star team in each of his first 14 seasons, and has been named first-team All-NBA 11 times, including each of the last three seasons.

German carmaker Volkswagen said on Monday that two of its suppliers had stopped deliveries to one of its factories in Puebla, Mexico, amid a contract dispute. The company said the parts suppliers, ES Automobilguss and Car Trim, had stopped delivering parts for the Volkswagen models Jetta, Beetle and Golf. ""We are negotiating with the suppliers to find a quick solution,"" Volkswagen said in a statement.

The Mexican Association of the Automotive Industry said that the factory produced 110,000 cars in 2016 and that the plant had a workforce of 4,500 people. VW said it had halted production at its Puebla plant on Sunday. ES Automobilguss is a German company that produces automobile seats. Car Trim makes seats and parts used in gearboxes. The dispute came on the heels of a threatened strike by workers at the factory on Friday, when they voted not to strike, pending negotiations between labor and the company. The German automaker said it could not assess how long the production halt would last. Volkswagen has been working to shore up its financial position following the so-called dieselgate scandal. The company has set aside billions of euros to cover the costs of the scandal, which saw it cheat on emissions tests with the aim of making it appear that its vehicles met environmental standards.

"The 35-year-old will have security clearance and access to classified information, but no official title or salary when she works in the West Wing. She will serve as her father's ""eyes and ears"" while providing broad-ranging advice, a senior administration official said Monday. WASHINGTON - Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the president, is getting an office in the White House West Wing, stepping up her highly visible role as an adviser to her father. She will not have an official title and is not expected to have a distinct portfolio of responsibilities. Her role will be to serve as the president's ""eyes and ears"" while providing broad-ranging advice, not just limited to women's empowerment issues, said Jamie Gorelick, an attorney who is also working on ethics issues for the president's older daughter. Ivanka Trump will not have a title or salary. President Trump has said his daughter, who has worked along with her brothers for the past year as a trustee of the Trump Organization, would be an invaluable asset to the administration. The first daughter has also been part of a number of meetings with world leaders and business leaders and has made calls alongside the president to foreign leaders, including the president of Turkey and the prime minister of Japan. She has also led initiatives such as talking to chief executives about how they can bring on and train more women and is spearheading the launch of an initiative to encourage more girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math. She has also been involved with recruiting candidates for high-level administration positions, including Dina Powell, the deputy national security adviser for strategy, who worked with Ivanka Trump at Goldman Sachs. Ivanka Trump will follow the same ethics restrictions that apply to government employees. That means she will not be able to participate in issues related to her fashion line or other business ventures. She is also not expected to file financial disclosure forms. Ivanka Trump will be an unpaid employee in the White House, following the rules that apply to federal government employees. But ethics experts have raised concerns that her access to the West Wing and her influence in the White House could create conflicts of interest. The first daughter is set to publish a book later this year, and she has started a fine jewelry line. Her husband, Jared Kushner, recently stepped down from the management company of his family's real estate business, which has raised ethics concerns of its own. ""The first issue is that this arrangement is so out of the ordinary that it's hard to assess what the conflicts of interest might be, because we've never seen this before,"" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""She's not subject to any of the traditional ethics rules, but we know that she has a lot of business and financial interests, and we know that those interests are going to be affected by government decisions,"" he said. Ivanka Trump has also been the face of the administration's efforts to reach out to women, including the announcement of a proposal that would mandate paid leave for new mothers and fathers. Last month, she sat next to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the country's first female leader, when the German leader visited the White House.

"Kallum Watkins gave the bottom-of-the-table Rhinos an early lead but Willie Isa's first two Wigan tries put them 12-4 ahead at the break. George Williams, Dom Manfredi and Ben Flower went over as the Warriors gained control. Watkins added a second try, but Wigan were too good. Leeds drop to 12th while Wigan, who have lost just once in their last seven games, climbed to second. The Rhinos, who have not reached the Super League Grand Final since 2005, have won just four of their 17 matches this season. They have lost all four of their games since the arrival of Dave Furner as head coach in June, with the Australian replacing Brian McDermott. Wigan, who started the season with a 6-6 draw at home to St Helens, have lost just one of their last seven games and are now just two points behind leaders St Helens. The Warriors, who last won the title in 2013, have won 24 of the 46 meetings between the sides since 2000. There was a minute's silence before the game in memory of Wigan and England winger Joe Burgess' father, who died in the early hours of Sunday morning. Furner said: ""I was pleased with a lot of what we did tonight. We had a lot of momentum in the second half but a few mistakes in crucial areas cost us. ""The boys are improving each week but we need to eradicate those errors. We will continue to work on that. We need to be more consistent with our performances. ""The effort was there tonight but we need to get rid of the errors and be more clinical. I'm still proud of the boys. They are doing a lot of hard work and it is getting better."" Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: ""Leeds are a quality team. They have got some players in there. They are going to come good, they are going to bounce back. ""It was a really tough game. We spoke at half-time that if we are going to win this game, we are going to win it in the second half. We spoke about getting a bit more accuracy.""

"Two employees of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) were initially quarantined in the office. A note reading ""die a painful death, Muslims,"" was in the envelope with the powder. CAIR's executive director said the incident was a hate crime and called for federal law enforcement to investigate. ""This hate incident is just the latest in a series of attacks targeting our nation's Muslim community,"" Nihad Awad, CAIR's executive director, said in a statement. ""FBI data show a spike in hate crimes nationwide last year. As the report indicates, anti-Muslim bias incidents and hate crimes have been rising since 2014."" The FBI data released last week showed a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 compared to 2016. Of those crimes, 1,679 were based on religious bias, including 273 against Muslims. Anti-Muslim incidents rose 15 percent nationwide in 2017, according to a study by CAIR. ""Islamophobia has unfortunately reached a level where hate crimes are now a regular occurrence,"" said CAIR-Florida Regional Operations Director Nezar Hamze. ""We cannot allow hate to fester in our society. We must learn to accept our differences and find common ground if we are going to move forward as a nation."" Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving a ban on wearing the niqab, or full face veil, in public buildings. The court's refusal to hear the case leaves in place a 2015 ruling by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling said the Muslim woman, who was not named, had no right to wear the veil covering her face except for the eyes while talking to police officers in a traffic stop. CAIR has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a Muslim student in Maryland who was prohibited from wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase ""Guns Don't Kill People, Americans Kill People."" It also filed a similar federal lawsuit in California on behalf of a Muslim student who was prohibited from wearing a T-shirt that said, ""I Am An American, I Am A Muslim.""

"The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) follows a 2013 investigation by BBC Panorama into the Military Research Force, or MRF. Daniel Rooney was 18 when he was shot and killed in 1972 by a soldier from the MRF, a secretive unit of the British army that was in Belfast at the height of the Troubles. The soldiers who served in the unit have never been identified. Members of the unit gave evidence to the Panorama programme under the condition of anonymity and described how they shot people without warning. The MRF operated in West Belfast between 1971 and 1973, at the height of the Troubles. Its members wore civilian clothes and drove cars with false number plates. They are believed to have killed up to 15 people. In 2013, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire, launched a review into the activities of the MRF. He has reportedly identified a former MRF soldier who he believes shot and killed Daniel Rooney. In response to this development, the family of Daniel Rooney said: ""We would like to thank the Police Ombudsman's office for their hard work in bringing this case to a successful conclusion. We would like to see a prosecution for the murder of our brother, Daniel. We also call on the British government to come forward and make a public apology for the murder of Daniel and other members of the community at the hands of the British Army.""

"Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a ""very, very strange year at Uber."" In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first day of work. She also says he tried to get her to have sex with other people on the team. When Fowler reported this, she says Uber's HR department tried to sweep the issue under the rug. And Fowler is far from the first Uber employee to complain about sexism at the company. I've been in tech for a while, and this is the first time I've heard of a tech company's HR department trying to cover up sexual harassment. Even in the most toxic of environments, that sort of thing has always been taken seriously. In fact, I've seen people fired for much less. And it's not because of a high standard of ethics in tech; it's because they've been sued and lost before. To make matters worse, Uber has been embroiled in scandals for quite a while now. These range from overly aggressive drivers who hassle passengers and drivers, to CEO Travis Kalanick and COO Emil Michael getting into a fight with a driver over Uber's falling fares. In an email to staff, Kalanick said: ""What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in."" He also says that an ""urgent investigation"" is underway. So what's going on at Uber? My theory: Uber's culture is broken. This is a company that has made a lot of enemies, and not just with drivers. When it comes to sexism, it's done a few things that are unacceptable in the corporate world: There's the frat boy culture. There's a story about a private dinner party where Kalanick was present. An Uber employee was talking to Kalanick's girlfriend and was overheard by another employee, who reported the incident to Kalanick. This set off a chain of events that resulted in the man being fired. There's the masturbating driver. There's the grayballing of law enforcement and government officials. There's the aggressive culture. There's the combative behavior. There's the ""always be hustlin mentality. There's the culture of ignoring laws. There's the price gouging. There's the God-complex. There's the ""women as sex objects"" culture. There's the culture of not caring about customers. There's the culture of not caring about employees. There's the culture of not caring about partners. There's the culture of not caring about laws. There's the culture of not caring about ethics. There's the culture of not caring about the press. There's the culture of not caring about your reputation. There's the culture of not caring about your drivers. There's the culture of not caring about your employees. There's the culture of not caring about your customers. There's the culture of not caring about the law. There's the culture of not caring about your investors. There's the culture of not caring about your board. There's the culture of not caring about the government. There's the culture of not caring about other people. It's pretty clear what's going on here: Uber has a broken culture. This isn't something that happened overnight. It's been going on for years. And it's been going on because the company is full of frat boys who think the rules don't apply to them. This isn't a story about Uber. This is a story about Silicon Valley. This is the story of a company that has gone off the rails. This is the story of the bubble that we've been talking about for years. But here's the thing: this isn't just Uber. It's all of Silicon Valley. Take a look at the companies that have imploded in the last few years: Snapchat (Classic frat boy culture) Zenefits (Sex, Drugs, and HIPAA Violations) Theranos (Elizabeth Holmes doesn't understand what's going on) Tinder (Sexual harassment) Reddit (Sexual harassment) TechCrunch (Sexual",0,458

"They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are ""of particular interest"" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved the parts were used to down the aircraft. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the discovery is consistent with her government's ""suspicions"" that MH17 was shot down by a Buk missile fired by Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. She says the parts were found near the crash site and were ""very consistent with a Buk missile system."" ""I believe the evidence is building and we need to be careful, we need to be meticulous, but we also need to be realistic about what is happening here,"" she told the Nine Network on Saturday. ""This is a system which was transferred from Russia into eastern Ukraine and into the hands of the separatists."" Ms Bishop has previously said the missile was fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists are fighting Ukrainian government forces. Ms Bishop has been adamant that Australia would not impose further sanctions on Russia without ""strong and compelling"" evidence. She has now reiterated that she wants to see the final report from the Dutch Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, before making any further decisions. ""I think that they will be able to come to a final conclusion, they will be able to determine the cause of the crash,"" she said. ""The evidence needs to be incontrovertible, the chain of evidence needs to be complete so that when we make a decision and when we say that we are convinced that this was a Russian missile fired by the separatists from eastern Ukraine, then no-one will be able to contradict that."" The parts were sent to the Dutch Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, and will be examined by military and civilian investigators. ""We're aware of the recent reports about parts found in the Ukraine that allegedly originate from a Buk missile system,"" a Dutch Safety Board spokeswoman told AFP. ""The Dutch Safety Board is in possession of the parts and is examining them in close cooperation with the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to find out more."" The Dutch-led JIT is investigating the cause of the crash, with experts from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Malaysia, Australia and Russia taking part. The team has previously said a Buk missile system, with up to six missiles, was moved from Russia to eastern Ukraine on the day of the crash and was then moved back across the border. JIT has said it is the ""most plausible scenario"" that the plane was shot down from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. But Russia has rejected suggestions its forces were involved and instead accused Ukrainian forces of shooting down the plane.",0,462
"Even though Cuba is less than 100 miles away from the US, the two counties fell out in 1959, and no American president has visited since then. The fall out was a result of Fidel Castro's nationalisation of American businesses in Cuba. However, on 16 June 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he was cancelling the detente started by his predecessor. This was due to a 90-year-old retired government worker being injured in a so-called 'sonic attack' at the US Embassy in Havana. However, the Cuban government has denied all knowledge of any such attack, and the FBI has been unable to find any evidence of the attack taking place. The announcement caused a flurry of activity, with many people thinking that this was the end of travel to Cuba, and airlines cutting down on flights. However, the announcement is a 'clamp down' rather than a 'ban', so what does it mean to US citizens travelling to Cuba? How has President Trump's decision affected US travellers? What does it mean to US travellers? The new restrictions apply to any US citizen travelling to Cuba. This means that they can no longer travel on a 'people to people' visa, which was intended to allow for cultural exchanges and the sharing of information between the two countries. This was the most popular way for tourists to visit the country. Instead, Americans will need to travel under a specific visa, which may not be issued for tourism, but must be for one of 12 approved activities, such as visiting family, conducting official US government business, or participating in educational activities. How has the decision affected US travellers? Many US travellers have been taking advantage of the more relaxed rules, and have been visiting the country by cruise ship, plane, and even by private boat. They have been able to enjoy a country that was once off-limits to them. What does it mean for the future of US travel to Cuba? The US has around 20 diplomatic staff at the Cuban Embassy. The Cuban government has stated that it wants the embassy to be reduced in size, as they want parity between the two countries. However, this may result in less staff being able to process the new types of visa, which will make it even harder for US travellers to visit the country. Cruise ships have been visiting the island, and this may also change. In the past, cruise ships were not allowed to visit the country, but due to the relaxation of travel rules, cruise lines such as Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Lines have been sending ships to the island. However, with the change of policy, there is no guarantee that this will continue. It remains to be seen what the future of US travel to Cuba will be, and how the Cuban government will respond.

"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013. There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in recent years, with the United Kingdom government having to legislate to reduce the numbers being used, with big supermarkets now charging 5p per bag in order to discourage consumers from using them. The department said that the 200m increase between 2013 and 2014 was partly due to a ""more robust approach to data collection."" The new report is the first to take into account the impact of plastic waste on the ecosystem. In 2016, an estimated 1.8 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste was generated in the United Kingdom. Most plastic waste comes from the food and drink sector, which is responsible for a third of the total. The figures were released alongside a report into the impact of plastic on the environment, which called for the government to adopt a ""life cycle approach"" to the issue. She said: ""We've already seen a huge shift in attitudes to plastics in recent months - with companies and the public becoming more aware of the need to protect our environment."" In a statement, environment secretary Michael Gove said: ""Our strategy will tackle the issue of plastic waste by working across government and beyond."" As the report notes, plastic can cause ""harm to the natural environment and potentially to human health."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""Our strategy will make clear that we need to take action at every stage of the product lifecycle - from production and design, through to consumption and disposal - to turn the tide on plastic waste."" More news: Ocado to form home-delivery joint venture with Marks Spencer Plastic waste can pollute soil and waterways, and has a harmful impact on biodiversity. Britain is set to ban the sale of single-use plastics including straws and cotton swabs in England. The report also looks at the risk of microplastics, which are pieces of plastic less than 5mm in diameter. The CCC says that as a result of the ban, an estimated 5.9 billion fewer plastic bags have been used in the United Kingdom since the law was introduced. The CCC also suggested a potential ban on the sale of single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups and takeaway cartons. ""Further action to tackle single-use plastic items, such as disposable coffee cups and takeaway containers, should be considered in the future."" The report, titled ""Better Recycling,"" says that measures should be introduced to ""ensure that as much value as possible from waste resources is captured by the United Kingdom economy."" The strategy will be published later this year. Both the government and retailers have been under pressure to do more to tackle plastic pollution in recent months.",0,465
"It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was spitting on the walls. It was the nearest thing to a jolly at Upton Park on Tuesday night, as the stadium's days were numbered, and a reminder that it has not been all doom and gloom for West Ham since they moved to the London Stadium in the summer. Although it is still a bit of an experiment. While the Emirates has been Arsenal's home for 11 years, and Tottenham are due to move into their new White Hart Lane in 2018, West Ham are still in a transitional period. They have played at the London Stadium for only 11 games and the novelty of being able to get a ticket to see the Hammers is still prevalent. The opening ceremony for the stadium was delayed by nine months, there are rumours that West Ham are struggling to pay their rent and there is an issue with the pitch. And it is here where West Ham's biggest challenge lies. The club and the London Legacy Development Corporation - the stadium owners - are locked in talks over the future of the pitch. The Hammers want it to be returfed every year but the LLDC believe this is too expensive and are looking at artificial grass, like the 3G pitch at the Kingsmeadow ground in Kingston-upon-Thames, which is home to AFC Wimbledon. The problem is that not only does it look awful, West Ham's players are also unhappy with the surface. It was always going to be a difficult project, moving into a stadium built for the London 2012 Olympic Games, but West Ham are still adapting to their new surroundings. The club are also trying to encourage the club's fans to fill the stadium, despite the increased capacity. West Ham are trying to recreate the Upton Park atmosphere in their new home by introducing 'bubble' zones, where the most vocal of the supporters will be stationed. In all, 5,000 season-ticket holders will be affected by the move. A West Ham spokesman said: ""We have asked supporters to move in order to try and replicate the atmosphere of Upton Park. ""It's a phased process and we started moving fans over last season so we had a 'test run'. ""We've done some great work to improve the atmosphere - we've got bubble zones, improved the acoustics. West Ham have not had the best of starts to life in Stratford, with a 4-2 defeat to Watford, a 2-1 victory over Bournemouth, 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough, 2-0 loss to Chelsea, 1-1 draw with Stoke, a 2-0 win over Sunderland, 1-1 draw with West Brom, 3-0 win over Crystal Palace, 4-2 defeat to Manchester United and a 3-1 loss to Tottenham. They are in 16th place in the Premier League table with 18 points from 18 games, but the most significant result for the Hammers this season was their 2-1 FA Cup third round replay victory over Manchester United on Wednesday night. That could help set the tone for the rest of the season. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic was delighted with the victory, which earned the Hammers a fourth round tie against Fulham. ""I'm proud of them,"" said Bilic. ""We deserved to win. ""It was a special night for our fans and for us. West Ham have come up against some big teams at the London Stadium, but the forthcoming run of fixtures sees them facing sides in the bottom half of the table. In the past, the Hammers have struggled against teams below them in the Premier League, but they can't afford to drop any more points if they are to build on their promising start to the season. The players have had an extra week to prepare for the clash with Hull on Saturday - West Ham's first home game since the start of November, having faced Tottenham, Manchester United and Stoke away from home in December. West Ham won all three of those matches and a home tie against Hull should be a welcome return to east London. Mike Phelan's side, on the other hand, have had a torrid",0,466

"For most of US history, party nominees have been decided by political power brokers and deal-makers behind closed doors. Parties operate like private clubs - they make their own rules and decide who is allowed to participate. But this has changed. The presidential nominating process has become a contest that is primarily decided by the will of the voters. Primaries and caucuses have become the dominant way we choose our nominees. The media in 2016 has been filled with criticism of the Republican primary process. And there are real problems: a crowded field, too many debates, too many polls, and a single-minded focus on Donald Trump. The Republican process has also been dominated by a lack of participation. Millions of Republicans stayed home in protest, or perhaps they simply had nothing to vote for. Parties are private organizations. They have the right to conduct their own business, even if the rules they adopt are perceived to be unfair. But the public has a right to understand the process, and the media has an obligation to explain it. Here are some questions voters might ask when watching the nominating process unfold: Who is allowed to vote? In most states, only people who are registered with the party are allowed to vote in primaries. Caucuses tend to have fewer restrictions. This is why we see many independents voting in the Democratic caucuses, but not in the Republican primaries. Who makes the rules? The Democratic National Committee (DNC) makes the rules for the Democratic Party, and the Republican National Committee (RNC) makes the rules for the Republican Party. These rules are written by a few insiders, but they have the effect of marginalizing voters who do not belong to the party. Why don't the parties want outsiders to vote? If the goal is to nominate a candidate who can win the general election, why not allow as many people to participate as possible? Who pays for all of this? Primaries and caucuses are paid for by the taxpayers. In fact, the taxpayers pay for most of the nominating process. This includes all of the debates and much of the primary campaigning. The two parties are private organizations, but they have turned the nominating process into a taxpayer-funded operation. Why do the parties have so much power? The parties control the process because the government has given them the right to do so. The parties are private organizations, but they have been given the privilege of nominating candidates. This is known as the state-party ""nexus."" The nominating process is a part of our democracy that is clearly in need of reform. Many of the reforms that are proposed involve taking away the power of the parties. Some of these ideas are good, but it is also important to understand that the parties are the only organizations that are accountable to the voters. It is critical that the parties remain accountable to the voters, and this is why we have to be careful about removing their power.

The singer hanged himself from a bedroom door, law enforcement sources told TMZ . Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory , was a massive hit in 2000.

"I feel like I'm playing well right now and can't wait for the second week. I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I'll be spending my Sunday off playing with the kids on the grass courts. It's my favourite thing to do on my day off at Wimbledon and I'm going to try to bring a few of the players with me. That's a nice sentiment from Nadal but I doubt he'll be able to get many of his fellow pros to join him in the fun. The Spaniard is among the few who are actually still in the tournament at this stage. The second week is now set and there are some intriguing match-ups on the cards. Nadal will take on Juan Martin Del Potro in the round of sixteen. Their head-to-head record is 10-5 in Rafa's favour and he is yet to lose to the Argentine in the majors. Del Potro beat Nadal at the 2009 US Open, the only time the two have met at a Grand Slam. ""Juan Martin is a player that can be dangerous on this surface,"" said Nadal after his victory on Saturday. ""He has a big serve, he's very good on the baseline with a big forehand. He's a very smart player. I know I need to be at 100 per cent if I want to keep having chances to win. I hope to be ready to play my best."" In the quarterfinals, Nadal could face either Marin Cilic or Novak Djokovic. Djokovic made quick work of Horacio Zeballos on Saturday and is looking sharp. ""I'm just glad I'm able to win in straight sets and play as well as I did today, and I hope I can continue playing as well as this in the next one."" If Nadal and Djokovic get to the semis, they will be joined by a member of the Federer-Murray generation. Roger Federer takes on Adrian Mannarino and Andy Murray plays Benoit Paire. I'm expecting to see Federer and Murray advance in straight sets, both have been in great form. The final quarter features the big serving Kevin Anderson, John Isner, Philipp Kohlschreiber and Gilles Muller. Isner and Muller will face off in the round of sixteen. In the women's draw, there are still a few big names left in the tournament. Jelena Ostapenko is still in the draw and the French Open champion will face Elina Svitolina. The winner will likely take on Petra Kvitova in the quarterfinals. In the second quarter, Venus Williams will face Jelena Jankovic and the winner will likely face Johanna Konta in the quarterfinals. The winner of the quarter will face either Karolina Pliskova or Caroline Garcia. The bottom half features Garbine Muguruza, Angelique Kerber, Simona Halep and Victoria Azarenka.

"Security assistance has been withheld since 2011, when the Gulf state put down mass Shia-led protests. But US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Bahrain had made progress on human rights and that the assistance was ""a tangible reminder"" of American support. Mr Kirby said the administration remained ""deeply concerned"" about human rights abuses, and that the new assistance would be contingent on progress on those issues. The US State Department said the resumption of assistance came after Bahrain ""unwound some of its most restrictive measures against civil society and the media."" But Bahrain's government had not implemented all the recommendations of an independent commission of inquiry into the 2011 crackdown, it said. ""We continue to encourage the government of Bahrain to continue on the path of reform and reconciliation,"" Mr Kirby said. Bahrain is the home of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet and Washington has been keen to maintain close ties with the island kingdom. But the crackdown on protests, led by Shia activists demanding greater rights, attracted strong criticism from international rights groups. Most of the detainees were Sunni Muslims, with some Shia. The US State Department said the 127 detainees were serving sentences or being held for trial on charges that included ""violent felonies."" ""We strongly support the king and the government of Bahrain as they move forward with the implementation of the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry,"" Mr Kirby said. ""We believe that this is an important recognition of Bahrain's progress thus far, and we hope that it will help the government of Bahrain sustain the positive momentum it has created with these and other recent reforms."" Bahrain's Sunni Muslim rulers have responded to unrest among the Shia majority with a crackdown on dissent. The government has rejected the accusations, saying the country's Shia enjoy more freedoms than those in other Gulf countries. In June 2011, the US resumed arms sales to Bahrain, which it had suspended during the protests. In February 2013, the US Department of Defense approved the sale of equipment and support worth about 1.5bn (920m) for upgrades to the country's F-16 fighter jet fleet. The government of Bahrain had previously said that it was being ""unfairly singled out"" for criticism by human rights groups and the US, arguing that it had implemented a number of reforms recommended by the inquiry commission. Among the reforms was the establishment of a police ombudsman to look into allegations of abuse. But the government has also strengthened anti-terrorism laws in a move that has been criticised by rights groups.",0,475
"Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired. People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the edge of the city. More thuds, more panic. Some protesters chanted ""dirty bitch,"" a reference to the president, others took aim at the opposition parties that had called the demonstration. ""They're all in it together,"" shouted a man, trying to keep a crowd of youths from throwing stones at the riot police. ""They're all corrupt."" Dozens of people had already been arrested, and then the police van arrived. ""At last, we're going to get them,"" shouted one of the riot police, jumping off the van and running towards the youths. He and his colleagues then dragged them, screaming, to the van. The police were in a tough mood, and they were not going to tolerate any more defiance. ""Why did you throw stones?"" I asked a young man, as he was bundled into the van. ""Because I'm poor, because I'm hungry,"" he replied. ""I want my share of the oil money, I want to live."" ""I know, we all do,"" I said. ""I don't mean to be rude,"" he said, ""but I'd rather talk to someone who can do something for me."" There were shouts of support from the demonstrators still on the street. They had heard that the president's son, the former head of the state oil company, had been accused of corruption in the US and that he had been released on bail. ""Why didn't they keep him in prison?"" shouted one man. ""Why didn't they let him pay his bail in oil?"" ""They're all in it together,"" came the reply from the crowd. Inside the van, the young man who had been arrested told me that he was 26 years old, that he had studied sociology and that he had never had a job. ""I wanted to help my family,"" he said. ""I wanted to work with the police, but they wouldn't take me, because they said I didn't have the right connections. ""Now look at me, look where I am, in the back of a police van."" ""I'm sorry,"" I said. ""I wish I could do something for you."" ""I'm not blaming you,"" he replied. I then asked the young man if he was angry at the government, and he replied: ""No, I'm not angry at the government, I'm angry at the whole system, at the way the government is, at the way the people are."" ""Well, in the end, that's the same thing,"" I said. ""It isn't the same thing,"" he said. ""The government is just part of the system. We need to change the system."" A few minutes later, the police van drove away. I do not know what happened to the young man. The crowd grew thinner. People were tired. The riot police were waiting to see if anything more was going to happen. I walked through the streets of this poor neighbourhood, talking to people. ""I'm tired,"" said one man. ""I'm tired of this country, of this life, of being poor, of being hungry, of getting nothing. Nothing."" I went into a small shop and asked the owner if he would like to say anything. ""What can I say?"" he said. ""I've got nothing to say."" He gave me a soft drink, for free, and I sat on a chair outside the shop. ""I'm tired,"" said another man. ""I've worked all my life. I've done everything they asked me to do, and where am I now? I'm a beggar, I've got nothing."" ""But you're not begging, are you?"" I said. ""No, not yet,"" he replied. ""But that's what I'm going to have to do."" ""And where are you going to do that?"" I asked. ""Here, in the street, outside this shop."" ""I'm sorry,"" I said. ""I wish I could do something for you."" ""It's not your fault,"" he replied. ""I'm not angry at you. I'm angry at the whole system, at the way this government is, at the way the people are.""

"Sean Earle snatched the bag of Linda Clarke, who had cut her wrists and walked out of hospital before sitting on a ledge over the M602 in Salford. After she fell, Earle dropped the bag containing her passport, mobile phone and a suicide note into the road, where it was later run over by a lorry. At an inquest into her death, Bolton coroner Alan Walsh said he was ""wholly unimpressed"" with the ""lackadaisical approach"" of GMP officers who had failed to pass on information about Clarke's suicide attempt. ""Had her bag been left with the hospital authorities, as it should have been, then the subsequent tragic events might have been avoided,"" he said. ""These officers should have been more alert to the possibility of further harm. I am satisfied that the officers failed to consider the potential consequences of their actions in leaving the bag of a suicidal person at the scene of a road traffic accident, as though the bag had been left by an absentminded motorist."" Clarke, 49, had tried to take her own life while staying in a hotel in Salford on 28 August 2016. Earle and his colleague were called to her hotel room after reports that she had been seen walking through the lobby with a wound to her wrist. She was taken to hospital for treatment before she discharged herself and walked back to the hotel, where she sat on a ledge over the motorway. A jury returned a verdict of suicide after hearing that officers had been told Clarke had taken an overdose of medication and had been assessed by a mental health nurse in the hours before her death. Detective chief superintendent Mary Doyle, the divisional commander for Salford, said: ""We have carefully considered the findings of the inquest and will now ensure that all officers involved are reminded of the correct procedures for dealing with suicidal people. ""We are absolutely committed to providing the best possible care for anyone who is in need and on this occasion we recognise that we didn't get it right."" First responders who are called to emergency situations involving people at risk of suicide are trained by the force to look after their belongings. Guidance issued by the College of Policing says that ""officers should never remove or dispose of property without consulting with the individual."" A spokesperson for GMP said: ""First responders are trained in the correct procedure when dealing with a person at risk of self-harm. This includes looking after their property until their return. ""However, on this occasion, our officers did not follow the correct procedure, which has been addressed. We will now ensure that all officers involved are reminded of the correct procedures for dealing with suicidal people."" The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had been aware of the case and had liaised with GMP, but that it had been unable to identify any misconduct that warranted an investigation.",0,478
"All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births.

"The 23-year-old crowdfunded her way to Rio to compete in the women's single sculls, but finished 20th in the finals last Saturday. However, six days later Snoop Dogg posted a picture of his new album cover, which features a woman with a striking resemblance to Puspure. It is believed the woman on the cover is a young actress named Tara Macken, and while it is possible Puspure's face was used for inspiration for the cover, the similarities are a little eerie. Puspure was made aware of the resemblance, but was nonplussed. ""I really don't know what to say,"" Puspure told The Irish Sun. ""I was shown the cover by a friend but I don't know anything about it. ""It's nice to be on the cover of a Snoop Dogg album and it would be great to get a shout out from Snoop. ""Maybe he'll send me a signed copy of the album."" Puspure began her Olympic journey with a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe.com, with the 23-year-old raising almost 27,000. ""The Irish team is extremely small,"" Puspure wrote on the site. ""I am the only female sculler on the team and the only female single sculler in Ireland. ""In rowing, single sculling is an expensive sport with each boat costing over 15,000.

"Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks ""resilience."" South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) runs the phone line and has said calls have risen by 27. The move is likely to spark fears over plans for a single emergency number for the county's police, fire and ambulance services. Oxfordshire County Council's health scrutiny committee discussed the issues on Thursday, where OCCG's chief executive, Louise Patten, said there is ""no guarantee"" the 111 service will survive in its current form. In a meeting agenda document, Ms Patten said: ""The 111 service does not currently have the resilience needed to meet increasing demand. ""The number of 111 calls into SCAS has increased by 27 since April 2018, and the system has been challenged to cope with this volume."" She said OCCG was working with SCAS to see what could be done to improve the service. It comes after it emerged the number of 111 calls in the county last year rose from 120,000 to more than 155,000. The service was launched in 2013 and is designed to ease pressure on 999 services. It is designed to help people with less serious issues and is staffed by non-emergency trained advisers and clinicians. SCAS chief executive, Will Hancock, said: ""The rise in calls has been due to a number of factors including the increasing popularity of the service and the time of year, the weather and the levels of flu. ""It has also been due to some patients making unnecessary calls to the service for minor ailments."" Councillor Steve Connelly, chairman of the health scrutiny committee, said he had ""real concerns"" about the 111 service. He said: ""The thing about 111 is that if people cannot get through they tend to go to the 999 service. ""I know that has been a real problem, and there are real concerns about it. I think it needs to be monitored closely."" He said he hoped the issue could be resolved. A single non-emergency number for Oxfordshire's police, fire and ambulance services has been discussed. The county's police and crime commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld, is calling for a single non-emergency number for Thames Valley Police, Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and SCAS. But the plans have been criticised by members of the county's police and fire authority, who said they have ""serious concerns"" about the move. Mr Stansfeld, who is overseeing the project, said he is confident the number will be launched in the summer.",0,485
"Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun. Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, the most massive star known.

These young behemoths are extremely rare, with none found in our own Milky Way Galaxy.

""The cluster is around a hundred times less massive than the largest ones we see, but is producing stars at a rate a thousand times greater. This makes it a crucial object for seeing just how far these clusters can go."" ""We think that very massive stars can only form in clusters that contain at least a few hundred stars,"" said Professor Crowther. ""Otherwise the stars would form too far apart and would be too isolated to collect enough gas to become so massive. R136 seems to defy this logic and is producing a prodigious number of very massive stars."" ""The young stars will have formed in the last few million years, but some of the most massive ones have already evolved surprisingly far for their age, as we can tell from their hot temperatures and extreme brightness,"" said Dr. Chris Evans from the Royal Observatory Edinburgh. ""R136 is already more than halfway through its lifespan, but in just a few million years it will explode as a supernova, very likely leaving behind a black hole."" The team also found that R136 is home to several stars whose surface temperatures exceed 40,000 degrees Celsius, more than seven times hotter than the surface of the Sun. Such extreme temperatures are only found on the surface of stars that are 30-40 times more massive than the Sun, or ones that have recently exploded. ""At first glance, it would be easy to assume that the R136 stars are much older, more evolved, and cooler than they really are, since they are fainter than other young stars of similar mass. The only way to be sure is to measure their temperatures, which we can do by looking for the subtle signatures of glowing hot iron atoms in the star's radiation. However, this is very difficult, even for the VLT,"" explained Dr. Evans. ""These results are an exciting step towards a fuller understanding of the lives of the most massive stars. The new results suggest that the R136 stars are already near the end of their lives, shedding massive amounts of material into their surroundings at the rate of one solar mass every few million years. However, the reason why these stars evolve so rapidly remains a mystery."" The team used the FORS2 instrument on the VLT to split up the light of the R136 star cluster into its component colours. This allowed them to measure the masses and temperatures of many of the individual stars. The results are reported in a paper entitled ""The R136 star cluster hosts several stars whose individual masses greatly exceed the accepted 150 Msun stellar mass limit"" by P.A. Crowther et al.

"Researchers hope to learn how much it weighed, how it moved and what it used its iconic back plates for. A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones, which could be the basis of a digital reconstruction. The dinosaur, a Stegosaurus, was discovered in Wyoming in 2003 and is now being shipped to London. The specimen is one of the most complete ever discovered, and the first to go on display outside the US. Dr Paul Barrett, from London's Natural History Museum (NHM), said: ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime find. ""The original Stegosaurus only ever consisted of about 25 of the skeleton. ""We have 75 of it here, which is completely unprecedented. This is a world-class specimen."" The Stegosaurus's name means ""roofed lizard,"" and it would have been one of the largest creatures to have roamed the Earth. It lived in the late Jurassic Period, around 150 million years ago, and belonged to a family of plant-eating dinosaurs known as the Ornithischia. The dinosaur was discovered in a quarry by palaeontologist Bob Simon. In the same pit, he found the remains of three other Stegosaurus skeletons. ""They were all jumbled up together,"" explained Dr Barrett, who is an expert on Ornithischia. The fossils were shipped to the NHM last week, where they are being stored and studied by a team of experts. Dr Barrett said the NHM was the perfect home for the dinosaur. ""This is the world's leading centre for the study of these kinds of dinosaurs,"" he told BBC News. ""We have a unique pool of expertise here that will allow us to study this specimen properly and produce the best possible science. ""We're going to start by scanning every bone - that will take several weeks. Then, we'll be able to put all the pieces together in a digital space, where we can see how the skeleton fits together in 3D."" He added: ""I've been studying these kinds of dinosaurs for 20 years and I've never had the opportunity to study a specimen with this level of completeness."" The NHM has ambitious plans for the fossils, and hopes to make a digital copy of the entire skeleton available for researchers, schools and members of the public to study. The real bones will be carefully cleaned before being put on display in the museum's Earth Hall, where they will be displayed alongside the NHM's Diplodocus skeleton. Dr Barrett said: ""This is the first time that a major dinosaur has come to the UK and the first time a Stegosaurus has gone on display outside of the US. ""We want to use this opportunity to tell people about the science that we do, and the important questions that we're addressing."" The Stegosaurus will be on display from December.",0,487
"West Midlands Police said there was a ""sweet irony"" to officers using the centre for forced entry training when it had been paid for by money paid into the Proceeds of Crime Act. The centre, in Birmingham, contains a realistic crime scene set, a mocked-up flat and an area that simulates road traffic accidents. Four years ago the force opened a similar facility at its Wolverhampton headquarters, but it has had to look at the centre in Birmingham because the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner has put the Wolverhampton centre up for sale. Courses run at the centre include ""street awareness,"" ""rape and other serious sexual offences,"" ""interviewing witnesses and suspects"" and ""dealing with people with a mental health issue."" There are also specialist courses for detectives investigating gang-related violence, forensics investigators and scenes of crime officers.

"Jeremy Forrest, from Petts Wood, London was jailed for five-and-a-half years in 2013 for abducting and having sex with the girl when she was 15. The pair spent seven days in France before being tracked down by police and returned to the UK. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the woman, now 22, said she feels as if she had been ""kidnapped and forced to return"" to the UK after the police found the pair in France. ""I thought I was going to be with the person I loved for the rest of my life,"" she said. ""But instead I was kidnapped and forced to return. I'm not the victim here, I'm the person who was exploited and taken away from what I wanted. ""I had found true love and was taken away from it. I never chose to leave France. ""I was a 15-year-old girl in love. I wanted to be with him. But I was forced to come back. It was like I'd been kidnapped."" The pair are now reportedly living in a new home in Hastings, East Sussex, after reuniting following Forrest's release from prison in June. Speaking of the moment she was taken back to the UK, she said: ""The police said, 'You're going home now', and I said, 'No, I'm not'. ""But then they told me that if I didn't go they would arrest me for aiding and abetting a criminal. I was a 15-year-old girl and I was petrified."" The woman also revealed that the pair have been secretly meeting ever since. She said: ""I was 15 when we met, and we're adults now. We've been secretly meeting up ever since. ""I thought we'd never see each other again, but it made us stronger. ""We have a future. We are a couple in love and that will never change. I will be with him until I die."" The couple reportedly bought a house together in Hastings, East Sussex, and are planning to marry and start a family. Forrest was handed a five-and-a-half-year jail sentence at Lewes Crown Court after admitting abducting a child, which he served half of before being released. Forrest was banned from contacting the woman for five years, but she was free to contact him. ""I've never had a life without him. He's been a huge part of my life for so long. I knew it was wrong and that I was breaking the law but it was worth it. ""He's made me so happy. He's brought me out of the darkness. ""He's got me through my exams, he's encouraged me to go to university. ""He's the only one who ever believed in me and was always there to support me. He's stuck by me through everything, through the court case, the aftermath. He's always been there for me."" She also said she was glad she didn't wait until she was 16 to be with Forrest, as the couple would have been separated for the following three years while he was in prison. The woman also said the pair have no plans to tell their families about their relationship yet. ""We're just going to take each day as it comes. We don't want to tell anyone just yet. It's still very new to us. ""If people don't agree, they don't agree. That's their opinion. I don't care what anyone else thinks. ""All I know is that I'm going to be with him for the rest of my life and we're going to have a future together."" Speaking of the court case, she said: ""I remember crying and crying and crying. I didn't want to be taken away from him. It felt as if I was being taken away from the love of my life. ""I just remember not wanting to leave him. I couldn't bear to be away from him. I thought I would never see him again."" The woman said she had felt suicidal after being forced to leave France and that she would have killed herself had it not been for her relationship with Forrest. ""I had been at my absolute lowest. But he saved me. He gave me a reason to live. He was the only person I ever really wanted to be with. ""He has changed my life for the better. He's given me a future. I don't know where I would",0,489

Hilton Nursery has been run by the same family for three decades and provides childcare for more than 70 families in the area.

It is understood the closure is because the nursery has been unable to secure a long-term lease with its current landlord. Aberdeen Council has been approached for comment. The Scottish government is to establish a task force to address the problem of women being jailed for non-payment of fines. The task force is to be led by former Labour MSP and Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC. It follows a report by Holyrood's justice committee which found that more than 40 of women in Scottish prisons had been jailed for failing to pay fines, while 39 were serving sentences for shoplifting. The committee said in its report that most of the women it spoke to had been fined for offences which were ""survival crimes"" - such as shoplifting or benefit fraud. The report said that women's prisons are ""seriously overcrowded"" and the population has grown significantly in recent years. It also found that Scotland's prison population is made up of a disproportionate number of young women, with almost half of women in prison aged under 30, and that the use of remand to custody had increased significantly. The Scottish government's report said that many of the problems faced by women in prison could be linked to a ""lack of community support"" and that they ""may have experienced trauma, abuse, mental health problems or addiction."" Ms Thomson said: ""This review aims to identify the range of factors that lead to the increased use of imprisonment for women, including those associated with offending behaviour and the court system, and to make recommendations for improvement. ""I look forward to engaging with the Scottish government and other stakeholders to identify and implement solutions to what is clearly a complex problem.""

"That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation is that Amazon is undercutting the authorized price of e-books for the first two weeks of their release. It has also been reported that Amazon has deals with two publishers, Hachette and Bonnier, to do this. Amazon has been selling e-books at below cost. That is not news. It does this to drive sales and push out competition from rival e-book retailers. The Guardian reports that Amazon is doing this by buying e-books wholesale from publishers. It is then selling them at a loss, which it can afford to do as its dominant position in the market allows it to recoup the money elsewhere. If the accusation that Amazon is also undercutting the authorized price of e-books is true, this is a more serious concern. The Guardian says this could violate competition laws. However, this is not to say that Amazon is necessarily behaving illegally. For a company to be found in breach of competition law, it has to have a dominant position in the market. The Guardian reports that Amazon has a 90 share of the e-book market in the UK. However, the European Commission has said that a market share of 40 or above could constitute a dominant position. There are several different tests that the Commission can apply to determine a company's market share. If Amazon is found to have a dominant position in the market, it would be much easier for the Commission to find it in breach of competition law.",0,494
"Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights. But for his latest outing, he's shifted down a gear. The drive will still be familiar, but the view is more scenic. Joshua has been the real deal since he first got into boxing as a late teenager, but this is different. No more fighting in an arena where the toilets are bigger than the changing rooms. No more sweating it out in the gym when there's nobody watching. No more weigh-ins at motorway service stations. No more searching for sponsors. This is a different world, and Joshua is in the driving seat. The car is his new Audi R8 Spyder. The scenery is the tourist hotspots of Tenerife. The destination is the island's largest boxing arena, which will stage the next stop on his journey to world boxing stardom. ""I've worked hard to get where I am,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I've sacrificed time away from my friends and family and I've missed opportunities in life that other people have had. ""But I've been very lucky. It doesn't matter what you do in life, if you're not lucky you're not going to get there. It's a big part of it. ""I've worked hard to put myself in a position where luck can come to me. If I keep doing that, and keep working hard, I'll keep getting lucky."" Joshua's rise has been nothing short of meteoric. He won an Olympic gold medal in London in 2012, turned pro two years later and just 14 fights later is the unified world heavyweight champion. But he's taking nothing for granted. He's still got the same trainer who he started out with, Rob McCracken, and he's still got the same team around him, including long-time friends and supporters. ""You can't get too comfortable,"" he said. ""A lot of the stuff that I'm doing, and a lot of the places I'm visiting, is part of a long-term process. ""We're not just doing this for the next fight, we're doing it for the long-term goal of establishing a brand."" Joshua's team have been in the gym for the past two weeks, a makeshift home for the fighter and his camp. It's a dingy, dusty, underground space next to a couple of pizza restaurants. A bright white Joshua poster has been stuck on the window to obscure the gritty view of the pavement. Inside, the walls are covered with posters of past fights and there are a couple of beaten-up old sofas. Joshua trains in the early hours of the morning, leaving the afternoon free to take in the sights of Tenerife. His days off are spent wandering around the island's beaches and bars. ""The sun is shining, the sea is warm,"" said Joshua, ""but I'm here to do a job. The first three weeks were all about getting used to the weather, the food, the time zone and the travelling. ""But for the last two weeks, it's been about getting down to business. We've got the right people around us and we're all working together to get the right result."" Joshua has been beaming a smile for the cameras throughout the trip, but the grin disappears when he steps into the ring. His gym sessions are full of intensity, with punches pounding the heavy bag and the ring floor shaking underfoot. He's only ever been involved in a 12-round fight once before, when he beat Klitschko, but Saturday's bout against Carlos Takam in Cardiff is the third time in a row he will be fighting the full distance. ""Sparring is the hardest part of training, because it's the most realistic,"" said Joshua. ""In sparring, you can't really make mistakes, because you'll get caught with a shot. ""You have to be sharp. I'm not going to give away my tactics, but I've been working hard on punching and slipping.

The authorities are said to have been alerted to the problem by a charity, Dogs Trust, which was asked to take over the care of the dogs. I'm absolutely shocked that a boarding kennels, licensed to look after animals, could do this. It's completely inappropriate and very upsetting. We're very grateful to Dogs Trust for taking in these dogs and stepping up to the plate and helping out. The kennels licence had been suspended by Teignbridge District Council and the owner has been removed from the premises. Dogs Trust said it had received 11 dogs from the boarding kennels. I've never seen dogs in such a distressed state. Some are so badly affected that they are being re-homed with specialist foster carers to help them recover from this horrendous ordeal. Dogs Trust say they have no further comment at this time due to an ongoing police investigation. Devon and Cornwall Police said it had no comment to make on the case at present. I hope that this case will result in tighter regulations for boarding kennels. I was appalled to read this in the newspaper. I am always very careful about the boarding kennels I use. I am lucky to have a very good kennels nearby, but I have had friends who have not been so lucky. I hope that this case will result in tighter regulations for boarding kennels. Animals deserve the same rights as humans.",0,500

"2 October 2015 Last updated at 18:13 BST Speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight's diplomatic and defence editor Mark Urban, he said UK policy in Syria had been hampered by a lack of ""joined-up government."" The UK's policy on Syria has been ""held back"" by not being able to take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a former director of the British Foreign Office has told the BBC. ""There is no strategy for this - there's a series of tactical responses,"" Sir Simon Fraser, who left the Foreign Office last year after 40 years, said. ""It's very difficult for the government, partly because of the lack of joined-up government."" He said the government's strategy for Syria was ""to take on ISIS and to degrade Assad."" But he said the UK had held back from targeting Mr Assad ""because it's not clear what you would put in his place."" Mr Fraser said the UK's response was ""better than nothing"" but suggested the UK's focus should be on degrading ISIS. He also said he believed Russia's actions in Syria were ""extremely cynical."" ""I don't think they're interested in bombing ISIS - they're interested in propping up Assad,"" he said. ""The British government has been quite right to be very cautious about this."" ""It's interesting that Russia is also bombing the Free Syrian Army,"" he said. ""There's a strange contradiction in what the Russians are doing. ""They are also bombing the people that are the only people that are going to provide the solution to Syria, in the long run.""",0,502

"Zeid Raad Al Hussein described the incident, in which 10 people were wounded, as ""extremely shocking."" Cizre has been the focus of an offensive by Turkey's army against the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) since December. Turkish authorities said that the situation in the southeastern district was under control after a gunfight between security forces and Kurdish militants on Monday left 11 people injured. The violence occurred after Turkish authorities entered the town of Cizre, where they set up security checkpoints and detained 38 people. The local mayor, Leyla Imret, was among those detained, Turkish news agencies reported. Turkish troops and Kurdish militants clashed in Cizre on Monday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would not allow Turkey to ""become like Kobani,"" referring to the Syrian town that Kurdish militias took from ""Islamic State"" (IS) fighters in 2015. The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, described the situation in Cizre as ""extremely shocking."" ""We have been receiving extremely distressing reports from Cizre,"" he said in Geneva. ""I am especially concerned at reports that at least 16 civilians, including women and children, have been killed and hundreds of others injured over the last several days due to the disproportionate and excessive use of force by security forces."" Cizre has been at the center of fighting between Turkish troops and Kurdish militants since December. On Sunday, Turkey's army said that 600 militants were killed in Cizre over the past week. Kurdish groups say that more than 100 civilians were also killed in the operations. The clashes took place despite a two-year-old ceasefire between Ankara and the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. Turkey has been struggling with violence in the southeast for years. The PKK launched an armed campaign for Kurdish autonomy in 1984, leading to a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. Since the ceasefire collapsed in July, the conflict has left hundreds of people dead. jarbw (AFP, Reuters) Turkish forces push into southeastern Cizre amid violence Turkish police and troops have pushed into the southeastern town of Cizre.

"On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at North Middlesex University Hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the London hospital were so overrun that trolleys were ""stacked up"" in corridors during a visit by inspectors in October. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) also found patients were at risk of infection due to a lack of cleanliness, and there were not enough nurses to provide safe care. Its report said: ""One patient was told they had to wait for a commode and this was the case for all patients on the ward. ""When we observed the ward we saw there was only one commode available for use by more than 100 patients."" The report added: ""On the day of our inspection we saw trolleys stacked up in the corridors. ""We saw there were a number of patients requiring commodes in the corridor. ""Staff told us this was because the ward was so busy and full that there was nowhere else for the patients to go."" The CQC also raised concerns about the cleanliness of the hospital, which provides services for around 350,000 people in Enfield and Haringey, north London. It said: ""We saw staff did not consistently clean their hands between patient contact. ""There were no audits to show that the ward environment was being cleaned appropriately and to a satisfactory standard. ""We were told by staff that the hospital had problems with cleaning the wards due to a lack of staff. ""The Trust told us they had identified that there were not enough staff to provide safe care."" Inspectors also found that patients' dignity and respect was not always maintained. The report said: ""Patients told us that staff treated them well and with kindness. ""However, we saw patients being moved to and from the ward without using sheets. ""We observed that patients were left on trolleys in the corridors, including one patient who had their drip and monitoring equipment with them. ""We saw that the patient was not given any screening from other people in the corridor."" The hospital was ordered to take action to protect the safety and welfare of patients. A spokesman for the hospital said: ""We are very sorry that some patients experienced delays when being admitted to the emergency department on one day in October. ""In the last six months we have seen a 12 increase in the number of patients attending the hospital's emergency department. ""We have therefore been recruiting more doctors and nurses to help manage this increase. ""In November, we saw a reduction in the number of patients attending the emergency department compared to last year, which suggests that the additional staff we have recruited are helping to manage demand.

"Invisible Edinburgh said the aim was to reveal a different side to Scotland's capital city. The tours start in the Grassmarket, Castle Terrace and Middle Meadow Walk and each has a theme. For example, one is based on the true story of a convicted murderer who escaped from prison and became a local celebrity in the Grassmarket. ""This is a new way of looking at the city that hasn't really been done before, "" said Michael Davies, the founder of Invisible Edinburgh. ""The tours tell stories and give an insight into the history of the city, but in a way that is really different to the normal guided tours. "" Davies said the tours would provide a more immersive experience of the city by using the phone's location technology to pinpoint the user's position and tell them the story of where they are. The tour also uses the phone's compass to point out important buildings and other landmarks. ""It's like a book or a film, "" he said. ""You're in a place and you're told a story that relates to where you are. "" Each tour consists of a series of audio tracks, which are downloaded to the phone or other device, and then played as the user moves to different locations. Davies said the project had been a year in the making, and had been inspired by similar tours in other cities. ""I had seen other tours like this and wanted to do something similar in Edinburgh, "" he said. ""The city is such a beautiful place, but you can't see it in the same way if you just walk around it, so this gives people a new way of experiencing the city. """,0,507
"Dickson carried his bat for 207 not out, as Shiv Thakor's maiden five-wicket haul saw Kent all out for 412. Derbyshire's Billy Godleman retired hurt without facing a ball after being struck on the head by a bouncer from Adam Milne. Kent's Sam Billings made 74, including 12 fours, before being bowled by Hardus Viljoen. Dickson was also on the receiving end of a short ball, being hit on the helmet by the same bowler. Godleman was struck on the back of the helmet by a ball from Milne as he attempted to duck and the Kent batsman was forced to retire hurt with a suspected concussion. In the absence of Dickson, who had made his first-class debut last week, Godleman captained Derbyshire to a win over Durham in the One-Day Cup. Billings shared in a 69-run stand with Daniel Bell-Drummond, who made 46 before he was lbw to Viljoen. A 65-run partnership between Dickson and Alex Blake followed before the latter was lbw to Calum Haggett for 13. Haggett (1-101) then had Sean Dickson lbw for eight before Sam Northeast joined Dickson in the middle. A further 140 runs were added before Dickson's innings ended, being caught behind off Haggett. Northeast and Matt Henry both fell in the last over of the day as Harry Podmore took two wickets to go with his two earlier in the day. ""The wicket is pretty good but there's a bit of a tinge of green to it. If you get it in the right area it will bounce and move a bit.

"Sentinel-1b was carried into orbit by a Soyuz rocket that flew out of Sinamary in French Guiana. The new platform will monitor shipping lanes for pollution and icebergs, and survey the oceans for phytoplankton. It will also be used to track land subsidence and watch the growth of cities and the retreat of glaciers. The satellite was launched from Kourou in French Guiana. Sentinel-1b is the second in a fleet of Sentinel Earth observation satellites being put up by the European Space Agency and the European Commission. The first Sentinel platform was launched in April 2014. In combination, the Sentinels will make up the most sophisticated Earth observation constellation ever developed. The first mission, Sentinel-1a, was lofted two years ago to make detailed all-weather maps of the Earth's surface every six days. Sentinel-1b, which was also launched by a Soyuz rocket, will fly 180 degrees behind its twin to offer the same capability but with a shorter revisit time of just three days. The pair work with microwave radar. Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are optical satellites, and Sentinel-5p will be a spectrometer to measure the trace gases that sit in the atmosphere. The Sentinel series is being procured in the context of Europe's Copernicus programme, which aims to provide an autonomous capability to the EU for gathering environmental data. Copernicus is led by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Its ultimate aim is to give policymakers accurate information on which to base decisions concerning land, oceans, the atmosphere, climate and security. These objectives are being taken forward by the European Space Agency (Esa), which is responsible for the development and operation of the Sentinel satellites. The Sentinels are designed to be compatible with the American Landsat series, which has been observing the Earth since the early 1970s. And this data compatibility is deemed to be extremely important because of the need to maintain long-term records of change on our planet. The Sentinel-1b satellite will be placed in the same orbit as its twin, Sentinel-1a. ""It's almost like doing a twin study. The two satellites will see exactly the same location on the Earth, but because they're in slightly different orbits, they'll be separated in time by less than 10 minutes,"" explained Prof Andy Shepherd from Leeds University, UK. ""That really gives you a kind of stereo view of the Earth and lets you see things that you can't see with a single satellite. Prof Shepherd will be using the Sentinels to study the flow of ice around Antarctica and Greenland. ""I think it's fair to say that almost all glaciologists will be using Sentinel-1,"" he told BBC News. ""The radar penetrates through the snow and sees the ice underneath. We can use the changes in the ice flow to tell us about the climate. A key role for the Sentinel-1 mission is the monitoring of shipping lanes. The ships themselves will need to be equipped with radio beacons that can be detected by the satellites' radar. The system will then be able to follow vessels as they traverse the world's oceans, and should be able to pick out any that are behaving suspiciously. Other uses include the detection of oil spills, and the tracking of sea ice. ""Especially with the second satellite we'll have this huge amount of data, which will allow us to monitor changes in the sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic,"" explained Dr Malcolm Davidson from the UK National Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""So, for example, if we get a collision between two big icebergs and it breaks off a large piece, we'll be able to see that within days. ""We'll be able to see the movement of icebergs and sea ice from day to day. Both the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites will be used to map the world's land cover. Sentinel-1 will contribute data on how vegetation is growing and changing, on the state of permafrost, and on how water is being stored. Sentinel-2 will then add",0,509

Fufa admits it owes the coach, who also led Uganda to their first Afcon appearance since 1978, but has promised to clear his dues. ""My contract entitles me to a fixed salary for the next two years. Since July 2017 to date, I have only received two months' salary,"" Sredojevic was quoted as saying. ""My family has suffered. I have no words to describe the pain and agony my family has gone through."" The Serbian was named the best coach at the 2017 Caf Awards after guiding Uganda to the Afcon finals. He also won the Best Coach of the Year gong at the Uganda Sports Press Association awards in May. Fufa has confirmed to BBC Sport that Sredojevic will receive his salary arrears and that they are working to resolve the issue. The governing body has, however, not confirmed whether the coach will lead the team at the 2019 Afcon finals in Cameroon. ""As a person and a professional, I am very proud of my achievements so far but I am not happy with my employer,"" he added. Fufa has previously been accused of not remitting allowances and bonuses for players and coaches. The Federation was dragged to court in June 2017 by a group of players for not paying allowances and bonuses amounting to 60,000 (47,000) from a 2014 friendly match against Nigeria. Fufa officials were arrested in connection to the case, which is still on-going. In 2015, Sredojevic accused Fufa of not paying his salary but they were later paid.

"Firefighters dealt with blazes on Friday overnight at garage forecourts in Salisbury and Durrington as well as in residential areas of Amesbury. An aircraft was also found burnt out at a business in Andover. In Salisbury the incident was in the early hours at the Co-op petrol station on Fisherton Street, close to the ring road. Four crews attended from Salisbury, Westlea, Wilton and South Wilts and tackled the fire in a vehicle and in the canopy of the petrol station. A car on fire in a garage forecourt is also believed to be linked to the spate of suspected arson attacks. Fire crews from Salisbury were called to the blaze at the Esso garage on Barford Road, Durrington, at 2.25am on Friday. The fire was in a vehicle which was parked in the forecourt. A spokesman for Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the fire was thought to be suspicious.

"Ajinkya Rahane became the fifth Indian to score centuries in both innings of a Test match as they declared on 267-5. In reply, captain Hashim Amla (23 not out) took the Proteas to 45-1 at stumps. India would be looking to seal the series, while South Africa will want to keep the Test alive when play starts on day three. Rahane, who scored 127 in the first innings, was dismissed for 15 by Wayne Parnell (1-36) for the third time in the match after a 78-run partnership with Murali Vijay (57 not out). Vijay and Rohit Sharma (50 not out) then put on an unbeaten 87 runs to take India to their 500. The tourists had the best of the day's play as they won the toss and elected to bat first, with Rahane's century taking them to 356-7. Parnell was the pick of the bowlers as he took 5-109 in 31 overs, while Imran Tahir (1-96) and Dean Elgar (1-60) picked up one wicket apiece. South Africa were reduced to 12-2 in their second innings after the Proteas' openers were both dismissed in the 13th over. Stiaan van Zyl (2) and Dean Elgar (10) fell to Mohammed Shami (2-23) and Ravichandran Ashwin (1-19) respectively.

"Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's programme was pushed through without debate, according to parliamentary speaker Salim al-Juburi. Under the plan, Mr Abadi will cut spending and eliminate senior posts. It follows mass protests over corruption and poor services. The move also aims to abolish the country's three vice-presidencies and three deputy prime minister posts. The plan will ""protect the resources of the state,"" Mr Juburi said. Mr Abadi has struggled to balance the demands of Iraq's different political factions as the country battles an insurgency by so-called Islamic State (IS). The group controls large parts of the north and west, and on Tuesday two attacks near Baghdad killed at least 30 people and injured 60 others. Corruption is widespread in Iraq, and is blamed for many of the country's problems. Iraq has the world's fifth-largest oil reserves but a significant proportion of its population lives in poverty. Iraq's parliament has approved a new government led by Haider al-Abadi, two weeks after his predecessor Nouri Maliki stood aside. MPs voted in favour of all but one of the cabinet's 33 ministers, with a decision on the remaining nominee deferred for a week. The new administration has vowed to fight corruption and terrorism, as well as create jobs. Mr Abadi, 62, is seen as a consensus candidate. He was nominated after Mr Maliki, who had held the post since 2006, agreed to step aside. The new prime minister has two deputies: the former leader of the Iraqi National Alliance (INA), Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Saleh al-Mutlaq, a secular Sunni Muslim who led the Iraqi Front for National Dialogue. The INA, a coalition of Shia parties, was the largest group in the outgoing parliament. Other key cabinet posts were awarded to: Hoshiyar Zebari, foreign minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, oil minister Khaled al-Obeidi, defence minister Bayan Jabr, finance minister Iraq's main Kurdish parties are also represented in the cabinet, as are the main Sunni and Shia Arab blocs. Mohammed Ghabban, a Shia politician from Baghdad, was not approved as the nominee for the interior ministry, which oversees the police. No reason was given for the decision, but it was reportedly because of objections from Kurdish and Sunni parties. The other cabinet nominees were approved unanimously or with a large majority, AFP reported. They now have a week to present a programme to parliament, which will decide whether to keep them in office. In his first speech to parliament as prime minister, Mr Abadi said: ""I swear to God to protect the constitution and the law, and look after the interests of the people. ""I will be just to all Iraqis. The people will see what I will do. I call on politicians to work with me."" Mr Maliki's reluctance to give up the post of prime minister had plunged Iraq into political crisis. He was accused by opponents of pursuing a policy of sectarianism and seeking to entrench his authority. His rule also coincided with a sharp increase in sectarian violence and growing insecurity in the country. However, Mr Maliki has said he will not go quietly, and his supporters have warned of violence if he is forced out. The new prime minister's first task will be to form a national unity government to confront IS, which controls large parts of the north and west and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East. Iraq's government has been struggling to push back against the jihadist group, which has declared a caliphate in the areas it has seized. On Thursday, IS said it had beheaded a second US journalist, Steven Sotloff. The group said it was in retaliation for US air strikes against its fighters in Iraq. Last month, it released a video showing the killing of another US journalist, James Foley. The US has vowed to continue its air strikes, which it says have helped stem the advance of IS and allowed Iraqi and Kurdish forces to regain ground.",0,519

"To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on as the game progresses. This is only the second time I have seen England lose a Test to Bangladesh. I have not been to Bangladesh since 2004, when England were beaten in Dhaka, and I'm sure they will be shattered to have not been able to back up their dominant first-innings performance. I was not surprised to see Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes get out the way they did, trying to attack and hit through the off side. That was always going to be a problem for England, because the off-spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz was bowling well and, more importantly, into the rough outside the right-handers' off stump. The other thing is that Mehedi bowled with a lot of confidence. He was very accurate and pitched the ball up a lot of the time. That means a left-hander has to be positive because he cannot sit there and let it come to him. If you look at the way Moeen got out, trying to hit the ball out of the rough, you can see how difficult it was to play him. It was the same for Ben. I do not think he made a mistake playing the ball he did, he was just unlucky to edge the ball onto his pad. Ben's dismissal has raised some questions about whether he should have been batting at No 5, but it would be a mistake to make a change now. I know from experience that when you are playing as a No 5 batsman you have to be able to be a 'jack of all trades'. You have to be able to attack as well as absorb pressure, and you have to be able to cope with the different demands of different pitches. Ben is a quality player and, although I am sure he will be disappointed with this dismissal, I am sure he will be looking to improve. You cannot blame him for this loss. As a side, you have to have faith in your top five. You can have all the plans you want but if the top five are not scoring the runs you are in trouble. There have been a lot of questions about how England have played, but I think they will be asking the same questions of themselves and will come back stronger next week. As a batsman, you always have to be honest with yourself. If you have not been doing the basics well enough and you have not been scoring enough runs, that is going to affect you mentally. But you have to look to improve on those things. If England do not have the confidence to back up what they have done in the past, they will be in trouble. But I have no doubt they will be able to do that. As a side you have to play the conditions. England are very good at playing their game, but this week it has not worked. When you have not got the runs on the board, the pitch tends to get a little bit lower and slower and it is a lot easier for the spinners to bowl on. They will be backed by the Bangladeshi crowd, who will be on their side, and it is going to be a very difficult week for England. The first hour of the second Test will be very important. If England can get through that period and get 100 runs on the board, that will be a big achievement. The key is to get through the first hour and get through the new ball. Once that is done, the bowlers will have to toil away on a pitch that is not doing a lot, so it is a case of batting for as long as you can and getting as many runs as you can. Bangladesh will not be trying to do anything too different. They have already shown that they can bat for long periods, so they will just be trying to bat England out of the game. It was fantastic to see the way they batted in their second innings in Chittagong. They have shown they can bat, but the real challenge for them now is to try to win a Test series against England. They have never won a Test against them before. I think there will be a lot of nerves in the first hour on Friday morning. England will have to play the conditions better. They will have to be more patient and the batsmen will have to play a lot straighter. They will need to play with soft hands and really concentrate because, if you let a ball sneak through your defence in this situation, you can lose your wicket. I",0,521
"Revised growth estimates now suggest the construction industry shrank in the first quarter of 2012, but by less than previously thought. Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean that the sector avoided an official recession, but the government's forecasts also predict a much slower pace of growth for the rest of 2012. Data released this week shows that the economy shrank by 0.2 in the first quarter of 2012, instead of the 0.3 previously estimated. This may be enough to stop the construction industry being declared to have entered a recession, defined as two quarters of consecutive negative growth. The second estimate of GDP for the quarter has been revised up to a fall of 0.2 from a previous estimate of 0.3. The reason for the revision is that the construction industry is estimated to have grown by 0.3 in the first quarter, rather than shrinking by 4.8 as estimated last month. Though the construction industry is now estimated to have grown in the first quarter, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the industry will continue to struggle this year. It forecasts the sector to grow by just 0.2 in the second quarter and then by only 0.1 in the third and fourth quarters. These forecasts imply that the construction industry is set to grow by just 0.5 this year. This is much lower than the ONS' previous forecast of 1.2 growth for the sector this year, made in March. The ONS has revised down its forecast for GDP growth this year from 0.8 to 0.6. Inflation is expected to peak at 3.3 in the second quarter of this year and then to fall to 2.2 in the fourth quarter.",0,522
"In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the government, who are trying to remove her from the legislative council. Nathan Law, who is in the middle of his second year of university, is also taking the government to court. The 23-year-old is the youngest ever member of Hong Kong's legislative council. Both are part of the pro-democracy camp that is fighting for a more open election system in the city. The two were in Brussels to raise awareness of the political situation in Hong Kong at the European Parliament. ""There are few cases where a democratic country is facing a situation where a democratic movement is being suppressed by an undemocratic government. We need the international community to monitor what is happening in Hong Kong,"" said Mr Law. Ms Chow, who is serving her sentence in a juvenile detention centre, has been found guilty of taking part in an unlawful assembly during the ""Umbrella Movement"" protests. Her case has been seen as politically-motivated and has prompted protests in the city. Ms Chow's sentencing is seen as part of a broader effort by the Chinese government to suppress the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Mr Law said the current situation in Hong Kong was ""scary"" and ""worrying."" ""The government is trying to control the entire city,"" he said. Ms Chow and Mr Law were in Brussels to raise awareness of the political situation in Hong Kong at the European Parliament. ""If you want to be a politician in Hong Kong, you must be willing to put yourself out there and risk losing your seat in the legislative council,"" he said. They both admit the situation is hard for the Hong Kong public to swallow and many people do not understand what is happening. ""People are worried about the erosion of Hong Kong's rule of law,"" said Ms Chow. ""But I want to tell them not to worry, they should not be afraid. There are many people here fighting for your rights. You should not be scared to fight for your rights. We need people to stand up and speak out,"" she added. She said the movement could not be suppressed by throwing people in jail. ""They are trying to scare us but we will not be scared,"" she said. The two were invited by the European Union's only Green party member, Jose Inacio Faria. Mr Faria said he was shocked by the events in Hong Kong. ""I'm concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and I think it's time for the European Parliament to say something,"" he said. ""I want to push the EU to raise these issues with the Chinese government and make sure Hong Kong is respecting democracy and rule of law,"" he said. ""I'm a bit frustrated that the EU is not saying anything. We need to be much more vocal about what is happening."" Mr Faria said he wanted to make sure that Hong Kong was not forgotten. ""I'm aware that the situation in Hong Kong is not at the top of the agenda. There are many other problems in the world, but we have to make sure that democracy in Hong Kong is not forgotten,"" he said. ""That is why it is important to have the two young members of the legislative council here. Their presence here has an important symbolic value,"" he said. ""We have to keep the attention on Hong Kong,"" he added.",0,523
"A 25-year-old woman testified that Larry Nassar molested her from the age of six until 12 during family visits to his Michigan home. Mr Nassar, 53, is accused by more than 120 girls and women of sexual assault in cases dating back decades. More than 120 women, including the 2012 Olympic team captain, are now suing Nassar for alleged abuse. ""I did it,"" she said. ""I wanted you to suffer."" ""I felt so broken and so small and I felt like I didn't matter."" During the hearing, Raisman also explained that she had been so focused on training for the Olympics, she didn't realize that what was happening to her was sexual abuse. During the sentencing hearing, Rachael Denhollander described how Nassar convinced her and her parents that she had a muscle problem in her hips at age 15. ""Sexual abuse of children is much broader than the physical assault itself,"" said Michelle Collins, vice president of the rape, abuse and incest national network in Washington, D.C. ""But, the shame and guilt that survivors feel and the manipulation and coercion that perpetrators use is often far more damaging than the physical assault itself."" ""Larry, how many of us are there?"" ""You are a pathetic monster that is only sorry that you got caught."" Nassar's victims recounted that they were in the care of the USA Gymnastics doctor for multiple treatments, and several victims said the abuse began during their first visit to Nassar for treatment. ""I am strong enough to walk out of here and leave you to your hell behind me."" Nassar, who pleaded guilty to the sex crimes, has been accused of sexually assaulting more than 140 women. ""Larry, I'm not going to look away anymore,"" Raisman said in her remarks, per the Associated Press. ""He had to go on a long road trip and said he needed someone to come along and help him."" The 23-year-old recently won the 2017 season of Dancing with the Stars, and explained on the show's season premiere that she was dealing with some emotional baggage, and that she wanted to be a part of the MeToo movement. Larry Nassar is accused of sexually abusing more than 100 women, most of whom were his patients. ""I want them to have to face their accusers."" I want you to know, as much as it is possible, the depth and breadth of how you have wounded those you were entrusted to care for. ""You violated the oath that you took when you became a doctor."" On Wednesday, 15-year-old Jessica Thomashow told the court that Nassar molested her during a medical examination at her home when she was just nine years old. More news: Ex-South Korean president guilty of corruption, sentenced to 24 years ""Imagine feeling like you have no power and no voice,"" Maroney, 21, wrote in a statement read in court. ""Today, I want to tell everyone that I really did love the sport of gymnastics."" More than 125 women who said they were abused by Nassar when they were younger are expected to address the court. In a letter, the organization said: ""USA Gymnastics admires the courage of those, like McKayla Maroney, who have come forward to share their personal experiences with sexual abuse."" The Michigan Attorney General's Office is investigating how the school handled complaints against Nassar. The U.S. Olympic Committee issued a statement supporting victims of Nassar. ""I am so proud of her and I stand behind her, 100 percent."" According to court documents, Nassar would give the girls massages under the guise of medical treatment and would then fondle them. ""I hope this testimony will help others to know that they are not alone and that they are not to blame,"" the statement said. She said she was ""terrified"" to see Nassar again.

"Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by PS800,000, to PS3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016. This was despite turnover falling by PS1m to just over PS100m. During the year, the group invested PS4m, primarily in its milling and nutrition businesses, and has plans to continue with that investment in the coming year. The results mean the company has increased its year-on-year pre-tax profits for the fifth consecutive year. Harbro, which employs around 230 people, is a supplier of livestock feed, animal health, farm supplies and equipment. It operates across Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Managing director Graham Baxter said the company had enjoyed a strong performance, despite challenging market conditions. He said: ""It was a year of two halves for us. Despite the fall in turnover, we saw very positive trading in the first half of the year. ""However, the second half saw us deal with a more challenging market environment, especially in terms of feed ingredient pricing. It was very much a buyers' market, which made it difficult for our customers. ""We chose to absorb those additional costs for our customers, while at the same time continuing to invest in our people and our operations. We remain in a strong financial position and are well placed to continue our growth."" Mr Baxter said Harbro had benefited from a strong performance from its nutrition division, which it has grown through strategic investments in research and development and its own feed mills. He said: ""We are continuing to invest in people and facilities, with the aim of continuing to deliver the best possible service and products to our customers. ""The strength of our business has allowed us to invest heavily in our nutrition business, both in people and in facilities. ""We have increased our capacity by around 30 per cent, which allows us to be more efficient and to reduce lead times for our customers."" Harbro recently appointed Chris Sim as its new head of nutrition. Mr Baxter said that, while there were market challenges, the industry was in a strong position and he was optimistic about the future. ""Our industry has faced some challenges over the last couple of years, but the meat and livestock sector is strong and well positioned,"" he said. ""Brexit is likely to have a number of implications for the industry, including around exports, but it also presents opportunities. ""I think the UK will be in a good position to take advantage of its exit from the EU and continue to deliver high-quality meat and livestock products."" ""Harbro is in a strong position to take advantage of those opportunities as and when they arise."" Harbro was founded in 1981 by John and Rosemary Barnett. It has since developed into one of Scotland's leading animal feed, nutrition and rural supply businesses. The company supplies livestock producers throughout Scotland and Northern England, as well as those in Northern Ireland, through its joint venture with animal genetics company Genus. Its main production facility is in Thainstone, near Inverurie, and it has mills at Newbridge and Ayr. Harbro also has a network of 12 retail stores, which provide farm supplies and equipment, as well as delivering livestock feed and other products direct to farms and crofts. The company also operates a significant wholesale business, supplying livestock producers and other independent feed merchants across the UK. It is a member of the AIC, the UK's largest buying group for the agricultural industry. Through its retail stores and other facilities, Harbro employs around 230 people. In 2013, Harbro merged with Aberdeenshire-based farming group ANM Group, which operates across Scotland, England and Ireland.",0,525
"""The decision has dealt the final blow to democracy in the country,"" said the Organisation of American States. The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would have to change its rules before it could resume its duties. The opposition-controlled National Assembly has been in dispute with the government since 2016 over the powers of the vice-president. They accuse him of usurping the powers of the assembly, and say he should be impeached. Opposition lawmakers say the court ruling amounts to the suspension of the legislature and that it is invalid. The decision is the latest in a series of moves by the government and the court to take powers away from the opposition and consolidate their control. Venezuela is going through a severe economic crisis, with the International Monetary Fund predicting inflation will reach one million per cent this year. The opposition accuses President Nicolas Maduro of mismanaging the economy and undermining democracy. His supporters say the country is beset by an ""economic war"" led by the opposition and the United States. What did the court rule? The Supreme Court ruled that the assembly is in contempt of court over the failure of three legislators to appear in court. It said it would stay in contempt until the legislators appeared. The three were sanctioned after they were accused of receiving money and goods from businessman Juan Carlos Escotet, for campaign funding purposes, in 2010. Mr Escotet is a member of the Primero Justicia opposition party, to which the three legislators also belong. The court also said the legislators had violated an order prohibiting the assembly from swearing in three legislators from the state of Amazonas. The opposition won control of the assembly in elections in 2015. The Supreme Court has ruled that the three legislators should have been suspended and new elections held. The assembly has ignored the ruling, arguing that the legislators should have been replaced by their alternates, as is standard practice. In January, President Maduro was sworn in for a second term following an election in May which was boycotted by the main opposition parties and widely condemned by the international community. But the Supreme Court has ruled that the result of the election was valid, and the National Assembly is therefore ""in contempt."" What is the National Assembly? The opposition won a majority in the assembly in elections in 2015, a year after President Maduro came to power following the death of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The legislative body has been in a long-running dispute with the government since 2016. The government-allied Supreme Court said the assembly was in contempt of court in 2016, but reversed its decision a few days later. However, the assembly was suspended again in March 2017, after the Supreme Court said it was in contempt for swearing in the three suspended legislators. The opposition boycotted the presidential election in May, saying it was rigged in favour of President Maduro. The president said the boycott was an attempt to stage a coup with US backing. The decision to boycott the election came after the opposition failed to push for a referendum to remove the president from office and fresh elections to be held. How did the opposition react? They say the ruling has invalidated the legislature. ""The government of Nicolas Maduro just invalidated the only branch of government elected by the people in Venezuela,"" opposition leader Juan Guaido wrote on Twitter. ""Today they invalidated the National Assembly, tomorrow they will invalidate the presidency of Juan Guaido."" Mr Guaido, who is head of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president in January, claiming that he had a constitutional right to assume presidential powers from Mr Maduro, who had been re-elected last year in a vote that was widely dismissed as a sham. Mr Guaido says he is recognised by more than 50 countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. But Mr Maduro has the support of China and Russia, and is unlikely to be removed from power by force. How is the country faring? Venezuela has suffered several years of recession, with shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. The UN estimates that four million people have left Venezuela since 2015. Most have gone to neighbouring Latin American countries, particularly Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Opposition parties won a majority in parliament in elections in 2015, but President Maduro moved to increase his powers, creating a constituent assembly in 2017 to rewrite the constitution.

"Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness. He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the Squire pub in Longridge, Lancashire. His family said he was the ""life and soul of the party"" and had been ""the beating heart"" of the local community. Mr Spector had recently been given the Freedom of the City of Lancaster for his charitable work and was the first person to be given the honour posthumously. He was a well-known figure in the community for his love of dressing up as Santa Claus and taking part in charitable events. He began the tradition in 1990 after being given the role of Santa at a local school's Christmas event. He continued to dress up every year, taking part in 25 events in 2014, including the PNE Christmas party. He also helped to create an ""elf trail"" in Lancaster, which has raised more than 75,000 for a range of charities, including the Royal British Legion, and for local hospitals. Lancaster Mayor Stuart Hirst said: ""We are all devastated to hear that Santa has passed away. Jeffrey was an inspirational man and he will be sorely missed. ""He was a true gentleman and a great character and he had a positive impact on so many people's lives.

"Murray, 25, who has already secured Rio Olympic qualification, was down in 21st after the fencing round. Strong swimming and run-shoot combined events helped her climb to ninth and reach the final. She made a strong start in the final, taking the lead after the fencing round. ""I felt so good in the fencing and I was so relaxed, I knew I could go into the swim with a bit of a lead and then the run-shoot was really good,"" she said. Murray, who won gold in the team event last week, was not at her best in the second discipline, losing time on all her rivals in the pool. But she was back in control in the combined event, stopping the clock in 1:34.29min. ""It was a nice, controlled swim, I was surprised by it but I guess it was a good thing, I know I have to work hard in the next couple of weeks to get that swim back up to speed,"" she said. In the final discipline, Murray had to chase down 2015 world champion Sarolta Kovacs, and despite coming close to the Hungarian, she could not overtake her to claim the gold medal. ""It's a little bit frustrating because I was catching the girl but then she would just stay in front of me, so it was frustrating but you have to be happy with silver."" While Murray's run-shoot was the fastest of the day, she said the heat had affected her in the final. ""I was really tired and I think that's just from the heat, it's really hot out there,"" she said. ""It's a little bit frustrating but you have to be happy with silver."" She said she was pleased with her progress in the event and felt she was building towards a strong Olympic Games. ""The result today was really good. I've come a long way from the beginning of the year, and now I'm getting on the podium at World Cups, so I'm just really happy with that,"" she said.

Esposito, 19, who has also secured Rio qualification, went into the final ranked fourth after the preliminary and semi-final rounds. ""I was a bit disappointed with my performance today but I guess it's still a positive to be in the final,"" Esposito said. ""I've been competing a bit more this year and I'm starting to get used to the high pressure competitions now. I'm glad to be in the final and I'm glad to have the experience, I'll learn from it and hopefully it will help me in the future."" Meanwhile, Laugher said the result was an improvement from last weekend when he finished outside the top-ten. ""I was really happy with my dives today. I came 10th here last weekend so it was a really big improvement for me,"" he said.

"Media playback is not supported on this device At 44 years old, Owens was the oldest of the 12 referees chosen for the World Cup, but his age will not prevent him from realising a dream. The 1000-run mark came up when KL Rahul got to 19 and that was the second time in the day that Rahul had brought up a milestone. Rahul and Vijay added 18 runs to the overnight score when Amir, who bowled a no ball on the previous delivery, had Vijay caught behind. Vijay has been dismissed 10 times by left-arm pace bowlers, including five by Mohammad Amir. But India's 100-mark came up in the 30th over and the match was evenly poised. Earlier, India's bowlers did well to restrict Pakistan to 3385 in their 50 overs. After Hardik Pandya was dismissed in the 40th over, Jadhav, who had walked in to bat with the score at 92 for 4, stayed in the middle till the end. For India, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya took one wicket each. ""I thought there was an outside edge,"" Kohli said after the match. ""We played really well. We can't be more happy with the kind of cricket that we played in the last two weeks."" Pakistan had shocked England to enter their maiden final of the tournament while defending champions India defeated Bangladesh to set up the title clash. ""The turnaround has been magnificent."" India have won all three of their previous matches against Pakistan in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments to date, including in the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup on home soil in Mohali. ""If you look at the players we selected, nobody expected us to go to the final, let alone win the tournament."" The roar got louder when he brought up his half-century. ""You got to give credit to the opposition as well, they were outstanding."" ""I've never played in a game like this."" ""They've got some fantastic players."" ""It's been an up and down ride for us but I'm just so proud of the boys, they've been unbelievable,"" Morgan said. During this period, Pakistan scored just 72 runs. Earlier, India lost three wickets for 54 runs in the first 10 overs. The 18th over of the innings bowled by Hardik Pandya was a turning point in the match as Pakistan took 19 runs from it to revive their innings. ""We knew they would come hard."" ""The turnaround has been magnificent,"" said Kohli. A soft dismissal for the Proteas' skipper, who was trapped in front of the stumps as he attempted a sweep shot off the bowling of leg-spinner Imran Tahir. ""I think we've got the ability to play long games as well."" On the way to his half century, Fakhar Zaman brought up the 100 for Pakistan with a massive six. ""The attitude and the style of play that the boys have shown was outstanding, and today was a complete performance,"" he said. But Pakistan, the lowest-ranked side to feature in a Champions Trophy final and appearing in their first ICC final since the 2009 World Twenty20, bounced back to dismiss India's top three in quick succession.

"The public car park is just off the Upper Newtownards Road, one of the main routes into the city. Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars and white vans. The pallets have been used to make a warren of streets, which snake around the car park and are named after well known Belfast landmarks, including Ormeau Road, Donegal Square, Botanic Avenue and Cregagh Road. I see a man putting an old mattress outside a ""house"" made from pallets. He has a small child with him. As I watch, they collect some planks of wood and a few pallets and start to build another house next door. Dozens of men, women and children have done the same. It is a ragtag assortment of make-shift houses, many of which have ""gardens"" made from pallets and planks of wood. There are people everywhere. Some are cooking food on camping stoves. Others are playing football. A man is sitting on the grass outside one of the ""houses,"" carving a wooden stick with a pen knife. He has a small child on his knee. As he works away at the wood, he holds the child's hand in his. It is a tender scene. I see a woman putting clothes out to dry. She is hanging them from the frame of a discarded tent. I also see a man with a scruffy beard who is sitting on a plastic chair outside one of the houses. He is smoking a cigarette and talking on a mobile phone. He takes a long drag on his cigarette, and then exhales a stream of smoke. It drifts away in the wind. I watch as a man and a woman, who are both carrying large rucksacks, walk up the hill to the car park. They have obviously just arrived and have their eyes wide open. The man looks around and says something to the woman. I can't hear what he says, but I imagine he is probably saying something like, ""It's not quite what I expected."" It is the same with every newcomer. There is shock and surprise. These people are some of Belfast's most vulnerable. They are homeless, down on their luck, and have nowhere else to go. They have built a community here. They have made a life for themselves. They have made something from nothing. A mural has been painted on one of the walls in the car park. It is of a bird with outstretched wings, and underneath are the words ""No surrender."" I try to talk to some of the people living here, but many refuse to speak to me. One of them says to me: ""Don't take any pictures, and don't come back again. We are fine as we are. We don't need your help."" I approach a man with a big beard and a dog. He says his name is John and that he has been living in the car park for a year. He points to a nearby ""house"" and says, ""That's my house over there. It's not bad."" John also says he does not want help. He says he is happy to stay in the car park. John and his dog The council has said it does not want the car park to be used as a permanent home, but has been criticised for its response to the situation. One Belfast city councillor said the situation was ""shameful"" and called on the council to act with ""greater urgency"" to deal with the problem. Councillor John Kyle said he had seen people ""living in a state of absolute squalor and in fear of their lives."" ""People are sleeping out in the open, they are in fear of their lives and they have no proper toilet facilities,"" he said. ""These are people who have complex needs, they have drug and alcohol addictions and other mental health issues. They should be treated with dignity and respect."" He added: ""This is a human tragedy on our doorstep and we need to treat it with the urgency it deserves. The people there need help and support. ""I have spoken to some of the people living in the car park and they say the council needs to act. They say they are not getting the help they need."" The council has said it is planning to demolish the derelict buildings at the rear of the car park. It said this will ""remove the opportunity for this area to be used for rough sleeping and anti-social behaviour.""",0,539
"Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was a severe blow to the strategic power of the region. The alliance of Eritrea, South Sudan, Uganda, and Djibouti, all of which relied on Meles for strategic and logistical support, is in peril as the Ethiopian government is re-evaluating its position on a number of regional security and political issues. This comes at a time when regional security is at a delicate crossroads, with South Sudan on the brink of civil war and Eritrea facing the most severe drought since the 1984 famine. Meles was a stabilising influence in the region, but the West may need to act quickly to avert disaster. The potential for civil war in South Sudan is reaching a critical stage. The 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the Sudanese civil war, is on the verge of collapsing. After the death of Meles, the Ethiopian government withdrew its forces from the disputed border region of Abyei, and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and allied militias moved in to fill the security vacuum. This has provided Khartoum with a strategic advantage in their long-running dispute with Juba. Oil production, which is an important source of revenue for both countries, has been halted as a result. Ethiopia had been mediating between the two countries but has now withdrawn. This will add to the pressure on Juba and lead to further instability. Eritrea has been facing the worst drought in decades, and the United Nations has warned that the country is on the verge of famine. The Ethiopian government, which under Meles had been allowing large amounts of food and medical aid to reach Eritrea, has cut back on its support. Ethiopia is wary that its ally Djibouti is supporting Eritrea in the disputed region of Ras Doumeira on the Djiboutian-Eritrean border, and Addis Ababa fears that Djibouti may be allowing Eritrea to use its port facilities. This has created a stalemate, which has, in turn, impacted on the humanitarian crisis. The UN has been forced to use longer and more dangerous routes, and Eritrea has been severely disrupted. Meles had acted as a mediator between the two countries, and his death means that the situation is likely to deteriorate further. The UN is facing increasing difficulty in providing aid to the region, and there are fears that the drought could soon become a humanitarian catastrophe. The Ugandan government, which is facing increasing pressure from the West over its human rights record, has long relied on Meles for support. Meles' death is a further blow for President Museveni. The Ethiopian government has been supplying Uganda with military and logistical support in the fight against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which is based in South Sudan. Uganda was able to persuade Khartoum to allow it to use South Sudanese territory to track down LRA forces, but the Ethiopian withdrawal from Abyei has weakened Uganda's strategic position. This comes at a time when the US has cut its support for the Ugandan military, which had been seen as a crucial element in the fight against the LRA. The LRA has recently stepped up its attacks on Ugandan and South Sudanese targets, and there are fears that the group will attempt to exploit the current instability in the region. Meles was one of the main political and military strategists in the region. His death leaves a power vacuum in the region, and there are fears that the alliance between Eritrea, South Sudan, Uganda, and Djibouti could collapse as a result. The West, and in particular the US, needs to step in and provide support to the alliance if it is to survive the transition in Ethiopia. The US has lost a key strategic ally in the region, and it would be foolish to stand by while the situation deteriorates further. The US should continue to put pressure on the Ethiopian government to continue to support Djibouti, Uganda, and Eritrea. Furthermore, the US should engage with Sudan and South Sud",0,540

He said: ""We are expecting a major impact from this weather event and I would urge everybody to heed the safety warnings that have been issued and to act with common sense and avoid all non-essential travel. ""Schools should take the decision that is in the best interest of the safety of their staff and their children. ""I do not expect that there will be any other decision taken but we will have to wait until each authority in each area makes that decision.""

"The jury praised Ahmed Mansoor for regularly raising concerns about arbitrary detention, torture and degrading treatment in the Gulf state. As a result, it said, he had faced repeated intimidation, harassment and death threats. The right to free expression is guaranteed under the United Arab Emirates (UAE) constitution and yet authorities continue to arbitrarily restrict free speech and commit human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. The last time Mansoor was arrested was in April 2011. He was held for eight months and prosecuted on the charge of insulting the country's leaders. Mansoor had used his blog to call for demonstrations inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings, and signed a petition in favor of universal, direct elections for the Federal National Council, a government advisory body. ""The UAE authorities should release Ahmed Mansoor immediately, drop all charges against him, and respect freedom of expression,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW. ""Governments that are truly committed to free expression should press the UAE to stop persecuting Mansoor and end its systematic repression of human rights defenders."" Mansoor is the sixth winner of the Martin Ennals Award, which is given to Human Rights Defenders who have shown deep commitment and face great personal risk. The aim of the award is to provide protection through international recognition. The winner is selected by the Martin Ennals Foundation, a network of ten of the world's leading human rights organizations. The award is presented annually in Geneva by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights or his representative.

The UN's cultural agency UNESCO said on Friday that 148 journalists were killed in 2014, the highest toll since it began keeping records on the issue 10 years ago. (Photo courtesy of AFP) The UN agency said the worsening situation in the Middle East was largely to blame for the jump in the number of journalists killed, with the conflict in Syria accounting for more than half the journalists killed last year. ""The situation in the Arab region, with Syria on the top, followed by Iraq and Libya, is more dangerous than ever for journalists,"" said UNESCO's director general Irina Bokova. The Middle East accounted for 46.4 percent of the killings of journalists last year, followed by Africa at 24.2 percent and Asia at 19.1 percent, said UNESCO, which is holding a two-day conference in Paris on the safety of journalists. ""The news is bad, very bad,"" said the head of UNESCO's press freedom division, Guy Berger. ""Journalists are often seen as a symbol of the freedom to inform."" Berger said the high number of journalists killed last year was not only due to the conflicts in the Middle East, but also ""to the fact that more and more non-state groups and individuals are involved in the killing of journalists."" ""They want to control the narrative, they want to decide what is published and what is not,"" he said. The conference comes days after the killing of Charlie Hebdo journalists in Paris, including cartoonist Georges Wolinski, who is regarded as a journalist because he worked for a newspaper. UNESCO said it would pay tribute to Wolinski and fellow Charlie Hebdo journalist Bernard Verlhac, known as Tignous, at the conference on Monday.

"SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes. The series was created by Mike Young, who was born in Cardiff. The first series of 13 episodes were made in 1983, but it wasn't until 1987 that it was shown on television. The series was a hit with children, and was repeated for several years. It was broadcast in other countries, including America, France, Japan and Australia. There was a big budget remake of the series in 1992, which was screened in English. It was shown on BBC1 in the UK. The series was a success, and a further 52 episodes were made. It was broadcast in 30 countries, and the series has been dubbed into several languages. The series features a teddy bear who is given superpowers by a wish made by a small boy, John. He helps John and his friends save the world from the evil Texas Pete. The SuperTed Centre is a museum in Merthyr Tydfil. It opened in 2012 and contains sets, costumes and characters from the series.

"Ali Asghar Zarean told state TV that Iran would sign an agreement with China to modify the reactor before doing so. On Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency cited unnamed experts as saying the reactor was likely to be modified to produce isotopes needed for medical purposes. China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the Iran deal had been the product of multilateral efforts and ""any unilateral action taken by relevant parties could easily lead to further complication of the issue."" ""We hope all parties concerned will remain rational and exercise restraint, ease tensions, resume negotiations, and resolve differences and disputes through dialogue,"" spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing in Beijing. In a phone call to his French counterpart, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the nuclear deal ""now is in danger of falling apart,"" according to her office. At the same time, the chancellor also stressed the importance of dialogue with Iran, saying that ""the ball is in Iran's court."" The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, is travelling to Washington to underline the EU's determination to preserve the nuclear deal. Mogherini is expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday. Merkel, who has been an ardent defender of the nuclear deal since it was reached in July 2015, called for the issue to be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. ""It's true that so far we haven't seen Iran breaching the agreement, and we are monitoring that very closely,"" she said. But Merkel added: ""We want to make sure that Iran really abides by it."" Merkel noted that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country wants to adhere to the deal if it sees economic benefits from it. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters in Berlin that ""the deal is in danger because Iran no longer feels bound by the commitments to which it has signed up."" Maas said the EU has been in ""close contact with the Trump administration"" about the situation in the Persian Gulf. ""We do not want it to come to a military conflict,"" he said. He said that the EU is ""of course"" prepared to talk with the U.S. about the situation, but stressed that ""the main thing now is to talk to Iran."" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Berlin, London and Paris are calling for an expert-level meeting of a commission that oversees the implementation of the deal ""in the coming days"" to ""jointly look at how the agreement can be kept alive."" Merkel said that she's spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the situation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow has been urging the U.S. and Iran to ease tensions and begin a dialogue. ""We are convinced that this is the only possible way to normalize the extremely tense situation around Iran,"" Lavrov said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency Tass. Lavrov said that Moscow remains in contact with both Tehran and Washington and is ready to share ""our experience and proposals on how to de-escalate the situation."" He said he had discussed the situation with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is to meet with Pompeo in the coming days. Russia, China and Iran are all signatories to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. The agreement is aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the accord in May 2018. Since then, he has imposed sanctions on Iran in an all-out effort to cripple its economy. Trump said Iran will be ""held accountable for its actions."" ""The leaders of Iran are acting with the assumption that at some point, America will permit them to have a nuclear weapon,"" he said.

"Campaigners fought to save Ipswich Airport after it was earmarked for housing by Ipswich Borough Council, with some occupying the terminal building for about four months. The anniversary of the airport's closure is on 30th November. The first airfield to be built in Suffolk was at Melton, and in 1935 Ipswich Airport was officially opened. The Airport was requisitioned by the RAF during the Second World War, and after the war the airport opened to the public in 1947. In 1956, the airport became a limited company and was named Ipswich Airport Ltd. It closed in 1996, but the buildings remained in use for general aviation and business aviation purposes. Ipswich Borough Council bought the land at Ipswich Airport in 2004 and in 2009 the airport was closed. The council's intentions were to use the land to provide 800 homes, a local centre and businesses, as part of an area of 1,400 homes. Ipswich Airport had been part of a strategic site which the council had identified for development since the 1990s. In 2014, the council approved planning permission for 800 homes and a business park. A further application for a new road linking the new estate to the A12 was submitted by the council in May 2015. The council has said that the road would remove the need for people to use residential roads to access the airport site and surrounding areas. The B1077, which runs alongside the airport site, has been closed since 2009, when the airport was shut. The new road will connect the airport site with the A12, and the council has said that the road is crucial to the development of the site for housing and a business park. The site of Ipswich Airport was put forward as an alternative to expansion at Stansted Airport. The closure of Ipswich Airport was a particular blow to businesses in the region, which had been campaigning for an alternative to the London airports. Suffolk Chamber of Commerce said the closure would have a serious impact on the economy of the region. A week before the closure, the Chamber had been urging the council to keep the airport open for another 12 months, to give more time for the airport to be saved. The Chamber said the closure would mean that the region lost the opportunity to develop an airport which could have been an alternative to London, as well as creating the potential for new jobs and investment. Ipswich Airport had been a base for air freight services to Southend, which the Chamber said provided a valuable link for local businesses to get their goods to London City Airport and the continent.

"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK may want to be more ""obliging"" to certain countries to secure future commercial advantages. The EU is keen to maintain a united front in negotiations with Britain. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned Britain on Tuesday not to expect a special trade deal with the EU after it leaves the bloc. Speaking during a meeting with EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, Juncker said the UK's priority should be securing a deal with the EU over exiting the bloc, not a free trade agreement. ""We need to work very hard to ensure that our separation is as orderly as possible,"" he said. ""Before thinking about the future, we need to clarify our past and the present. We need to settle the accounts,"" he added. ""We will not mix these things up. That will be the message of the European Council."" Juncker's comments came after British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested that Britain could be ""more outward looking"" to individual EU member states once it leaves the bloc. The EU has maintained a united front in negotiations with Britain, with officials warning that the UK cannot expect to maintain the same benefits it has as a member state. The bloc has repeatedly stressed that Britain's decision to leave the EU must not be more beneficial than staying. The EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Tuesday that the UK must accept the fact that Brexit will have ""negative consequences"" on its economy. ""We can't have the same advantages as in the single market. That's the decision of the British people,"" Barnier told the European Parliament. On Monday, May urged the EU to adopt a more ""creative"" approach to the talks, suggesting the bloc was being too inflexible in its approach. The Brexit talks are due to resume in Brussels next week.",0,549
"Last month he became the first player to speak publicly about being sexually abused as a boy at Crewe in the 1980s. There are now 155 suspects in the UK-wide historical abuse inquiry, with 328 clubs involved, in addition to a further 48 clubs, 54 individuals and 24 other organizations. In an interview with the Guardian on Monday, Stewart said he had been heartened by the response to his revelations and was ""not bitter"" about his experiences, which included being regularly invited to the homes of Crewe's coaches for ""special training sessions,"" where he was molested. He said he had been inundated with messages of support from fellow players. ""It's been very good,"" said Stewart. ""It's not been overwhelming. The biggest thing for me, and I didn't think it would happen to this extent, is the number of footballers who have phoned me and messaged me. Some of them are the biggest names in football. ""I can't believe the number of people that have got in touch and said, 'I know what you're talking about, I have been through it'. So that's what I'm trying to come to terms with at the moment. I didn't expect it to be that big. ""It's a relief to know that people are coming out and saying, 'I know exactly what you're going through, I've been through it'."" One of those players was David White, a former Manchester City and England winger, who gave evidence to police on Monday. He said he was abused by Barry Bennell, a former Crewe coach, as a 13-year-old at Manchester City. Stewart said he had felt compelled to speak out because of the death of his friend Gary Speed, the Wales manager who hanged himself in 2011 at the age of 42. ""I think Gary was the real reason why I did this,"" said Stewart. ""He was the reason why I phoned the police and said, 'I've got a story to tell you'. But he was also the reason why I didn't do it sooner. If Gary was here, he'd be phoning me and saying, 'Come on, Andy, you've got to say something.' He'd have been doing that. So when he passed away, I just thought, 'I'm not going to be able to live with myself if I don't say something.' I just hope I've done the right thing. ""There are some people who will be thinking, 'Why are you doing this now?' But it's the hardest thing I've ever done. It's probably the hardest thing I'll ever have to do again. You can't get your head around the magnitude of it. I don't think I'll ever get my head around it. It's all the unknown factors that are the hardest thing."" Stewart said he was surprised at the criticism he had received from some former Crewe players, including Steve Walters, who said Stewart was ""jumping on the bandwagon."" ""The only thing I would say is that this is not a bandwagon,"" said Stewart. ""I've been thinking about this for years. I'm not going to say anything to Steve because he's a good lad, but it's the last thing on my mind - to be on a bandwagon. I've been thinking about this for a long, long time. And it's the last thing on my mind to be a victim. I don't want to be a victim. I don't want to be labeled a victim. ""I'm not bitter. If I was bitter, I would have been bitter 15 years ago. This has only come out now because I've had to do it for myself. I've had to do it for my own sanity, for my own wellbeing. ""It's something that's been with me for 40 years and it's something that I'm never going to get rid of. You can't get rid of it. It's with me. It's with me every day. So the only way I could get it out is to do it this way. ""It's not an easy thing to do. If people think it's an easy thing to do, then they're very, very wrong.""

"The 28-year-old's nine-year-old daughter was also threatened by a member of the gang, who had a knife. The burglary happened at their home in the Turf Hill area at about 23:15 BST on Monday. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has said the gang could be linked to a number of similar offences across the area. In this case, a gang of four men barged their way into the house, holding the family hostage for about half an hour while they searched the house. They stole cash and jewellery and made the occupants open safe boxes. The family, including the footballer's mother, were forced to the floor while the men demanded keys for a safe. They were threatened and assaulted, and the nine-year-old girl was also threatened by a man carrying a knife. The men left the house in a white Audi estate car, which was later found abandoned and burnt out in Whit Lane in Turton. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin, of GMP, said: ""This has been a truly terrifying ordeal for this family who have not only lost irreplaceable personal items, but have been left extremely shaken. ""While the investigation is still in its early stages, we are currently treating this as an isolated incident and believe the offenders have purposely targeted this address. ""I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious, or has information about this incident, to please get in touch with us as soon as possible."" GMP has said the same gang could be responsible for a number of other burglaries in the area, and has appealed for anyone who has been a victim of a similar crime to contact them.

"The Chesterfield striker was cleared of rape at a retrial in 2016. He had been charged with attacking the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, Denbighshire. Following the retrial, the Professional Footballers' Association said Evans would not be returning to the game until his name had been ""cleared."" But last Friday the PFA withdrew its support for the player, saying that it had been ""misled"" by Evans. We should not be surprised by this. According to the Guardian, there was a report by a company called First Point Family Law which ""found the woman was not a credible witness, but the PFA's lawyers chose not to read it because they did not want to risk being accused of re-victimising Evans's accuser."" The Guardian report also states that ""it has emerged that the PFA did not attempt to contact the victim in the Evans case, despite the body's rules stating that it would not act without her consent. The PFA did not seek her consent to represent Evans, according to the woman's father."" But then, what should we expect from an organisation that routinely puts out statements such as this one following the news that they had withdrawn their support: The PFA has been a strong advocate of the principle of establishing the innocence of any member charged with a criminal offence before publicly condemning them or withdrawing its support. We have therefore supported the right of Ched Evans to return to his club in order to resume his career. The PFA has also been concerned to protect the welfare of the victim of this crime, as it would with any victim of any crime, and has been particularly anxious to avoid any action which might serve to further victimise her. I don't believe that the PFA are particularly interested in the welfare of the victim of this crime. They are interested in protecting their own backs. They are interested in being seen to be ""doing the right thing."" The PFA's half-hearted support for Evans and subsequent withdrawal of it serves only to highlight the hypocrisy of the organisation. They claim to be concerned about the welfare of the victim but do not make the effort to contact her or seek her consent to represent Evans. They claim to have been ""misled"" by Evans. They claim that Evans was not, in their view, ""guilty"" of the crime. Evans may not have been found ""guilty"" of the crime. I am not going to dispute that. But he was found guilty of the crime. The jury found him guilty of the crime. The jury's decision was overturned by a judge. The jury found Evans guilty of the crime. The jury were not ""misled"" by Evans. How can the PFA claim to have been ""misled"" by Evans when the jury found him guilty? I don't believe that the PFA are concerned about the welfare of the victim of this crime. The PFA are an organisation with a certain agenda and certain set of interests. They are not concerned with the welfare of women who are raped. They are not concerned with the welfare of women who are victims of domestic violence. They are not concerned with the welfare of women who are stalked. They are concerned with protecting the interests of their members. They are concerned with protecting the interests of the people who pay their wages. That is all they are concerned with. And that is all they should be concerned with. And if they are not going to stick by one of their members who has been found guilty of rape, then they shouldn't. But they should not claim that they have been ""misled"" by him when a jury found him guilty of the crime. They should not claim that they are concerned about the welfare of the victim when they make no effort to contact her. They should not claim to be concerned about the welfare of women and children who are victims of rape, domestic violence and abuse when they do not even make the effort to contact the victim in a case they are involved with.

"The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95 compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and earns more than 10,000. According to a new survey by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), 95 per cent of the 68,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that were part of the roll-out of auto-enrolment between August and November 2015 are complying with the new rules. The figures are only slightly down on the 97 per cent compliance rate reported in July 2015. Auto-enrolment was introduced in 2012 in an attempt to address the fact that many people were not paying into a pension scheme. Under the new rules, all employers are required to automatically enrol all employees who are not already in a workplace pension scheme into a qualifying scheme and contribute towards it. Employees can opt out of their workplace pension if they want to, but they will not be able to rejoin for a year. If they opt out, employers are not required to make any contributions. There are different levels of minimum contribution that employers must pay depending on the type of scheme they offer and when they joined. Employers have until 1 June 2016 to start offering workplace pensions to their staff, although the largest businesses were required to do so first. ""These figures show that small and micro-employers are embracing automatic enrolment, with compliance rates remaining consistently high,"" said pensions minister, Baroness Altmann. ""Automatic enrolment is a cultural shift that is already helping millions of people take responsibility for their retirement.""",0,557
"Anna Jacobs read the description by Tecomak Environmental Services in an email inviting her for interview. Attached seemingly by accident, the comments suggested Ms Jacobs, of Horsmonden in Kent, was not good enough for the role of sales executive.

"HS2 Action Alliance says a paper by HS2 Ltd shows engineering work will mean closing parts of some passenger lines for 133 weekends, and some freight lines for 50 weekends. Spokesman Joe Rukin said: ""This is utterly unacceptable."" But HS2 Ltd said that any closures would be ""carefully planned."" The government's preferred route would see HS2 travel through Warwickshire, Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire and link Birmingham to London. The 237km (147 mile) route would also run through parts of Oxfordshire, Staffordshire and Leicestershire. It would mean a new station would be built at Toton, south of Nottingham, and the existing station at Sheffield Midland would be upgraded. 'Unacceptable closures' HS2 Action Alliance said the paper ""reveals an alarming number of closures of key parts of the West Coast Main Line."" Mr Rukin said: ""It looks like the Department for Transport's decision to allow HS2 Ltd to build the London-Birmingham line before the rest of the route to Manchester and Leeds has been made in complete ignorance of the effect that construction of HS2 will have on the West Coast Main Line. ""The West Coast Main Line is currently being upgraded as part of the government's 9.4bn investment programme. ""This will not only be wasted, but is now looking like being completely undone by HS2."" 'Extensive work' But HS2 Ltd said: ""The West Coast Main Line is one of the most congested mixed-use railway lines in Europe, carrying 40 more traffic than it was designed for and in need of major upgrades, requiring significant closures. ""We recognise the impact that the essential engineering works to modernise the West Coast Main Line will have on local communities and are committed to working with all parties to minimise this impact. ""However, it is essential that this work is done if the line is to continue to provide vital services to businesses and passengers."" It said it was ""committed to working with all parties to minimise the impact on local communities"" and closures would be ""carefully planned with consideration for passengers, businesses and local communities."" But it said HS2 was ""vital to the UK's economy and will provide a 47bn boost and 100,000 jobs"" and would provide ""much needed extra space for passengers and freight on the existing network."" At the end of January, the High Court ruled that the government had acted unlawfully in failing to disclose its rationale for changing the route of part of HS2. It said that the government had acted ""unlawfully"" in failing to disclose to MPs the rationale behind the alteration of the HS2 line in December 2016. Earlier this year, a senior MP said HS2 was ""on the edge of viability"" after it emerged the cost of the route had gone up by a third. HS2 was due to cost 56bn, but the Department for Transport has now said it will cost between 65bn and 78bn. The start date has been pushed back from 2026 to 202829.

"In an interview with Fox News, he said: ""There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?"" Mr Trump also said he would ""send in the Feds"" if Chicago did not ""fix the horrible 'carnage'."" ""I will send in the Feds!"" he tweeted. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Mr Trump meant he would ""work with Chicago to help them fix the problem."" But what did Mr Trump mean by ""send in the Feds""? ""I think what he is expressing there is the concern and desire to want to help people that are hurting and to emphasise the level of violence in parts of Chicago,"" Mr Spicer said. When asked whether Mr Trump could send in federal troops, Mr Spicer said the president had used that phrase before. ""I think that is a broad brush of federal assistance,"" he said. What would a federal intervention look like? A federal intervention could be either a military deployment or a surge in federal law enforcement agents. Critics have already accused Mr Trump of not understanding the Constitution, which reserves policing duties for state and local governments. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Mr Trump was not talking about sending in the military but rather about ""federal agencies"" that could be involved. ""I think what he meant by that is a surge of federal agencies that are going into Chicago and trying to get a hold of this situation,"" Mr Priebus said. The Fraternal Order of Police - the largest police union in the country - said Mr Trump's intervention would be ""unprecedented"" and ""raise serious legal issues."" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called Mr Trump's threat ""misguided,"" adding that ""federal law allows local police to do their jobs."" ""I want to remind President Trump that it was a Republican Congress, under the leadership of (then-House Speaker) Newt Gingrich and (then-Speaker of the House) Dennis Hastert, that passed the law that even allows the federal government to come in when there's a consent decree,"" he told the Chicago Tribune. What does a consent decree mean? A consent decree is a legal agreement between state and local governments and the federal government to enforce laws. In November, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald, an African-American teenager, by a white police officer. In January, then-US Attorney General Loretta Lynch found that the Chicago Police Department had violated the law, prompting the city to sign a consent decree that allowed federal oversight of Chicago's police department. In September, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Chicago branch of the NAACP filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging a pattern of excessive force against minorities. How common are federal interventions? The Chicago Police Department has been under federal oversight for more than a decade, with an ongoing consent decree that dates back to 2003. Under that agreement, an independent monitor monitors the department's progress in reducing excessive force and increasing transparency. The Justice Department has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies since 2009 and is enforcing 19 consent decrees, according to the New York Times. In Baltimore, six police officers were charged in connection with the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American who died from injuries in police custody. In 2016, the Justice Department found that Baltimore's Police Department had engaged in a pattern of discrimination against African-Americans. What is the crime rate like in Chicago? Chicago's murder rate has risen from 430 in 2015 to 762 in 2016, according to the Chicago Police Department. The rate was 18.3 murders per 100,000 residents, up from 11.4 murders in 2015. Chicago's murder rate is the highest in the country, according to the FBI. Which other cities have high murder rates? St Louis, Missouri, was second on the FBI's list of cities with a population of 100,000 or more. It had a murder rate of 60.3 per 100",0,561

Meanwhile, Austria forward Marko Arnautovic is due to fly to China for the Super League champions to complete his move. Shanghai SIPG have agreed a fee with West Ham for the 29-year-old. The Austria international joined West Ham from Stoke for 25m in 2017. Bilic was appointed West Brom boss on June 13, replacing Darren Moore who was sacked in March. West Ham are hopeful of appointing a new manager before the weekend's game against Manchester City. ""The manager's job is one of the most important in the club, and we believe it is right to take our time to make the best possible appointment,"" joint-chairman David Sullivan said. Manuel Pellegrini was sacked by West Ham on 28 December after two-and-a-half years in charge. Graeme Jones, the assistant manager, has taken charge of first-team affairs on an interim basis and has overseen the last three league games. West Ham United have sacked manager Manuel Pellegrini after a run of poor results. The Hammers are 17th in the Premier League table, one point above the relegation zone, after losing 2-1 at home to Leicester City on Saturday. Former Manchester City boss Pellegrini, 66, was appointed in May 2018, signing a three-year deal. He replaced David Moyes, who took over on a short-term deal following Slaven Bilic's sacking in November 2017. West Ham, who have not won a Premier League game since 30 October, lost 4-0 at Oxford United in the FA Cup third round on 5 January. Pellegrini's sacking was announced less than an hour after the club announced the appointment of David Moyes as his successor. West Ham have confirmed the appointment of David Moyes on an 18-month deal, to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as manager of the Premier League club. The Scot returns to the London Stadium after being the Hammers' interim manager for the final six games of the 2017-18 campaign. David Moyes has been appointed as the new manager of West Ham United on a two-and-a-half-year deal. West Ham have announced the appointment of David Moyes as their new manager, replacing Slaven Bilic. The Scot, who has been out of work since leaving Sunderland following their relegation from the Premier League, has signed a contract until the summer of 2020. Moyes said: ""I'm really looking forward to meeting the supporters, being in the stadium with them. ""I'm looking forward to seeing them get right behind the team, and my team also. We need everybody with us. West Ham sacked Slaven Bilic on Monday following Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Liverpool, their 10th loss in their 13 Premier League games so far this season. Moyes was appointed on a six-month deal at Sunderland last summer, but was unable to prevent the Wearsiders from being relegated from the Premier League. The 54-year-old was previously manager of Everton, who he led to the 2009 FA Cup final, and Manchester United, where he succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson on a six-year contract in 2013. He has also managed Preston and Real Sociedad, who he left in November 2014 after a year in charge. West Ham sacked Slaven Bilic on Monday following Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Liverpool, their 10th loss in their 13 Premier League games so far this season.

"India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was to be an alternative to the corrupt practices of the cities. In February 1946, in a speech at Sevagram, Gandhi said: ""Unless India makes an all-out effort to give the village the place of honour, I shall have nothing to do with independence. I want a permanent village settlement, i.e., permanent structure of freedom."" Gandhi was not an arm-chair theorist. He had lived and worked in villages and among the poorest people of India. He saw them as more honest and more industrious than the city dwellers and wanted India's future to be determined by them. He realized that Indians had become too westernized. They had adopted the worst of western civilization, its materialism and its greed. Gandhi tried to restore India's traditional virtues of simplicity and non-violence. Although Gandhi was a Hindu, he respected all religions and insisted that India should treat its minorities with respect. Gandhi thought that the Congress had become a party of vested interests. He believed that it should not be in power and that India should have a government of national unity. Gandhi and other Congress leaders were released from prison when the war ended and the British released all political prisoners. Gandhi travelled all over India to try to restore peace. He called off the ""Quit India"" movement as soon as the war ended. In May 1946, the British agreed to give India independence by June 1948. They offered to remain until that time to ease the transition. British policy was to divide India and the Muslim League had already created a separate state called Pakistan. The only question was where to draw the line between the two countries. Gandhi was willing to let the Muslims have a separate country if that was their wish. He felt that they would eventually realize their mistake and reunite with India. He was willing to sacrifice the unity of India to avoid a civil war. In June 1947, the British announced that India would become independent on August 15, 1947. The new borders of India and Pakistan were drawn in such a way as to divide the Punjab and Bengal between the two countries. India and Pakistan became separate countries on August 15, 1947. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India. The new borders of the two countries were arbitrary and created many problems. The most serious problem was that millions of people became refugees. Hindus living in Pakistan and Muslims living in India had to leave their homes and go to the other side of the border. Both sides were blamed for the massacres of the refugees. Gandhi visited the riot areas in an attempt to calm the people. On January 13, 1948, Gandhi started a fast unto death because he felt that the Hindu and Sikh politicians were not doing enough to protect Muslims. The fast had the desired effect and the rioting stopped. Gandhi broke his fast on January 18. On January 30, 1948, Gandhi held a prayer meeting in Delhi. After the meeting, he went to the garden of Birla House to greet the people. A Hindu fanatic named Nathuram Godse came forward and shot him three times in the chest. Gandhi died instantly.",0,565
"The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-112 to Burns, 115-113 to Beltran and 114-114, which did not seem to reflect Beltran flooring Burns or his dislocating the champion's jaw. Beltran landed a left hook that dropped Burns in the eighth round, but the Scot managed to fight back and finish the round strong. There were contrasting views of the fight. The contest, which Burns took in his home country, was a thriller as the two battled from the opening bell. Burns, who was making his fourth defence of the WBO belt, now has 39 wins in 43 fights, with three defeats and one draw. ""He's a great fighter, he's tough, and I'm really glad I got the win."" ""When I was down, he was up, but I got back on my feet and got back on the front foot."" ""I believe he deserves it."" ""I just said to my trainer, 'I'll be honest with you, I don't know if I've won that fight, he said. ""I showed I could punch and box, but I was fighting the wrong fight."" ""I felt I was going to stop him."" 'I did, ' he said. Beltran was making his seventh attempt at winning a world title, having previously been beaten by WBC champion Juan Manuel Marquez, Shawn Porter, Danny Garcia and Paul McCloskey. ""I thought I'd done enough to win the fight."" ""I felt strong, I felt I was winning the rounds."" ""I am very disappointed but I thought it was a good fight."" Beltran had his first real success in the seventh, when he caught the Scot with a right hand. ""I'm not taking away from his victory but I believe I won the fight."" ""I hope he can take it."" ""You could see it was a really tough fight,"" said Burns. ""He's one of the best at the weight, and one of the best in the world.""",0,566
"Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that, at times, had more than a hint of the improbable. The United manager, who was celebrating his 71st birthday, had said his side were not going to let City's victory at White Hart Lane go unanswered and so it proved in a game that exploded into life in the second half with the champions on top. Yet if Ferguson's side were rampant at the start of the second half, Albion had already shown they could cause the visitors plenty of problems. Indeed, when the sides met at Old Trafford back in August it was the Baggies who opened the scoring and they were a threat again here. The home side, who had not scored a goal in their three previous league games, could have gone in front after 19 minutes when Graham Dorrans fired a left-footed shot just wide of the far post. The same player then saw a 30-yard free-kick rise just over the bar before Peter Odemwingie, who netted twice at Old Trafford, curled a shot just wide of the post after United goalkeeper David De Gea had only just parried the ball away. With United struggling to get into their stride, Albion took the lead in the 28th minute when Jones, who had just lost his marker in a crowded penalty area, fired home a header from Chris Brunt's left-wing corner. But any thoughts of a famous victory were quickly extinguished as United equalised almost immediately. Valencia's deep cross picked out Evra, who produced a marvellous overhead kick to guide the ball past Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster. Rooney was then denied a 26th goal of the season by Foster, before Albion came close to retaking the lead through Paul Scharner's header, which was kept out by a flying De Gea. As it was, the game was turned on its head with two quick goals from United. The first came in the 60th minute when Rooney's pass picked out Nani, who shrugged off the attentions of two Albion defenders to fire home a left-foot shot from the edge of the area. Five minutes later, United struck again when Valencia's cross was headed home by Rooney. The England striker, who was making his first start since the Boxing Day defeat at home to Blackburn, was a constant threat, and the former Everton striker was also instrumental in the build-up to United's fourth goal. Nani's cross was again headed home by Rooney, although his effort was going wide until Scholes diverted the ball home. Ferguson's side then sealed victory when Nani hit a fine shot from 20 yards, and it might have been even worse for Albion had De Gea not been forced to make a fine save to keep out Dorrans' effort. Albion boss Roy Hodgson had no doubts as to who was the better team. ""I think they are a very good team with very good players,"" he said. ""We did very well for a long period but in the second half we conceded three goals very quickly and they could have scored more. ""We didn't do ourselves justice, they were very good, we didn't do badly but when they score three goals in five minutes the game's over and you have to accept it.""",0,567

"Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it had put forward the idea ""reluctantly."" The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500. They are calling for a 10 year cull of around 300 horses a year, with the remaining 1,000 to be relocated. Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it had put forward the idea ""reluctantly."" The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500. The ponies are thought to have been there for hundreds of years. John Allen, the group's chairman, said: ""It's a very difficult and emotive subject to talk about, but we have to be realistic. ""We have a long-term plan, a 10-year plan to reduce the numbers and relocate the ponies to other areas of Dartmoor where they can be better managed. ""We don't want to see any ponies killed, but we think that if we had an agreed policy with the Forestry Commission and National Park, we could cull about 300 ponies a year in a controlled and humane way. ""The horses would be shot by a vet. ""We estimate that if we had that cull for 10 years, we could relocate about 1,000 horses and we would be left with a viable population of about 1,000."" Dartmoor National Park Authority said there were no plans to cull the ponies but it was aware that their numbers had dwindled. A spokesman said: ""The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association has, for some years, maintained a list of ponies which they believe are surplus to the needs of the moor. ""The National Park Authority is fully aware of the need to manage Dartmoor's equine population as the traditional role of the hill pony is no longer viable. ""We are also aware that a cull is a possible and acceptable means of controlling equine numbers in certain circumstances. ""However, a cull would not be appropriate at this time because of the low numbers of equines left on the open moor. ""The authority has no plans to cull any equines on Dartmoor at the present time.""",0,571

"Nick Hardwick said staff shortages, population pressures and prison policy all contributed to problems, with a 69 rise in self-inflicted deaths. The Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence that prison suicide rates were rising. Prison suicides have reached record levels in England and Wales, with 119 prisoners taking their own lives in the 12 months to September 2016. A report by the prisons watchdog, the chief inspector of prisons, said staff shortages, population pressures and prison policy all contributed to the problems. The number of self-inflicted deaths has risen by 69 per cent over the last three years, from 70 in 201213 to 119 in 201516, the report found. Last year was also the highest number of suicides on record, the inspectorate's annual report said. The findings come despite a number of measures to prevent self-inflicted deaths, including the provision of staff training. The report found that suicides were most prevalent in local jails, with 61 deaths, with the 40 young offender institution and child prison deaths the lowest at 11. There were 23 deaths in women's prisons. The high proportion of deaths in local jails was likely to be because they held the most vulnerable and troubled prisoners, the report said. It said there was ""significant concern"" that the number of self-inflicted deaths had risen. Prisons with the highest number of deaths included HMP Chelmsford with eight, HMP Bristol with seven and HMP Birmingham with six. There were six self-inflicted deaths at HMP Winchester, five at HMP Swansea and four at HMP Exeter. The report said: ""The number of self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales has risen to its highest level on record. ""The suicide rate is far higher than in the wider community and is also higher than in most similar countries. ""Historically, and still today, the vast majority of deaths in prison are self-inflicted. ""We have found little evidence that prisons are getting to grips with the causes of self-inflicted deaths despite the recommendations made in coroners' rule 43 reports. The inspectorate's analysis found that prisoners who were white, aged 20 to 29 and serving sentences of less than 12 months were most likely to take their own lives. It found that 50 per cent of those who died had only been in prison for 12 months or less. Some 20 per cent had only been in prison for less than a month and 30 per cent were in prison for less than three months. The report also found that 40 per cent of those who took their own lives had previously been identified as presenting a risk of suicide or self-harm. It said: ""It is clear that the prison system has yet to get to grips with the level of self-inflicted deaths and in particular those of new prisoners. ""The fact that many of those who took their own lives were new prisoners suggests that they were not able to cope in prison and that existing strategies to identify those at risk were not working. ""There is a need for much more effective systems to identify those at risk, which includes asking the right questions at the right time. The inspectorate said it would be issuing a thematic review into self-inflicted deaths in the coming months. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Every death in custody is a tragedy and we are committed to reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in our prisons. ""We are taking urgent action to stabilise the estate and curb violence by addressing the shortage of prison officers and improving safety and security. ""We have also invested 15 million in a safer cells programme and in training and support for our prison officers. ""The prison and probation ombudsman has confirmed that there is no clear evidence that the rate of self-inflicted deaths in prison custody is increasing. A Prison Reform Trust spokesman said: ""The record number of suicides in prisons in England and Wales last year is a crisis that demands urgent action. ""This should start with a moratorium on the use of prison for minor offences, an area where we have seen rapid growth in the use of short custod",0,573
"The force said paedophile hunter activities can hinder investigations and lead to offenders walking free. Det Ch Supt Tom Richards of Kent Police said it also diverts resources away from policing. But Ian Puddick, a former City worker who became a hunter after being falsely accused of harassment by his wife, said it is sometimes the only way to catch offenders. He said police are ""overwhelmed with reports of online child abuse and don't have the resources to investigate all cases."" Mr Puddick, who now works as a consultant in cybersecurity, said the police needed to step up their game and ""get up to speed with technology and work with online vigilantes."" ""They [police] can't be seen to be proactively working with vigilantes so instead of working with them they try to shut them down."" He said he ""makes sure I'm in a public place"" when meeting an alleged predator. ""I tell people where I am going to be, I always have a hidden camera running and have a mobile phone with me at all times."" He added: ""There are some very dangerous people out there."" The force said paedophile hunter activities can hinder investigations and lead to offenders walking free But a spokesman for Kent Police said that while it understands the frustrations of groups and individuals who want to catch potential paedophiles, police operations ""have been jeopardised when individuals have used online identities to arrange to meet people, in an attempt to identify offenders."" The spokesman added: ""In these cases it is the online vigilantes, not those they aim to expose, who could end up in court. ""Those who undertake online 'stings' put themselves in physical danger, and often do not realise they are committing criminal offences themselves and could end up with a criminal record."" Det Ch Supt Richards said police forces are ""working hard to educate children about online safety and make sure that they know how to protect themselves,"" as well as working to prevent offending in the first place through ""early intervention and rehabilitation."" He added: ""We also have dedicated teams of detectives who investigate these offences and bring those responsible to justice. ""This is why it is so important that people don't take matters into their own hands, but report any suspicions they have to the police so we can investigate and ensure that the offender is put before the courts."" The spokesman also said that online vigilantes who expose suspected paedophiles could be prosecuted themselves under a number of offences, including intimidation, assault, and the unlawful disclosure of personal information. In 2015, self-styled paedophile hunter Stinson Hunter was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of assault for a vigilante attack on a former teacher in Newcastle. The judge, Recorder Ben Nolan QC, said he was concerned about the rise of ""self-styled paedophile hunters"" and criticised Hunter's ""vigilante mentality."" The former teacher, who was attacked, was later found not guilty of child grooming and sexual assault. Seven forces in England and Wales were contacted for this story. Only Kent Police responded.

Authorities in Sierra Leone and Liberia are trying to use quarantines to halt the spread of the deadly virus, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa.

"The next public consultation in the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) scheme was due in September but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor Andy Burnham promised to re-run the consultation after a wave of objections to the previous draft. But a senior council source said the delay would give the GMSF team time to develop more detailed policy documents in conjunction with the town halls and prepare a more accurate picture of where new housing could be delivered. The source added that the scheme needed to be based on an 'evidence-based approach' and said that more time was needed to 'get it right'. Earlier this month, the mayor said he wanted to see 'more emphasis' on town centre development in the new strategy and a greater focus on brownfield sites. A spokesperson for the mayor said: 'It is now clear that the GMSF draft has to change if we are going to get a plan for the future of Greater Manchester that people can support and is fit for purpose. 'The mayor has made clear that the next stage of the plan has to take a different approach and the 10 authorities are working together to produce a more evidence-based, up-to-date and realistic plan. 'This includes updating the evidence base, identifying opportunities for town centre development and brownfield land, and the appropriate level of green belt release. 'A new plan will take time to produce and we will not be rushing it. Our aim is to be as thorough as possible and get it right for the long term. 'There is a huge amount of work to be done and it will be released in the summer. 'The mayor is clear that he wants the GMSF to be more ambitious for town centre development and better protect our green belt and communities. 'He is also clear that he wants to work with local residents, developers and local authorities to build a plan for Greater Manchester's future that everyone can support.' A draft GMSF was published last October and proposed 227,000 homes should be built across Greater Manchester by 2035. The current green belt boundary, which covers 52,142 hectares, would be cut by 12.5 per cent to 45,793 hectares to accommodate the housing, under the proposals. Government minister Sajid Javid said he had 'grave concerns' about the GMSF, which he said would 'dramatically cut' Manchester's green belt. Burnham said in June that he intended to scrap the draft GMSF and start again. The AJ revealed in August that Manchester City Council had hired former chief executive Sir Howard Bernstein as a consultant to advise on the GMSF. Architect and urban designer Jonathan Schofield, who is curating a major exhibition at the Museum of Science and Industry on the history of planning in Manchester, said: 'It is no surprise that the GMSF timetable has slipped as there are so many moving parts in the process and so many vested interests. 'People seem to have forgotten that the previous draft GMSF was formulated under the Greater Manchester Association of Chief Executives (AGMA) and was agreed by all 10 councils. It is not something that has dropped out of the sky like the Grand Inquisitor. 'The questions of brownfield sites, housing numbers and green belt have been thrashed out in detail in the last version of the GMSF. It will be interesting to see if a revised GMSF offers something radically different, and what the evidence is to support any change. 'The GMSF is a very ambitious plan, which is why it has been getting such a hard ride.'

"Police initially said that business rivalry was a more likely motive for the attack on the Movida bar restaurant outside Kuala Lumpur on 28 June. They added that two men and a woman have been arrested in the investigation. The woman, who was arrested on Tuesday, had acted as a mediator in a dispute between the businessmen, but later joined her two brothers in the murder plot, police said. Mongolian woman Altantuya Shaariibuu, 28, was shot twice in the head before her body was blown up with military grade explosives. The remains were found scattered in a jungle clearing, 15km from the Malaysian capital. Ms Shaariibuu had been involved in negotiations over a purchase of French submarines worth US1.14bn. The deal was between Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Razak and French submarine maker DCNS. Mr Najib has denied any links to the murder. The police said they had also seized a gun and a car in which the three suspects had travelled to the site of the murder. Police chief Mohammed Bakri Omar told the Star newspaper the three were being investigated for premeditated murder. ""There is a possibility that they have committed other murders,"" he said. The case has been a focus of intense public interest in Malaysia, with many linking the victim to the country's political elite. Ms Shaariibuu is believed to have had a relationship with one of Mr Najib's aides, Abdul Razak Baginda, who was detained for questioning last week. He has since been released. Mr Razak has denied any wrongdoing. A French lawyer for Ms Shaariibuu's family, William Bourdon, said his clients believed that the Malaysian authorities were not willing to investigate the case thoroughly. Ms Shaariibuu's father, Shaariibuu Setev, told the BBC he would only be happy if the Malaysian government handed over the case to an international tribunal. ""I am not satisfied with the way this case is being handled by the Malaysian government,"" he said. Ms Shaariibuu had been trying to get a commission she claimed was owed to her for her help in brokering the deal between Mr Razak and DCNS. The case is also threatening to derail the defence deal, which is being handled by a French state-owned company. A French government spokesman said on Wednesday that the investigation into the murder would not affect the submarine purchase, which was expected to be approved in coming months.",0,578

"Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared from near a farmhouse in Iraklis on 24 July 1991. The site, which is 750m from where he was last seen, was searched by his family and friends during the week after his disappearance, but to no avail. Ben's family had been living in the village of Iraklis, about 20km south of the island's main town of Chania, at the time of his disappearance. His father, Neil, was working there as a dive instructor. The site, which has been searched twice before by South Yorkshire Police, is just a few hundred metres from a taverna, where it is thought Ben may have been headed. During the week before the new search began, specialist teams from South Yorkshire Police, along with the South Yorkshire Fire Rescue Service and officers from Crete, began surveying the area with sonar equipment, to produce a detailed map of the area. The search began on Monday 21 May 2012 and was expected to last five days. It was undertaken by members of the Greek specialist rescue team EMAK and the South Yorkshire Police underwater search team. The search team used specially trained search dogs to sniff out possible areas of interest for further searches by officers and specialist sniffer dogs. Neil and Christine Needham have spent the last 20 years trying to find out what happened to their son and have come to Crete every year to search for him. During this time, more than 40 locations have been searched by police officers and volunteers from South Yorkshire Police and Greece. Following the end of the search, Detective Inspector Jon Cousins from South Yorkshire Police said: ""Over the last few days we have carried out a detailed search of the area with the assistance of specialist teams from Greece. ""The terrain is very difficult to search, with many caves, sink holes and gullies to investigate.

Four weeks later, Mr Ewing developed a severe infection in his legs and arms and was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for treatment. He was then transferred to Leicester Royal Infirmary where he died on 23 January 2010. Mr Ewing's family contacted specialist medical negligence solicitors Irwin Mitchell to investigate the care he received at Kettering General Hospital. Investigations by Irwin Mitchell's specialist medical negligence team found that Mr Ewing had been on aspirin before he was transferred to Kettering General Hospital. However, when he arrived at the hospital it took five hours for him to receive his first dose of aspirin. This was a missed opportunity to treat Mr Ewing's heart attack. Mr Ewing's family were devastated by his death and took legal action against the hospital to discover the truth about what happened to him. The hospital admitted that the delay in giving Mr Ewing aspirin was a missed opportunity to treat his heart attack and that this may have contributed to his death. Mr Ewing's family have now received an undisclosed settlement to help them come to terms with their loss.

The report by a team of doctors and legal experts led by the former president of the General Medical Council, Prof. Sir Michael Rawlins, will say that doctors are failing to follow the 2005 guidelines which say that ""the responsibility for making the decision to start, and subsequently to continue, the process of nutrition and hydration rests with the clinical team"" and that relatives should be involved. The review team was asked to examine the use of tube feeding in patients in a permanent vegetative state or minimally conscious state. It is expected to recommend that tube feeding should only be given to patients with such conditions if the clinical team and relatives are in agreement that it is in the patient's best interests. One in five of the 20,000 people who are admitted to intensive care units in England each year have a serious brain injury. If they are diagnosed as having a permanent vegetative state, doctors will often recommend withdrawing food and fluids if there is agreement with relatives. The practice of withdrawing tube feeding and fluids is legal in Britain and is sanctioned by the professional body for doctors, the General Medical Council, but the report is expected to recommend that new guidance is needed. The review team will say that the withdrawal of tube feeding is an ethical minefield which has caused problems for doctors and nurses who may disagree with relatives about the best interests of a patient. The issue is expected to be discussed at a conference on medical ethics at the Royal Society of Medicine on Thursday. David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist at City Hospital, Birmingham, will tell the conference: ""There are profound disagreements about these issues within the medical profession and between the medical profession and families."" He said the review's recommendations were unlikely to resolve the issue. But Baroness Ilora Finlay, a leading consultant in palliative medicine, said that a revised approach to the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration would ""provide more clarity for clinical teams and greater protection for patients."" The 2005 guidance says that ""nutrition and hydration, whether by oral, enteral or parenteral routes, should not be provided to patients who are able to take food and drink by mouth, but refuse to do so."" But Baroness Finlay said: ""The report will argue that, while the current guidelines are ethically robust and legally defensible, they do not give sufficient guidance as to how and when the guidelines should be implemented."" The report has been sent to the Department of Health and is expected to be published within the next few weeks. A spokesman for the department said that ministers would consider the findings ""very carefully."" Previous articleBallot boxes and bullet boxes Next articleWill Egypt Become a Democracy?",0,589
"Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over PS600m in 2014 to only PS55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from PS500m in 2014 to a mere PS13m last year. As a result, Aberdeen is now a ""fallen angel"" in terms of attractiveness to investors, according to the global property firm. Figures from CBRE have also shown that occupier demand in Aberdeen fell by a quarter in 2016, while the city's office supply exceeded demand by 33 per cent in the year to the end of June 2016. Knight Frank said in its report: ""Investment volumes in Aberdeen have declined sharply over the past two years, with the value of transactions down from PS600m in 2014 to PS55m in 2016. ""Aberdeen has always been a fairly illiquid market, particularly in the office sector where investment volumes have traditionally been low, but the lack of interest in 2016 suggests that, in the current climate, Aberdeen is becoming a 'fallen angel'. ""Occupier demand is likely to remain subdued for the foreseeable future, with any upturn in the office market dependent on the oil price and the wider fortunes of the energy sector. ""Investment volumes are likely to remain muted over the next 12 months but could be boosted by the sale of the Pitfodels House office campus, which has been put on the market for sale. ""The property could attract investor interest from a number of sectors, including PRS and the hotel market, as well as office occupiers. ""The projected sale of the site should at least generate some interest in the Aberdeen market. ""Any evidence of oil prices stabilising and the wider energy market picking up is likely to lead to an improvement in occupier demand and investment volumes. Earlier this month, commercial property investment firm Hansteen Holdings reported a PS166.4m loss for the year to the end of December as it wrote down the value of its portfolio in the north-east.

"The 28-year-old has scored 37 goals in 98 appearances since joining the Lions from non-league Halifax in 2014.

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Mumbai Indians (MI) will be playing against each other for the first time in this season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). While they did not register a win in their previous encounter against RCB, they did show that they have the firepower in their batting line-up to defend any score. During a panel discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, United States, on Tuesday, the outspoken billionaire was asked by Bloomberg anchor Stephanie Ruhle to explain what exactly he meant by that. The Brewers are in the midst of a three-game series with the Reds this week. The Brewers-Reds series has added significance for Milwaukee, which entered Tuesday with a half-game lead over the Cubs in the National League Central. His second set was much more of a rollercoaster. After breaking for a 4-1 lead, he lost three games in a row. It was a straight-set victory for Djokovic in his first match since March, and he'll look to keep up the momentum against Dominic Thiem in the second round on Wednesday. The Celtics have the number one pick in the upcoming National Basketball Association draft, which they received from the Brooklyn Nets in a trade several years ago. The Celtics have been linked to Fultz for some time and now look certain to take him at number one. With the Celtics already giving Brad Stevens the keys to the franchise, and with Fultz's leadership qualities, this could be the beginning of a special Celtics era. At this point, the Wizards have to feel pretty confident going into Friday night's Game 6. If the Celtics go on to win the series, the Cavs will have to wait a little longer for their next opponent. He's not the only one. ""They're a lot better, so we have to be better."" The Cavaliers were 6-for-26 (23.1 percent) on 3-pointers. ""Even though it's 3-1, it's still the playoffs,"" Olynyk said. Rookie sensation, Milwaukee Bucks' Malcolm Brogdon has been named the 2016-17 NBA Rookie of the Year. Dario Saric, who was the Rookie of the Month for both April and March, finished in third place in the voting. The 2017 NBA Awards will be the first time the league has handed out their own awards. The NBA All-Rookie First and Second Teams were also revealed. So, what happened on the first tee? ""I don't know, I've never seen that before."" Things were so bad that a tee time was adjusted to allow two groups to tee off at the same time just to try and get the players through the front nine before the day was out. Everything is not alright with the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers are on the verge of elimination and the Celtics are on the verge of the NBA Finals. The Celtics had 18 offensive rebounds to the Cavs' 15, and they outscored the Cavs 17-7 on second-chance points. Earlier in the day, Venus Williams defeated Japan's Kurumi Nara in straight sets to reach the second round of the tournament. The last set, I think, he played good tennis. ""The last few matches I played against him, he was really very aggressive from the first point, so I was expecting the same."" ""I was a bit sad after the first match, because I lost against a player that I lost also in Monte Carlo,"" Nadal said. The Rangers had a few good chances in the second period , but they also had to kill off a four-minute penalty that began with a high-sticking call on Chris Kreider .

"Their lawyers had asked the court to declare ""unlawful"" the consultation process that led to the proposed axing of the PS320m fund. The five are among 19,000 people who receive payments from the disability living allowance (DLA) fund. The case was rejected by a judge in the High Court in Belfast yesterday. Lawyers for the five claimants had argued that the proposed cuts were in breach of the UK's Equality Act and would have a ""disproportionate and adverse impact"" on disabled people. Mr Justice Treacy dismissed the case but said there was a ""strong public interest"" in the issues being considered further. He refused to grant leave to appeal against the decision but said the claimants were entitled to make a direct appeal to the Court of Appeal. Among the five claimants were 13-year-old Kirsty McCullough and 17-year-old Cahal Carvill, who are both wheelchair-users and rely on the allowance. The three other claimants were Jonathan Lewis, who has cerebral palsy, Sarah McCaffrey, who has a learning disability, and 69-year-old John Kelly, who is a full-time wheelchair user and has had three strokes. Campaigners claimed the move to axe the fund was the ""tip of the iceberg"" for disabled people in the province. Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said: ""The decision to scrap the DLA funding was announced with a total lack of consultation and in a manner which was insensitive and insulting to the needs and requirements of people with disabilities. ""Sinn Fein will continue to support those who are affected by this decision and will seek to have it reversed."" The Department of Health has insisted the funding cut was not an attack on disabled people. A spokesman said: ""The fund is being ended because it is no longer needed, as these benefits are now a matter for the new Northern Ireland Executive."" The DLA fund was set up in 1993 when direct rule ministers in the province decided to pay allowances to people who were severely disabled, but not unemployed, in the absence of a Stormont Assembly.",0,592
"The Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, held 47 trillion (PS30tn) in private wealth last year as the number of new millionaires rose in China and India. North America is the world's largest region for private wealth, with US34.3tn. It was followed by Western Europe with US22tn. The Asia-Pacific region is also set to post the biggest growth in the next five years, with a projected 12 compounded annual growth rate, while the US will see its wealth grow at 7 CAGR, according to a report from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The BCG report found that while China had the largest growth in the number of millionaires with 480,000 new millionaires, India was not far behind with 340,000 new millionaires. Indonesia and Thailand also showed strong growth in their number of millionaires. India and Indonesia are also poised to see their number of millionaires grow by 7.2 and 7.3 respectively in the next five years, the report found. The global private wealth market stood at US106tn in 2008, but fell to US93tn in 2009 following the global economic crisis, the BCG report said. The market is now expected to grow by a CAGR of 7.2 to US145tn in 2014, according to the report. ""In our view, the increase in private wealth will continue to be fuelled by a number of trends,"" the BCG report said. ""These include the recovery of global financial markets, the rapid growth of emerging markets, an improving outlook for developed economies, and the creation of wealth from new sources of entrepreneurship.""

"The club's latest accounts, for the year ending May 2014, also show the Bluebirds owe around PS174m - most of it to owner Vincent Tan. This was despite revenue increasing to PS34.5m from PS27.5m. The Bluebirds' loss of PS17m came after a PS19m loss the previous year. Cardiff said the loss arose from the fact their revenue increased by only PS7m while their wage bill rose by PS21m following promotion to the Premier League. A statement from Cardiff said: ""Following promotion to the Premier League in 201213, the club's turnover has increased to PS34.5m.

"The team discovered a set of 12,000-year-old Ice Age stone tools while excavating Rubha Port an t-Seilich, on Islay in the Inner Hebrides. The tools included scrapers used for cleaning animal skins, sharp points used for hunting large game and axes used to fell trees or cut up carcasses. Professor Nick Barton, Director of the project, said: ""There are hundreds of tools on the site, and a very rich sequence spanning about 2,000 years. It looks as though the site was a stone tool production site during the earlier period, and was used as a hunting stand later on. This is a fantastic discovery which will give us new insights into the first Scots."" Scottish Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism Fergus Ewing said: ""This is an incredible discovery, which helps us to better understand the people who once lived on our islands, and how their lifestyle fitted in with the landscape and natural resources. This excavation is a great example of how the historic environment can contribute to the local and national economy, attracting visitors and creating local employment."" The team is now trying to identify the exact species of animals hunted by the tool-makers. Finds include horse bones and teeth, which may have come from hunted animals or scavenged carcasses, while DNA analysis of dog bones from the site suggests that the tool-makers may have used dogs to help with the hunt. Professor Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University said: ""The site is one of the most exciting early prehistoric sites that I have ever excavated. It's quite exceptional."" The team believes that the site may have been used by some of Scotland's earliest settlers. Dr Andrew MacGregor, Historic Scotland Head of Archaeology, said: ""This is an amazing discovery. At this time Scotland was an Arctic wilderness as the last ice age was ending, and this site is one of the best records of how people adapted to this harsh environment.""

"He was speaking after crowds in Tehran cheered negotiators who had agreed to curb some of Iran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. The six-month interim deal agreed in Geneva was the most significant breakthrough in years in curbing Tehran's nuclear ambitions and halting a decade of rising tension between Iran and the West. The agreement appeared to be a victory for Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in June on promises to ease the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy and to repair the Islamic Republic's image abroad. It could also have significant implications for Iran's relations with the West and other oil exporters in the region, where the prospect of increased Iranian fuel exports could drive down prices. Rouhani said the agreement recognised Iran's nuclear rights and would lead to the lifting of sanctions that have cut Iran's oil exports in half and more than halved its access to oil revenues to about 100 billion a year since 2011. ""We showed them that we, too, will not give in to pressure ... We will give up part of our (nuclear) rights in order to pave the way for future relations and for future negotiations,"" he said in a television interview. Rouhani also said the agreement provided for the United States and European Union to remove all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran at the end of the six-month period. Under the interim accord, Iran agreed to limit uranium enrichment to 5 percent, a level that would be sufficient for power generation but that would make it difficult to convert to highly enriched uranium suitable for a bomb. Iran also agreed to halt work on a heavy water reactor in Arak, one of the most controversial parts of its nuclear programme, which could provide a potential second path to a nuclear weapon using plutonium. In return, Western powers will lift sanctions on a number of sectors of Iran's economy, including auto, aviation and petrochemicals. They also agreed to release some of Iran's frozen assets and pledged not to impose new nuclear-related sanctions for six months. ""We have promised that after six months, if the other side has honoured its commitments, we will take another step to go along with them,"" Rouhani said. ""We will do it step by step. We will not cross any red line."" The agreement was welcomed with an eruption of cheers in Tehran, where crowds gathered to celebrate. ""It is the first time that I feel happy about Iran's foreign policy. I hope it will get even better in the future,"" said Massoumeh Ahmadpour, 35, a civil servant. Another Tehran resident, Alireza Khodarahmi, 27, said: ""I am happy that the nuclear issue has been settled. I am really happy that the economic situation in Iran is going to improve."" While Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticised the agreement, some Gulf Arab states were circumspect in their response, mindful of the prospect of a partial rapprochement between Tehran and Washington. In a statement, Saudi Arabia said it hoped any deal would prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, suggesting it was not yet convinced this was the case. Bahrain, a close Saudi ally which has long accused Iran of fomenting unrest among its Shi'ite majority, also welcomed the agreement, but said it should not be at the expense of international efforts to curb Iran's nuclear activities. The UAE, another key U.S. ally in the Gulf, simply welcomed the agreement without further comment. The United States and its allies fear that Iran has been using its civilian nuclear energy programme as a cover to develop nuclear weapons capability. Tehran denies this, saying the programme is solely for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity. The agreement will allow a gradual easing of the sanctions that have crippled Iran's oil-dependent economy, although most sanctions will remain in place. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the agreement would allow Iran to keep its existing enrichment capacity. ""The structure of all of our nuclear programme will remain ... Our centrifuges will continue to spin,"" he told Iran's Press TV. Iran has a major financial interest in seeing sanctions lifted. The country has been subjected to successive rounds of sanctions since 2006 that have cut its oil exports",0,599
"The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the west. South Korea is the frontrunner in the growth of graduates, with their numbers set to almost triple between 2000 and 2025. China, India and Indonesia are not far behind. The US is expected to maintain its lead over Europe, but the gap between the two regions is expected to narrow by 2025. Andrew Harrop, of the thinktank Demos, said: ""The economic power of the traditional western world is shifting eastwards. The UK has some of the best universities in the world, but we can't afford to be complacent. We need to make sure our higher education system has what it takes to compete with the best in the world. That means a rigorous focus on teaching quality and a student-centred system that promotes choice, value for money and diversity."" The OECD's figures predict that in 2025 the UK will have 136 graduates per 100 people of working age, compared with 126 in 2000. Germany, which was at 107 in 2000, is predicted to reach 140 in 2025, while the US will rise from 111 to 142. The OECD average is expected to rise from 108 in 2000 to 130 in 2025. The UK's rise is partly driven by government plans to boost the number of students attending university. In 2007, ministers announced that universities would be able to take an unlimited number of students with A-level grades ABB and above. The government wants 50 of school-leavers to go to university, and is introducing higher tuition fees and a new loans system from this year. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: ""We are committed to widening participation in higher education and increasing the numbers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The white paper will set out in more detail our plans to achieve this."" The OECD report, Education at a Glance 2010, says that over the next 15 years, higher education enrolment rates will increase in all OECD countries, though the rise in some will be more rapid than in others. Along with the UK and Germany, Greece, Italy and Canada are all predicted to experience a rise of 10 or more. In the US, the OECD says, more than 40 of the working-age population will have a tertiary education by 2025, the highest proportion in the OECD area, followed by Canada and Japan. In the EU, 25 of young adults in the Netherlands and Denmark already have a tertiary-level education, compared with 20 in the UK. In Italy and Spain, the figure is 11. The OECD says: ""A clear message emerges from these projections: educational attainment continues to rise but the speed of the increase will be slower than in the past. This is mainly because of a declining share of young people in the population, and partly because of a slowing down of the rate of growth of participation in tertiary education. ""The rise in educational attainment will, however, continue to be accompanied by a shift in the balance of fields of study as more students enter business, administration and law, and fewer enter engineering, manufacturing and construction.""",0,600

"Kaori Okuni, one of the women campaigning for change, said the ruling would lead to ""suffering for those who plan to marry and those who are set to be born."" ""I would like to see the country's constitution protect same-sex couples in the future,"" said Ms Okuni, who has lived with her same-sex partner for 10 years and is now campaigning for the same-sex couples to be allowed to marry. In the same-sex marriage case, a district court in Tokyo rejected a request by three couples to be legally married and one of them, represented by lawyer Masao Oka, said they would appeal. But the judge, Hitoshi Hashizume, said same-sex marriage was illegal under the constitution. ""I think it is unreasonable,"" he said, ""and therefore violates the constitution, to say the only way to achieve that (peace of mind) is for same-sex couples to be allowed to marry."" He said that the government must recognise same-sex couples as legal entities and that some local governments had already begun to do so. Campaigners in Tokyo said they were disappointed. ""The ruling is an insult to those people living in same-sex relationships,"" said Akane Matsuoka, from the campaign group Marriage for all Japan. ""The judge went to lengths to explain the current status of our country, where same-sex couples cannot marry, but he did not understand that we are working to change that. ""He failed to understand that the country has changed and there are many who think the same-sex couples should be allowed to marry."" Gay marriage is currently only legal in 28 countries worldwide, and Taiwan became the first in Asia to legalise it in May 2019. But Japan is often described as a ""conservative country"" and the country has a very low level of public support for gay marriage - a poll in 2015 by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only 39 of Japanese supported same-sex marriage, compared with 61 in the US. The issue of same-sex marriage is not widely debated in Japan and some campaigners complain of a lack of media coverage. But in recent years, there has been a steady rise in support for the LGBT community. In 2017, an LGBT-themed manga comic about a gay couple and their life in Japan became a bestseller, and there are now LGBT districts in major cities where same-sex couples are openly affectionate with one another. In 2018, a politician from the governing LDP made history by ""coming out"" as gay in parliament, and many hope that this will lead to a shift in attitudes. Same-sex marriage is legal in Australia, New Zealand and parts of the United States. In Asia, Taiwan became the first country to legalise gay marriage in May 2019.",0,602
"The aircraft, nicknamed ""Bette"" after one of its pilot's girlfriends, was built in 1941 from donations from the Borough of Lambeth Spitfire Fund. It was stationed in Cornwall, Hampshire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire, and flew many missions over France and Germany. In 1945, the plane was scrapped in a Lincolnshire quarry. The plane was a Mark VB with registration number EP120 and was built by Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd. The plane was equipped with a Rolls Royce Merlin engine and had a top speed of 362 miles per hour. It was armed with eight .303 machine guns and two 20mm cannons. Another notable item from the Spitfire is the propeller, which is made of wood. This is because the English had a shortage of metal during the war, so they had to use whatever materials they had available. The propeller was also made of laminated spruce and birch plywood covered with a thin layer of birch. This aircraft was excavated in 1991, and was not restored until 2004.

"The Academy Selsey suffered extensive damage and much of its contents was destroyed in the blaze on 21 August. The school's 453 pupils are currently being taught at four locations in and around Chichester. An initial crowdfunding campaign was set up by Bunn Leisure on behalf of the Academy, with a total of 31,739 being raised in the space of just six days. A new JustGiving page has now been set up to continue the fundraising drive, with the target set at 20,000. The money will be used to purchase much needed resources to aid the delivery of teaching to pupils following the fire, which is believed to have been started deliberately. The funds raised will be managed by the Selsey Academy Trust on behalf of the school, with the JustGiving page being monitored by Bunn Leisure. Bunn Leisure's Head of Marketing and PR, Tom Dabell, said: ""We are delighted to see that the fundraising campaign has been so successful in such a short space of time.

"Figures shared with 5 live Investigates by the charity RoadPeace reveal a 23 drop in prosecutions in England and Wales in the five years to 2015. In the same period, the number of people killed on the roads rose by 33 to 1,782. It comes as the Government is considering raising the maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving from 14 years to life. Alongside RoadPeace, the family of Noreen Lawler, who was killed by a dangerous driver, is calling on the government to do more to make sure the courts are able to act decisively and hand down appropriate sentences. Noreen, 54, was killed on 12 March 2011, when the car she was travelling in was hit by a stolen BMW being driven at high speed along the wrong side of the road. The car had been stolen just a few minutes earlier by a group of young men who were joyriding. The driver of the car was 17-year-old Declan Brennan. He had been banned from driving just six months earlier and had a history of road traffic convictions. Brennan pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was given a four-year custodial sentence. Noreen's daughter Clare is still coming to terms with her mother's death. ""No sentence will bring my mother back, but the sentence he got was just an insult to us as a family. He was in prison for 18 months and then he was out. He can live his life but we have to live our lives without our mum. It's not just a physical sentence, it's a life sentence. ""We're missing out on so much. My mum's never going to see her grandkids grow up. ""The sentence that he got was an insult and I want the government to do something about it and bring in longer sentences. If they bring in longer sentences then there'll be more of a deterrent for people to think before they get behind the wheel of a car."" Clare is now supporting a campaign by RoadPeace, a charity which supports people bereaved by bad driving, for a change to the law. Mary Williams OBE, chief executive of the charity, says the current maximum sentence of 14 years for causing death by dangerous driving is ""derisory."" ""The last time this sentence was increased was in 2004 and it was increased from ten years to 14 years,"" she says. ""We want it to be increased to a life sentence. ""We believe that the message needs to be got across to the public that this is not a minor offence. If you kill someone by dangerous driving you could spend the rest of your life in prison."" The charity's figures, obtained by 5 live Investigates, show that the number of drivers prosecuted for causing death by dangerous driving in England and Wales has fallen from 321 in 2010 to 250 in 2015 - a drop of 23. In the same period, the number of people killed on the roads rose from 1,353 to 1,782 - an increase of 33. Ms Williams said it's ""shocking"" that so few people are being prosecuted, while the number of people being killed on the roads is increasing. The number of people being prosecuted for causing death by careless driving has also fallen. In 2010, 439 drivers were prosecuted in England and Wales. In 2015, that number fell to 348 - a drop of 21. The maximum sentence for causing death by careless driving is five years. ""We believe there is a significant under-prosecution of people who kill and seriously injure on the roads,"" says Ms Williams. ""People are being prosecuted for causing death by careless driving who should be prosecuted for causing death by dangerous driving. ""There's a failure by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to understand the difference between careless driving and dangerous driving."" 5 live Investigates has discovered that prosecutions for causing death by dangerous driving in England and Wales have fallen by 23 in the past five years In the same period the number of people killed on the roads rose by 33 to 1,782 The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years, RoadPeace is campaigning for this to be increased to life 5 live Investigates has seen figures which suggest there has",0,606

""For someone with Down syndrome, caring for a person with dementia can present a much greater challenge than it does for most other families."" Stem cells have been used in a clinical trial for the first time in the UK to treat stroke patients. The first two patients have been treated as part of a trial which will involve a total of 12 people. One patient had a stroke six years ago and is still recovering. He said he was ""prepared to try anything to get better."" ""It may not work, but it may make a big difference."" The trial at the Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, will enrol six people with chronic stroke and six with transient ischaemic attack (TIA). A stroke is caused by a clot or bleeding in the brain, causing brain cells to become damaged or die. Patients are usually treated with clot-busting drugs or thrombolysis to try to restore blood supply to the brain immediately. In the trial, patients' own stem cells are being injected into the damaged area of their brain. The hope is that the stem cells will help to repair damage by generating new cells.

""He's someone who's interested in opening up space to the masses. He's a catalyst for space travel becoming more mainstream."" Scientists said the commercialisation of space travel could help the UK retain its position as a world leader in space research. ""The UK has had a strong presence in space research for years,"" said Dr Williams. ""We've got a big industry here and some of the best minds in the world. ""But the government needs to put a lot of money into space research. I'm hoping this announcement will be a catalyst for that.""

"The research, by William C Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Youyou Tu, has led to drugs to treat diseases affecting more than 3.4 billion people around the world. One of them, an antiparasitic agent, is so effective it has led to the near eradication of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. William C Campbell, an Irish-born parasitologist, shared half of the prize with Omura, a Japanese microbiologist and chemist, for their work developing avermectin, a derivative of which has been used to treat hundreds of millions of people with river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, or elephantiasis. The other half of the prize was shared by Tu, a Chinese chemist, for her work discovering artemisinin, a drug that has slashed malaria death rates. The first sign of progress came in 1974, when Omura, working at the Kitasato Institute in Japan, found a compound, avermectin, that had a strong effect against roundworms and other parasites. Campbell, then at Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey, found that a modified version of the compound, ivermectin, proved effective in rats, mice and dogs, and could be taken by mouth rather than by injection. Ivermectin was approved for use in humans in 1987, and has since had a dramatic effect. More than 18 million people, mainly in Africa, have been treated for river blindness, the World Health Organisation says. Lymphatic filariasis, which can cause major swelling of the legs and genitals, has been all but eradicated in many countries. Tu began her work on malaria in the 1960s at the Beijing Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Her initial goal was to find a treatment for malaria in children. But in the 1970s, during the Cultural Revolution, she was sent to a rural area to work as a barefoot doctor. There she saw many patients suffering from malaria, and was determined to find a cure. Her research, which involved studying traditional herbal remedies, led to the isolation of a compound from the sweet wormwood plant that was effective in treating malaria. Tu and her colleagues spent years modifying the compound to improve its effectiveness and reduce its toxicity. Tu, who is 84, said she was delighted to receive the prize. ""I never thought I would receive the Nobel Prize. The Chinese government has been very supportive of me and my work. I would also like to thank the traditional Chinese medicine community,"" she told the official Xinhua news agency. The winners will share a prize of 8m Swedish kronor (688,000). The Nobel prizes for physics, chemistry and economics will be announced later this week, with the peace prize to come on Friday. The date is marked annually by a ceremony and banquet in Stockholm.

It will be overlooked by a new 150-seat restaurant and a sky bar on the 55th floor. Work is due to start on the site, which is opposite the Piccadilly railway station, in 2021. Owen Street was originally called Jackson's Row, after James Jackson, a successful merchant and mayor of Manchester in 1796. Jackson's Row was a narrow, steep, cobbled thoroughfare that ran up to the Town Hall from the market place. The street was demolished in 1848, in order to build a new Town Hall and was renamed to Owen Street. The Old Town Hall was built on part of the street site in . Further north, part of the site became the Old Police Station, built in 1879. It was used as the Manchester Town Hall for 80 years, until the present Town Hall was built on Albert Square in 1877. The building was partly destroyed during the Blitz of 1940, and a modern building was constructed within the 19th century facade. It was used as the Central Police Station for Manchester from 1879 until the 1970s. The station was rebuilt after the war and again in the 1970s. The Old Town Hall and Police Station are now part of the Manchester Central convention complex. The site was also the location for the first Manchester Royal Infirmary from .

But Leicester were given hope when Jamie Vardy's penalty reduced the deficit and he then pounced after Virgil van Dijk's flick-on to level. Liverpool, who had chances to win the game in the closing stages, suffered a fifth defeat of the campaign. Liverpool's players reacted with frustration and anger at the full-time whistle, and with good reason as this was the fifth time they have lost a lead in the Premier League this season. The Reds were in control for long periods of this match, and should have been out of sight before Leicester even had a sniff at goal. Xherdan Shaqiri replaced the injured Georginio Wijnaldum and for a while the Swiss international added a spark, but his final ball let him down and he was replaced by Fabinho after 70 minutes. The Brazilian was even more wasteful and his failure to create anything in the closing stages was costly. Reds will rue not taking chances Liverpool were in control of this game but they should have been out of sight before Leicester's second-half comeback. They dominated the opening 45 minutes, creating several chances and they should have had more than the one goal they did have at the interval. Firmino was guilty of a glaring miss after a wonderful pass from Milner, while Sadio Mane also spurned a glorious chance. When you are on top, you have to take advantage, but the Reds couldn't and it came back to haunt them. Fans have right to be angry Liverpool supporters have every right to be angry after this result. They paid 59 a ticket for this game and they will have left feeling shortchanged. Anfield should have been rocking after the Reds took a two-goal lead, but their euphoria soon turned to anger as they saw their side allow Leicester to battle back. The home crowd was pretty subdued for the final 15 minutes, but that changed when the full-time whistle sounded. They were quick to show their anger, booing their side off at the final whistle, and their frustration was understandable as they saw two points slip away. Foxes deserve credit This was not a case of Leicester deservedly coming back to take a point. They were poor for much of this game and failed to create anything in the opening 45 minutes, but they still managed to get back in the game. The Foxes were never out of it, though, and their quality showed in the final stages. They have been dragged into the relegation battle by the loss of their key players in January, but it would be a major surprise if they don't beat the drop. Man of the match - Jamie Vardy The Leicester striker was a constant threat, especially in the second half, and he scored twice. The first goal, a penalty, was far from convincing, but his finish for the equaliser was quality. This was a game that could have gone either way, but Liverpool will be kicking themselves. They dominated the first half, but they failed to take advantage. Leicester grew in confidence after the break and their comeback was no more than they deserved. They will now be looking up the table, rather than over their shoulders. Jurgen Klopp: ""I'm really disappointed. We were the better team. We played good football. We had chances, but we didn't finish. It's a game we should have won. ""It's a game we should have controlled. Leicester got confidence from our goalkeeper making a save from Vardy and then the penalty. After that, they played the long balls, the second balls and stuff like that. ""We lost the ball in the wrong moments. We can play better than we did. In the first half we played really good football. We played better than Leicester. The second half was wild."" Craig Shakespeare: ""They're a good side, but we stood up to the challenge and we had a belief that we could get back in the game. ""I'm delighted for the players. We've been in a difficult situation, but there's some light at the end of the tunnel. ""It was always going to be a difficult game. We rode our luck at times,",0,619
"The 28-year-old footballer's contract was terminated hours after he was dropped for Saturday's Premier League match against Manchester United. He will stand trial on Friday on two further counts of assaulting a woman. He is expected to be sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday after being found guilty of assault. The court heard he would be facing a jail sentence, possibly suspended, and said he was concerned about the effect on his partner, who was pregnant with their second child. The 30-year-old then failed to appear at Stoke Magistrates' Court on Tuesday to enter his plea, which he had been due to do at a hearing in the morning. Both men were drinking throughout the evening. Evans was told he must sign on the sex offenders register. A Stoke City spokesman said: ""The club wishes to make it clear that the termination of the contract was not in any way inconsistent with its earlier stated position."" The 23-year-old was also found guilty of assault and handed a six month sentence suspended for 12 months. Sheffield United are on the verge of signing Evans after the former Wales worldwide saw his Stoke contract terminated on Friday. Evans was found not guilty of rape at a trial in April previous year. The footballer was found not guilty of rape at a retrial previous year but he was convicted of a lesser charge of sexual assault. The former Manchester City trainee played for Sheffield United between 2009 and 2015, making 130 appearances, before leaving for Chesterfield. ""Sheffield United have had to consider the most hard of decisions."" The 28-year-old was released by Stoke City on Friday morning after the Championship club severed his contract following a series of damaging headlines. The decision to terminate the player's contract was made by the club's owners and directors. Ms Caitlin Roper, spokesperson for Women's Aid, a charity which supports abused women and children, said: ""While we respect the court's decision, we remain concerned about the message this sends out to victims of sexual offences and anyone else who has suffered domestic abuse."" The Football Association said the 28-year-old must serve half of the sentence before he can resume his career. Evans was on trial alongside fellow Blades player and friend Clayton McDonald, who was found not guilty.",0,620
"She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet. It had been a 'difficult week' she admitted, an understatement if ever there was one. 'I got it wrong. I am sorry. And I am learning from this,' she said, in the most humble manner we have yet seen from this proud and unbending of politicians. The media and the public were looking for a show of contrition from the beleaguered leader, and she duly delivered. This was the first time she had admitted she had made a mistake, and for the Conservatives, for whom the pursuit of power is the only real goal, this was an important step. Her place at the top of the Tory party is secure. As usual, the Chancellor Philip Hammond did not disappoint, and he came out with his most bizarre analogy yet. He compared the Prime Minister to Winston Churchill, noting that Churchill was the first person to recognise the threat from Hitler, and that he was also in a minority in the House of Commons on the issue. It was true, Hammond said, that Churchill had 'the lonely furrow to plough' but he was not alone for long. And just like Churchill, May is having to manage a divided party, a party that is determined to 'fight on' as they face up to the prospect of defeat and humiliation. But the Prime Minister has a rather different relationship with her party. When she stood up at the Tory conference last year and announced that she was going to call a general election, the party roared with approval. When she took the stage in Manchester this week, the party bellowed with disdain. She was there to announce a 'new' Tory social policy, one that is designed to appeal to a new generation of voters, as well as try to win back those that have deserted the party in the last few years. There were promises of more money for the NHS, an end to the public sector pay freeze, and a cap on energy prices. And there was a determination to tackle the 'everyday injustices' suffered by those 'just about managing'. But despite the new rhetoric, her speech was notable for what was not said. There was no mention of the 'Northern Powerhouse', a policy that was close to the heart of George Osborne, but has been dropped by his successor. And there was no mention of the 'dementia tax', or indeed the 'triple lock' on pensions. She also did not talk about the social care crisis, or what the government was planning to do to alleviate the situation. She did not talk about the 'difficult week', or about the 'deal' that she had done with the DUP. And she did not talk about the Grenfell Tower disaster, or how the government planned to respond to the tragedy. Instead she talked about the need to address the housing crisis, by building more homes, and on the need to give young people the skills that they need to flourish in the modern economy. She talked about how the government would create a 'fairer Britain', one that would work for everyone, not just a privileged few. And she talked about how the Conservatives would protect the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. She talked about the need to challenge the ideology of Islamic extremism, and how the government planned to address the issue of migration. And she talked about the need to 'come together' and deliver a good Brexit deal for the UK. But in reality, she could have been talking about anything. After all, these are issues that could have come from the Labour or Lib Dem manifesto, and indeed many of the things she was talking about had already been announced by the previous Labour government. It was a speech that was meant to heal the divisions in her party and in the country, but it did neither. For her party, it was too little, too late. They had wanted her to go a long time ago, and now they want her gone. And for the country, they want to know what the government is planning to do to address the problems we are facing. It is a time for strong and stable leadership, not a weak and wobbly one.",0,621
"Four tickets were purchased by Bournville College in Birmingham under former principal Norman Cave, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. The Longbridge further education college also held a PS170,000 reception for about 150 delegates at the event. The four tickets, which were purchased with college funds, cost PS600 and covered the cost of a meal and refreshments, the FOI request shows. According to the Birmingham Mail, the cost was covered by the college's block grant. The Freedom of Information request also revealed that Mr Cave and two other senior staff enjoyed a reception for 150 people in the VIP area of the NEC, which cost the college PS170,000. Mr Cave told the paper he was 'not aware' the tickets had been bought with college funds and said he paid his own way for the reception. The college was placed in administration in July after an investigation into 'financial irregularities'. The order was made by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills at the request of the Skills Funding Agency following the investigation.",0,622
"Eight year-old Phoebe Hanson wrote to BBC Radio 4's PM saying she worried how the ""bongs"" would be replaced while Big Ben is being repaired next year. PM's editor, Roger Sawyer, said he was ""so impressed by her letter,"" he decided to ""give her a little assignment."" He said Phoebe, from Merseyside, ""is very keen on politics and the news,"" and wanted to make sure that ""if the bell isn't going to be working, then there's still going to be some chimes to help us tell the time."" Phoebe, who loves watching BBC Radio 4's PM on television with her mum and dad, was asked to come up with the chimes that will replace the traditional bongs while the clock tower is being renovated. She chose the national anthem, the theme from Doctor Who, and the chimes of the BBC's Shipping Forecast. Her father, Tom Hanson, said Phoebe ""just loves the news"" and that she ""can tell you what happened on the Today programme this morning and what happened on PM last night."" Mr Hanson, from Hoylake in Wirral, said: ""It's been a running joke with her that I say to her that when I retire I'm going to apply to work as a BBC journalist and she says 'Well, when I'm older, I'm going to be a journalist'. The eight-year-old from Hoylake has been a big fan of the PM programme for years. But when she heard that the famous bongs of Big Ben would be silenced while the clock tower is restored, Phoebe decided to write to the show's editor, Roger Sawyer, to express her concerns. ""She was saying how she loves PM and how she is going to miss the bongs of Big Ben while it is being repaired next year and that she was worried how they would be replaced,"" said Phoebe's dad, Tom. Her letter impressed Mr Sawyer, who invited Phoebe onto the programme to share her ideas. Phoebe is a Year 4 pupil at Hilbre High School in West Kirby. She also said the BBC could play a recording of the national anthem or the Shipping Forecast tune. Phoebe will be keeping a keen eye on developments as Big Ben is silenced next year. She said: ""I am going to miss it. I want to be a news reporter when I grow up."" Phoebe's dad, Tom, said: ""She has always been very inquisitive and always wants to know what is going on in the world. She loves listening to the news on the radio or watching the television news. ""We are all very proud of her, it's not every day you get to present your own idea on national radio."" Phoebe, who wants to be a news reporter when she grows up, is a regular listener to the BBC's PM programme. The eight-year-old was worried about how to keep track of the time when the bongs of Big Ben are silenced while it is being restored. So she wrote to the programme's editor, Roger Sawyer, to ask what will take their place. Mr Sawyer was so impressed by Phoebe's letter he invited her onto the programme to share her ideas. Phoebe said she would miss the chimes of Big Ben The BBC is expected to announce how it will replace the bongs during the restoration work in the next few weeks. Phoebe's father, Tom Hanson, said: ""I think she will be quite disappointed when it does happen. ""She is very interested in the news at the moment and has been asking us if we can get tickets to go and watch a live debate in parliament."" The Year Four pupil at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Merseyside, was asked to come up with some chimes to replace the bongs during the work. She chose the national anthem, the theme from Doctor Who, and the chimes of the BBC's Shipping Forecast.

"Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands at last getting ready to kick-start the region's manufacturing industry? BMW's Longbridge site is also now back in full swing, and the company is currently advertising for extra staff at the plant, which is still based around the old Austin Rover factory. This is the first time the site has been used to its full capacity in a decade, with 250 new staff being recruited on top of the existing 3,000-strong workforce. The Midlands is also home to the new Aston Martin factory in Gaydon, which is now fully operational. The first cars have been built at the plant, and the site is also home to the brand's new design and engineering centre. The news is a far cry from the gloomy period in the late 1970s, when British car manufacturing seemed to be heading for terminal decline. The new jobs will be a welcome boost for the region's economy, with the government claiming that the new posts will create an extra 7,500 jobs in the supply chain.",0,625
"Friars Walk has been years in the planning and the development ground to a halt in the 2008 financial crisis. Now it is opening with Debenhams as its anchor store, HM, Next, New Look, River Island and the only Primark store in Newport. The new shopping centre is a project that has been nearly 20 years in the making, and will bring more than 100 shops to the city centre. Shoppers can park in a multi-storey car park, with more than 1,200 parking spaces available. It is also hoped that the new shopping centre will make the city more appealing to tourists and visitors, as well as improving the lives of local residents. Following the opening of Friars Walk, Newport's Celtic Manor Resort has launched a new website which allows visitors to book rooms, events and golf at the venue. The new website, which was developed by Cardiff-based digital agency 360, has been designed to help tourists, as well as corporate groups, to easily find out about the Celtic Manor Resort. The website includes a new online booking system, a new brand identity and a new design for the website. As well as information on rooms, events and golf, the website also includes details of the resort's restaurants, including the Steak on Six restaurant, which was launched in 2015. The resort said that the new website ""introduces a new 'smart' mobile-friendly booking engine, with a fresh design to match, and an easier and quicker process for booking accommodation, events, golf, spa treatments and dining.""",0,626

Jurgen Klopp's side has the perfect opportunity to boost its title hopes with a victory at Southampton on Sunday. Liverpool FC are locked in a battle with Manchester City to win the Premier League title this season as both clubs look to try and finish top of the table. Liverpool's Sadio Mane celebrates scoring their third goal with team mates. Liverpool have now scored 91 goals in all competitions this season and only three teams in Premier League history have managed more after 38 matches. Burnley boss Sean Dyche said: ""It's tough to take."" Liverpool have 85 points from 36 games, while City have 83 from 35. ""I'm pleased with the three points."" Klopp's team now sit on 85 points and are one point clear of City at the top of the table with three games to play. Burnley defender Ben Mee. It is a wonderful moment in a very hard season.

Mane has a better chance of being selected for the PFA Player of the Year award than Van Dijk, who is seen as a strong favourite to win the award.

"Mr Blair said the party he used to lead should aspire to govern, rather than be a ""fringe protest movement."" He has been a vocal critic of leader Jeremy Corbyn, who he says cannot win an election. The Conservatives are set to take the largest share of the vote with around 44, up six points on 2015. The Lib Dems are forecast to get 10 of the vote, down one point on the last general election. UKIP is on 5, up one point, while the Greens and the SNP are both unchanged on 4. The party leader said the result meant ""politics has changed"" and her opponents ""must now accept that this government has a right to complete its work."" The final poll of the campaign predicts the Conservatives will win a majority of 50 seats in the House of Commons. The last general election opinion polls put the Tories up to 14 points ahead of Labour, on 46, with Jeremy Corbyn's party on 32. The UKIP leader said the election had been ""a disaster"" for his party, but said he believed he had been the ""most scrutinised"" of all the leaders. Meanwhile, in Scotland, polling expert John Curtice has said it's possible that the SNP could lose 10 seats in the election. He told the BBC's Politics Scotland programme: ""I am struck by the fact that the SNP's majority in some seats has gone down a little bit more than you might have expected."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told supporters his party had a ""historic duty to fulfil"" and that the ""real fight starts now"" after the party suffered losses in early seat results in the election. In Houghton and Sunderland South, Labour's Bridget Phillipson held the seat, but with a reduced majority. On the other side of the country, Labour held onto its seat in Ealing Central and Acton but with a reduced majority. In an election dominated by Brexit, the pro-EU Lib Dems are forecast to make gains in remain-supporting areas. The party's deputy leader Jo Swinson said that she was ""hugely proud"" of the party's performance and said it would be a ""strong voice for the liberal values"" in Westminster. The exit poll, conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC, suggested Labour had lost seats to the Conservatives, as well as making no headway against the SNP in Scotland. If the exit poll is correct, it would be a disaster for Labour, which had hoped to make gains and deprive the Conservatives of an overall majority. A number of Labour MPs are at risk of losing their seats, including former party leader Ed Miliband, who looks to be unseated by the Conservatives in Doncaster North. The exit poll also suggested that the Conservatives would be the biggest party in Scotland, with 14 seats, with Labour and the Lib Dems having only one each. It also suggested the Conservatives would lose one seat in Wales, with Labour down one and Plaid Cymru gaining one. Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg lost his Sheffield Hallam seat to Labour's Jared O'Mara. However, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron held on to his Westmorland and Lonsdale seat in Cumbria. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall is yet to be declared in Boston and Skegness, where he is standing. The exit poll predicted the party would win no seats. The pound rose following the release of the exit poll, which suggested the Conservatives would win a larger majority in the House of Commons. The pound jumped 0.4 to 1.29 against the dollar after the exit poll. The pound had been trading at its lowest level since April following a series of opinion polls that pointed to a hung parliament.",0,628
"It's rare that the company delves too far into how the ""magic"" - as they call it - works. Their logic is a magic trick doesn't get better if you know how it works. But in a behind-the-scenes video released Thursday by the Disney Institute, the company detailed exactly how a guest gets into the ""FastPass"" queue, and how the process works from start to finish. The video was part of a ""backstage magic"" webinar for Disney's ""Passholders"" (those who pay for an annual pass to the parks). FastPass, if you're not familiar, is Disney's ticketing system, which allows guests to reserve rides, shows and character meet-and-greets ahead of time. Guests are able to make those reservations 30 days in advance if they're staying at a Disney resort, or 60 days in advance if they're not. When you reserve the FastPass tickets, you're given a one-hour window to use that FastPass. So you could, for example, reserve a 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. window for the ""Space Mountain"" ride. As you approach that time, the ""magic"" starts to happen. When you show up at the ride, you'll get a notification on the ""My Disney Experience"" app that says, ""You're good to go!"" It will tell you to tap the screen to see which entrance to use. Once you tap the screen, it will show you a map with an arrow pointing you in the right direction. That's when you head to the designated entrance, which is the one with the Mickey Mouse head on it. Once you get to the Mickey Mouse entrance, you'll find a cast member (what Disney calls its employees) with a device that scans your MagicBand or ticket. The device is what's known as a ""long-range RFID reader,"" which stands for radio-frequency identification. The reader will pull up your name and picture, and let the cast member know it's you. The device will then display a screen showing a digital version of your FastPass ticket. The cast member will then scan your ticket, letting you into the FastPass line. Once you're inside the FastPass queue, you'll also find RFID readers at the ride entrance, according to the Disney Institute. The RFID reader will scan your MagicBand or ticket one last time to make sure it's really you, and then you're free to ride.",0,629

The news will come as a huge boost to fans after Federer admitted on Thursday that he would ""think hard"" about playing at Wimbledon if his back problem resurfaces. Federer's exit to del Potro was his earliest at Roland Garros since his 2003 debut. Wimbledon's chief executive, Richard Lewis, said: ""It's a huge disappointment for the fans and for us, but we hope he will recover and be with us."" Federer is set to make a decision on Wimbledon following consultations with a medical team over the coming days. The back trouble surfaced last week in his first-round loss to Lukas Rosol in the grass-court warm-up event at Halle. It flared up again during his second-round tie with del Potro and he admitted: ""It's not good enough. I'm better than this."" Federer said: ""I'll have to get into a hard training schedule now, then take a decision about Wimbledon. ""I'll decide in the next few days. I'll talk with the doctors and see what they say. ""We'll have to wait for the next few days and see how it goes."" The seven-time Wimbledon champion, who last missed the tournament in 1998, added: ""I'm not 24 any more so things have to be different. I'll have to do the right things, get more physio, train, do extra fitness work. ""I didn't expect this to happen. I'll have to see how it goes. I'll have to do everything I can to make sure I'm in good shape for Wimbledon. ""I've had a lot of issues to deal with the last 12 months. I've been able to deal with them so far. I hope I can deal with this one as well.""",0,630
"The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in six years, according to the latest IHS MarkitCIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). The index hit 58.2 in December, up from 58.0 in November and far above the 50.0 mark that signals no growth. However, the CBI said that growth in retail sales fell to its lowest level in five years in the year to December, with 50 of retailers reporting a fall in sales and 42 a rise. The balance of -8 was the weakest since March 2012, and the decline in orders on suppliers was the steepest since February 2010. The CBI's Distributive Trades Survey also found that firms expect a further deterioration in the New Year. Overall, the economy is still growing, but the pace of growth is slowing, according to the latest CBI Growth Indicator. The measure - a composite of output growth across the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors - rose by 0.2 in the three months to December. Although the figure was stronger than the 0.1 growth seen in the three months to November, the pace of growth remained below its long-term average. The construction sector is still experiencing a squeeze, according to the latest survey by IHS MarkitCIPS. It said that total construction activity in the UK declined for the 10th consecutive month, with the Civil Engineering sector seeing a fall in new work. However, there was a further solid increase in staffing levels during December, with construction firms taking on additional employees in response to greater workloads and rising business requirements. The UK's services sector slowed down at the end of last year, according to the IHS MarkitCIPS UK Services PMI. Business activity increased for the 21st month in a row, but the rate of expansion was the slowest since September 2016. The survey also found that optimism about the year ahead fell to a two-and-a-half-year low, with sentiment dampened by concerns about the economic outlook. Overseas sales rose again in December, but there was a sharp increase in input price inflation, which was the highest for six years. Businesses are concerned about the effect of Brexit on the UK economy. Two in five businesses (41) say the UK's decision to leave the EU has had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). A quarter of businesses (24) say the decision has had a positive impact. In its latest economic outlook, the EY ITEM Club is forecasting a slowdown in 2018, due to the impact of Brexit uncertainty on business investment. It expects growth to slow to 1.5 this year, down from 1.8 in 2017. The EY ITEM Club's chief economic adviser, Peter Spencer, said: ""The UK economy has been surprisingly resilient since the referendum in June 2016. However, as the Brexit date approaches, businesses are becoming increasingly cautious about investment. The Bank of England has increased interest rates to 0.5 from 0.25, the first rise for 10 years. In his announcement, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said that the decision reflected the progress of the economy and the need to return rates to 'more conventional levels'. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says the decision to raise rates is an unwelcome move. It is warning that the increase will hit many companies hard and, when combined with other rising costs, could lead to job losses. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is also concerned. It says the increase comes at a time when consumer prices are rising faster than wages, hitting household budgets. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has called on the Government to take action to mitigate the impact of business rate increases in April. The BRC wants the Government to drop proposals to increase business rates in April, which could cost retailers up to 250 million. It also wants more frequent business rate valuations to avoid the impact of sudden increases. The National Living Wage (NLW",0,631

McCloskey still had a year remaining on his contract with Ulster, but has signed a new three-year deal with the province. ""He's very excited about the future, and I think he feels he's still got a lot of rugby left in him, and he wants to go out and play that for Ulster,"" said Les Kiss, Ulster's Director of Rugby. ""We're obviously very happy with that. He's a great asset to us, and we're delighted that he's made that decision."" Kiss added that he was looking forward to working with McCloskey in the coming seasons. ""I think Stuart is a young man that's on the rise, and I'm excited about seeing where he can go to,"" he said. ""I think he's at a wonderful age, where he's still got plenty to learn, plenty to develop, and plenty of opportunity to be exposed to different parts of the game. ""I'm really looking forward to that opportunity, and I think he's really excited about that as well. He wants to make sure that he can improve and make an impact on the game, and it's great for us that he's decided to stay here."" In the meantime, McCloskey is fully focused on the task in hand as Ulster seek to secure their place in the Champions Cup next season. ""I'm very happy with the decision,"" he said. ""It was a very tough decision, but I've made it and I'm delighted to be staying for another three years. This season has been a tough season for me, with injuries and stuff like that, but I'm looking forward to getting back on track and showing the Ulster fans what I'm made of. ""It was a tough decision, because there was interest from other clubs, but I've been here since I was 15, and this is my home, and I love this place. I've grown up here and I feel at home here. I'm very happy to be staying here."" McCloskey is now looking forward to the upcoming Pro12 games against Connacht and Munster, and to making his mark on the international stage.

"Amber Rudd told the BBC the manifesto was ""not going to be identical to the last one"" and said things had changed since 2015 because of Brexit. The target, set out in the party's 2015 general election manifesto, was dropped in the Queen's Speech a year ago. A Russian airstrike hit Syria's largest Kurdish town on Thursday, activists and a Kurdish official said, wounding two civilians amid fears of a widening of the conflict. The Pentagon said that in retaliation, "" US aircraft conducted a show of force, and the coalition contacted Russian officials to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing."" The military says it will continue to conduct air operations over Syria, despite Russia's threat to target USA warplanes. The Pentagon has released dramatic video showing a USA fighter jet shooting down an Iranian-made drone operated by pro-regime forces in Syria. The White House has said it will work to keep lines of communication open with Russian Federation amid escalating tension in Syria. On Saturday, a US Navy FA-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian SU-22 ground attack aircraft near the Syrian town Tabqa. USA forces have been supporting Kurdish fighters with both ground forces and air power as they battle ISIS in Raqqa, the extremist group's de facto capital. A USA warplane shot down a Syrian government fighter jet on Sunday, prompting Russian Federation to issue a threat of retaliation and escalating tensions over Syria. The Russian Defense Ministry threatened target USA -led coalition jets in Syria in response to the US military's downing of a Syrian warplane, which Washington said was dropping bombs on US-backed forces. ""We do not seek an escalation of the situation in any way, and we would encourage all parties to de-escalate the situation and focus again on the fight to defeat ISIS,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. In a statement to CNN, the US-led coalition said the show of force was in ""self-defense,"" adding that it does ""not seek to fight Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces partnered with them."" The statement added that Russian forces in Syria would be told to treat any further air or ground forces from the coalition as ""enemies,"" and would be ""targeted immediately."" After an alleged chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians, the USA in April fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian air base the Pentagon says was used to store chemical weapons. ""The coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces partnered with them, but will not hesitate to defend coalition or partner forces from any threat,"" said the statement. The coalition said the location was close to where another ""pro-regime"" drone, which intelligence sources had also identified as Iranian, was shot down on June 8 after dropping bombs near coalition forces. The confrontation came after another first: Iran, in retaliation for IS-claimed attacks in Tehran, fired ballistic missiles at IS positions in eastern Syria, a strike it boasted publicly about and which Israel strongly denounced.",0,635
"A deal was made by the two main parties and the British and Irish governments to resolve a crisis at Stormont. Solutions were found on issues over paramilitarism and welfare reform, both of which have caused deadlock in recent months. The deal was announced on Monday and follows weeks of intense negotiations between the two parties. This is the third attempt in the past year to break the political deadlock in the province. The issues of the crisis were divided into three strands: the first strand was on issues of welfare reform, the second on paramilitarism and the third on issues around flags and the past. The first strand on welfare reform has been agreed after a series of ""sticking points"" were resolved. The main point of contention was the introduction of an ""apparent parity"" between the amount of money people receive in Northern Ireland and the amount people receive in Britain. On flags, a commission has been established to consider the toxic issue of flags and emblems, including those at Stormont. The issue of the flying of the Union flag at Stormont caused a political crisis last year. On the past, a new body will be set up to look into issues around dealing with the legacy of the past. The body will be independent and the remit of the body will include looking at issues of state killings. The British Government has also promised to look at issues around dealing with the past, including the issues around the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings and the activities of British state forces during the conflict. Monday's deal was welcomed by both of the main parties and the Irish and British governments. Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny and British Prime Minister David Cameron were both briefed on the details of the agreement. Northern Secretary Theresa Villiers told the British parliament that the agreement was a ""significant and positive step forward."" ""The agreement will be published and laid before Parliament later this week. But I can confirm that it addresses the three main areas of contention. Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the agreement was a ""significant development."" ""The agreement which has been reached this morning is a significant development and a positive step forward for the people of this island. ""It provides the basis for the implementation of all outstanding commitments from previous agreements. ""It will allow us to begin to deal with the issues of the future and will allow us to move forward on the issue of dealing with the past. ""This agreement will also ensure that the institutions are bedded into a position of strength and stability. ""This is an important day for the political process and I commend all those involved for the work they have undertaken in recent days to bring this about. ""There are many challenges ahead but I believe this agreement provides the basis for a new beginning in the political process. ""Sinn Fein will honour all of our commitments within the agreement and we will work with our partners in the DUP, the Irish Government and the British Government to resolve all of the issues. ""I am pleased that the two governments have already confirmed their intention to honour their commitments. ""All of the parties will have to work together to make this agreement a success. ""But I believe the Irish people, north and south, and the British people can look to the future with confidence. ""Sinn Fein has always wanted a successful political process. This agreement provides a platform for that success,"" he said. DUP leader and First Minister Peter Robinson also welcomed the agreement. ""Today's agreement is good for Northern Ireland and its future. ""This agreement will allow for the delivery of important issues for our people. ""There will be welfare reform, a better deal for our farmers, and benefit levels will be maintained for our people. ""This agreement will also enable a balanced approach to the difficult issues of the past. ""The agreement also sets out a clear way forward on the issues of parades and flags. ""Those who want a better future for our people will want to see this agreement work. ""I want to commend my party team, the other parties involved, the Irish and British governments, for the positive way in which this agreement has been reached. ""I am confident that the DUP will honour its commitments in full. ""I call on everyone to respond positively to this agreement and to give it our full support. ""It has been a long journey to get to this point. ""The important thing now is to continue our progress and build on this agreement to deliver for all our people.

"A group led by Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan bought a controlling 60 stake in Swansea in a deal ratified by the Premier League on 1 July. They are considering an application to list the club on the stock exchange. Reports that Swansea City are looking to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) should be of considerable interest to sports clubs, writes Matthew Howarth, a partner at law firm Mills Reeve. With 116 clubs in the English football league structure, it is one of the most popular sports in the UK. But the competition for success is intense, with 92 clubs competing in the English Football League alone. For those in the top flight, there is a need to invest heavily to ensure their status in the Premier League, which is essential for the revenues that can be generated. But one of the challenges that many Premier League clubs face is a lack of access to capital. Traditionally, English football clubs are owned privately by wealthy individuals, or a consortium of individuals, or by supporters' trusts. But in recent years there has been some interest from the US in the English game, with foreign owners attracted by the prospect of success and the potential for growing the profile of the club, and therefore its commercial revenues, in the world's biggest sports market. English football clubs have been slow to recognise the benefits of listing on a stock exchange, but there have been a few notable exceptions in recent years. Celtic in Scotland is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a stock exchange run by the London Stock Exchange, while AFC Wimbledon, a club in the fourth tier of English football, is also listed on AIM. But the idea of listing a Premier League club on a stock exchange is a new one. With the cash available to Manchester United and Manchester City, both of which have benefited from huge injections of capital from their American owners, they have become the dominant forces in English football in recent years. But for the other clubs, it is difficult to compete. If Swansea City were to list on the NYSE, it would be the first Premier League club to do so. The advantage of such a move would be that it would provide access to capital, while at the same time providing an exit route for the club's owners. It would also mean that the club's supporters would be able to own a stake in the club if they wanted to. This is an interesting time for Swansea City. In July, a group led by Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan bought a controlling 60 stake in the club in a deal that was ratified by the Premier League. The group paid 100m, with chairman Huw Jenkins keeping a 10 stake in the club. The new investment has provided the club with some much needed capital. The club is also moving forward with plans for a new stadium. It currently plays in the Liberty Stadium, which it shares with Ospreys Rugby Club. But there has been a desire for some time to build a new stadium, which the club hopes will help it to grow commercially. The stadium will have a capacity of 33,000, and will be built on a site in Landore, just a few hundred yards away from the current ground. If the club does list on the NYSE, it will be an interesting development for other clubs. But while access to capital is a potential benefit, there are also risks. First, there is the risk of the owners being able to sell their stake too easily, while there is also the risk of the supporters' trust being diluted if it decides to sell its shares. But the move also raises the question of whether there are other clubs in the English Football League who would be interested in listing on the stock exchange.

"The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom demanded, though according to reports a ransom was paid in the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center attack. On the 18th of March, the computer systems at Kentucky Methodist Hospital and a number of other systems at the Methodist Health organization were taken offline after an attack by a ransomware variant called Locky. The malware encrypted the files on the hospital's network, and a ransom demand for 4 Bitcoins was made. Locky is a particularly aggressive form of malware, and according to reports, the infection was able to bypass the antivirus software in place. The attack occurred at around 2 AM on the 18th of March. According to hospital officials, the attack was detected quickly and the organization's IT department was able to remove the malware from the network and restore encrypted files from backups, although the process took several days. All the infected systems had to be wiped and rebuilt, which resulted in delays to some services while the systems were offline. The ransom demand was not paid and the hospital's incident response plan was successfully followed. No patients were turned away from the hospital as a result of the attack, although some patients were moved to other hospitals to allow their care to continue. The attack was reported to the FBI and the Kentucky attorney general's office, and an investigation into the attack is underway. Methodist Health has said that the attack is the result of an employee opening a phishing email, although it is unclear if the employee clicked on a malicious link or opened an attachment containing the ransomware. One employee did make a mistake that allowed the ransomware to be installed, but the incident response plan was followed and the attack was contained and systems were restored from backups. Methodist Health was able to return to business as normal relatively quickly, and all patient data was secure. The attack has highlighted the importance of business continuity planning and backup plans, which the organization had in place and were effective. The incident was contained, although it took several days to recover from the attack. Another ransomware attack recently took place at two California hospitals - Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital - that are both part of the Prime Healthcare Services Inc. network. Both hospitals were attacked on the 17th of March by a variant of Locky ransomware called Kimcilware. Both hospitals took the decision not to pay the ransom demand, and worked with law enforcement agencies to restore access to encrypted files. The FBI is investigating the attacks, which are believed to have occurred at around the same time. The ransomware was identified quickly by hospital IT teams, and while access to data was prevented, emergency services were not affected. Patients were not turned away, and all services were provided while IT teams worked on restoring the encrypted files. Prime Healthcare Services has a business continuity plan in place to deal with such incidents. The plan was put into action, and while there was some disruption to services, it was minimal. No information was provided on how the ransomware was installed, although Prime Healthcare Services has said that while the ransomware attack was disruptive, the incident response plan was followed and the attack was managed effectively.",0,639

"The rail union is calling on the Scottish government to set out an immediate timetable for Abellio to be stripped of its ScotRail franchise. It has said making Scotland's railways publicly owned would be the best way to ensure the future success of the network.

"Charity Twelves Company, based in Devon, said it had turned away 112 people seeking support in 2015. A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a 75 increase in incidents involving new psychoactive substances in the past year. The charity, which provides outreach to rough sleepers, said: ""We have experienced a huge increase in the number of people using legal highs, which has led to a huge increase in the number of emergency hospital admissions. ""We have had to turn away 112 people in 2015 due to their inability to access services, because of their use of legal highs. ""We have also had to remove six people from the streets in the last 10 months who had taken legal highs and had died."" The charity said it had also had to remove six people from the streets who had died after taking legal highs. In a statement, the charity said: ""There is a growing issue of people using legal highs and those who are not ready or want to access services are unable to access them because of their use. ""These are people who are in a very vulnerable place in their life and need support to make the changes that will help them move forward."" It is a legal requirement that housing providers ask about the applicant's history of substance misuse and it is not uncommon for hostels to ask residents to be abstinent from drugs and alcohol for a period of time prior to being admitted or during their stay. The statement continued: ""Charity Twelves Company recognises that not everyone is ready to engage with services and therefore they are at risk of being unable to access housing, treatment or mental health services and are therefore at increased risk of becoming trapped on the streets. ""The use of legal highs is a growing issue on the streets and something that we at Charity Twelves Company are not willing to ignore."" The charity said it had teamed up with the police and other organisations to try to tackle the problem. In 2015 the number of incidents involving new psychoactive substances - formerly known as legal highs - increased by 75 in Devon and Cornwall, according to police. In Plymouth, Devon, the charity Shekinah said it had seen an increase in the use of legal highs, which were ""taking over the city."" In a statement the charity said: ""We have witnessed a massive increase in the number of people using legal highs in the city. ""We are seeing people on a daily basis who are under the influence of legal highs and not just homeless people. ""It's also people who have homes, jobs, families and the impact of legal highs is taking over our city. ""There is a real need for an increase in awareness, education and intervention in order to address the rise in legal high use in our city. ""We would really welcome more partners working together to address this rising issue."" Plymouth City Council said it had seen a ""significant rise"" in the number of people using legal highs in the past year, and in the number of people in need of support from treatment services. The council said in a statement: ""People using legal highs can become aggressive and this is causing a rise in the number of anti-social behaviour and public order incidents, resulting in a high demand on police resources. ""In addition, the level of drug-related litter has increased and our street cleaning teams are finding more needles and other drug paraphernalia on the streets, creating a potential risk to the public. ""This situation is also putting additional pressure on our treatment services, as the number of people seeking help from these services is rising rapidly. ""Plymouth City Council's public health team is working with other agencies to tackle this issue. ""It is hoped that the introduction of the Psychoactive Substances Act will be one of the measures that will help to reduce the use of legal highs."" In June, a report by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a think tank which aims to tackle poverty and its root causes, said legal highs had become ""a national epidemic"" and were causing an ""acute crisis"" on Britain's streets. The report suggested the total cost to society of legal highs was 1.3bn, with an annual cost of 267m to the NHS.",0,647
"In a statement (in French) it said it was ""worried about the continued worsening of the situation."" On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey said it has killed 63 militiamen and destroyed shelters and ammunition depots since the start of the campaign, which it dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch."" Iraqi Kurdish officials said the Turkish campaign was also damaging infrastructure and water facilities in the region. The UN estimates that more than 5,000 people have fled Afrin since the start of the offensive, with many heading towards Aleppo and Idlib. Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Sunday the operation would be completed by May. The U.S. is concerned about the Turkish offensive and the effect it could have on the fight against the Islamic State group. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to ""crush"" the militia, which his country views as a terrorist group. The U.S. has long supported the Kurds in the fight against the Islamic State group, which still holds pockets of territory in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. has no troops in Afrin but does have about 2,000 special forces troops and other U.S. troops stationed in the predominantly Kurdish region further east. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that Turkey's offensive distracts from efforts to defeat Islamic State militants. ""The violence in Afrin disrupts what was a relatively stable area of Syria. It distracts from the international efforts to ensure the defeat of ISIS,"" Mattis said in a statement. He added that the U.S. urged all sides to ""de-escalate tensions"" in Afrin. On Saturday, Turkey's foreign minister said the operation in Afrin would be followed by moves against the town of Manbij and other areas in Syria. Manbij is held by Kurdish-led forces that ousted the Islamic State group in 2016. The U.S. also has hundreds of special forces in the Manbij area. The U.S. and Turkey have been holding talks in Ankara over Manbij. The U.S. has warned Turkey that the operation in Afrin risks harming U.S. relations with its NATO ally. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday that his country is determined to carry out the operation ""until the end."" ""From the start we have said 'We can come any night without warning. We informed the U.S. and Russia. We don't have a problem with the (local) people but we are against the terror organization, Cavusoglu said.",0,648

"He faces a number of charges. First, he pulled out of a long-planned trip to Moscow after the US missile strike on a Syrian airfield. It was agreed the US Secretary of State and his Russian counterpart would meet to discuss the most contentious issues. For now, that meeting is off, and this is bad. The second, Trump signed a bill expanding sanctions on Russia. This is also bad. But the most damaging, and the most difficult to explain, was his firing of FBI Director James Comey. The official explanation: he was no good at his job. That's hard to swallow. Comey was appointed by President Obama in 2013. He was a member of the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. He was a registered Republican. The unofficial explanation, the one that made the rounds in the media, is that Comey was fired because he was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The only one who can answer this question is Trump. But for now, all we have is hearsay. In a tweet, Trump suggested there might be ""tapes"" of his conversations with Comey. This is an odd thing to say. It was an obvious attempt to intimidate Comey, and, if there were tapes, then Trump could release them and prove his version of events. But what if there were no tapes? Trump's behaviour is puzzling. He won the election on the strength of his personality and his campaign promises, many of which he has now broken. In his first 100 days, he has failed to repeal Obamacare, he has failed to ban Muslims from entering the US, he has failed to build a wall on the Mexican border, and he has failed to bring back jobs to the rust belt. But he could have salvaged his presidency if he had kept his campaign promise to improve relations with Russia. With the firing of Comey, he has severely damaged any hope of that happening. Trump's Presidency is going from bad to worse.",0,650

"Allan Whittern ran the grocer's store in Suffolk Parade from 1932 until his death 50 years later, in 1982. Following its closure in 1991, the door painted with his father's name is now in the Museum of Shoreham. The property, now known as 343 High Street, is currently occupied by a dry-cleaning business. The grocer's shop was known as Paddy's, and was in fact run by three generations of Allan Whitterns. The first Allan's son, John, was the second Allan. He was killed during the D-Day landings, and his son, Allan, known as Allan Junior, took over the store, although it is uncertain if he ever married or had any children. Before Allan Whittern Senior became a grocer, he was an undertaker. He was born on 26 January 1881, and married Katherine Louisa Wood in 1902. At the time of the 1901 census, Allan's father, Samuel, was running a grocer's shop in Buckingham Road, Shoreham. Samuel Whittern was born in Worthing in 1851, and married Elizabeth Parsons in 1873. They had seven children. A photograph of Allan Whittern's shop, taken in the 1950s, can be found in the gallery. A book of photographs of Shoreham through the years, containing many of Allan Whittern's pictures, can be found here.",0,652
"The humpback has been seen at Pettycur Bay, Kinghorn in Fife. Humpback sightings are not uncommon in Scotland, but a large whale so far up the Forth estuary is a rare sight. Humpback whales are known for their extraordinary long-distance migrations and are seen from the western coasts of Britain and Ireland. Although not uncommon, sightings are rare, especially in Scotland. The last time one was seen in the Forth was in 1902. Sightings from British coasts have increased since the 1990s as a result of whales moving into British waters and other sightings are likely to increase in the future. Humpback whales are named after the large hump and small dorsal fin on their backs. They have very long flippers and a small tail. Humpback whales grow up to 16m long and can weigh up to 36,000kg. They are black on the top and white on the bottom, with variable black and white markings on the sides. Humpbacks are known for their songs, which males use to attract mates. Humpbacks also slap their flippers, tail, and heads on the water surface to make loud noises. Humpbacks are found throughout the world's oceans, but their range is not continuous. Populations are separated by up to thousands of miles. In the northern hemisphere, humpbacks migrate from the tropics to the poles in the summer months. Females reach sexual maturity at about 5 years of age, with males maturing at about 6 years. They are polygynous, meaning a single male mates with multiple females. Females have a calf every two years and usually give birth in the tropics during winter. The calf is born tail-first and takes its first breath when its head breaks the surface. Newborns are 4-5m long, weigh 1.5-2 tonnes and have a dark grey to black colour. They are nursed for about 6-10 months and drink around 100 litres of milk per day. Humpbacks feed by swimming through large shoals of fish and scooping them up with their large mouths. They also feed on krill and plankton. The humpback was hunted extensively for its meat, oil and whalebone, and almost hunted to extinction. Today, the humpback is no longer hunted, but continues to face threats from fishing gear, pollution and climate change.",0,653
"Noah Zunde, who was 22 months old, succumbed to heatstroke after being left in the car for seven hours. His mother, Romy Zunde, had mistakenly believed she dropped Noah at day care that morning. But her husband, Noah's father, picked up the boy and took him home, where he left Noah in the car. The boy's mother, an attorney, was working in her home office, unaware that Noah was in the car. She went to the car at 5:30 p.m., thinking Noah was at day care, and found him dead. There have been at least 11 heatstroke deaths of children left in vehicles this year. This is the second such death in Missouri this year, and the 600th since 1998, according to KidsAndCars.org, a national nonprofit child safety group. A child left in a hot vehicle can quickly die.

"They were able to hold a metal plate a few centimetres above the rabbit's chest and use it to regulate the animal's heartbeat. If such medical implants could be made smaller, they would be useful for monitoring the heart rate of a patient in hospital. The team, led by Robert Langer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discovered that when they coated the plate with a conductive polymer, the plate was able to stop and start the heart without the need for any external power. The effect was due to the fact that when the heart's electrical impulses hit the plate they created a magnetic field. The plate's metal surface acts as a Faraday cage, confining the magnetic field to the area of the plate, creating an electrical current that in turn blocks the passage of the impulse through the heart. The effect was made more powerful by coating the metal plate with a layer of a non-conductive polymer, followed by a layer of a conducting polymer, which acted as a secondary cage. The team also tested the effect of the device on an anaesthetised pig. Again, it was able to control the animal's heart rate. The device is unlikely to be useful in humans for some time, as implanting it in a patient would be an invasive procedure requiring surgery. However, Langer believes that future research could lead to a more user-friendly device, such as an electrode that could be placed on the chest. ""It's a very clever approach,"" says Richard Borgens of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. ""It can be used for biofeedback or, at the extreme, for stopping the heart."" ""It might be applicable in a situation where someone needed to be controlled by a doctor or nurse, in the event of arrhythmia, for example,"" he adds.",0,657

"The prime minister stressed her belief he was committed to advancing the ""special relationship"" with the UK. But Mrs May told the Financial Times she expects ""very frank"" talks on trade at this week's summit in Hamburg, Germany. The prime minister has been struggling to secure her own position at the summit as she clings on to power following the general election result which saw the Tories lose their majority in the House of Commons. ""I want to be very clear about the position the UK Government is taking, which is that we want to maintain a close economic relationship with the EU,"" she said. ""It's a great relationship."" ""It will be a continuing relationship of working together, but I'll be clear that what we want to do is to look for trade opportunities for the United Kingdom."" Mrs May said: ""I want to be clear about the position the United Kingdom government is taking, which is that we want to maintain a close economic relationship with the EU."" The Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""On Brexit, they agreed to continue to keep in close touch and work together to take the discussions forward."" Although the PM has been invited to the summit, the discussions on trade are likely to be highly sensitive, as the remaining 27 European Union member states try to forge a united front in the Brexit negotiations. The statement that Theresa May made yesterday about the free movement of people ending in March 2019 was a statement that was made for a domestic audience. The Prime Minister will attempt to show she is still relevant on the world stage at the G20 summit in Hamburg, where she will meet US President Donald Trump for the first time since the election. ""We've already been laying the groundwork for those discussions to take place,"" she said. She also said she will look at the US with confidence after Brexit, and said she will look forward to meeting President Trump for the first time as Prime Minister. The paper also claimed that Trump has privately said May's approach to the Brexit negotiations is ""too soft"" and that he plans to be tougher on the EU than she is. The leaders of the world's 20 largest economies will be meeting in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday and Saturday. Mrs May has rejected the European Union timetable for negotiations, which would see trade talks begin after the issues of the UK's ""divorce bill"" and the rights of European Union citizens in Britain are settled. ""And I'm going to be talking to President Trump and other leaders as I go through the G20."" In her first major foreign policy speech since calling a snap election, she also urged the EU to build a ""deep and special"" partnership with the UK as the price of getting a free trade deal. But he also said he would not allow the United States to be taken advantage of by other countries. ""So it's very much in the interests of both the U.S. and the United Kingdom for us to have a good trade relationship after we have left the European Union,"" she added. ""It will be a continuing relationship of working together, but I'll be clear that what we want to do is to look for trade opportunities for the United Kingdom.""",0,659

"""Fracking"" involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure. The joint report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering say the technique is safe if firms stick to a set of 100 guidelines. The process is not new, having been used in America for some years. But it has been under intense scrutiny, with concerns raised over its safety. The report's authors, who include energy industry experts, academics and regulators, say it is a ""key opportunity"" to deliver security of energy supply and economic growth. They say fracking will have an impact on local communities but the risks of environmental damage can be minimised if best practice is implemented. The report's authors warn that the speed of exploration and drilling will be limited by the rate at which suitable sites can be identified and by the scale of the infrastructure required to support multiple sites. The report says there is no evidence that fracking for shale gas will lead to an increase in earthquakes that can be felt on the surface. Professor John Beddington, the government's chief scientific adviser, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the study was an ""authoritative and independent"" report that would help ""inform the public debate."" ""The important thing is that if we are going to go down this road, we need to do it properly, we need to have the regulation in place, we need to make sure we have got the monitoring in place, and we need to do it safely and in a way in which we can mitigate the environmental risks."" Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the government would press ahead with its plans to extract shale gas, saying the report showed it could be done ""safely and responsibly."" ""This report is an important step forward in giving people confidence in the safety of fracking,"" he said. ""It clearly shows that shale gas extraction can be done safely if it's properly regulated and monitored. ""It will now be for energy firms to show that they can carry out exploration safely and responsibly."" Government officials say Britain has huge shale gas reserves which, if tapped, could help it achieve energy independence and improve its balance of payments. The government recently lifted a moratorium on fracking that had been in place since 2011 after a shale gas company was accused of causing two small earthquakes. A government-commissioned report into the seismic risks found they were low, but said fracking operators should be required to hold a 5m liability insurance policy. The UK's energy reserves are dwindling, and it has relied on imports for the past six years. The Energy Department recently said there could be 3,200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas trapped in the rocks under Lancashire and Yorkshire alone. Fracking involves drilling a well vertically several kilometres below ground. Then, at that depth, it is drilled horizontally for another kilometre or so. A mixture of water, sand and chemicals is pumped down the well at high pressure to fracture the shale rock and release the gas trapped within. Environmentalists say fracking is unsafe and could contaminate groundwater and cause small earthquakes. There have been hundreds of small earthquakes reported in the US and Canada near to fracking sites. According to the BBC, a new technique, known as acid fracking, is also being considered. Acid fracking involves mixing hydrochloric acid with water and sand and pumping it into the ground to crack rocks and release shale gas. It has been banned in some states in the US over fears it could pollute drinking water. The shale gas industry is expected to create thousands of jobs.

But Jamie Proctor's strike just before half-time, after he had an earlier goal disallowed, gave the Tykes hope. George Moncur almost levelled in the second half, but after John O'Sullivan had a goal chalked off for offside, Millwall held on to reach Wembley for the second successive season. The Lions had already scored three goals in the first leg at The Den and they were in the ascendancy again when Gregory forced a superb save from Adam Davies in the 12th minute. The Barnsley keeper was equal to Gregory's close-range effort but was beaten just two minutes later when Jed Wallace's shot from the edge of the area was well saved by Davies, but Gregory reacted quickest to head in the rebound. Barnsley were still looking for their first goal of the tie but were coming close and after Alex Mowatt had had a shot deflected just wide, Moncur saw a good effort saved by Jordan Archer. The Tykes continued to push forward and were awarded a penalty in the 40th minute when Mowatt was tripped by Wallace. But Tom Bradshaw's spot-kick was well saved by Archer. However, they did pull one back a minute later when Proctor fired home at the back post after a good delivery from Mowatt. Barnsley came out strongly for the second half and had a goal disallowed for offside after five minutes, but they were still pushing forward and came close to an equaliser when Moncur's effort was cleared off the line by Byron Webster. Davies kept the Tykes in the tie in the 66th minute when he got a hand to Jake Cooper's header, but they needed another goal and went close when Bradshaw's effort went wide. O'Sullivan was then introduced and came close to scoring in the 73rd minute, but his effort was ruled out for offside. Barnsley continued to push forwards and forced a string of corners but Millwall stood firm and held on to reach Wembley.",0,665
"The team-mates collided while racing for the lead on the last lap of the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday. Hamilton went on to win and now trails Rosberg, who was forced to retire from the race, by 11 points in the overall standings. In the heat of the moment, Hamilton labelled Rosberg's move as ""silly,"" while Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said he felt ""like a broken record"" after the second collision between the two drivers in as many weeks. The Mercedes duo met up on Tuesday to discuss the crash and Hamilton now believes the pair have come to a mutual agreement on how to avoid a repeat. ""It was a very good meeting and we can move forward positively from it,"" Hamilton said. ""We want to win together as a team and that's important. ""It was important to meet face-to-face as men to discuss it. I am confident that we can work together as a team and as we have done in the past. ""We can grow from these experiences."" Hamilton and Rosberg have been team-mates since 2013. Their first crash came in their rookie season when Rosberg punctured a tyre after tapping the back of Hamilton's car. The British driver subsequently failed to finish a race for the first time in his career, while Rosberg was only able to finish 11th. ""It's not the first time that we've had an incident in the last corner,"" Hamilton added. ""It's something that's not happened for a while, but that's motor racing. ""We move on and we have another race in two weeks' time, so we can regroup and move forward."" The next race on the calendar is the British Grand Prix on 5 July.",0,666
"It said just 8 of councils had built enough to replace half of their stock sold through the scheme, which allows council tenants to buy their homes. The charity said that in the worst areas, the amount of social housing had actually fallen by 1. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it was working to increase supply. The RTB scheme, introduced in 1980, allowed tenants to buy their homes from councils at a large discount. Councils sold 400,000 homes under the scheme in the 1980s, and a further 45,000 under Tony Blair's government between 2005 and 2010. Almost 80,000 homes have been sold since the Coalition government extended the right to buy to housing association tenants. The sale of these homes has raised more than 4bn which was used to build new houses. However, the charity Shelter, which carried out the research, said councils were not replacing the homes they sold. Using government figures, it found that 140 local authorities sold homes under the scheme between 2012 and 2017, and that 61 of them did not replace them. It said that 88 of council areas saw a drop in the number of social rented homes between 2012 and 2017. In the worst areas, the number of council-owned homes fell by more than 1 over the period, and in one in five areas there was a net loss of social housing. Sarah Neville, who leads Shelter's campaigns, said: ""When the government extended the right to buy, they promised that 'one-for-one' replacements would deliver new affordable homes for families in need. ""But these figures show that for thousands of families there is still no replacement in sight, and meanwhile councils are being forced to sell off their most valuable assets. ""With the housing crisis leaving thousands of families homeless or stuck in unsuitable temporary accommodation, we need the government to fix its broken right-to-buy scheme and urgently replace homes sold off."" The Local Government Association said it was working with the government to increase supply of social housing. ""There is a chronic need for new affordable housing, and councils are keen to do everything they can to boost the supply of homes that people on lower incomes can afford,"" it said. ""This is why councils want to replace every home sold through right-to-buy, and we are working closely with the government to maximise the opportunities to build the genuinely affordable homes we desperately need."" A government spokesperson said it was committed to increasing the supply of social housing and that it had ""delivered on the promise to replace additional homes sold through the voluntary right-to-buy pilot and one-for-one right-to-buy agreement."" ""In the past 18 months alone, local authorities have started on site or completed 11,242 additional affordable homes to replace those sold through the scheme,"" they added. The right to buy scheme was expanded in 2012 to allow housing association tenants in England to buy their homes. In 2015, an annual target of selling 12,000 homes through the scheme was set, but just 2,634 sales were completed in 2017-18. In June, the government announced that it was scrapping the scheme, saying that the discounts available were too generous. The Treasury said that the new scheme, which will be rolled out in 2020, will cut the maximum discount by a third. Jaguar Land Rover to build electric cars in UK",0,667

The 18-year-old, from the Exeter area, was climbing on the 15ft (4.6m) high statue and had to be rescued by the fire service. A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall Police said: ""Following the incident, he was arrested on suspicion of theft and was taken into custody. ""While in custody, the man became unwell. Medical assistance was called but he was later declared deceased."" A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall Police said: ""We are not treating this death as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner."" The statue of General Sir Redvers Buller was erected in 1905, and has stood in Exeter since 1938. The statue is known locally as the ""Covered in Copper,"" due to a bet involving betting shop owner Freddie ""Fingers"" Fowler. In 1996, Mr Fowler bet a customer that he could not make it up on to the top of the statue, the Daily Mail reported. The customer won the bet and was given 100 and his choice of odds on a football game, which turned out to be 75,000.

"The images appeared to show the pair on foot during a safari in June at the Gir National Park in western Gujarat state. Officials at the park said they imposed a fine on the couple for violating wildlife rules. The couple also was questioned by police. The park is the only place in the world where the wild Asiatic lion can be seen. The park officials said the couple was visiting the park with an approved guide and driver when they got out of their vehicle to take photos with the lion. They said the couple failed to report the incident to authorities, as required. The couple also was accused of not taking permission from park authorities to venture off the track, and to enter the prohibited zone in the park. Park officials said the couple was fined 2,000 rupees (29.50) for violating the rules. Authorities said the couple was also questioned by police on Thursday. The Gir National Park is a wildlife sanctuary spread over 545 square miles (1,412 square kilometers) and is considered the last abode of the Asiatic lion. In 2015, two people were killed by lions in separate incidents while visiting the park. In 2012, a video posted on YouTube showed a pride of lions surrounding a car carrying a family. The driver and a park guide were suspended for allowing the tourists to open car doors. Previous articleWill Smith To Do An Action Film Next?

"Just minutes after leaving harbour, the ferry capsized. 193 people were killed in the tragedy. Belfast man Bill McCrea was more than 1,500 miles away in Kent, when the ship went down. But when he learned that his wife Marion and his four children were among the missing, he rushed to Northern Ireland to identify their bodies. Mr McCrea, who now lives in Newtownabbey, is still haunted by the disaster. He says that he blames the ferry company, Townsend-Thoresen, for the tragedy and wants to see them pay compensation to the families of the victims. ""They're a guilty party,"" he said. ""They are. They're responsible for the ship sinking and all the deaths. And they've just got away with it."" He added that the company ""just put their hands up in the air and say they're not responsible, but they are responsible. They had a contract with the people. They promised to take them safely from one port to another and they didn't."" In October 1987, a jury returned an open verdict on the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise. But it found that Townsend Thoresen, the company which operated the ferry, was guilty of neglect. However, Mr McCrea said he believed that the verdict did not go far enough. ""We went for the top man in the company, and we got him. But he got off. And that was the worst thing that ever happened to us. He got off and he's still there."" The tragedy of the Herald of Free Enterprise has never been far from the McCrea family's thoughts. Mr McCrea, who lost his wife, his two sons, his daughter and his son-in-law in the disaster, says that his life has been destroyed. He said that the family would never recover from the tragedy. ""I've a grandson who is 14. He was five when his mummy and daddy went down in the sea. And he's been looking for a daddy ever since."" Mr McCrea said that he was angry with the British Government for failing to protect its citizens. ""If we lived in America we would have been compensated in full. We would have been compensated in full for the deaths of the people. We would have been compensated in full for the deaths of the people. We would have been compensated in full. But we don't live there, we live in the UK. And we're under the rule of the UK government. And they're not interested in us at all."" The UK Government has said that it will issue a formal apology to the families of the victims and survivors of the disaster. Mr McCrea said he was grateful for this, but he wanted it to go further and include an offer of compensation. ""It's been nearly 15 years since the disaster, and I just want it to be over with. I'm sick and tired of it,"" he said. Mr McCrea added that he believed the tragedy could have been averted if the ship's loading procedures had been different. ""Had they had a ramp on the ship, as they have now, and the cars been on the top instead of the bottom, the ship would not have capsized,"" he said. He said that he also blamed the Government for failing to introduce tougher regulations for ferries. ""We're still not safe, because the Government has never come down on the ferries to have proper rules and regulations to have these ships safe for the people."" He said he believed that the Government had been ""wrapped up"" with the ferry companies and that safety measures had been compromised. ""That's why the ship capsized and 193 people died. They're just not bothered about us."" A statement by the UK Government has offered the families of the victims and survivors a formal apology for the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster. The statement was issued on behalf of the Government by the Rt Hon Stephen Byers MP, Secretary of State for Transport. ""Today I wish to offer an apology to the families of the victims and the survivors of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster of 1987.

Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor. The four zones were originally agreed in May but the deal was short-lived. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the agreements showed that peace in Syria was ""still achievable."" He and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also held talks in the Russian city of Sochi on Monday. Mr Putin said the creation of the de-escalation zones would be ""a real step towards the final settlement of this conflict."" ""I am sure that after these agreements are finalised and implemented, it will be a step towards stabilising the situation in Syria and create the necessary conditions for a political settlement of this complex conflict,"" he added. Mr Erdogan said that ""the aim is to stop the death of civilians."" ""There is no other aim but to give some rest to civilians. But this is not the end, we have more work. We agreed to boost the mechanism in the field. We will not allow ceasefire violations,"" he said. The two leaders also discussed the Iran nuclear deal, with Mr Putin expressing support for the agreement. The Russian president said: ""This is a very important subject for us... and it is important to preserve it in the future."" The Russian leader said he agreed with Mr Erdogan that ""it is necessary to give up the language of sanctions and switch over to the language of development, the language of co-operation, the language of joint efforts."" Iran signed a deal with the US and five other world powers in 2015 under which it agreed to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. President Donald Trump has been critical of the deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and refused in October to formally certify that Iran was complying with its obligations. He passed the issue to Congress instead. The US president has until 13 January to decide whether to continue waiving US sanctions on Iran's nuclear programme. The Syrian conflict has been raging since 2011, when government forces violently cracked down on pro-democracy protests. The four zones are in rebel-held territory in the provinces of Idlib, Latakia, Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Eastern Ghouta and Deraa. Under the plan, checkpoints and observation points will be set up around the four zones to monitor the truce and traffic flows. The Iranian government has been a longstanding supporter of Mr Assad. Russia launched a military campaign in support of the Syrian government in 2015, targeting what it said were ""terrorist groups."" Turkey has backed rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. The two countries brokered a ceasefire in December, which has been repeatedly violated.

"According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote. The question on the ballot paper, 'Should Scotland be an independent country?', was answered by 2,001,926 people who voted No, and by 1,617,989 who voted Yes. The turnout of 84.59 surpassed even the 83.9 who voted in the 1950 general election, when Clement Attlee's Labour government was returned to power. ""A decision has been made. Let us respect that decision. Let us work together, firstly to ensure that Scotland gets the government it voted for and then to ensure that the governments of these islands work together, and with the people, for the social and economic benefit of all,"" he said. Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, said: ""The vote stays the same. It was decisive, it was legal and the decision was taken. There were loud cheers when Alex Salmond took to the stage at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and announced that Glasgow had voted Yes. There were even louder cheers when he said that Dundee had voted Yes. But there were loud boos when he announced that Edinburgh had voted No. Edinburgh was not the only Scottish city to reject independence. Aberdeen also voted No, while Dundee and Glasgow voted Yes. Following the result, a UK government source said David Cameron's cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss how to take forward its commitment to grant more powers to Scotland. David Cameron said he was delighted that the people of Scotland had chosen to keep the United Kingdom together. He said he had spoken to Alex Salmond on the phone to congratulate him on the ""passionate and dignified"" campaign he had fought. The Prime Minister said the UK was a ""diverse and tolerant"" country, and that it was right for all the nations that made up the UK to have ""more power"" over their affairs. He said he had ""no excuses"" to delay the process. The Prime Minister, who faced an angry backlash from Scottish MPs earlier in the year when he ruled out a currency union with an independent Scotland, said he wanted the people of Scotland to have ""as much say as the people of Wales and Northern Ireland and England over how they are governed."" Cameron said he wanted to make clear the referendum was a ""once in a generation"" or ""once in a lifetime"" event, and that the debate was settled for a ""very long time."" Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy Scottish first minister, said it was a ""momentous decision"" that would be ""accepted by people across Scotland.""

"Inspired by the lily pond in Monet's garden at Giverny in France, the painting was the top lot at Sotheby's sale of modern and impressionist works. It totalled just under 160 million, with the second-highest price paid for a Monet in auction history. The top lot at a Sotheby's auction in New York on Monday night was ""Meules"" painted by Claude Monet in 1890. It sold for 110.7 million. It was last sold at auction in 1986 at Sotheby's for 2.5 million. The auction house did not provide details of its current owner. Claude Monet's ""Meules"" sold for 110.7 million at Sotheby's in New York on May 14, 2019. The painting depicts a field of golden wheat under a blue sky in the French countryside. Monet painted it during his first campaign of haystack paintings. The painting is one of only four from the ""Haystacks"" series known to remain in private hands. The previous owners of the painting include some of the most prominent art collectors of the 20th century, including American socialite Peggy Guggenheim and cosmetics magnate Estee Lauder. The painting had been on display at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1984 to 1999. ""The sale of the monumental Meules is the culmination of more than 20 years of work at Sotheby's, and I am immensely grateful to the collectors who have entrusted me with its stewardship over that time,"" said Simon Shaw, Sotheby's senior vice president of worldwide Impressionist and modern art, in a statement. The previous record for a Monet painting sold at auction was set in 2014 with the sale of ""Nympheas,"" which fetched 57.5 million at a Christie's auction in London. ""Meules"" was the second-highest lot sold at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern works on Monday night, where a total of 349 million was raised. More than 40 works from the collection of philanthropists Herbert and Adele Klapper were offered at the auction. The couple collected modern and impressionist art for over 50 years, and Sotheby's said the auction of their works was a chance to ""revisit and celebrate their contributions to the art world."" Herbert and Adele Klapper The top lot from the Klapper collection was ""Nature morte, vase aux marguerites et coquelicots,"" painted in 1890 by Vincent van Gogh. It sold for 59 million. Vincent van Gogh's ""Nature morte, vase aux marguerites et coquelicots"" sold for 59 million at Sotheby's on May 14, 2019. The auction house said the painting is the only one of its kind in private hands. Another van Gogh painting, ""La semeuse (La moisson),"" was the third highest lot at the auction, fetching 33.5 million. Vincent van Gogh's ""La semeuse (La moisson) "" sold for 33.5 million at Sotheby's on May 14, 2019. The painting was last sold at a Sotheby's auction in 2000 for 2.4 million. A painting by Edvard Munch, ""Girls on a Bridge,"" was the fourth highest lot, selling for 49.5 million. Edvard Munch's ""Girls on a Bridge"" sold for 49.5 million at Sotheby's on May 14, 2019.

"The Scot dug deep to claim a 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-4) victory in a match that lasted two hours 59 minutes. He recovered from two breaks of serve in the first set and two in the third to keep his hopes of reaching the final four alive. Nishikori, who won his group by beating Murray in straight sets, will play Stan Wawrinka on Saturday. The Swiss beat Marin Cilic, who had already qualified, 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (10-8). Nishikori, who has a 2-5 record against Wawrinka, said: ""I have to stay aggressive and try to play my game, dictate. ""I beat him in London two years ago and in Barcelona and we had a good match in the Olympics. I hope I can play well and it will be a great battle."" Wawrinka added: ""He's a great player, he's fast, he has a good serve, and he's a bit like me with the way he plays. ""It's going to be a tough match. He's already beaten me this year and I think we're going to have a great match."" Analysis - 'Murray's reactions were fantastic' BBC Sport's Nick Mullins at the O2 ""Murray was superb and his reactions at the net were fantastic. There was a fantastic moment in the third set when he stopped a Nishikori forehand with his racket, and then hit an amazing winner. ""If Murray wins the tournament he will be ranked number one for the first time, and he has the game to do it. ""He was down two breaks of serve in the first set but fought back and that gave him confidence. ""It was a physical battle and Murray looked tired at the end. He'll have to recover quickly and be ready for the semi-final."" Murray's revival Having been outplayed by Nishikori in a 6-4 6-4 defeat on Sunday, Murray responded in the best possible way. The Scot, who was also beaten by the world number five in the US Open quarter-finals, looked down and out when Nishikori broke serve in the first game of the match and then again in the fifth game. Nishikori's confidence was sky high but Murray found a way back into the match, winning five of the next six games to level at one set all. Both players squandered break points in the third set before it went to a tie-break, which Murray won after failing to convert four match points. Nishikori, who did not face a break point in the entire match, said: ""It was a tough match and I played well. I had some chances, but he served well. He's one of the best returners, so it's tough. I'll try to improve my serve and my game."" Murray, who has won 19 consecutive sets in London, added: ""It was a tough match, Kei played well. I didn't serve well in the first set but got better as the match went on and that helped. ""It was a very high-intensity match, there wasn't much in it. I was lucky at the end."" Earlier, Wawrinka produced a near-perfect display to see off Cilic, who did not look at his best after securing his place in the semi-finals on Wednesday. The Swiss, who has never been beyond the last four in London, was supreme at the net, winning 24 of 30 points and never facing a break point. ""I played really well,"" said Wawrinka, who won the French Open this year. ""I was moving well, I was playing aggressive. I was mixing really well and my serve was good, so it was a great match. ""I'm really happy. I'm playing well so far, so I hope I can continue."" Cilic, who is playing at the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time, was not too despondent after the defeat. ""I didn't feel bad on the court,"" he said. ""I felt good. I played good tennis. I was just a little bit off at the start of the match. I had a few chances in the first two sets to break but didn't do it and that's what decided the match. ""I think",0,686
"Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two crashes of the same plane type. I have no idea why this keeps happening, but I hope there is a definitive reason that can be found so that it can be rectified. I had a bad feeling about this one and I do not think it is a good thing to be so correct. I will not be travelling by air any time soon. Sadly, the likelihood of your getting into a plane crash is very low, so I wouldn't let this incident change your travel plans. I'm not sure about that. Some of the videos on the internet of that crash look pretty scary. And there are 2 crashes now. I wonder if the Boeing 737 Max is safe? It is, the problem lies in the pilots. Really? I would have thought that if the pilots are trained, and the plane is safe, there should be no problem. I just don't get it. Surely planes are safer now than they have ever been? There is a training issue, if you pay attention to the news, it is one of the things being investigated at the moment. I am not sure I follow, if there is a training issue, then how can the plane be safe? I assume that they are trained for all eventualities, and the training works, otherwise there would be more crashes. Yes, there are a lot of pilot trainees that never get to graduate, because they fail their training. There are also a lot of trainees that do not even get accepted for training. The training is very rigorous, and if you do not pass, you do not fly. I think that the crash was probably caused by pilot error. But that's just my opinion. That is a scary thought. I wonder if the plane manufacturers have anything to do with the training of the pilots? I just find it really strange, that in this day and age of better technology, planes are still crashing. I know that, and my point is that there should be nothing wrong with the plane. The pilots, on the other hand, need to be trained. Surely the manufacturers should have a say in the training, since they are the ones who have designed and built the plane? Surely they know what is best for the plane, and who better to train the pilots. I am sure they have a say, but the pilots are trained by the airlines that employ them. That's not good, because the airlines will only train them according to their needs. The manufacturers should have the final say, since they are the ones who know the plane the best. I am not sure how that would work, but it sounds like a plan. It would work in the best interests of the passengers. That is the whole idea, to protect the passengers. I wonder if the manufacturers will do that? I don't think they do at the moment, but they should. Maybe they should be forced to? That could be an option, but I do not think it will happen. It should, because the safety of the passengers is of paramount importance. There is a lot of testing that goes on before a plane takes to the skies, including computer simulations and real life testing. But there is no guarantee that the real life testing will be exactly the same as the testing of the plane during flight. What other things do the plane manufacturers test for? They test for all sorts of things, and not just from the manufacturer, but the airlines as well. I wonder if they test for the worst case scenario? Yes, they do, and then some. Do they ever test for the worst case scenario and the worst pilot scenario? I would imagine they do, but you never know. I wonder if they have trained pilots for all scenarios, or if the pilots are trained by the airlines? I am not sure, but I think the airlines train the pilots. Wouldn't it be better if the manufacturers trained the pilots? I would imagine that the airlines would want to train their own pilots. That's not good, because the manufacturers will have a better understanding of the plane, and know better how to train the pilots. I think you are right, but I am not sure that will happen. I think it would be a good idea if they do. I am not sure if that will happen, because it has not happened before. Maybe it",0,687

"The hosts had Josh Passley dismissed for bringing down Garry Thompson before Wycombe went ahead when Paul Hayes fired home Paris Cowan-Hall's ball. Thompson later saw red for a challenge on Ainsworth, with Sam Wood's spot kick making it 2-0. Northampton replied through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but Thompson's dismissal proved to be the turning point as Wycombe held on. Meanwhile in League Two, there was no way through for Exeter City as they were held to a goalless draw with Portsmouth at St James' Park. The Grecians were unable to find a way through the Pompey rearguard and had to settle for a point, with the visitors rarely threatening. Pompey's first-half shot count could be measured on one hand, but the second period saw a little more in the way of chances. Oxford United extended their unbeaten run to 14 games with a 1-1 draw against AFC Wimbledon at the Kassam Stadium. The Dons took the lead just after the break through Adebayo Akinfenwa, but the hosts responded well and got their equaliser through Danny Hylton. Oxford remain four points clear of fourth-placed Wycombe with two games in hand, while Wimbledon are 10th. Barnet climbed out of the bottom two in League Two with a 2-0 win at Luton Town. John Akinde put Barnet ahead in the first half with a 25-yard strike and Curtis Weston added a second with a 20-yard strike in the second half. Luton's Jack Marriott hit the woodwork twice in the first half and Alex Gilliead had a goal disallowed. Luton are now without a win in 10 league games, while Barnet won for just the second time in their last 17 matches. In League One, Wigan Athletic drew 0-0 with Sheffield United at the DW Stadium. The game was not without incident as Wigan's Max Power was sent off in the 75th minute for a foul on Billy Sharp. Shrewsbury Town kept their slim automatic promotion hopes alive with a 3-1 win over Blackpool at the Greenhous Meadow. Town took the lead through Andy Mangan, before Isaiah Osbourne was sent off for bringing down Danny Philliskirk. It was a good day for the Shrews, as they extended their winning run to six games, keeping them in touch with the automatic promotion places. Colchester United recorded their second successive win, beating Scunthorpe United 2-0 at the Community Stadium. Mikael Mandron's early goal set them on their way, with Drey Wright doubling their lead after the break. It was a disappointing result for the Iron, who have just one win in seven games. Crewe Alexandra's winless run extended to 14 games with a 1-1 draw against Doncaster Rovers at the Alexandra Stadium. Rhys Bennett's header put Doncaster ahead in the first half, but Lauri Dalla Valle equalised for Crewe after the break. The Railwaymen have now lost just one of their last five games, but have not won since 27th November. Elsewhere in League Two, York City were held to a goalless draw with Mansfield Town at Bootham Crescent. The Stags are now without a win in six games, while York are now unbeaten in four. In the National League, Torquay United slipped to the bottom of the table after a 3-0 defeat at Guiseley. The visitors had been on a decent run of form, but they found themselves three goals down after just 23 minutes. Matty Pearson gave the hosts the lead from the penalty spot after 18 minutes, and Adam Smith added two more to wrap up the victory in the first half. Chester were the big winners in the National League, as they thrashed bottom side Kidderminster Harriers 7-1 at the Exacta Stadium. Matty Hughes gave Chester the lead from close range in the first half, and his strike was added to by Kingsley James just before the break. Kidderminster did pull a goal back through Micah Evans, but that was as good as it got for them, as James (2), Ross Hannah and a Matty Brown own goal sealed an em",0,689
"The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed its investigation after it found no evidence of a defect in the vehicle. Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with a truck in Florida in May 2016. Mr Brown was using Tesla's autopilot feature, which is able to control a car during some journeys. But the NHTSA said it would ""continue to examine the issue of driver attention."" ""It should be clear that automakers can only design systems that require human driver oversight,"" said NHTSA director Mark Rosekind. ""The combined effects of human error and the lack of sufficient system controls resulted in this tragedy."" The US government had been investigating the incident since June. The NHTSA report concluded that the car's cameras had failed to recognise the truck crossing the road and that the braking system was not designed to spot vehicles crossing the car's path. The agency said that Tesla had instructed drivers to keep their hands on the wheel at all times and to remain in control of the vehicle. It said that the driver was able to see the truck for seven seconds but had ""set cruise control at 74mph (119kmh), two minutes before the crash."" ""No safety-related defect existed in the subject vehicle at the time of the crash,"" the report said. Tesla's autopilot system is intended to allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel when driving on motorways and switch on an automatic steering and lane-changing mode. But the driver is expected to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. Mr Brown's family issued a statement following the findings, saying that they hoped that the crash would lead to ""enhanced safety measures that could have prevented the crash or made its consequences less severe."" ""We heard numerous times that the car killed our son. That is simply not the case,"" they added. The family said that the autopilot feature ""is by far the most sophisticated driving-assist system on the road"" and that Mr Brown was ""a pioneer"" who ""wanted to help change the world."" Tesla said in a statement: ""We appreciate the NHTSA's analysis of last year's tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology. ""We will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.""

"Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC ""Syria is doing its best"" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its full list of chemical weapons and facilities to the OPCW, the watchdog which is overseeing its disarmament. Mr Mekdad said the UN should ask Syria's rebels if they were blocking access to chemical sites. The US and Russia brokered a deal to disarm Syria after an August sarin attack in the suburbs of Damascus killed hundreds of people. Mr Mekdad said the US and its allies were rushing to blame Syria without waiting for the OPCW to complete its work. Syria is still in the midst of a civil war which has already killed more than 100,000 people. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says Mr Mekdad's comments suggest the OPCW may soon come under pressure from Syria and Russia to pressure the rebels to allow access to chemical sites, which they say have been overrun. The statement from Mr Mekdad comes after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that his government was responsible for only 10 of the delays in the disarmament process. ""The other 90 is due to the terrorists and the countries that support them and supply them with weapons,"" he said, according to a translation provided by Syria's state news agency. Mr Assad's government refers to the rebels who are fighting against it as ""terrorists.""",0,691

Haywood admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to six years imprisonment. He was also disqualified from driving for six years. PC Browning was a popular and well-respected officer who had worked for Thames Valley Police for 12 years. Senior investigating officer, detective inspector Gordon Spirit, of the Joint Major Crime Unit, said: ""The tragic death of PC Gareth Browning has had a profound impact on the local community, his colleagues and his family. ""Haywood's actions not only deprived Gareth's family of a loving husband and father, but also the community of a highly-respected police officer. ""Haywood failed to take responsibility for his actions and attempted to pervert the course of justice by giving an alternative version of events in a bid to avoid prosecution.

"But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are illegal. The industrial action was not by doctors, and most of the action was in England and Northern Ireland. Media captionIs the NHS up for sale? But with some patients having operations cancelled and others turned away from AE, the NHS was not operating normally. The mood of the public, too, is far from supportive. An opinion poll carried out for the BBC by ComRes suggests most people do not think the NHS is up for sale. The poll also shows that most people think the NHS is being damaged by the strike. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been talking about the health service as a ""crown jewel"" - something that is precious and not for sale. But what does he mean? The government has repeatedly said the NHS will not be ""on the table"" in trade talks with the US. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is going further and saying it won't even be in the room - that no-one is going to discuss the NHS when the trade talks get going. But there is a problem. The US has said the NHS is exactly what it wants to talk about. The acting US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said recently: ""I think everything should be on the table."" There are some who think the NHS is just too important to be part of trade negotiations - that if the US is determined to talk about the NHS, the UK should walk away from the table. In a poll for the BBC's Panorama programme, only a quarter of people agreed with the US that the NHS should be up for discussion. The Department of Health and Social Care says there are three things that mean the NHS will not be on the table: ""There are lots of things that we're not going to be discussing with the US, as a matter of principle. One of them is pharmaceuticals and drug pricing. Another is the NHS. And a third is food standards. So, those three things, as a matter of principle, we are not going to include in trade talks with the US,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We're not going to accept any diminution of food standards, we're not going to discuss drug pricing, and we're not going to put the NHS on the table."" This sounds pretty clear, but it may not be enough to reassure critics of a trade deal with the US. The prime minister has talked about removing barriers to trade, and that might include opening up the NHS to more private companies. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants to renationalise the NHS - putting it all back into public ownership. There are some who argue the NHS is not up for sale - and that the whole debate is a bit of a distraction. The government has promised to give the NHS an extra 33.9bn a year in funding by 2023-24. It has also pledged to bring down waiting times for treatment and to upgrade buildings and facilities. That is not enough, say critics, who argue that the NHS has been run down and neglected. They want to see more funding - up to 40bn a year extra. If that money is not forthcoming, they say, the NHS could be sold off bit by bit. In the ComRes poll, people were asked whether the NHS was being damaged by the strike. The poll found that people are more likely to think the NHS is being damaged by the strike than that it is not. But half of people (51) said the NHS was not being damaged by the strike, and a third of people (34) said it was. It has been a difficult day for the NHS - and there are more industrial actions to come.",0,693

"However, the resolution is non-binding, with Nigeria and Senegal opposing a withdrawal. South Africa and Burundi have already decided to withdraw, accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty and unfairly targeting Africans. The ICC, which sits in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in 2002 to prosecute the worst crimes, where national courts are unable or unwilling to take cases forward. The move by South Africa to leave followed a dispute last year when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the country despite being the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. The ICC said Burundi's withdrawal did not affect the preliminary examination of the country's situation already under way by the court's prosecutor. ""We wish to reiterate that Burundi remains under preliminary examination by the court, with respect to crimes committed on its territory or by nationals of Burundi since April 2015,"" ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah told Reuters news agency. ""We continue to closely follow the situation in Burundi,"" he added, declining further comment. The court has faced criticism that most of its cases have involved African nations. The court has had to fight off allegations of pursuing a neo-colonial agenda in Africa, where all but one of its 10 full investigations have been based. ""The ICC, despite its serious efforts, has been unable to address impunity,"" he said, adding that the court had also failed to respond to calls to address Africa's concerns. ""This decision is the result of careful consideration,"" he added. ICC judges have issued arrest warrants for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and others over allegations of genocide in Darfur. In 2015, South Africa was criticised for allowing Mr Bashir to visit the country. The ICC has never convicted anyone for genocide. However, in 2016, former Congolese Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC was established by the Rome Statute in 2002. It has been ratified by 123 countries, including 34 African states. According to the Statute, countries can only withdraw with effect from one year after giving written notification.",0,695

The head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, said 25 civilians were killed in the strikes, including five children and a woman. The US-led coalition has been bombarding ISIS positions in and around Manbij, to the west of the Euphrates River, since the SDF, a Kurdish-Arab alliance, pushed into the city in May. It was not immediately clear if the bombardment was the result of an air strike or shelling, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

They happened in Caerphilly, Newport and Blaenau Gwent. Det Ch Insp Stuart Griffiths said: ""There is a possibility that these incidents are the result of one or more people targeting drug users in the hope of stealing from them."" He said there was a ""small chance"" that the incidents were the result of ""contaminated or impure batches of heroin."" He added: ""We are extremely concerned about these incidents and are advising anyone who may have information to contact us as a matter of urgency. ""There is a chance that the substance which has caused the problems may still be in circulation. ""I would like to take this opportunity to warn heroin users that they may be at risk of taking contaminated or impure drugs. ""The side effects can be extremely serious and users are advised to be extremely cautious, to be aware of their own personal health and well-being and to seek urgent medical attention should they become unwell or begin to feel unwell."" Wales Ambulance Service said it had responded to two incidents in Caerphilly and one in Newport. A spokeswoman said paramedics had been called to Blaenau Gwent and Cardiff, but that these had not been in relation to the heroin alert.",0,697
"He complained that Dawn Bowden referred to ""Goebbels-like propaganda from the right-wing media"" in a recent debate. He claimed Eluned Morgan ""trivialised suicide"" when saying Brexit would ""slit the wrists of the nation."" Nathan Gill said a number of Labour and Plaid Cymru AMs had ""sought to belittle and mock"" the First Minister. He said Rhun ap Iorwerth said the First Minister should ""go home to the sheep,"" referring to him as ""a farm boy from the Vale of Glamorgan."" Mr Gill also said, when Neil McEvoy was a Labour AM, he had referred to Mr Jones as ""a lamb in sheep's clothing"" - Mr McEvoy is now an independent AM. Mr Gill said the comments ""reflect an utter lack of respect."" He said: ""It's time to call an end to this nasty and vicious narrative. ""It's about time we had a debate and a discussion about what is best for the people of Wales, and stop this descent into the abyss."" The First Minister is leaving his post in December and will be replaced by a new leader for Welsh Labour, which will be announced on Thursday. He was asked if his comments were a dig at his Labour successors who would take over, but he replied: ""My point is this: whoever is going to be the next first minister of Wales, whether it's a Labour first minister, whether it's a Plaid Cymru first minister or a Conservative first minister, they should be treated with respect."" Mr Gill said he would not comment on how he had been treated when he was an AM. The Brexit Party AM had to stand down from his role to comply with rules which prevent members from holding both Westminster and assembly seats. AMs debate whether national parliaments should be able to block the European Union from ending the Brexit transition period. Mr Jones replied: ""The honourable member, as he so often does, has got it wrong. ""He has sought to create a narrative which is at complete odds with the reality of what has happened over the course of this last couple of days. ""The UK Government, in their desperation, reached out to Labour to get a Brexit agreement and the Labour Party, in its wisdom, said no. ""I don't see any Labour AMs saying that they should have said yes."" The leader of the House, Julie James, said the First Minister should be ""allowed to speak without interruption."" A number of AMs have also complained about the way the Welsh Government has responded to the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Bill, which would give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Ms James said the Welsh Government had ""not sought to delay, or block, or derail, the bill,"" but there were ""significant concerns"" about it. She said the government was ""right to be concerned about the potential effect of the bill on the wider electoral system.""",0,698
"The Staffordshire club are second in the Premiership - the top-flight of English rugby as it stands - and have been part of the league for 15 seasons. Lichfield director of rugby John Muldowney admitted he was surprised at the outcome. ""We're in shock because the professional clubs all voted against us,"" he told BBC Radio Stoke. ""We're disappointed to lose the opportunity to play in the Championship. It's a setback but it's not a disaster."" If the RFU Council approves the plan, which they are expected to do, it would come into effect from the 2010-11 season. The RFU has made the decision to reduce the number of professional teams in England after seeing a recent drop in standards within the game. England's failure at the Rugby World Cup and a poor showing in the Six Nations campaign this year have been seen as a major contributing factor to the RFU's decision. In addition, it is hoped that cutting the number of teams will allow the quality of rugby to be improved in the country. ""It's a little disappointing but you can understand the RFU's view. They want the professional game to be as competitive as it can be,"" Muldowney said. ""The standard of rugby has dropped, there is no doubt about that. It's a shame that we haven't got the opportunity to play in the Championship but you have to move on. This is a setback but it's not the end of the world. We'll regroup and move on and see what the future holds."" Lichfield are second in the National Division One and are just one point behind leaders Worcester. It is believed that the likes of Doncaster and the Cornish Pirates could be promoted, if they don't make the play-offs for the Championship. Hopefully this will be the start of the decline in professional rugby in this country. I know I have mentioned this before but the standard in the domestic game is just terrible. The sooner the clubs realise this and that the fans want to see a more competitive league the better. The Championship is a joke at the moment with only 45 teams being in any way competitive. It is a shame that Lichfield have missed out but they are the only team I can think of that have shown an interest in being promoted. Hopefully this will be the start of the decline in professional rugby in this country. I know I have mentioned this before but the standard in the domestic game is just terrible. I agree 100 with the above comments. The standard in the Championship is pathetic, with only a few teams actually trying to win the league and the majority of them trying to finish mid-table. The sooner we see the demise of professional rugby in this country the better. Hopefully Lichfield will get promoted next season and the Championship will revert to it's old name of National League One. One of the problems is that a lot of the clubs are thinking about what they can get out of the Championship rather than what they can offer. The sooner we see the demise of professional rugby in this country the better. I don't think you'll see the demise of professional rugby in this country, not anytime soon anyway. But I do agree that the level of professionalism needs to be higher than what it is now. The sooner we see the demise of professional rugby in this country the better.

Meanwhile, a Brexit Party supporter on the Isle of Wight has been arrested for daubing a swastika on the door of a Labour MP. A 62 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a racially or religiously aggravated public order offence. No action was taken against the spray-paint manufacturer or the MP's wife, who was overheard to say, ""Oh no! Now the whole street will think we're racists."" The government has been urged to ban a controversial book which may be a manifesto for terrorism, by exposing readers to the hateful beliefs of a fringe extremist group. The ""Little Red Book"" is the subject of an online petition which has attracted thousands of signatures since it was launched earlier this week. The document is published by the Communist Party of China. One of its most notorious passages says: ""The people of the world cannot be liberated except through socialism."" It is freely available on the internet and can be bought in bookshops, although it has been banned in Vietnam and Mongolia. It is believed to have inspired several terrorist incidents, including the Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four, the Great Leap Forward and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Critics say that reading the book can make people more susceptible to far-right ideology and racism, and can even encourage them to join the Communist Party. ""We don't want to see a repeat of the atrocities committed by communist regimes around the world,"" said one signatory to the petition. ""It's bad enough that they get away with murdering people and crushing free speech, but they shouldn't be allowed to recruit new members in this country as well.""

"David Cameron said a stadium would ""inspire young people, brings jobs and wealth"" to the county.

""I think it would be great for the country to have a World Cup bid, I think it would be great for us to host it again, I think it would be great for the West Midlands,"" Mr Cameron said. ""I think it would inspire young people, brings jobs and wealth and great opportunities and we've got some fantastic football clubs, some fantastic stadiums. ""We've got good transport links, good motorway links, good rail links, good airports, a fantastic fan base. We have got everything that is required to host a great World Cup and to bring it back to this country. ""The World Cup was fantastic when we had it in this country. We had great stadiums, great fan zones, great transport links, great hospitality and we had great football as well so this is an opportunity for this country to show what it can do."" Olympics minister Hugh Robertson said the government was ""working very closely with the Football Association"" on a bid. A final decision on whether to bid is due to be made in 2018, but an FA spokesman said the ""indications from all parties are very positive."" But it is not thought the Prime Minister had spoken to any of his ministerial colleagues before making his comments. Earlier, Labour's shadow culture secretary, Harriet Harman, said the prime minister's intervention was a ""cynical attempt to distract attention from the Conservative Party's catastrophic failure to get to grips with football's corruption crisis"" following the disclosure that the Tories received a 30,000 donation from the company of a former FIFA official shortly before the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. ""The Prime Minister should focus on the immediate issue of football's corruption crisis, not a World Cup bid that would not take place until 2030,"" she said. ""He should be dealing with the present - the corruption and bribery and corporate sponsorship - rather than talking about the future."" The Labour party said it would ""support a credible and deliverable bid to host the World Cup."" A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ""A World Cup bid would be a great idea but only if it was deliverable, affordable and, most importantly, had the full backing of football fans and the grassroots of the game. ""Unfortunately, as we have seen with the Olympics and the EU referendum, David Cameron has a habit of making big promises he can't keep."" A spokesman for UKIP said the announcement was ""nothing more than a publicity stunt and an empty promise."" He said: ""Instead of trying to make cheap headlines, Mr Cameron should be using his political capital to reform the FA, the game's governing body, which is now a cesspit of corruption and incompetence. ""Instead of making empty promises to host a World Cup in 15 years' time, he should be focusing on the here and now.

Dozens of people wearing military-style clothes gathered at the burial of Mairead O'Hara at Ballygawley, Co Tyrone, yesterday. Police said a gun was fired during the funeral, although no one was hurt. A police officer was hurt by a brick and several vehicles were damaged. Dozens of people wearing masks and black clothing, some carrying banners in support of the INLA, attended the service at St Mary's Church. A number of people wearing balaclavas carried a coffin draped in the Irish tricolour. The coffin was carried to the grave by a masked man with a black beret, along with men wearing berets and carrying replica rifles. One man wearing a beret and black gloves carried a black flag bearing the name of the INLA. A number of people stood in salute and gave the clenched fist salute as the coffin was lowered into the grave. Two men were arrested on suspicion of disorderly behaviour and a further two arrests were made for public order offences. Police are also investigating reports of shots being fired at a police vehicle as it passed a funeral house following the service.

Gatland says his players have been working hard, but are focused on the job at hand against the Chiefs. ""We had a very good session today [Sunday], and the boys have been working hard,"" he said. ""We had a good recovery day yesterday, and we've just got to keep things ticking over for Tuesday."" Wales' Gareth Davies starts at scrumhalf in place of Ben Youngs. Owen Farrell comes in for George Ford at flyhalf, and Elliot Daly will make his first Test start at outside centre. Liam Williams and Jack Nowell will contest the right wing jersey, with England's Anthony Watson moving to the left wing, while Mike Williams has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. British and Irish Lions head coach Warren Gatland has confirmed that Billy Vunipola will not feature in the British and Irish Lions' first Test against New Zealand next weekend. Vunipola dislocated his left shoulder in the second half of the Lions' 22-16 victory over the Otago Highlanders in Dunedin last Saturday. The Lions have also ruled out second-row Iain Henderson. ""It's a massive blow to lose Billy,"" said Gatland. ""He's been a big player for us and his contribution since coming on tour has been immense."" The Lions are also without injured England trio Billy Vunipola (shoulder), Joe Launchbury (calf) and Jack Nowell (ankle). Jonathan Sexton, Tadhg Furlong, George Kruis, Owen Farrell and Mako Vunipola all return to the starting XV for the Lions' match against the Maori All Blacks in Rotorua on Saturday. They come in for Johnny Sexton, Dan Biggar, CJ Stander, Peter O'Mahony and Ben Te'o respectively, with the quintet named on the replacements bench. Alun Wyn Jones (shoulder) and Ben Te'o (calf) are ruled out. ""It's great to have them back,"" said Gatland. ""We have spoken about the importance of the squad and how everyone has a part to play. ""We saw on Tuesday night what a good performance the bench gave and it was important to reward those players who have worked hard and get them another start. ""We are really looking forward to the game on Saturday and seeing the players express themselves and play some attacking rugby. The Maori All Blacks are a very proud and accomplished team, and we will have to be somewhere near our very best to beat them."" England's Maro Itoje has been added to the squad for the British and Irish Lions' third tour match against the Crusaders on Saturday. Itoje arrives in New Zealand on Monday after playing for Saracens in Saturday's Aviva Premiership final defeat to Exeter Chiefs. His late arrival to the Lions squad means he will be ineligible for selection for this weekend's game against the Crusaders in Christchurch. Itoje will be available for selection for the final match against the Hurricanes on Tuesday. The Lions have also added three players to their squad for their match against the New Zealand Maori on June 17. Scotland wing Tommy Seymour, England wing Jack Nowell and Ireland flyhalf Paddy Jackson have all been added to the touring party. They replace Ireland wing Simon Zebo, who has been ruled out with a hand injury, as well as Wales flyhalf Dan Biggar and Wales centre Jonathan Davies, who have both been ruled out of the tour with shoulder and foot injuries respectively. British and Irish Lions boss Warren Gatland has named a 41-man squad for the tour of New Zealand this summer. The Lions will play 10 matches, including three Tests, on the tour and the first game takes place against the New Zealand Provincial Barbarians in Whangarei on Saturday June 3. The squad includes 16 English players, 12 Welshmen, 11 Irishmen and two Scots. ""I am hugely excited by the squad that has been selected for the 2017 tour of New Zealand,"" said",0,717
"The works on Gdynia Way near Plymouth's city centre have been in place since June to widen the road to three lanes. But police said they had seen an increase in crashes in the area. Temporary average speed cameras have been set up in the roadworks area, but police said the speed limit was not being enforced because the signs were being obscured by vegetation. Devon and Cornwall Police said it had seen an increase in the number of accidents in the area during the roadworks. A police spokesperson said: ""Due to the increased number of accidents on the Gdynia Way roadworks, we have put a stop on any prosecution for speeding. ""This is due to the speed limit signs being obscured by vegetation, so in the interest of road safety, the speed limit is not being enforced. ""We continue to encourage all drivers to take extra care and attention in this area."" The roadworks project is part of a wider scheme to improve the A386 Tavistock Road, and was intended to be completed by the end of the year. The Gdynia Way stretch of the road is currently down to one lane, and a 40mph speed limit is in place. The project is also intended to improve cycle and pedestrian facilities in the area, as well as the junctions of Gdynia Way, and Outland Road and Tavistock Road. Plymouth City Council said the roadworks would be completed by the end of the year.

"He argued that you can only have a vibrant West End if you've got a strong regional base developing the talent and he sees no reason why so much more money shouldn't be spent outside London. In terms of the economics of his own work he added: ""I think I've always been a pragmatist. I would love to do a three or four week run of a new play at The Cottesloe Theatre but I haven't yet. ""It's not economically viable for me to do that because I couldn't afford to do it and I don't have time. It's not what I'm paid to do in the sense that it's not what people pay me for. ""It doesn't mean that I wouldn't do it if somebody asked me but I'm not going to ask them."" The topic of ageism in theatre was also raised by an audience member and it was clear that Lloyd Webber has a real bugbear about the matter. He told the audience: ""I'm very, very upset about the whole age thing. I think it's awful. I'm not just talking about what happens in the West End, I'm talking about what happens in schools and colleges. ""I'm so upset at the whole idea of getting rid of everybody over 40 in our business and what it's doing to our industry. ""I think it's a terrible, terrible thing. I'm glad to see that in the last year or two some people are getting to play leads in the West End who are over 40 and it seems to be going down better than ever. ""So I hope that people will think that a bit more and I think that we've got to be very careful about the whole age thing. ""But I think that's just a wider part of an ageist society and I'm very much against that. I think it's a dreadful, dreadful thing that we're doing in our society at the moment."" On the topic of casting Lloyd Webber was asked whether he ever has a vision of who will play a role when he writes a piece. He replied: ""I don't normally have a vision of who's going to play the role. I think I'm a very pragmatic person and so it depends on who's available at the time. ""When I wrote Jesus Christ Superstar I was going to play it on my own on the piano and then we realised that somebody had to sing it. ""I wouldn't have cast Glenn Carter if it hadn't been that he happened to be the one I heard singing one afternoon and I thought 'he's just great'.""",0,719
"East Sussex Wildlife Rescue said it had rescued 25 birds in the last 12 months at Ditchling Common Country Park. In the latest incident a fishing hook had to be removed from the bird's wing. In 2015, a jay was caught in a trap at Ditchling. The bird was discovered by a couple out walking their dog. The East Sussex Wildlife Rescue and Ambulance Service (WRAS) went to rescue the bird and found it caught in a wire trap. Worried about the safety of others, the charity contacted East Sussex County Council and Brighton and Hove City Council to highlight the dangers of traps. Now the charity has revealed that another jay has been caught in a trap. The bird has been taken to a vet to have the trap removed. Trevor Weeks MBE, founder and director of East Sussex Wildlife Rescue and Ambulance Service, said: ""We are very worried about the use of these traps. They are indiscriminate and can cause a lot of injury. ""There are alternative ways of trying to reduce the number of birds without the risk of trapping non-target species like this jay, which is a protected species. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: ""It is disappointing to hear that another bird has been caught in a trap. We understand the trap was a legally-set trap, and we are pleased that the bird has been taken to a vet to have the trap removed. ""The RSPCA is opposed to the use of traps for the purpose of pest control as they have the potential to cause unnecessary suffering.

"21 October 2016 Last updated at 15:03 BST In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but none have been spotted since 2012. A survey in 2013 found only 36 on the British coastline, compared with 75 in 2003. Dr Dan Bolt, who led the survey, said the decline had been ""quite shocking."" ""Seahorses are quite charismatic and people like seeing them,"" he said. ""They're a very important species in terms of the habitats they live in. They can tell us a lot about the health of the sea, so they're a very good indicator of the health of the environment."" He said the seahorse survey was the first in the UK to combine local knowledge and expertise with science. The team at the Marine Biological Association (MBA) in Plymouth is working with members of the public, tourism businesses and conservation groups to study the problems affecting seahorse populations. ""We're hoping the message will spread across the coasts of Devon and Cornwall and then even wider,"" said Dr Bolt. The information being gathered will help researchers try to understand the reasons behind the decline. Dr Jane Hawkins, from the MBA, said seahorses are ""incredibly vulnerable to the effects of humans."" ""The problems are loss of habitat, pollution and also incidental fishing bycatch,"" she said. ""The fishing industry are very keen to work with us to try and avoid catching these animals because they know that bycatching seahorses is illegal. ""If they are caught, bycatching a seahorse, they have to stop fishing and return to shore and report it. That's costly to them, so they want to avoid that."" The project is part of the MBA's new citizen science strategy, and Dr Bolt said he hoped it would lead to a ""broader engagement"" with the public. ""We want to involve people in the work that we do so that we can be more effective and efficient in terms of what we do,"" he said. We] will engage people more in science, in the work that's happening in their local area, and try to get them involved in projects that interest them."" The survey team is also studying a number of other marine species, including the short-snouted seahorse. ""The short-snouted seahorse is quite unusual, in that it's only found in the Mediterranean and in the UK,"" said Dr Bolt. ""It's quite a large-bodied seahorse, so it's quite interesting. ""But we know almost nothing about them. We don't know how long they live for, we don't know their breeding habits, we don't know how many there are, so there's a lot of work to be done."" The short-snouted seahorse is said to be the only one that does not change colour when it's stressed, and it only eats live food.",0,722

There was little goalmouth action at either end until the 25th minute when Liam Bridcutt played in Morison, who fired home from the edge of the penalty area. The home side continued to look the more likely to score in the second half and their second goal arrived in the 57th minute when Morison set up Bridcutt, who fired past Ben Foster.

"In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed by police. In a statement, the Paris prosecutor said the men ""came out shooting."" They killed a police officer in the street before escaping to the building, taking a hostage, according to the French Interior Ministry. The hostage was released unharmed, police said. Three other suspects are also being sought in connection with Wednesday's attack on the magazine, in which 12 people were killed. The brothers had been under police surveillance after the younger one, Cherif Kouachi, was convicted of terrorism offences in 2008. Seven more people were detained in raids across the country on Thursday and police are searching for Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Cherif Kouachi. French media reported that Cherif Kouachi, 32, was sentenced to three years in prison, with 18 months suspended, in 2008 for terrorism offences. He was alleged to have been involved in the recruitment of fighters for Iraq. His brother, Said Kouachi, 34, was reported to have been under investigation from 2008 for links to the same network. French police released photographs of the two suspects on Thursday morning, describing them as ""armed and dangerous."" The suspects were named by a French official and by an anti-terrorism expert who spoke to The Associated Press news agency. A third suspect, Hamyd Mourad, 18, surrendered at a police station in Charleville-Mezieres, near the Belgian border, on Wednesday. ""He introduced himself and presented himself to the police,"" said a local official. The suspects' identities were disclosed after counter-terrorism police said they had identified two of the suspects by analysing surveillance video. Cherif Kouachi was also identified by his fingerprint, which was found on a Kalashnikov magazine left in the getaway car, according to the French TV station iTele. The black Citroen C3 was abandoned in a street in northern Paris, where the attackers hijacked another car. A source close to the investigation said Said Kouachi had been under close surveillance by the DGSI intelligence agency. The DGSI had been monitoring his phone calls and e-mails ""for years,"" the source told AFP news agency. One of the people being sought is Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, who had been living with Cherif Kouachi, said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins. ""There is a search for a young lady born on 20 October 1988, of Tunisian nationality, named Hayat Boumeddiene,"" he said. She was not involved in the attack, he said, but her partner was. He also said the suspects were known to security services, but were not considered an ""imperative"" threat. The Kouachi brothers are believed to have been behind the shooting at the Charlie Hebdo offices on Wednesday. Charlie Hebdo's latest tweet was a cartoon of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Its last tweet before the attack was a cartoon of the IS militant group's leader giving season's greetings. The satirical magazine has drawn protests in the past with its cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. It published a record print run of one million copies of its latest issue on Wednesday, featuring an image of the Prophet Muhammad weeping. French President Francois Hollande has said several terrorist attacks had been thwarted in recent weeks. World leaders have condemned the attack. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the assault on Charlie Hebdo was ""not just an attack on French citizens but... on freedom of speech and the press, core elements of our free, democratic culture."" ""We are all Charlie Hebdo,"" she said, using a slogan that trended on Twitter after the attack.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (PS11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to either deposit their old notes in a bank - which trigger questions from officials if amounts deposited are suspiciously high - or exchange them for new bills. Cash dispensers at banks have been emptied as millions queue for hours in the hope of withdrawing money, while the government has put a daily limit on cash machine withdrawals of 2,500 rupees. The result has been a crippling shortage of cash, with people in cities and villages alike being forced to use credit and debit cards for the first time and ATMs running dry within hours, if they are working at all. Narendra Modi took the decision to withdraw the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation in a surprise announcement on November 8, in a bid to tackle corruption and black money. The news of the withdrawal sent shockwaves through the financial system as people flocked to banks to exchange their old notes for new ones, forming queues that lasted hours. Banks were closed on the following day, a public holiday, and reopened on November 10, by which time the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), had issued a new 2,000 rupee note and a new 500 rupee note. The RBI also set limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs at 2,500 rupees per day and 24,000 rupees per week, while limits were also applied to over-the-counter withdrawals from banks, which were set at 10,000 rupees per day and 24,000 per week. In an address to the nation on November 8, Modi said: ""Black money and corruption are the biggest obstacles in eradicating poverty."" Referring to the surprise element of the decision, he added: ""To minimise the difficulties of citizens in the coming days, several steps are being taken. ""1. Persons holding old notes of five hundred or one thousand rupees can deposit these notes in their bank or post office accounts from 10th November till close of banking hours on 30th December 2016 without any limit. ""2. Thus you will have 50 days to deposit your notes and there is no need for panic. ""3. Your money will remain yours. You need have no worry on this point. ""4. After depositing your money in your account, you can draw it when you need it. ""5. Keeping in mind the supply of new notes, in the first few days, there will be a limit of ten thousand rupees per day and twenty thousand rupees per week. This limit will be increased in the coming days. ""6. Apart from depositing your notes in your bank account, another facility will also be there. ""7. For your immediate needs, you can go to any bank, head post office or sub post office, show your identity proof like Aadhaar card, voter card, ration card, passport, PAN card or other approved proofs, and exchange your old five hundred or thousand rupee notes for new notes. ""8. From 10th November till 24th November, the limit for such exchange will be four thousand rupees. From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased. ""9. There may be some who, for some reason, are not able to deposit their old five hundred or thousand rupee notes by 30th December 2016. ""10.

The student was detained for trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel in 2016. He was sentenced to 15 years hard labour. He was returned to the US last week in a coma. The funeral service took place at Wyoming High School, where he graduated in 2013. His family has not disclosed the cause of his death. ""He's home and we believe he's at peace,"" said Fred Warmbier, his father. He said he believed his son had been tortured in detention.

The North Korean statement did not mention the student's neurological injuries, which doctors say are consistent with brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen. Heartbroken parents By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Wyoming, Ohio The funeral service was a private affair, open only to friends and family. A small crowd of reporters gathered outside the building and they were joined by a few locals. Some of them said they had known the family for years, and shared their grief. The day before the funeral, Otto Warmbier's father had spoken publicly for the first time since his son's death. He was critical of the North Koreans, and also the Obama administration, which he accused of failing to act quickly enough to secure his son's release. Otto Warmbier's parents have remained silent since his return to the US last week. The only indication of how they're feeling was their decision to bury their son, not in his hometown, but in his school. Their son was a gifted student, academically and athletically. They are his proud parents. President Donald Trump said he was determined to ""prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency."" ""The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim,"" he said in a written statement. Mr Trump said he had spoken to Mr Warmbier's parents and told them their son had ""inspired a sense of unity"" in America.

Audience member Angelique Flynn - whose question about whether a UK-only points-based immigration system would work prompted the exchange - told BBC Radio 4's World At One she was concerned that it was ""becoming a real theme"" in the debate. ""The EU has its problems but immigration isn't the cause of all of them,"" she said. 'Unfettered immigration' Ms Sturgeon said ""the EU isn't perfect,"" but warned that if the UK voted to leave it would be ""the hardest of Brexits."" She said she did not believe the UK would be able to continue its membership of the single market, ""because to do so would require you to accept the free movement of people."" ""That's what the rest of the EU would insist upon, and you'd have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" she added. ""I don't believe there is the remotest chance, if we vote to leave the EU, that we would be able to negotiate a deal that gave us full access to the single market while not accepting the free movement of people."" But Mr Farage said he believed the UK could negotiate an alternative arrangement and said there was ""huge public concern"" about the level of immigration. ""I'm not saying immigration is not a good thing,"" he added. ""But what people don't want is unfettered immigration, where people come here, don't have a job to go to, don't have health insurance.""

He also said that, while the European Convention on Human Rights was ""not perfect,"" it had been ""a good thing"" for the UK. Mr Farage said the UK should leave the European Court of Human Rights as well as the EU, saying there was ""no way we can accept the European Court of Human Rights continuing to overrule UK Supreme Court judgements."" Ms Sturgeon said Mr Farage's ""intolerant"" views on immigration and human rights were ""an insight into the type of Britain he wants to create if he gets his way."" Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said the UK was ""stronger, safer and better off"" in the EU, saying: ""It has brought investment, it has brought jobs, it has brought prosperity.

"Cumbernauld has the dubious distinction of winning the Plook on the Plinth title for having Scotland's ""most dismal"" town centre in 2001 and 2005. Judges have compared it to Kabul and Beirut. It was designed in the 1950s to house Glasgow's overspill and in the 1960s it was Scotland's largest new town. Cumbernauld is the 10th most populated locality in Scotland, with a population of 50,000, and has the 6th largest shopping centre in Scotland. My work was inspired by the town's reputation, the problem of the thousands of empty shops that have closed in the town centre and the ubiquitous images of the hooded youth. The young people in my paintings have a sinister quality, they are wearing hoods, they are spraying graffiti, they are spraying paint, and they are carrying their skateboards, all of which makes them look like vandals. The skateboarders in Cumbernauld have a bad reputation for causing damage to the town centre. I use the skateboarders to represent the youth of Cumbernauld.",0,740
"Speaking about the 1948 contract Nye Bevan, the founding father of the NHS, offered consultants, he said he had ""stuffed their mouths with gold."" That gold was the ability to top up NHS salaries with private work. The government is going to stop this pernicious practice. The Times reports: Consultants will be banned from earning more than 150,000 a year in private practice under radical NHS reforms to be announced by Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, this week. The move is part of a package to allow the NHS to compete with the private sector by improving efficiency and reducing bureaucracy. Mr Lansley believes that the government must get better value for money from the 110 billion spent on the NHS each year. Hospitals will be allowed to pay consultants higher salaries if they treat more patients or work at weekends. If the consultant works more in the NHS, they will be able to earn more than 150,000. The current system means that some consultants earn millions of pounds a year by treating private patients at weekends while still earning a full-time salary from the NHS. I hope this proposal is extended to the GPs, too. Labels: NHS, Nye Bevan",0,741
"Only 50.5 overs were possible at the MCG, but Australia still got wickets at regular intervals with Jackson Bird taking two for 53. Azhar's 110-ball half-century saw him pass 1,000 Test runs, while his captain Misbah-ul-Haq fell for 11 to the fifth ball of the day's play, edging a ball from Bird to Steven Smith at second slip. Pakistan were 132 for three at tea, but they collapsed shortly after the break. Australia's pace trio of Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Jackson Bird were in fine form and were all among the wickets with Hazlewood taking two for 20, Bird two for 53 and Starc two for 64. Following that, the wicket of Babar Azam (14) to a loose shot off the bowling of Hazlewood seemed to throw Pakistan off. Opener Sharjeel Khan's 50 came off 33 balls, with seven fours and three sixes. ""Pakistan's bowling attack is phenomenal, they have quick bowlers and they're different to our bowlers."" Sharjeel was involved in a 50-run opening stand with Azhar Ali, who was dropped on four by Smith at second slip off Bird. Khan's 50 came off 33 balls, with seven fours and three sixes. ""We have a few plans but it will depend on the wicket,"" he added. Azhar's 110-ball half-century saw him pass 1,000 Test runs, while his captain Misbah-ul-Haq fell for 11 to the fifth ball of the day's play, edging a ball from Bird to Steven Smith at second slip. With the ball doing plenty, they were able to take advantage of Pakistan's failure to post a first-innings total to really put pressure on the home side. ""We have a few plans but it will depend on the wicket."" Sharjeel was brilliantly caught by a diving Smith for 50 off Starc, but in the next over, Azhar brought up his half-century. ""It's a challenging wicket, but we have to work hard and we know it's not going to be easy,"" he added.",0,742

"The security breach led to the possible theft of bitcoin worth 65m (PS49m). Bitfinex told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen from its exchange, about a fifth of the currency it handles. Bitcoin exchanges in China and the United States are also dealing with the effects of the attack. Bitfinex, a digital asset trading platform, has been the victim of a security breach. The breach was first reported by Zane Tackett on Reddit, who posted a screenshot of a Bitfinex page confirming the hack. A spokesperson for the company said on Twitter that the breach is under investigation and that the exchange is working with law enforcement agencies. Bitfinex is the world's largest dollar-based exchange for bitcoin, and is known in the industry for having deep liquidity in the USDBTC pair. Bitcoin fell 2 Wednesday to 572.62, a 21 drop from its recent high of 719.78. ""We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen,"" the company said in a statement on its website. The price of bitcoin, the digital currency that many have called the biggest innovation since the internet, is down more than 20 this week. The digital currency is now trading around 628. The company also explained that all services were being suspended as they investigate the security breach. Bitfinex is the largest dollar-based exchange for bitcoin. Bitcoin's value plummeted after a theft of 60 million of the currency. ""Bitfinex customers who were holding more than 0.5 BTC in their wallets will lose up to 36 of their funds,"" said Zane Tackett in a Reddit post. What will happen to the lost Bitcoin? Bitcoin trading has been suspended for all of Wednesday. The funds were said to have been transferred to ""several digital wallets"" and the company was trying to track them down. Bitcoin fell as much as 11 percent on Wednesday to a one-month low of 558.42 on the BitStamp platform. The price of bitcoin fell to 541 on Wednesday, the lowest in nearly a month, and was down more than 12 for the week, according to CoinDesk. Joshua Zipkin, a spokesman for Bitfinex, told Reuters the exchange was investigating the breach. It's not immediately clear how much money was stolen, but the price of the cryptocurrency has fallen sharply in the wake of the hack. Bitfinex said it will update customers once it has more information. Bitfinex suspended its trading services on Tuesday after its system was targeted by a cyber attack. The Ethereum developers plan to do a hard fork after the hacking of the DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. The digital currency is accepted as a form of payment by several major online retailers and can be swapped for cash at exchange bureaus. As the news of the hack circulated, the price of Bitcoin was falling, dropping below the 600 mark for the first time in a month. Bitcoin's total value, or market cap, has been halved in the past month, dropping to about 9 billion at the time of writing. It's not the first time bitcoins have been stolen. In March, Bitfinex's systems were breached, resulting in the theft of 1500 bitcoins, worth around 650,000 at the time. Britain's vote to leave the European Union has also led to some selling of bitcoin, which may have been bought on expectations of a so-called Brexit bounce. Bitcoin has been increasing in value since 2009 when they were worth less than 1.

"Reactions range from the ""BBC has killed Top Gear,"" to praise for a ""brave BBC."" The story was also news for media in areas as far apart as Latin America and Australia. The BBC's online announcement of Clarkson's contract not being renewed was the most shared and viewed story on its website on Wednesday, the corporation said. The 54-year-old was suspended last month following what the BBC said was ""a physical altercation with a BBC producer,"" which occurred at the end of filming on location in Surrey. Clarkson had been given a final warning in May 2014 following a racism row, but the BBC said his latest outburst was the ""final straw."" It's still unclear what actually happened between Clarkson and producer Oisin Tymon, but it's believed to have involved a dispute over a hot meal. A second person who was present during the fracas has claimed Clarkson punched Tymon to the floor, before shouting a series of expletives at him. Clarkson's replacement has yet to be announced, but TV presenter Chris Evans and radio DJ Zoe Ball have been tipped as potential hosts. The BBC has confirmed ""Top Gear"" will return in 2016, but it is unclear when filming will start. Hannah Gale, a journalist at the UK women's lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, wrote an article saying that Clarkson's dismissal was a ""victory"" for women. ""Whether Clarkson did punch Oisin Tymon or not, the very fact that he felt it was appropriate to have a physical altercation with a member of his team is absolutely shocking,"" Gale wrote. ""Especially in the workplace. I'm not sure many people would be able to get away with that without being fired."" Other women took to Twitter to praise the BBC for the decision, using the hashtag BringBackClarkson. The hashtag is a play on words from the BringBackClarkson campaign launched after Clarkson was suspended.",0,746
"The company said it had faced a ""chorus of music label representatives and artists"" accusing it of ""mistreating"" songwriters and performers. Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said: ""YouTube's recent comments about how they don't need content creators are disgusting."" In a blog post, YouTube said it was ""committed to ensuring that the music industry - from artists and songwriters to labels and publishers - earn more as a result of the growth of online music."" It insisted that its ""responsibility is to the wider ecosystem,"" including users of its services. YouTube said that in the last 12 months the music industry had made more money from the service than ever before, with viewers watching videos with music in them for a total of 25 billion hours. But it added that this represented less than a quarter of the time people spend listening to music online. The company said that ""this is not the way to solve the industry's problems."" YouTube and other tech firms have come under criticism from musicians and the music industry for not compensating them fairly. Major labels have argued that the value of their music to YouTube is being underestimated, while independent labels have complained about being excluded from negotiations about YouTube's new paid-for service, YouTube Music Key. YouTube's blog post followed a panel event in which it discussed its plans with artists. The event, described by one participant as ""fruitless,"" was held a day after YouTube had held a press briefing on the same subject. One of the panelists, Zoella, was later criticised by the music industry for being an ""unlikely representative"" of musicians' interests. YouTube responded by saying: ""We will continue to have conversations with the industry to ensure that we both understand each other's perspectives."" The blog post did not address any of the issues raised by musicians at the event or the wider complaints made by the music industry. Last week, the head of the music industry's global representative body criticised the ""damaging misconceptions"" about how the streaming industry works. Writing in the Financial Times, Frances Moore, the chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said: ""The unfounded and unproductive perception that the music industry is resistant to change has become tiresome.""",0,747
"The move was announced by President Thein Sein, who earlier rejected UN calls for an independent inquiry. The clashes between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims also displaced thousands of people. President Thein Sein's office said on Monday that a commission would be formed to investigate the recent sectarian violence that has ripped through western Burma. The panel will be headed by Burmese lawyer and former political prisoner Ko Ko Gyi, a leader in the 1988 uprising against military rule. The announcement follows a weekend of bloodshed in Rakhine state, where 10 Muslims were killed on Sunday after being shot or hacked to death by a Buddhist mob in a village just 24 kilometers (15 miles) from the site of an earlier massacre. The Muslim minority in Rakhine state, which numbers some 800,000, are often described as ""Bengalis"" and denied citizenship by the government, who claims they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Human rights groups estimate that around 650 people have been killed in sectarian clashes over the past year. The violence began last June after the alleged rape and murder of a Buddhist woman in Rakhine state. In March, a massacre at a village in central Myanmar saw some 36 Muslims killed by a Buddhist mob. On Friday, a United Nations official, Tomas Ojea Quintana, urged the Burmese government to allow an independent investigation into the latest violence in Rakhine state. ""The government should accept the recommendations of the international community to allow an independent and impartial investigation to take place in relation to these events,"" said Quintana, who is the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar. The Burmese government has refused the request, saying it has formed its own inquiry commission.

"Jim McCafferty, 71, appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court charged with eight counts of touching a boy under the age of 16. The crimes are alleged to have happened in Belfast between 1977 and 1980. McCafferty, from Torrent Park in south Belfast, was released on 2,000 bail with a number of conditions including surrendering his passport and not having unsupervised access to children under 16. He is also banned from football stadiums and parks. The court heard allegations that McCafferty abused three young boys, one aged 13, another 14, and a 15-year-old, between August 1977 and December 1980. McCafferty will appear back in court in November. The former youth coach of Celtic Boys Club is charged with 11 historical sex offences against young boys. McCafferty appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court and was remanded in custody. The 71-year-old, from south Belfast, is accused of molesting boys aged between 12 and 15. He faces 11 counts of indecent assault on a male and two of indecent behaviour towards a child. The offences allegedly occurred between 1972 and 1997. McCafferty, who was a coach at Celtic Boys Club in Glasgow, was arrested by Police Scotland in Belfast on Thursday. He is currently on bail in Northern Ireland in relation to other sex abuse allegations. A bail application was made in court on Saturday morning, but was opposed by detectives. A prosecution lawyer claimed that police had ""significant concerns"" about McCafferty's safety, if released. He said: ""It's clear that police have significant concerns about the safety of the applicant, not from the public, but from himself. ""He attempted to take his own life in July this year. ""A bail address is available in England, but police are not satisfied with the proposal and, as a result, are opposing bail."" Defence counsel said McCafferty had never been involved in any serious trouble and, despite the fact that he was on bail in Northern Ireland, was not a flight risk. The lawyer said: ""He has been living with relatives in Belfast since July. ""While there, he has never missed a court appearance and has co-operated with police at all times."" District Judge Fiona Bagnall denied bail on the basis that McCafferty could be a risk to himself. He was remanded in custody to appear at the same court via videolink on December 1. Ten of the offences are said to have been committed in Glasgow between 1972 and 1996. The remaining charge relates to an alleged offence in Renfrewshire in 1997. A Celtic spokesman said the club was aware of the charges. ""The safety and well-being of all children and young people who are in our care is of paramount importance to Celtic,"" he said. ""The club has been co-operating fully with the police in relation to all enquiries. ""Celtic will not be making any further comment and respectfully requests that our players and staff are given privacy to concentrate on football activities."" It is understood that the charges are unrelated to abuse allegations made against former Celtic Boys Club coach, Jim Torbett, who was convicted of abusing three former players in the 1990s. Torbett, 71, who is the former Celtic Boys Club director, was jailed for two years in 1998 for abusing three boys in the 1980s. A former Scotland international footballer has claimed he was abused by a coach at Celtic Boys Club in the 1960s, which was not connected to Torbett. Graeme Souness, who went on to become a successful manager, said the abuse took place on a trip to the US in the 1960s. Mr Souness was abused by a different man in a youth team he played in before joining the Celtic Boys Club. He said the abuse left him ""disgusted and embarrassed"" and he tried to bury the memory.

The four siblings are charged with offences linked to the alleged smuggling of 4,200kgs of tobacco and 800kgs of cigarettes in 2012. They are accused of evading 2.1m in duty on cigarettes and 624,000 on tobacco. The four accused, who all deny the charges, had been granted bail in 2014. But this was revoked after it emerged that one of the siblings had allegedly breached a condition of the bail. The other three were subsequently re-arrested. Their legal teams are now attempting to have the defendants re-released. However, a prosecution barrister told the court today that he will seek to have them returned to custody. It is claimed that one of the accused poses a flight risk. The court also heard that Laura Hughes has been on bail in England where she faces further charges of her own. But she was brought to Belfast last week and was remanded in custody over the alleged breach of bail conditions. She was released on Monday but was immediately re-arrested and now faces fresh charges of allegedly perverting the course of justice, intimidation and failing to provide a preliminary breath test to police. It is alleged that she interfered with a witness on December 12. Joseph Hughes is also accused of intimidation and two counts of theft. During today's hearing, defence counsel argued that there is no longer a flight risk and claimed that the witness who has been allegedly interfered with is a vulnerable person.

"As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a familiar voice. That officer, Detective Constable Simon Finch, had been in the dock at Manchester Crown Court during the trial of Naseer, who was found guilty of planning a series of terrorist attacks in the UK. Now the two men are face-to-face in a Manhattan courtroom, where Naseer is accused of leading an al Qaeda plot to bomb the New York subway system, and attempting to recruit people to fight in Afghanistan. Detective Constable Finch was one of the officers who arrested Naseer and searched his bedroom, and now Naseer is trying to undermine the credibility of the evidence which was found there. During the trial in the UK, Naseer accused Detective Constable Finch of planting evidence. When the jury found Naseer guilty, Judge Mr Justice Henriques said there was no doubt in his mind that the jury had found the officer to be an honest and trustworthy witness. Naseer is claiming that an email recovered from his computer was not written by him, but had been planted on his computer by the officer. Detective Constable Finch told the court that the email was sent from his home in Manchester to an email address in Pakistan. Naseer also accused him of writing and sending the email himself, but the officer said that was not the case. Naseer's lawyer, Preet Bharara, said that the email contained spelling mistakes. ""So you admit you can't spell,"" said Naseer. ""It's quite common, yes,"" said Detective Constable Finch. Naseer was taken into custody in the UK in April 2009, just after Najibullah Zazi was arrested in New York. The US claims that Zazi was in touch with Naseer and another man, Abid Siddique, who was also arrested in the UK. Both Zazi and Siddique have pleaded guilty in the US, and Zazi is due to be sentenced next week. The US alleges that Naseer had contact with Zazi, and sent him emails encouraging him to carry out a terrorist attack. Prosecutors say that Naseer also attended training camps in Pakistan, where he learned how to make bombs, use weapons, and carry out attacks. Naseer has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",0,761

"But when the last Labour government tried to bring them in the plan faced robust opposition, and the reintroduction of ID cards is not currently being considered by this government. The Brexit Party is the party of retirees and people who don't vote in elections, poll reveals There are about 21 million people who didn't vote in the European elections, but they will vote in a general election A poll by Ipsos MORI suggests that the Brexit Party's supporters are those who don't usually vote in elections and those who are retired. According to the research, 40 per cent of the Brexit Party's supporters are retired, compared with 29 per cent of Labour voters and 28 per cent of Conservative voters. The Brexit Party is also supported by 13 per cent of people who didn't vote in the European elections, compared with seven per cent of Labour voters and six per cent of Conservative voters. The survey found that people who voted for the Brexit Party are more likely to be middle class. More than half of those who support the Brexit Party are ABC1s, compared with 40 per cent of Labour and 37 per cent of Conservative supporters. It also found that people who voted for the Brexit Party are more likely to live in the south of England. Some 39 per cent of them live in the South, compared with 32 per cent of Conservative voters and 28 per cent of Labour voters. Asked about the party's supporters, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said: ""I think what it shows is that the Brexit Party is a protest party. ""It's not rooted in any particular part of the country, it's not rooted in any particular socioeconomic grouping. ""It's simply a protest vote against the failure of the mainstream parties."" Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said: ""The reality is that it is a party of protest, it is a party that doesn't want to win an election, it wants to stop the government. ""And the best way for them to do that is by taking seats that were already held by the Conservatives."" Sterling hits two-week low as poll shows Conservative lead narrowing Sterling hit a two-week low on Monday after an opinion poll showed a narrowing lead for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party before Thursday's election, while signs of new tentative life in Brexit talks also weighed. The pound was trading at 1.2871, down 0.3 on the day. Earlier, it slipped as low as 1.2863, its weakest since Nov. 22. An opinion poll published on Saturday showed the Conservative Party's lead over the opposition Labour Party had narrowed to 9 percentage points, down from 10 points a week ago. ""Sterling has been on the back foot on the narrowing lead for the Conservatives in the polls, especially as this is ahead of the TV debate,"" said Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London. ""The narrowing in the polls has led to a knee-jerk reaction in the market and the negative effect is also being amplified by the lack of liquidity in the market."" Investors are also focussed on any signs of progress in talks between the British government and the European Union on an exit agreement. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Monday that it was possible to get a Brexit deal by the end of the year, though there was no guarantee. ""We're in a phase where there's just lots of headlines on Brexit, so sterling is going to react to that,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""It seems like every day there's something new, so I think the market is just kind of going to bounce around in a range until we get some clarity. ""Until we get that, it's going to be very difficult to make a clear directional call on sterling."" Sterling has risen in recent weeks on expectations that a Conservative majority in parliament would make it easier for Johnson to get his Brexit deal approved by parliament, while allowing him to push through domestic reforms. However, there are still concerns about the long-term outlook for Britain's economy. The latest data from the Confederation of British Industry showed manufacturers",0,765

"He died in a Dublin Hospital at 06:40 GMT on Friday. Fr Reid, 82, a member of the Redemptorist order, secretly acted as a conduit between the republican movement and the British government in 1972. He was sent to help mediate in the hunger strike by the then Northern Ireland Secretary William Whitelaw. The strike eventually ended in October 1972, when the British government made concessions to the prisoners. Father Reid, a former teacher, was born in Co Mayo and joined the Redemptorist order in the 1940s. He was ordained in 1951 and later became headmaster of St Gerard's School in Belfast. He later helped the Provisional IRA to establish contact with the Irish government during the 1975 ceasefire. In the 1980s, he was again involved in negotiations between the IRA and the British government. Father Reid wrote a book about his involvement in the hunger strikes, called Ten Men Dead. He is survived by his sister, brothers and extended family. He will be buried at Clonard Monastery in west Belfast, the Redemptorists have said.

"He said he hoped the treaty would help prevent the transfer of weapons to ""warlords, human rights abusers, terrorists and criminal organisations."" The deal also bans arms supplies if this would violate arms embargoes or if they would be used in attacks on civilians or crimes against humanity. The accord is the first legally binding international treaty to regulate the global arms trade. It came into force in 2014 and 89 countries have signed up to it. However, many of the world's largest arms exporters, including the United States, China and Russia, have not ratified the treaty. The United States, which accounts for more than 30 percent of worldwide arms exports, said the treaty would not stop bad countries from buying and selling arms. The German government is a signatory to the treaty. Berlin has been trying to drive forward the process of arms exports after the ""Saudi Arabia affair"" at the end of last year, when the German government approved the export of weapons to Saudi Arabia despite a ban on such exports to countries involved in the Yemen conflict. The scandal led to the departure of Chancellor Angela Merkel's defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen. Amnesty International urged the Merkel government to implement the treaty as soon as possible, and to stop selling weapons to countries that violate human rights.",0,768
"Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a baffling assortment of buttons and lights, and about as much use as a chocolate teapot. The festive season is a time of giving, when we all pull together to make the most of the time with our families, and spread a bit of joy to those less fortunate than ourselves. But it's also a time of stress, and that stress can easily lead to arguments - particularly when we've got other people to share our time and home with. We've put together some of the most common arguments you're likely to have over Christmas, and how to resolve them with as little stress as possible. Read more: 'I've been with my partner for two years but have never met his family and I don't know why' It's common for extended family members to pull together over the festive season, to make the most of time off work and the chance to share the burden of caring for children. But not all of us have families who are ready and willing to put their grievances aside for a few days. If you're facing a Christmas with an estranged family member, it's important not to rush into any major decisions, and to consider what's best for your children. If you're in a relationship, make sure your partner is on board with your decision - and if you're single, consider seeking the advice of a trusted friend. If you're going to extend an olive branch to someone you haven't spoken to in a while, make sure you're prepared for any possible reactions. If your children are old enough, make sure they know the situation. You don't want to end up caught in the middle of an argument on Christmas day. Read more: 'My girlfriend's parents won't accept me because I'm working class' Of course, some people find that spending time with their family members is a real source of stress over the holidays. If you're in a relationship, you might find yourself being dragged into arguments between your partner and their family - and you might find it difficult to stay out of it. If you're single, you might find yourself the butt of some jokes about your relationship status - and no one likes being pitied at Christmas. If you're in a relationship, make sure you're prepared to defend your partner - and vice versa. This is especially important if you're going to be meeting your partner's family for the first time - it's always difficult to know how you'll get on with them, so it's important to show that you're on the same page. If you're single, it's important to not get drawn into arguments about your relationship status. People have a habit of talking about their relationship woes at Christmas, and if you're single it's easy to feel that you're being left out. Don't be afraid to draw attention away from yourself. If you're feeling uncomfortable, excuse yourself politely - and if you can, ask someone else to follow you to diffuse the awkwardness. Read more: 'I'm spending Christmas alone - and I'm delighted' It's easy to fall out with a partner or relative over the festive season. With people underfoot, and tasks to be done, tensions can quickly rise - and arguments can become more frequent. Try to stay calm, and focus on the bigger picture. Christmas is a time for family, and it's important to keep that in mind. If you feel yourself getting angry, try to take a step back. Go to another room, or go outside if the weather permits. Taking deep breaths can help to calm you down, as well as giving you time to think about what you're going to say. If you're feeling particularly angry, try to write down exactly what's making you so upset - this can help you to pinpoint the exact issue, and to figure out how to resolve it. If you're having a particularly difficult time with your partner, consider going to couples counselling.

"The case had been brought by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which formerly owned the transfer rights to the 24-year-old forward. The company claimed it was short-changed when Neymar transferred from Santos to Barcelona in 2013. The Catalan club will also be made to pay the legal costs of the plaintiffs and interest on the amount. Neymar's representatives confirmed they would appeal the decision. ""We will appeal this decision. We are calm about it and we are convinced that we will be victorious,"" they said. However, they refused to comment on whether Neymar's future at the Nou Camp could be affected by the decision. The Brazilian is rumoured to have become unsettled at the club after a summer of speculation surrounding a move to Manchester United, and has been heavily linked with a move away from Barcelona in recent weeks. Neymar arrived at Barcelona in 2013, and has since won five major titles, including two La Liga titles and the Champions League in 2015.

"But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over? Or is the tourism sector in Leicester about to take another meteoric leap? The positive impact of the discovery of Richard III's body in 2012 was felt beyond the city's borders. VisitEngland figures show the number of domestic visitors to Leicester rose from 13.1 million in 2013 to 13.8 million in 2015, and the number of overseas visitors increased from 314,000 to 401,000 in the same period. After Richard's remains were reinterred at Leicester Cathedral in March 2015, the city has continued to see an increase in visitors from the UK and further afield, with interest and engagement in the story still strong. Since the discovery of the remains, Leicester has had a 3.5m boost to its economy, with more than 100,000 people visiting the cathedral to see the tomb. Stuart Bailey, head of economic development at Leicester City Council, says: ""There is no question the discovery of Richard III has brought major attention to the city and has provided a massive boost to tourism. ""The city is now viewed as a major cultural hub and we have seen a lot of investment and interest in the city because of that. ""This has included the 19m refurbishment of the Curve theatre in the Cultural Quarter and there are many new restaurant and hotel openings. In the 12 months following the discovery, VisitLeicester reports more than 250,000 visits to its website and more than 50,000 visits to the Visit Leicester Information Centre. Bailey adds: ""We are hoping the trend continues and the city continues to build on the work we have done to make the city a tourist attraction. ""There are many events happening in the city over the coming months that will help the city grow its tourism offer and give visitors a reason to come to Leicester. One of the key events to hit Leicester this year is the opening of the new King Richard III visitor centre, which opens its doors to the public tomorrow. The centre, which is built on the site of the former Alderman Newton's School, where the king's remains were discovered, is a major addition to the city's tourism offer. The 4.5m centre will tell the story of the king's life and death, as well as explaining the events that led to his burial at the site. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby says: ""This has been an exciting project to develop and will be a fantastic addition to Leicester's tourism offer. ""We are expecting the centre to attract a large number of visitors and we are confident that when they visit, they will be impressed. ""The centre tells the story of King Richard III and the legend that has surrounded him for hundreds of years. ""Visitors will be able to learn more about the monarch and his life in Leicester as well as see the story behind the discovery of his remains and their journey to the Cathedral. As the home of a number of significant historical artefacts, including the largest collection of King Richard III artefacts in the UK, the centre has also attracted a number of international visitors in the run-up to its opening. Sir Peter adds: ""The centre has already been attracting visitors in its run up to the official opening. ""We have had a number of international visitors come to the centre, which is a positive sign of the interest the centre and the city is generating. ""We believe the centre will become a key part of the city's tourism offer, helping to attract people to the city and to help boost the local economy. Since the discovery of Richard III's remains, Leicester has seen a significant increase in tourism, both from overseas and domestic markets. The city is now viewed as a major tourism destination and one of the major historical cities in the country, thanks to the work of organisations such as Visit Leicester and Leicester City Council. The new visitor centre will provide a focal point for people to learn more about the king and the legend that surrounds him, as well as acting as a gateway to the wider heritage attractions the city has to offer. With the centre opening to the public tomorrow, Leicester is now a step closer to cement",0,776

"The Dundee-based company said shareholders had wanted changes to be made to improve performance. Chief financial officer Alan Trotter is to leave Alliance Trust, while chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox is expected to leave the business later this year. Alliance Trust, which has assets of 3.8bn, has seen its share price tumble by almost 12 in the past 12 months, while net asset value per share has increased by just 2.3. The departure of Trotter and Garrett-Cox comes following a campaign by shareholders to shake up the business. The Daily Telegraph reported that activist investor Laxey Partners had called for Garrett-Cox to step down and for a new chairman to be appointed.

They struck a plea bargain for a shorter sentence and were jailed for six years and eight months. The Scottish prisoner is now under armed guard at the Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima. ""I've told her to keep her head down, keep out of trouble, be mindful of the people around her, and she seems to be doing that,"" he said. He said the circumstances of the arrest, when police found the drugs hidden in food packets in their luggage, were ""strange."" He added: ""I think it's a bit strange that they had the bags and were getting ready to get a flight to Spain, and the bags were 24 hours in the airport in Peru. ""I don't know how they were handled, whether they were checked in and checked out of the airport, and who had access to them."" In a separate development, it emerged that a ""little black book"" of contacts was discovered in Melissa Reid's rucksack. Ms Reid, who previously worked at the Benidorm branch of the Tui travel agency, is thought to have been planning to set up her own travel business in Ibiza. It has been reported that Ms McCollum, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, was working in a nightclub in the Spanish holiday resort.

"Under anti-tax avoidance rules, if someone's tax arrangements are found to be ""abusive"" they must pay back the tax they have avoided. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged a ""genuine clampdown"" on such ""aggressive avoidance."" He said Labour's policy would ""send a strong message to tax avoiders"" that they would not be able to escape paying the tax they owe. ""Tax avoidance is morally wrong and it is costing Britain billions of pounds a year,"" he said. ""I want to make clear that a One Nation Labour government led by Ed Miliband will clamp down on this abuse, raise billions of pounds of extra revenue and use the money to help millions of working people in our country."" Under Labour's plans, HMRC would be given new powers to assess tax from the ""day the transaction was entered into,"" enabling it to recover tax more quickly, it was announced. Meanwhile, tax avoiders would no longer be able to claim interest on tax payments held back during a court challenge. Labour is also pledging to introduce a new ""general anti-abuse rule"" to enable HMRC to clamp down on any attempts to use ""contrived or abnormal"" steps to avoid tax. The party said the measures were designed to target ""sophisticated"" tax avoidance schemes, such as those exposed in the recent Paradise Papers leak. The leak, which involved 13.4 million documents from two offshore service providers and 19 tax havens' company registries, revealed details of the financial affairs of hundreds of politicians, celebrities and businesses. Among those implicated were members of Donald Trump's cabinet, a major donor to Theresa May and the Queen. HMRC is already pursuing around 135m in tax, interest and penalties from more than 100 people and companies named in the leaks, according to reports. ""The Paradise Papers leak shows the extent to which tax avoidance and evasion is becoming more and more sophisticated, and highlights the difficulties HMRC faces in keeping up with the most complicated schemes designed by highly paid professionals,"" Balls added. ""The tax gap is now 34bn a year, and closing this loophole alone will raise more than 600m a year for our public services.""",0,780
"Researchers followed nearly 240,000 Swedish men for 35 years. The analysis, published in the journal Gut, showed overweight teenagers went on to have twice the risk of bowel cancer. The risk of oesophageal and upper stomach cancers was also higher in people who were obese as teenagers, the study found. Public health officials have been warning about the dangers of obesity for years, but this study suggests the risks may be much greater than thought. The study found that young men who were overweight but not obese - those with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 - had a 29 increased risk of bowel cancer, compared with men who had a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. Obese teenagers with a BMI of 30 or above were 2.35 times more likely to develop bowel cancer as adults, the study found. The risk of oesophageal cancer was also raised. Overweight young men had a 51 increased risk, while obese young men had a 79 increased risk, compared with those of normal weight. The study also looked at other forms of cancer, but found no association. Lead researcher Dr Hannah Lennernas, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: ""It's been suggested that high BMI is associated with an increased risk of cancer but the data has been mixed."" She said the study was the first to suggest that being overweight in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of several forms of cancer in men. The researchers looked at data from the Swedish Military Conscription Service, which records information on weight, height, age and whether young men had been diagnosed with asthma or diabetes. From a study group of 237,793 men, 17,476 were diagnosed with cancer over the next 35 years. Dr Lennernas said: ""We found that men with higher BMI at 18 years had an increased risk of colon, oesophageal and pleural cancer. ""These results suggest that men who are overweight as adolescents could be at increased risk of cancer in later life."" She said: ""These results could have implications for cancer prevention initiatives, as reducing overweight in adolescents may reduce the future burden of cancer.""",0,781

""We should not be provoking them,"" said Sen. Mr. Tillerson also said he has told Russia's leaders they need to do something about North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

"Government limits to teachers' pay and ""real terms cuts"" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. ""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the Telegraph. The statement comes from the leaders of head teachers' union NAHT, the teachers' union NASUWT and the National Education Union (NEU). It has also been signed by the head of the Church of England education office and the chief executive of the Catholic Education Service. ""Teachers, school leaders and support staff are key to the future prosperity of this country,"" says the statement. ""A nation that invests in education is a nation that invests in its future. ""The current salary cap is damaging the economy and the public service of education in this country. It is time to end it."" It continues: ""We urge the Government to end the public sector pay cap and provide teachers with an immediate, fully funded, above-inflation pay rise."" Ministers have said the cap will be lifted for police and prison officers. The statement warns that pay restraint is making it hard to recruit teachers and is leading to staff shortages, which in turn risk affecting pupils' education. ""Teaching is a demanding profession, and teachers have lost pay relative to others in the public and private sectors in recent years,"" it says. ""We urge the Government to act now to ensure that the pay of teachers and support staff is sufficient to attract and retain talented staff and to ensure that teachers on all pay ranges have an income that reflects the increasing cost of living."" In a joint statement to the Telegraph, the union leaders say: ""We believe that the best way to ensure that pupils get the education that they deserve is to have a system where there are enough teachers, where they are well-motivated, well-qualified, and well-rewarded. ""The pay cap has severely damaged teacher pay and morale in recent years and the current pay cap is threatening the education of our children and young people by jeopardising the future supply of teachers.

The joint statement is signed by Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, the Rev Nigel Genders, chief education officer of the Church of England, and Mike Kane, MP, and former head teacher, who is now shadow education secretary. Ministers are considering whether to lift the cap for teachers. But schools are facing budget cuts, with the National Audit Office warning that funding per pupil has fallen by 6.5 per cent in real terms between 2010-11 and 2016-17. The school leaders' statement warns: ""The funding of schools is a serious problem. ""School leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to balance their budgets and this is having an impact on the education they are able to provide. ""There have been cuts to school budgets in real terms for the last few years, and more are to come, particularly in the area of high needs. ""As a result, schools are cutting staff and increasing class sizes to make ends meet. ""These cuts threaten the education of our children and young people and are not in the best interests of the future of our country. ""Funding must be increased to ensure that schools can provide the best possible education for every child and to help attract and retain teachers."" The statement was also signed by Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, and Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. Last year, more than 40,000 teachers left the profession in England, figures showed.

"The PS1.471bn spent shooting movies like Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2014 represents a 35 increase on 2013. Money spent on homegrown UK films rose 47 to PS720m. This is a really healthy result for the UK film industry, said Film London chief Adrian Wootton, who chairs the British Film Commission. We are undoubtedly in a strong position with the government recognising the importance of film and television production to the British economy. Claims to film tax relief are currently capped at PS35m, but Wootton said the government was looking at the issue. ""They have confirmed that they are considering it, but nothing has been confirmed yet,"" he said. The report also highlights the importance of the gaming industry to the UK economy, which was worth 3.16bn in 2014, up 11 per cent on the previous year. In 2014, 346 new video games were released in the UK, a significant increase on 2013's 239 titles. BFI chief executive Amanda Nevill said the report showed that ""film and high-end television are driving record levels of investment in the UK economy."" ""Film is a growth industry that delivers more than 100,000 full-time jobs, adds 5.6bn to our economy and is a major export,"" she added. The BFIDCMS report confirms that the UK film industry is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth, said Stephen Bristow, head of film and media at law firm Harbottle and Lewis. These statistics come at a time when the British film industry is enjoying great critical and commercial success, he added. The Star Wars franchise has been one of the most financially successful film series of all time, and has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards, including two wins. Episode 7 - The Force Awakens, was released in December 2015, and has earned 1.25bn at the box office worldwide. The latest Avengers film, Age of Ultron, was released in May 2015 and has earned 1.36bn at the global box office. The figure of 1.471bn spent on inward investment films in the UK in 2014 is only slightly below the peak of 1.498bn in 2013. The report points to a ""softening"" of the film industry in the UK in 2015 and 2016, which it attributes to ""a number of high profile titles in the UK inward investment sector have left for rival European territories."" The report points to the 110m 007 film Spectre, which was shot partly in Mexico. Globally, the UK film industry is the third largest, behind the US and India. The UK is also the second largest television exporter, behind the US, the report says.",0,784
"Dave Walsh, president of Liverpool Trades Council, said the council should not be afraid of setting an illegal budget. He said: ""There's an old saying in the Labour movement,'better to break the law than break the poor'. ""The people of this city don't want council house tenants evicted. They don't want their kids' schools closed and they don't want elderly people having to choose between heating and eating."" Over 100 people crammed into a public meeting called by Liverpool Trades Council at the Sandon pub in the city centre on Wednesday of last week. They heard speakers from the council, the trades council and the Labour party. Hundreds of people joined a demonstration called by the trades council on Saturday. The mood was angry at the prospect of cuts that are going to ruin people's lives. Neil (not his real name) is a single parent living in an area where schools, leisure centres and day centres are threatened. ""I used to be proud of Liverpool,"" he said, ""but now I feel humiliated by it. ""I'm a lone parent, my children are at school and I need the respite care provided at the day centre to cope. If it goes I'm going to end up in a mental hospital."" At the council's annual budget-making meeting this Thursday there is likely to be a huge demonstration outside. Inside the meeting the council is set to vote to break the law and set a budget that is illegal because it does not include the 14 million cuts. The council is then going to set up a special commission to campaign for more money from central government. Dave Walsh from the trades council said, ""The commission can't just be a talking shop. If you want to get 14 million from the government you've got to be prepared to take action to make them sit up and listen. ""It's no good the council saying, 'Don't take action because we don't want you to get into trouble'."" Council workers are to be balloted over whether to strike to stop compulsory redundancies. Liverpool socialist councillor Paul Brandon said, ""If council workers say they want to stop the redundancies, the council should back them and fight the government."" The council should tell the government it will use the 35 million it has in reserves to fund jobs and services. It should say it will take 35 million from the banks that have refused to meet with the council to discuss the crisis. It should be prepared to take over the banks. If the government threatens to sack the council and impose a commissioner, the council should call a one-day general strike. The council could say it will go to the courts to win the money it needs. If the government refuses, the council should hold a referendum on raising the money through a massive council tax increase. In the 1980s, the Thatcher government tried to make Liverpool council set a legal budget. It refused and set an illegal budget. The council mobilised 50,000 people onto the streets in support. In the end the government backed down and gave the council the extra money it needed. The government can be forced to back down again.",0,785

"Ryan Morse, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, died on 8 December 2012 from undiagnosed Addison's disease. Dr Leonard Peter told Cardiff Crown Court Dr Joanne Rudling, of Cardiff, did not ask for a blood test on the 27-year-old. But the jury ruled she was not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter. Mr Morse's mother Sally Morse said the family was ""saddened and disheartened"" by the verdict. Mr Morse, a father of two, had been admitted to hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. Dr Rudling, 38, said she had suspected Mr Morse had the rare disease but did not believe there was enough evidence to justify a blood test. A jury of seven men and five women took five-and-a-half hours to acquit her. Following the verdict, Mrs Morse said: ""As a family we are saddened and disheartened by the verdict. ""We still have to live with the fact that our son and brother Ryan died in such a needless way and it is hard for us to understand how this can happen. ""It is the way Ryan died that is the hardest part to bear. He died suffering, in pain and scared when all he needed was a blood test to diagnose Addison's. ""Ryan was a loving son, brother, father, uncle and grandson and his life was cut short due to mistakes. ""We have to live every day knowing that our boy didn't have to die and that's the hardest part."" Ryan Morse was 27 when he died in December 2012 'Fighting for justice' Dr Rudling said she was ""very grateful to the jury for the time they took to consider the evidence and for their decision to acquit."" ""I would like to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their continued support,"" she added. ""The inquest into Ryan Morse's death is due to be heard in November."" The court had heard that Mr Morse's family had to watch him suffer for hours without knowing what was wrong with him. Mr Morse's father Paul said: ""He was just lying there fighting for his life and nobody could tell us what was wrong with him."" The court heard that Dr Rudling, who has more than 15 years of experience, saw Mr Morse at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff after he had been admitted with vomiting and diarrhoea. He had been suffering from the symptoms for two days before he was admitted and had been sick about 20 times. The court heard that Dr Rudling believed Mr Morse was suffering from acute gastroenteritis and that his condition was not serious enough to warrant a blood test. But a second doctor, Dr Leonard Peter, who treated Mr Morse when he returned to hospital the following day, told the court that he had seen ""classic"" signs of Addison's disease. He said he immediately requested a blood test which confirmed Mr Morse was suffering from the condition. Dr Peter told the court that Mr Morse should have been given steroids to treat his condition and his life would have been saved if a blood test had been requested by Dr Rudling the day before. Ryan Morse died after vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea 'Complicated' condition Addison's disease is caused by a lack of hormones made in the adrenal glands, two small glands which sit on top of the kidneys. It means sufferers do not produce enough steroid hormones, which are vital for regulating metabolism, blood pressure and the immune system. Dr Peter said Addison's disease was a ""complicated"" condition and it was difficult to diagnose it because it was very rare and because the symptoms were similar to a number of other conditions. He told the jury that Dr Rudling had not fulfilled her duty of care and had failed to carry out a ""reasonable and competent"" examination of Mr Morse. But Dr Rudling told the court she had ""considered"" asking for a blood test but that she had not been able to reach a diagnosis. She said she had not believed there was ""sufficient evidence"" to justify a blood test. She told the court that Mr Morse had been ""a little bit vague"" when she asked him questions about his health and she had been unable to establish a full medical history. Dr Rudling said she had not been able to establish whether Mr Morse had been feeling unwell for more than a week and that had been ""pivotal"" in her decision not to request a blood",0,789

The Progress spacecraft has been launched more than 140 times since 1972 to deliver supplies to the space station. The loss of the cargo ship is the third space mishap for Russia in the past year. In October, a Russian rocket carrying a Mexican satellite failed just minutes after liftoff, crashing in Siberia. The following month, a booster rocket failed and Russia had to abandon a joint mission with Japan to fly a satellite into space to study black holes. And in January, Russia lost contact with another satellite, which was launched to find the 1908 Tunguska meteorite that exploded over Siberia and devastated 2,000 square kilometers (800 square miles). The unmanned cargo ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday, but contact was lost with it soon afterwards. Russia's space agency says Progress M-27M is now orbiting in an uncontrolled spin and may fall to Earth within days. A Russian space freighter loaded with 2.5 tons of supplies, fuel, water and oxygen for the ISS is now spinning out of control and may fall to Earth in a few days. The unmanned spacecraft was launched from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Tuesday. Contact with the Progress M-27M was lost after it launched from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Tuesday. Russian officials said it was not clear if the Progress had reached the planned orbit. Officials said the spacecraft was expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere between May 5 and 7.",0,791

"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday. It aims to address the 1 billion funding gap across the region by 2020. The STP document, which was released on Wednesday, also sets out how the region's health and social care services need to be transformed to meet the changing needs of the population, which includes addressing increasing levels of obesity, dementia and loneliness. The STP document is subject to public consultation. Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust chief executive Aidan Kehoe said the draft plan was ""a vital opportunity to set out a vision for the next five years that will ensure that NHS services across Cheshire and Merseyside are fit for purpose and continue to provide high quality patient care."" ""It's clear that if we don't change the way we deliver care and manage demand on services, then we will not be able to continue to provide the same level of care for patients. We need to change the way we work across the health and care system to make sure we can deliver high quality care for the people of Merseyside and Cheshire,"" he said. The STP also proposes that the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital Trust merges with Liverpool Community Health Trust. The document also outlines plans for the establishment of a primary and acute care system. The STP says this model will ""enable the health and social care system to provide care that is more integrated and better co-ordinated in the community."" The STP also envisages that the region will have a single cancer service, with a focus on earlier diagnosis and better outcomes. The plan also sets out proposals to develop a single centre for emergency surgery at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. This would be supported by specialist emergency surgery units at the Countess of Chester Hospital, Arrowe Park Hospital and Aintree University Hospital. The STP also proposes to develop a single centre for planned surgery at Broadgreen Hospital, which would be supported by a number of specialist elective surgery units.

"Emmerson Whittel may need surgery on his jaw, while the club alleges player Josh Lynam was also bitten on the ear. The RFL's match review panel will look at official match footage and witness statements. Meninga was forced to hold his post-match press conference in the stadium's main bar, with team officials trying to stop supporters from interrupting. Meninga said: ""It was an embarrassing incident. We're going to have to wait and see what happens with the RFL. We've got to see if they're going to do anything about it. ""If there's a player out there who needs a psychiatrist, he's got to go and see one. ""The players are going to have to learn to play with that passion and that enthusiasm without letting it get out of control and it's up to the coaches to do that.

"Surprise frontrunner Francois Fillon said his project was ""more radical,"" and vowed to implement sweeping changes in the first three months of his term. Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were more realistic. ""I want France to return to the family of nations where she belongs,"" Fillon said, referring to the ""Anglo-Saxon"" world of Britain and the United States. ""We need to go faster and faster, further and further,"" the former Prime Minister told the 16,000-strong audience in Paris' Bercy Arena. Fillon and Juppe are widely considered the frontrunners in the primary, which will be held in two rounds on Sunday and Nov. 27. The victor will face the winner of the Socialist primary, expected to be held in January. ""I want a new French independence,"" he added, referring to the ""dependency"" on Germany, the European Union's powerhouse economy, that had ""lost its radiance."" ""You're my family,"" Fillon told the crowd in the Bercy Arena, at the end of a sometimes-raucous debate. ""It's a radical project, but it's not radicalism. It's deep-rooted in the founding values of our country,"" he told supporters, many of whom wore the blue scarves of the party, and waved French tricolors. Fillon, who clashed repeatedly with Juppe during the debate, said his proposals were ""realistic"" and ""in line with the French people's aspirations."" ""This is no longer a primary of the right,"" Fillon said. ""This is a primary of France."" Alain Juppe, a former French Prime Minister, came in second, according to the same poll. The 62-year-old Juppe, who is considered more centrist than Fillon, proposed ""a French renaissance"" based on moderation, and reiterated his commitment to the EU. He vowed to slash unemployment, which currently stands at 10 percent, but said that he would not scrap the 35-hour work week, as Fillon has suggested. ""I will be a reformer, but in a calm and balanced way,"" he said. ""The French don't want us to be a country at war with itself."" ""I want to build a France that is modern, creative, and competitive,"" he said, adding that he would use his executive experience to ""get France moving."" The two leading candidates also clashed on immigration and security. Fillon proposed closing the border to all but a ""limited"" number of refugees and asylum seekers, while Juppe insisted that France was a ""nation of welcome."" Fillon repeated his pledge to restore military service, which was abolished in 1997, insisting that it would ""toughen up"" young people. Juppe rejected the plan as anachronistic. Fillon has surged in opinion polls since the start of the campaign, as the conservatives struggle to recover from the presidential election defeat of former President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012. Sarkozy failed to make it to the second round of the primary, and announced he was retiring from politics on Sunday night.

"Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common holacracy and sociocracy models. In the end, they decided to try a more radical approach: no managers, no bosses, no hierarchy. ""We believed that you could take responsibility and be autonomous, and that was enough,"" says Jonas Cronfeldt, Crisp's marketing manager. In fact, they decided to take it one step further. Not only did they get rid of bosses, they got rid of job titles too. ""If you have a title, you know more or less what to do, but it also puts you in a box and tells you how to behave,"" Cronfeldt explains. Without a title, everyone is equal and everyone is expected to contribute when and where they can. The approach seems to be working: in the three years since it was introduced, Crisp's turnover has grown by 50, and Cronfeldt says that staff are more engaged and motivated than ever. Lack of hierarchy is a feature of many of the most successful companies in the world. Valve, the games company, has no managers. Instead, it has a handbook for new employees that encourages them to find the right projects and groups to work with, and to take responsibility for their own contributions. It suggests that employees ask themselves: ""Since Valve is flat, I'll need to decide what I should be working on. To do this, I'll need to consult others to see what needs doing, and figure out how to make myself useful. ""I should look around for a project that seems like it needs help, or a group that needs my assistance, and then take the initiative to make myself useful."" While Valve is not anarchic - the company is split into small groups, each of which is managed by an elected 'leader' - the approach has helped to create a culture where people are empowered to make decisions and take responsibility. So does a lack of hierarchy help companies to perform better? Steve Denning, a former director of knowledge management at the World Bank, believes so. In a paper published in 2011, he looked at some of the most innovative companies in the world, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Pixar, Valve and WL Gore, and concluded that they all had one thing in common: a lack of bureaucracy. They were all able to adapt quickly to new trends and opportunities, and they all did so by trusting their employees to make decisions. Many of the companies that Denning examined use a more structured approach, however, such as Google's 'adhocracy' model, which allows employees to propose and vote for new projects. They also tend to be highly creative, which is not a trait that can necessarily be attributed to a lack of hierarchy alone. Crisp's Cronfeldt is in no doubt that it is the lack of hierarchy that has helped his company to grow. ""We don't have people leaving projects half-finished because they don't have the authority to make decisions. We don't have people taking forever to make decisions because they have to go through their line manager. Everyone has the authority to do what they think is right,"" he says. It's an approach that has helped to make Crisp one of the fastest growing and most profitable software consultancies in Sweden. It's also an approach that is finding increasing favour in some of the world's biggest companies. According to Deloitte's 2016 Global Human Capital Trends survey, nearly 90 of executives believe that the organisation of the future will be a more open, flatter, less hierarchical place. ""The new organisation is a 'network of teams', with a core of full-time employees working alongside contractors and freelancers,"" the report states. It suggests that this new approach will help companies to become more agile, collaborative and responsive. While most companies won't be able to ditch their hierarchy completely, they can learn lessons from those that have. The key is to ensure that people are empowered to make decisions, and that they have the authority to act on them.",0,798
"The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 to 0.25, in the process cutting its base rate to its lowest ever level. The MPC has also re-started the quantitative easing programme, this time buying 60bn of government bonds as well as 10bn of corporate bonds. On top of this it has introduced a Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to encourage banks and building societies to pass on the base rate cut to their customers. The Bank of England will purchase 10bn of corporate bonds over an 18 month period, to help support the UK economy during the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. We are confident that the Bank of England, in co-ordination with other central banks, will continue to take whatever action is deemed necessary to support the UK economy during this period of uncertainty.",0,799
"Based on a true story, Pride shows how gay rights campaigners from London raised thousands of pounds for miners in the Dulais Valley, after the NUM had spurned their support. Many miners, however, still refused to accept their help, believing the miners' strike was a straight fight against the Tories, not a question of gay rights. Pride is both a stirring drama and a timely reminder of how far the fight for gay equality has come in the past 30 years.

"Liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron - winner of the first round - and nationalist Marine Le Pen are already revolutionising French politics. They have delivered a big blow to the long-dominant parties of the left and right. They are set to clash in the second round on May 7. Mr Macron's year-old political movement - En Marche! (Onwards!) - is at the vanguard. But Ms Le Pen's anti-EU National Front has been gaining ground for years. French voters have been on a long journey towards this pivotal moment. The traditional left-right divide has been shifting for years, and the mainstream parties have suffered a series of setbacks and upsets. The Socialists have been on the slide for a decade. The traditional conservatives have faced splits and reverses. And in the last presidential vote, in 2012, a far-left candidate made it into the second round. In this year's first round, the Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon scored a miserable 6 of the vote. His predecessor Francois Hollande was the most unpopular French president in recent history. Mr Hollande's presidency was marked by terror attacks, unemployment at a 15-year high, a wave of industrial unrest and a bitter rift with Germany over austerity measures. He decided not to seek a second term. Nicolas Sarkozy, his right-wing predecessor, was also an unpopular one-term president. He lost to Mr Hollande in 2012. When he tried to return to the Elysee Palace, he was beaten by his former prime minister, Francois Fillon, in the conservative primaries. Mr Fillon was then embroiled in a financial scandal, in which he was accused of paying his wife and children huge sums of public money for fake parliamentary jobs. He came third in the presidential poll. Both parties are now embarking on a period of soul-searching. The Socialists may choose a new leader later this year. The conservatives are due to pick a new president in the autumn. France's mainstream parties now have to work out how to adapt to a new political landscape. The National Front has been a big beneficiary of the collapse of the left and right. Ms Le Pen has tried to ""detoxify"" the party, founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, by distancing it from the overt racism and anti-Semitism of the past. In the 2012 presidential poll, she came third with 18 of the vote. In the 2015 regional elections, the National Front won the first round in six of the country's 13 regions. It won the second round in only one of them. But the party's high score showed that it had become a major player in French politics. The party was also ahead in the 2014 European elections, with nearly 25 of the vote. The traditional left and right had to take notice. Ms Le Pen has sought to broaden her appeal with a radical anti-EU, anti-globalisation, anti-immigration agenda. This has worked well in the past in former industrial regions. But Ms Le Pen's attempts to reach out to a broader electorate appear to have paid off. She won more than 7.6 million votes in the first round, the best-ever score for the National Front. She was ahead in areas that have not traditionally been strongholds for the party, such as in the south-east and centre of the country. Ms Le Pen's brand of nationalism and protectionism has become more popular as French voters become increasingly disenchanted with globalisation and worried about immigration and Islamist terrorism. And the traditional parties have lost touch with their core supporters, who are worried about France's economic decline and feel abandoned in the face of globalisation. There is no doubt that the National Front has shaken up French politics. But many voters remain unconvinced by Ms Le Pen's policies. They are wary of her protectionist economic agenda. The party is also seen as weak on social and ethnic diversity. Mr Macron, who is pro-EU and pro-free market, has tried to appeal to a similar electorate. The independent centrist has said he wants to restore France's global standing and make it a ""start-up nation",0,802

"It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain the biological processes that lead to Alzheimer's and is sensitive enough to detect changes caused by drugs that are not yet available to patients. The study found that a specific type of brain scan, called positron emission tomography (PET), can effectively measure the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. These sticky, toxic proteins are thought to play a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, by damaging connections between nerve cells and disrupting the supply of oxygen and nutrients. Researchers at the University of Cambridge MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, in collaboration with the University of Oxford and drug company, Eli Lilly and Company, studied 44 patients with Alzheimer's and 25 healthy volunteers. The volunteers had undergone PET brain scans for other reasons. The researchers used the latest technology to examine the PET scans in minute detail, allowing them to separate out the effects of aging from the effects of amyloid protein build up. This, combined with highly sensitive statistics, meant that they could identify the specific biological processes taking place in the Alzheimer's patients' brains. They then used this information to predict the extent to which the patients' mental performance had declined over a 12-month period. The technique was able to predict patients' future cognitive performance with greater than 90 accuracy. ""For the first time we have evidence to show that PET brain scans can effectively measure the amount of amyloid in a person's brain,"" said Dr James Rowe, a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in Basic Biomedical Science at the University of Cambridge. ""These scans are able to predict how rapidly the disease will progress over the next year, providing a valuable new tool to help evaluate future treatments and establish how well they are working."" ""The technique could also be used to test the effectiveness of new drugs in the earliest stages of clinical trials, potentially reducing the time and cost involved in developing new treatments,"" Dr Rowe added. It is hoped that the findings could ultimately lead to new ways of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, before symptoms begin to manifest.",0,807

First Minister Carwyn Jones also said he would not be voting for Mr Corbyn and would not be telling people in Wales how to vote. BBC Wales politics editor Nick Servini said this amounted to a Labour split. Polls suggest Labour could lose seats in Wales, and Mr Gething has indicated the party is fighting to defend its record. On Tuesday, Mr Gething told the BBC Wales election phone-in that the Welsh Labour manifesto was ""not Jeremy's manifesto"" but rather a manifesto for the people of Wales. ""We're fighting this election on the basis of our record,"" he said. ""I didn't back him in the two leadership contests, but he is the leader of the party and we have got to make sure that he is the next prime minister. ""That's not going to be a choice for people in Wales but for people across the whole of the United Kingdom."" ""I didn't back him in the leadership contest, but he is our leader and he is going to be the next prime minister."" Asked if he was ""out of kilter"" with the national leadership, Mr Gething said: ""It's a very different context here in Wales."" ""We've got to win on the basis of our record, not on the basis of a manifesto put together by the party in England. That's not going to work in Wales."" Mr Jones, who is standing down as first minister at the end of the Welsh assembly term, told the same programme: ""I'm not going to be telling people in Wales how to vote. I'm going to be talking about our record. ""We're the only party in Wales that can deliver for Wales and for the people of Wales. I'm concentrating on our record and I'm confident that we will get a good result for Welsh Labour."" Mr Jones added: ""I have always been very upfront. I have not backed Jeremy. I have not backed him in the past. ""I have been very critical of his stance on Brexit, which is not the stance of the Welsh Labour government and I have been very critical of his stance on nuclear weapons as well."" But Mr Jones said he was campaigning to get Labour re-elected in Wales and would do all he could to support Mr Corbyn. Asked whether there was a split in the Labour Party, the first minister said: ""There's a difference of opinion in the party."" ""What we've got to concentrate on is the election and winning. ""The choice in this election is about the people of Wales and what's best for them. ""I'm not going to be telling people how to vote, I'm going to be concentrating on our record."" In 2015, Mr Jones' decision to rule out working with Mr Corbyn if he became leader did not go down well with Welsh Labour supporters. Since then he has had to work with a leader he had effectively disowned in a letter to MPs in the summer of 2015. Welsh Labour is working on the basis that its vote will be squeezed from both sides, with Plaid Cymru on the left and the Conservatives on the right. That is why Mr Gething is putting the emphasis on the party's record in government in Wales, which is why he is not using the national Labour election slogan. The party is clearly also concerned about how Jeremy Corbyn is perceived in Wales, and that is why the first minister is not backing his bid to become prime minister. Mr Jones has also been reluctant to answer questions about how long he would serve as first minister if he was re-elected next year. The Welsh government has already announced it is to work more closely with the UK government after the election in key policy areas such as health, farming and Brexit. First Minister Carwyn Jones said the agreement would ""ensure a UK-wide approach to issues affecting the whole country."" It will mean ministers from the UK government and devolved administrations will meet more regularly. Mr Jones said it would provide ""reassurance and stability"" at a time of uncertainty for the UK. The move was criticised by Plaid Cymru's leader Leanne Wood, who said it ""risks tying Wales even closer to the Conservative government's austerity agenda."" Ms Wood said:",0,810
"McBryde leads Wales against Samoa and Tonga this summer in the absence of Warren Gatland and Rob Howley, who coach the Lions in New Zealand. ""The game on Saturday gives us a huge opportunity to test ourselves against the best team in the world,"" he added. The All Blacks then finished off the Lions with a length of the field try from Beauden Barrett, who finished off an excellent counter attacking move. New Zealand's first-half charge made a mockery of the Lions' pre-match boast that they could target the All Blacks at the breakdown and halt their free-flowing game. O'Mahony was at the heart of a heroic Lions defence, the Irishman a colossus at the tackle, but his opposite number Sam Whitelock admitted the breakdown had been a tight contest. He believes that the Lions' second Test team is a fair representation of the best players in the United Kingdom and Ireland and has warned the All Blacks to expect a response. ""There's some really good things we're doing at the moment,"" he said. ""They are going to look back on that as one of the biggest opportunities missed."" Farrell's try, his first for the Lions, ended a stunning first-half comeback from the tourists, who conceded three tries in the opening quarter of an hour. ""We are going to have to start better than we did last weekend."" ""We have to look at the positives and move forward."" Both sides made changes at half-time, with All Blacks captain Kieran Read and centre Sonny Bill Williams the most notable omissions from the second half. ""We created some opportunities but were unable to finish them off."" ""I'm really proud of our guys."" ""It was a good lesson for us. You can't give teams like this a 25-point start, because you're going to struggle to get it back."" ""It's a different mindset,"" he said. ""It's been a tough tour so far but the boys are pretty excited about the opportunity to be here, it's a great place and a great venue."" ""We are going to have to start better than we did last weekend,"" he added. ""We knew we would have to play well and score tries."" The 22-year-old was the only Lions player to receive a zero rating in their 30-15 defeat to the All Blacks in the first Test on Saturday. ""The pressure is on us to get a result and we are going to have to play well to do that."" His workload as a scrum-half has been managed carefully and it will be intriguing to see whether coach Warren Gatland chooses him for the Test. The series is decided on aggregate scores across the three matches, so the Lions must win the second and third Tests to be the victor. The only remaining match is in Auckland on July 8.

"The team of scientists hope the information will help shift the focus away from the way trees look towards on the focus on biodiversity. Over the next decade, the urban forest will be replaced with a selection of native trees that will mimic the biodiversity found in wildlife. ""The diversity of the urban forest is much higher than the native forest"" said Dr Alex Lechner, a researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research. ""The native forest has a species loss, because of climate change, air pollution, intensive agriculture and forestry. Urban forests are some kind of a safe harbour for many of these species."" The researchers hope that the new study will help cities across the world to plant a wider range of tree species and encourage the growth of biodiversity within cities. ""We need to actively manage our urban forests so that they can support as much biodiversity as possible,"" Dr Lechner said. ""That means not just focusing on common native species, but also trying to preserve rare species, and planting a diversity of different species, including non-native ones.""",0,813

More than 40 new apps and services were launched on the platform. The new app is designed to give users more power, letting them block or report any messages they deem to be ""abusive, threatening or containing graphic violence."" The Messenger app can now also be used to make payments, stream live video, and play games. The app will also now allow users to send money to friends and family and play games, as well as video chat. ""We are introducing a new platform for developers to easily create an expressive and immersive experience to reach the over 600 million people using Messenger each month,"" the company said in a blog post. The Messenger app has been downloaded more than one billion times since it was launched in 2011. One of the most significant changes to the platform is that developers can now build Messenger apps using standard web technologies, meaning they can be loaded instantly without having to be downloaded first. ""You can use your phone number to sign up for Messenger - and bring all your contacts, including SMS and MMS, to the app,"" the company said. The Messenger app is also now able to accept payments, while video calling is also supported. ""There are now more than 100 million monthly active users on Messenger Platform, and more than 22,000 bots have been built to date,"" he said. Messenger's payment platform, dubbed Messenger Payments, is the first time Facebook has made its payments service available to third parties in the U.S. The social media giant has partnered with Stripe, Braintree, MasterCard and Visa to power the new system. For gamers, Messenger will also include new features that let you play games with your friends. One of the new services is Messenger Codes, which are unique patterns of dots that represent a Messenger user's profile. Facebook said it will roll out the new features over the next few days. You can now use Messenger without a Facebook account. The bot platform will be extended outside the US over the next few months, according to the blog post. Microsoft stops selling Xbox 360 NASA to unveil new discoveries involving Jupiter's moon Europa Oculus Rift Is Now Finally Available for 599 March 28, 2016, 10:23 AM Microsoft is ending production of the Xbox 360, marking the end of an era. NASA is expected to make an announcement on Monday (March 14) about its efforts to explore the oceans on Jupiter's moon Europa. The ocean, which is thought to be about 100 kilometres (60 miles) deep and buried under kilometres of ice, is believed to be twice the volume of the oceans on Earth. Jupiter's moon Europa, with its potential for an ocean under its icy crust, is one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for life. With the discovery of life in Europa, the future of humanity in the solar system will be set, and those who arrive first will secure their place at the top. A Cassini probe is now orbiting Saturn and making flybys of the moon Enceladus, which has also been touted as a possible home to extraterrestrial life. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has provided a wealth of information about planets, stars and galaxies. The telescope is widely credited with helping to prove that the universe is expanding and accelerating. The new planet hunter, Kepler, has found 1,000 new planets since its launch in 2009. It's called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The satellite will be the most efficient transit-based exoplanet surveyor ever created. It will also have the largest camera ever launched into space, with an array of 21 CCDs (charge-coupled devices) and 12 flight lenses. Still, the presence of liquid water is considered one of the key ingredients for life, and for scientists, the primary question about Europa has long been whether it could harbor some sort of life in its ocean.

"She is the first non-white female cabinet-level official appointed to the incoming Trump administration. Mrs Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during his election campaign. Who is Nikki Haley? Nikki Haley is the current governor of the US state of South Carolina. She is the first woman to hold the post and the second Indian-American, after Bobby Jindal, to serve as a US governor. Governor Haley, 44, was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa to Indian immigrant parents in Bamberg, South Carolina. She was raised as a Sikh, but converted to Christianity when she married. She is married to Michael Haley, an officer in the National Guard, and they have two children. Governor Haley first entered politics in 2004 when she was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives. She served three consecutive terms before running for governor in 2010. She won her first term in a runoff vote against her Republican opponent. In 2014, she won a second term, defeating her Democratic opponent by a large margin. Governor Haley has been described by some as a rising star in the Republican party and is considered a possible presidential candidate. She was also mentioned as a possible running mate for the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, during the election campaign. The governor is no stranger to controversy. In 2015, she was criticised for her response to a mass shooting in a black church in Charleston. She called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the South Carolina state house grounds, but was accused of not going far enough. The flag was eventually removed. She was also under fire over the 2015 removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state house grounds after the Charleston church shooting. During the campaign, she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio for the Republican nomination. But following his defeat, she said she would vote for Mr Trump. ""What I realise is, this is a time when we need to come together as Republicans and as a party, but more importantly as Americans,"" she said. Her comments in support of Mr Trump's policies were seen by some as an attempt to position herself for a role in the new administration.

"The king commissioned the piano for the palace from renowned maker Thomas Tomkison in about 1821. The instrument displays the flamboyant taste Tomkison shared with the king. It was bought by the Music Museum of the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1965. The piano is thought to be the only instrument from the period with soundboard painting to survive in its original condition. The images were discovered during conservation work carried out as part of a research project into early piano decoration by the SOAS, the British Museum and the Royal Academy of Music. The monarch's piano, which was unearthed at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), is thought to be the only instrument from the period with soundboard painting to survive in its original condition. Amid the exotic animals and foliage that are typical of the king's elaborate style, the painters have depicted a lion and a unicorn, and a figure of St George killing a dragon. The images were discovered during conservation work carried out as part of a research project into early piano decoration by the SOAS, the British Museum and the Royal Academy of Music. The project, which began in 2011, also involved the restoration of a piano with painted panels which belonged to the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. The work was carried out by the London-based piano restorer Paul McNulty, who was astonished to discover a second set of paintings beneath the lid of the instrument. After peeling away layers of old varnish, he found the images of the lion and the unicorn, which are a symbol of the British monarchy, and the figure of St George. It was a ""moment of complete disbelief,"" he said. ""It was very exciting, very surprising and very thrilling."" ""At the time, George IV was probably the most famous amateur pianist of his age,"" said the project's leader, Professor Ian Pace. ""It is ironic that he could never have actually seen these paintings as the lid of the piano was almost always left closed, as it was in a large room in the palace."" The images are believed to have been painted by Thomas Tomkison, a London-based piano maker who was known for his ""flamboyant"" style. The king commissioned the instrument for the palace from Tomkison in about 1821. The piano was bought by the Music Museum of the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1965, and was kept in storage for several years. Experts are working on a more detailed examination of the instrument, including the use of ultraviolet light to study the images. Dr Pace said the project had provided a ""unique insight into the history of the piano."" ""Not only are these remarkable images of national significance, but this project is also uncovering important details about the development of the piano, such as the kinds of materials used in its construction,"" he said.

"The former Army helicopter pilot and two fellow crew members will launch to the International Space Station (ISS) on a landmark flight from Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan. To mark the occasion, Tim is putting his name to a brand new whisky from Ballantine's, the 30-year-old single malt, limited edition, Ballantine's Space Glass. Tim Peake is the first British astronaut to be sent into space by the European Space Agency (ESA). He is due to spend six months on the ISS as part of the Principia mission - named after Sir Isaac Newton's seminal work on gravity and motion. Ballantine's Space Glass was created in partnership with the Open Space Agency, a collective of scientists, designers, engineers and artists, who develop projects that explore the edges of space. Their latest creation is a glass designed to drink from in zero gravity. To mark this momentous occasion, Tim Peake and Ballantine's have come together to create a limited edition whisky. Ballantine's Space Glass will be taken with Tim to the International Space Station and be launched on his arrival in November. The whisky takes the form of a zero gravity drinking experience, which allows a liquid to fall to the bottom of a glass, rather than float around as it does in space. The concept is inspired by the small droplets of whisky that form in zero gravity and the glass itself was created in collaboration with Scottish whisky experts at Ballantine's. Patrick Schiavone, Ballantine's Global Brand Director, commented: ""We are incredibly excited to be part of this project with Tim and the Open Space Agency. Tim is a genuine inspiration to us all and we are honoured to have a whisky with his name on it and which will be launched into space. The glass itself is a truly innovative design and we hope it will help astronauts to enjoy the Ballantine's 30 year old for many more years to come."" Tim Peake commented: ""The Space Glass has been developed to allow us to take whisky into space, so that we can enjoy it the way it should be. It will be a very special moment and I am delighted that I will be able to share this experience with the team at the Distillery when I return. The Ballantine's Space Glass is out of this world!""

"Both blasts went off on Thika road, a busy highway north-east of the city. The buses were crowded at the time of the explosions, which police said were caused by improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Witnesses said that some of those killed were burned beyond recognition. ""Most of the people were killed by the explosion. Others were injured by bullets,"" eyewitness Peter Mwangi told Reuters news agency. Another witness said she saw people being shot at close range. The explosions come at a time of heightened tensions in the capital and other towns, following the killing of a radical Muslim cleric and a series of revenge attacks by his followers. Kenyan authorities had said they feared attacks after the killing of Abdullah al-Faisal, a Jamaican-born Muslim cleric. He was sentenced to four years in jail last week for urging his followers to kill Westerners, Jews and Americans. In 2002 he served a year in jail after being convicted of inciting murder and hatred of non-Muslims. A group of gunmen in Mombasa fired shots at police and set fire to a luxury hotel before being killed by security forces on Wednesday. A Kenyan soldier was also shot dead outside a mosque in the city. Kenyan Muslim clerics have condemned the violence. A controversial decision by Kenya's government to build a new road through a forest in the capital has led to a surge in illegal logging, conservationists say. The new Nairobi Southern Bypass will cut through the Karura Forest, a 1,000-hectare (2,500-acre) patch of woodland in the city's north. The road is being built to ease traffic congestion in the city, but critics fear the forest will be destroyed. However, the government says trees will be replanted after the road is built. The new road is part of a 300m (200m) project to upgrade Nairobi's road network. The government says that it will provide a much-needed boost for the city's economy, but environmental groups fear the project will damage one of the last remaining green spaces in the capital. ""Karura is the lungs of Nairobi. It purifies the air, it recharges groundwater and absorbs rainwater and it provides a habitat for hundreds of species,"" said Jim Karani, the head of the Friends of Karura group. In the past month, environmentalists say illegal logging has increased in the forest, with many of the trees being used to make charcoal. Conservationists say the new road will fragment the forest, disturbing the habitat of wildlife, including 200 species of birds and other animals such as bush pigs, genets and antelope. The Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), a government-run organisation, is currently in charge of Karura. ""We are opposed to the road going through the forest, we think it will have a negative impact on the environment,"" said KEFRI's head of social forestry, Ben Biketi. ""Our research shows that many of the trees here are 500 years old and the ecosystem cannot be restored once the road is built,"" he said. The government has pledged to compensate for the damage by planting new trees in another part of Nairobi, but conservationists say this will be impossible. ""The trees in Karura are 500 years old, and it will take another 500 years for those trees to grow,"" said Jim Karani. The government says the new road is crucial for Nairobi's economy, and it has dismissed claims that the project will be damaging for the environment. ""This road is part of a wider development plan for Nairobi. We want to reduce the congestion in the city and the pollution that comes with it,"" said Peter Mbugua, the head of the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). ""We have to strike a balance between the environment and economic development,"" he said. Nairobi is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and the population is expected to double to five million people over the next 20 years. The government says it needs to expand the city's road network to cope with this growth, but conservationists are concerned that this will lead to more deforestation in the future.

"Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for the Dons. Goalkeeper Joe Lewis made several important saves for Aberdeen, including a smart stop from a close-range effort from Scott Brown after 55 minutes. The Scotland international's best moment came at 1-0 when he dived low to his right to keep out a powerful effort from Gary Mackay-Steven. In the 18th minute the Scotland international lost possession to Celtic's Callum McGregor, who then set up James Forrest for a shot that was parried away by Lewis. Most of the 23-year-old's work was done in his own box, but he made one foray forward, picking out Kenny McLean in the 15th minute. He did not have as much to do as his counterpart on the other side of the pitch, but he made a couple of good blocks. The 33-year-old played in a back three and was his usual composed self. His distribution was mostly good and he looked assured in the face of constant Celtic pressure. The former Celtic player was steady at the heart of Aberdeen's defence, but was unable to prevent his team-mate Shay Logan from losing possession in the build-up to Celtic's first goal. Logan tried to make amends with a fine run down the right in the 70th minute, but his cross was cut out. The 28-year-old was unable to make the same impact on the right side of the Dons' midfield as he did on the left in the semi-final win over Rangers. He did come close to making a big impact with a fierce drive that went just over the bar after 22 minutes. The 31-year-old had an important role in Aberdeen's win over Rangers in the semi-final and he was again prominent in the final. He was a willing runner and link man, and he got stuck in when required, but his best efforts were blocked. McLean was Aberdeen's most creative player, with his passing ability and vision in evidence. The 25-year-old came close to setting up a goal in the 14th minute when he played a ball to the back post, but his team-mate Stevie May headed over. In the 20th minute he almost put May through with a clever pass. The 28-year-old right-back had some excellent moments in the first half, including setting up a chance for May with a fine pass. However, he was caught out of position at the start of the second half, losing possession to McGregor, who set up Forrest for his shot that was parried away by Lewis. The 24-year-old was Aberdeen's most dangerous player, with his direct running from midfield causing Celtic problems. He went close with a shot after 12 minutes and a header that was deflected wide, before scoring the winner with a well-placed header after 39 minutes. The 30-year-old was a willing runner, getting stuck in on several occasions. However, he was unable to make much of an impact with his passing. In the 12th minute the former Celtic player tried to set up May with a pass, but it was cut out. The 28-year-old forward was a willing runner, but he was unable to link up with his team-mates in the first half. He went close with a header from a Logan cross in the 26th minute, before being replaced by Jayden Stockley at half-time. The 24-year-old forward started on the left side of Aberdeen's attack and he was a willing runner. However, he was unable to make a big impact in the first half and was replaced by Niall McGinn at half-time. The 26-year-old forward was Aberdeen's main goal threat, coming close to scoring with a header from a McLean cross in the 12th minute. He went close with another header from a McLean cross in the 37th minute, before being replaced by Jayden Stockley at half-time. The 26-year-old forward replaced May at half-time and he came close to doubling his side's lead with a header that",0,824
"Morton are well placed to secure a Championship play-off spot after Tuesday's 1-0 win at Raith Rovers. They were one of only two sides to earn a point at Ibrox last weekend, but could only draw at home to Ayr last time out. The hosts have won their last three home matches though, and they'll be looking to continue that trend against a team that has already secured their Premiership status for next season. Killie drew 1-1 at home to Hibs last weekend, but they haven't scored in their last four games, and their defensive record has been poor recently. We're not expecting too much to happen in this one, and under 2.5 goals looks the way to go. In-form Celtic can secure their seventh consecutive Premiership title if they beat Hibernian in Saturday's lunchtime kickoff. The Hoops have been scoring goals for fun this season, and they put five past Rangers in last weekend's Old Firm Derby at Celtic Park. The Hoops have won their last six league games, scoring at least three in each. Hibernian are a decent side, but they are a long way off Celtic's level. Neil Lennon's side have won their last two league games, but they have been heavily reliant on strikers Jason Cummings and Simon Murray. They may find goals hard to come by here, and Celtic look well worth backing at 815. The final game of the weekend sees Aberdeen host Ross County, and the Dons will be confident of getting back to winning ways. Derek McInnes' side have drawn three of their last four, and they have lost their last two at Pittodrie. Ross County have had a mixed bag of results in recent weeks, with defeats to Motherwell and Kilmarnock coming either side of wins over Hamilton and Dundee. Aberdeen look a little short at 47, and we like the look of both teams to score at 11. Dundee have won just one of their last 16 games, and they are in serious danger of being sucked into the relegation dogfight. Hamilton have been in decent form since the start of the year, and they have picked up good wins over Rangers, Motherwell and Ross County during that time. Martin Canning's men are starting to show the kind of form that they were expected to produce at the start of the season, and they are the clear favourites to take all three points here. We're backing a 2-0 win for Accies at 172. Motherwell have been in poor form since the start of the year, and they are without a win in their last six games. The Steelmen have slipped down to seventh in the table, and they are in real danger of missing out on a top-six finish. Dundee are only a point behind in eighth, but they have won just one of their last 16. Both of these sides look like they could do with the international break right now, and we fancy a low scoring draw here. St Johnstone have been in good form since the start of the year, and they have lost just one of their last eight games. However, only two of those matches have ended in Saints victories, and they are without a win in their last three. Rangers are five points clear at the top of the table, and they have lost just once in the league this season. The Gers have won their last three games, and they have kept clean sheets in each of those. The visitors have scored 11 goals in their last three away games, and we're backing them to win 2-0 here. Aberdeen are four points clear of Rangers at the top of the Scottish Premiership, and they have won their last three games in all competitions. They travel to Hamilton Academical on Saturday, and the home side have failed to score in three of their last four games. The Dons have kept clean sheets in six of their last seven games, and they have won their last six away matches. They are a massive price to win to nil here, and we're backing them to do so at 115. St Johnstone have been in good form recently, but they were beaten 2-1 at home by Hamilton Academical last weekend. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last seven games, and they have failed to score in their last two. Ross County are up to sixth in the table, and they have kept clean sheets in two of their last three away games. They have also failed to score in two of their",0,825
"Its reach has also expanded across the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert, attracting members from Mauritania, Morocco, Niger and Senegal as well as from within Mali where, in 2013, French and Malian troops halted its advance and forced it to retreat to the desert. The death of four US troops in Niger in October 2017 underscored the growing American military commitment to the Sahel region. There is no clear path to victory for either side in this battle. Instability in the Sahel has grown since a 2012 Islamist takeover of northern Mali by militants linked to Al Qaeda that was largely reversed by a French-led military operation launched the following year. A lawless triangle where the borders of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger meet has become a haven for jihadists, and violence has spread to coastal states including Benin and Ivory Coast. The French military put the number of dead at 10 fighters, and said that a number of others were ""put out of action."" The Algerian army later said the death toll was 25. ""The important thing is to guarantee the security of the population,"" Colonel Major Lamidi said. ""For that, we will continue until the last terrorist is killed."" Afghan forces, backed by American airstrikes and advisers, have been battling the Taliban militant group since the US invaded in 2001. Despite claims by the US and Afghan governments that the Taliban has been weakened, the group has recently conducted high-profile attacks in major Afghan cities. The US has also stepped up its campaign against ISIS-affiliated groups in the country, deploying more advisers and conducting more airstrikes on the group's positions. The Syrian civil war began as a largely unarmed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. It has since morphed into a full-scale war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. The war is being waged on multiple fronts, with non-jihadist rebel groups, jihadists, the Syrian government and its allies all fighting one another. The jihadist groups include ISIS, which at one point controlled vast swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq, as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of Syrian Islamist factions whose backbone is made up of a former Al Qaeda affiliate. The Russian military intervened in September 2015 to prop up the Assad government, which was struggling to hold territory in the face of a rebel advance. In late 2016, government forces drove rebels from eastern Aleppo, the country's biggest city before the war. A series of Russian-backed ceasefire deals has failed to bring about a political solution to the conflict. The US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria began targeting ISIS in 2014, driving it from Mosul and Raqqa in 2017 and inflicting significant casualties on the group. The US is also backing a Kurdish-Arab alliance known as the Syrian Democratic Forces in the east of the country. The war in Yemen, the region's poorest country, began in 2014 after Shia Houthi rebels seized control of the capital, Sanaa, and forced the government into exile. A coalition of Arab states assembled by Saudi Arabia launched an air campaign in 2015 to try to dislodge the Houthis from the capital and to reinstate the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The conflict has left at least 10,000 people dead, exacerbated a cholera outbreak and pushed millions to the brink of starvation. The fighting has taken on a sectarian dimension, with Sunni states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE battling the Shia Houthis. Al Qaeda's local branch, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has taken advantage of the chaos to seize territory in the country's south-east. The US has continued to conduct airstrikes against AQAP and a local ISIS affiliate. The US began a campaign of airstrikes against ISIS targets in Libya in 2016, but stepped",0,826
"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service recorded the acreage of several of the most serious of the 73 heath and grass fires its crews have tackled. The 332-acre total is the equivalent to around 200 football pitches. Group Manager Gavin Hammond said: ""The last few months have been very challenging for the fire service with large areas of heath, grass and forestry burning in the region. ""The prolonged dry spell of weather has resulted in vegetation and ground conditions that are extremely dry. These conditions, coupled with the hot temperatures and brisk winds have resulted in several significant wildfires in the Highlands and Islands. ""These fires have had a devastating impact on the environment. They have caused the loss of huge areas of forestry and heath and grassland and have also had an adverse impact on the local economy. ""The fires have resulted in the loss of grazing land and fencing, which in some cases has been in place for many years. They have also had a significant impact on the local wildlife and in one instance, a nesting colony of ospreys was lost. ""Many of these fires have required significant resources from the Fire and Rescue Service to bring under control. In some instances, the fires have been so large that we have been unable to extinguish them and have had to resort to containment, which has resulted in them burning for many days. ""The public are reminded of the dangers associated with wildfires and the devastating impact they can have on the environment and the local economy. ""I would urge the public to be extremely careful with naked flames when outdoors and to extinguish them fully. Please do not discard cigarette ends out of car windows.

"Aswad Thomas broke the deadlock for the hosts, heading Sam Magri's cross home after 22 minutes, but from there the visitors took charge. Andy Cook took his goals tally for the season to 14 when he found the bottom corner from 10 yards after good work from Ryan Wintle, before he added another with a calm finish just before the interval. Jonah Osborne headed the visitors into a 3-1 lead early in the second half, and although Andre Blackman reduced the deficit with a fine 25-yard strike, Osborne added a fourth with 13 minutes remaining to seal the points. The visitors made a bright start and could have been ahead inside the opening five minutes. Crewe's Luke Murphy found space on the edge of the box and let fly, with Shayne Hollis getting down well to parry the ball away from danger. After a quiet spell, Osborne forced a corner after a dangerous run into the area, and from the set-piece, Magri's delivery found its way to Thomas, who headed home from close range. The lead lasted just four minutes, as Crewe were level when Cook converted from 10 yards out after Wintle's cross was cleared into his path. Cook scored his second with a lovely finish from 15 yards, firing past the keeper after a neat one-two with Chris Porter. And the lead was extended when Osborne headed home from close range after Murphy's corner caused problems in the hosts' area. Blackman pulled a goal back for the hosts just after the hour mark, firing into the top corner from distance, but Osborne was on hand to add a fourth with 13 minutes remaining. The result sees Crewe close the gap on Bury to just four points, while the hosts stay 15th in the table.",0,828
"Police said Alexander Protopopov, acting deputy chief of Russia's prison service, oversaw the dismantling of the road in the far-northern Komi region. He then sold off its 7,000 reinforced concrete slabs, which he and his accomplices had replaced with a cheap, temporary cover. The new cover did not withstand the pressure of passing cars, and a gaping hole opened up in the road. ""The replacement of the concrete slabs with a temporary surface was a deliberate, criminal act that could have caused an accident, the death of innocent people, and other grave consequences,"" Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said in a statement. Markin said Protopopov and his accomplices also siphoned off funds earmarked for other work on the road, which links the Komi region to the neighboring Arkhangelsk region. Protopopov, who oversaw a prison service in Komi that has a staff of 15,000, was detained Wednesday. He and his accomplices face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of fraud, officials said. Prosecutors have also launched a separate probe into the suspected embezzlement of 68 million rubles (2.2 million) allocated for the road's construction, Markin said.

"Frenchman Christophe Borgye's remains were found at a property in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, in 2013 - four years after he was reported missing. Manuel Wagner, 29, has been found guilty of his murder, and David Ungi, 41, was found guilty of assisting an offender. The jury heard that Borgye was last seen by a friend on 13 December 2009. He was reported missing by his family in France, but a search by Cheshire Police found no trace of him. Police investigating a missing person's report said that Wagner was a prime suspect in the case. In 2013, a body was found buried in a ""concrete tomb"" at a house in Ellesmere Port. DNA tests identified the remains as those of Borgye, but his body was so badly decomposed it was impossible to determine the cause of death. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said that Wagner had been living in France when he met Borgye. The two men became friends and travelled together to the UK. Wagner told police he had been staying with Borgye at the Ellesmere Port address in 2009. He claimed that his friend had simply ""disappeared"" one day. ""In the early hours of the morning, the deceased left the property without taking any of his belongings,"" he told police. ""He's never been seen again."" Wagner claimed that the last time he saw Borgye, he was wearing ""a black jacket and black trousers."" But detectives became suspicious of Wagner's movements and found that he had tried to alter his account of the evening in question, adding that he was ""unreliable."" Wagner was arrested and later told police that he had carried out the killing and buried the body in his back garden. He said he had been ""angered"" by an argument with Borgye over money. Wagner said he stabbed his friend with a pen-knife and then buried the body in a shallow grave in the garden of the Ellesmere Port house. Wagner's defence team claimed that he had only admitted the killing under ""duress."" They said he had not intended to kill Borgye and that he had not intended to cause him serious harm. The trial heard that Borgye had died of blunt trauma to the head. The jury took four hours to find Wagner guilty of murder. Ungi was found guilty of assisting an offender. Speaking after the verdicts were read out, Detective Chief Inspector Gary McIntyre, from Cheshire Police, said: ""We are pleased that justice has been served and that the jury returned guilty verdicts. ""Christophe's family have been waiting a long time for this moment and to find out what happened to their son.

"It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned. Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save the Amazon rainforest. Mr Moura, 42, was given a 30-year jail term for ordering her killing. The US-born Ms Stang, a member of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur order, had received many death threats before she was gunned down. ""We want to see a fair and just trial,"" Ms Stang's brother, David Stang, told the BBC before the verdict. ""We want to see the ringleader behind bars for the rest of his life. I would like to see the government of Brazil enforce their own laws,"" he added. The jury in the federal court in Belem, capital of the Amazon state of Para, deliberated for more than 12 hours before reaching the verdict, which was met with cheers by Ms Stang's supporters. During the trial, prosecutors described Mr Moura as the mastermind behind the killing of the nun, who had spent decades defending the land rights of Brazil's poor and indigenous people. The court was told how Mr Moura had arranged the assassination after becoming angry with Ms Stang's efforts to keep him and his family from a plot of land they owned in Anapu, in Para state. Prosecutors said he had been the leader of a notorious gang known as the Rural Command of the Poor, which was responsible for death threats and land invasions in the region. After the verdict was delivered, Mr Moura's lawyer, Jader Marinho, said he would appeal against it. ""Today's ruling is a political farce,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""It is an arbitrary judgement. The jury did not follow the course of the trial. They didn't watch what was going on in the courtroom. They based their verdict on the media's version of events."" The jury also found two men - Rayfran das Neves Sales and Clodoaldo Batista - guilty of carrying out the killing of Ms Stang. They were sentenced to 17 years and 10 months and 15 years and eight months in prison respectively. Ms Stang's supporters said the trial was the final opportunity to bring to justice all of those responsible for her death.

"Scotland Yard said the 37-year-old was held at his home address under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Officers from the Metropolitan Police are searching the property. He has not been named. The arrest follows the death of a 31-year-old woman who collapsed after being exposed to an unknown substance in Amesbury, Wiltshire. A 45-year-old man, who was also exposed to the substance, remains critically ill in Salisbury District Hospital. Scotland Yard said the man's arrest ""is in connection with the investigation into the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal."" The arrest is the first to be made under the Skripal investigation since the suspects who were identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were seen in Salisbury the day before the attack. He will be transferred to custody in south-west England. The Met Police said they would not comment further. Detectives from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network have been investigating the death of Dawn Sturgess and the poisoning of Charlie Rowley, who was admitted to hospital on 30 June. They are also investigating the murder of Ms Skripal's father Sergei Skripal and attempted murder of his daughter Yulia Skripal, who were targeted in March this year. In a statement, the Met Police said the latest arrest was ""part of a planned operation"" but refused to give any further details on the investigation. It comes after the government revealed on Wednesday that tests had established the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was the same variety as that which poisoned Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley. The couple were found in a critical condition in a house in Amesbury on 30 June. Ms Sturgess later died in hospital. An inquest into the death of Ms Sturgess at Salisbury Coroner's Court earlier heard the mother-of-three was exposed to at least 10 times the amount of nerve agent the Skripals came into contact with. Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley are understood to have handled a container contaminated by the Novichok poison. The latest death is being treated as murder, and the poisoning of the couple as attempted murder. The inquest was adjourned until 2020. The Skripals' poisoning prompted a major incident involving hundreds of people - including emergency services personnel - in the Wiltshire city. A police officer who was one of the first on the scene was also seriously affected by the nerve agent. Nine months on, the investigation into the Salisbury attack continues. In July, a mother and daughter from Salisbury, Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin, were named as the two suspects by the UK government. Investigative group Bellingcat later revealed they were in fact highly-trained military intelligence officers. The Russian government has repeatedly denied all involvement in the poisoning. On Wednesday, the UK's security minister Ben Wallace said the government was set to submit an extradition request to Moscow for the two suspects. He said the government was ""ready"" to ask Russian authorities to send the two men to the UK to stand trial. ""We will bring all the capabilities of UK law enforcement to bear against the perpetrators,"" he said. The extradition request was delayed by the government to allow police to continue with their investigation. In a joint statement from the Home Office, the Foreign Office and the Department for Health and Social Care, the government said it was ""highly likely"" that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were exposed to the nerve agent after handling a ""contaminated item."" It said: ""It is our assessment that they were exposed to Novichok in a form that is much purer than that used in the attack on the Skripals. ""It is likely that Novichok was dispensed on to the street in a location in close proximity to the Skripals' home address.""",0,842
"The couple, from Halstead, suffered ""life-changing"" injuries during ""two hours of torture"" on 26 April. Kent Police said the woman remains in a critical condition and the man is still in hospital. The attack was carried out by three men who were armed with a knife and a claw hammer, police said. The attackers - who were wearing balaclavas - broke into the couple's house and used the weapons in an attempt to steal the keys to a safe. A fourth man, who was in a getaway car, has also been charged. The 34-year-old couple, who have not been named, were beaten, tied up and tortured, and the woman was also sexually assaulted. They suffered serious injuries including broken bones and the woman sustained life-threatening internal injuries. Police said they had been ""subjected to a two-hour ordeal"" before the couple managed to raise the alarm. Image caption The attackers wore balaclavas during the attack The couple were taken to hospital in London where they have been treated ever since. Det Supt Rob Vinson, from Kent Police, said: ""This was a horrific, targeted attack and the level of violence used was sickening.

"New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed off many bee colonies around the world. Varroa mites were found in the UK for the first time in 1992 and have now reached almost all of the honeybee colonies. The mite sucks the blood of the bees and passes on deformed wing virus. It can also infect bees with viruses that cause slow paralysis, blindness and death. The Cornish Black bees are resistant to the varroa mite as they have a different way of grooming themselves, which stops the mite reproducing. Dr Geraldine Wright, a senior lecturer at Newcastle University, said: ""This research is part of our ongoing efforts to conserve the Cornish Black bee. ""But the information we have learned from the Cornish bees can also be applied to other honeybee populations in the UK and abroad.""

"He said it ""makes sense"" for pay to be handled by AMs and Welsh ministers as education is already devolved. The Welsh Government described the move - part of planned changes to the way schools are funded in England - as a ""short-sighted move."" Teacher pay in Wales is set by the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government said it would be ""impossible"" to remove teachers from the national pay agreement and that the English proposals would not ""work"" in Wales. The Department for Education in England is proposing to remove national pay and conditions for teachers in England from September 2013. Instead, individual schools would be given the power to set pay, with the aim of attracting the best teachers. The government says schools in England have been hampered by ""bureaucratic burdens"" and need more flexibility over issues such as staff pay and conditions. Mr Crabb, Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, said: ""I think it makes sense to move towards teacher pay being determined in Wales by Welsh ministers and by the Assembly. ""It will be the same for the teachers here, they won't notice a change."" Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he was ""not prepared to discuss any changes to the current Welsh pay and conditions framework."" Mr Andrews said: ""There is no appetite among the teaching unions or the wider education workforce for the dismantling of the national pay agreement.

"The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices. But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech lawyer warns. The draft Investigatory Powers Bill has come under fire for its 'equipment interference' provisions, which would place a legal duty on internet providers to help the security services hack phones and PCs. But such powers would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a leading technology lawyer has warned. The draft bill published last month (PDF) has also been criticised for its 'bulk equipment interference' provisions, which would allow the security services to install malware and 'target equipment' remotely. Richard Cumbley, global head of technology at Linklaters, said the term 'equipment' is not defined in the bill, which would leave the government with a free hand to remotely install malware on any device, including connected cars and smart-home thermostats. ""The legislation as it stands is not clear,"" said Cumbley. ""There is no definition of what is covered."" He said the bill defines 'equipment' as anything that can be used to ""send or receive data over the internet, store data, or send or receive telecommunications."" ""This definition is deliberately wide and is likely to cover all manner of devices, from smartphones to cars,"" said Cumbley. ""Smart cars may be able to communicate with other cars, parking garages or even the traffic lights themselves."" The draft bill also contains a provision stating that equipment interference should not be used against 'national infrastructure' or 'economic well-being'. ""Even if the government intended to restrict the scope of equipment interference, the law as it stands does not,"" he said. ""The definition of equipment covers almost anything that can be plugged into the internet. That would seem to include even the most obscure and unexpected devices, like fitness trackers and thermostats."" The draft bill is currently being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. Cumbley also warned that the bill's provisions, if passed, would have knock-on effects for tech companies in the UK. ""The UK has ambitions to be a digital powerhouse,"" he said. ""The power to conduct bulk equipment interference and the potential for indiscriminate hacking are likely to cause many businesses and investors to question the UK as a destination for technology businesses.""",0,848

"Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge. Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected on the charge. In a statement after the ruling, which does not mean the jury's guilty verdicts over the other two offences are overturned, Mr Weatherhogg said: ""I am pleased that the court has accepted my appeal in respect of the conviction for coercive and controlling behaviour. ""I am now looking forward to returning to my young family after serving over two years in prison."" The detective's barrister, David Barnes, said that ""in the context of this case, there were a number of factors which led to the conclusion that the judge's direction had been inadequate, not least the fact that this was the first case of its kind to be tried in this jurisdiction."" The Court of Appeal also said that the judge's direction to the jury on the coercion charge was ""inadequate"" and that they should have been told to consider what was said by the detective's wife in her original complaint, and not just her later evidence. The detective was found not guilty by a jury of four other charges including intimidation and assault. Mr Weatherhogg's wife claimed that the detective had physically abused her and said he had pointed a gun at her in front of their children. However, the detective denied the allegations and said his wife was a ""compulsive liar."" A jury at Belfast Crown Court took seven hours to return unanimous guilty verdicts on the charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault on occasioning actual bodily harm, and a majority verdict on the charge of coercive and controlling behaviour. The detective had denied all the charges against him. Mr Weatherhogg's wife told the court that the abuse started in 2015 and that it was ""like living with Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde."" On one occasion she said her husband beat her with a metal bar and on another he punched her in the face and then strangled her with her scarf. She claimed she was ""punched and kicked"" by her husband, who she said would shout at her to ""shut the f up."" The court heard that the alleged abuse continued until February 2017, when the woman said she was attacked by her husband with a metal pole while she was holding the couple's baby son. She said that during the attack the baby was accidentally struck by the pole. The woman said her husband also ""punched"" and ""slapped"" her son. Mr Weatherhogg's wife told the court that after a previous incident of domestic violence her husband had made her lie to police about what had happened and that he ""made her out to be a liar."" She said that during the couple's marriage she had been diagnosed with depression and had been prescribed anti-depressants. She claimed that Mr Weatherhogg had not only controlled her physically but that he had also controlled her financially, and had stopped her from working. Mr Weatherhogg's wife said that her husband had held a gun to her head on a number of occasions.

Its annual revenue for 2014 was 4.8 billion ringgit, which was down by 3.4 per cent year-on-year. Its annual loss was 1.17 billion ringgit, down by 17 per cent from 2013. The airline had suffered years of financial losses even before it was hit by two major disasters in 2014. Flight MH370 disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. All 239 people on board are presumed to have died in the incident, but the cause of the crash and the location of the aircraft has not been determined. In July, flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Malaysia Airlines' group chief executive Christoph Mueller said in a statement: ""We have achieved what we set out to do in 2014, which was to effect the necessary changes for the future of the airline."" ""The work done so far is already showing positive results in our bottom line and we are on track to meet our goal of stabilising the airline by the end of this year,"" he added. The airline said that it aims to break even by the end of 2017. Malaysia Airlines was taken private by Malaysian state investment fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad in Dec 2014, in a 6 billion ringgit deal. Khazanah Nasional now owns 100 per cent of the airline, and in May this year, Mr Mueller was appointed to head the airline. A new chief executive had been sought by Khazanah as part of its recovery plan for the airline. It said then that Mr Mueller's appointment was the ""most important step"" in the recovery process. The airline had earlier said that it would cut 6,000 jobs, with 2,000 of those through the end of 2014. Its fleet would also be reduced to 140 planes from 194. Malaysia Airlines said that it would launch a new business plan in September.",0,864
"Some 1,500 officers have been deployed to the Olympic Stadium area, authorities have said. Officials are in high alert following Tuesday's attacks in Brussels. Last year, a friendly between Germany and the Netherlands was cancelled due to a bomb threat. Germany and the Netherlands played in an empty stadium on Tuesday following a bomb threat in Hanover. The match was called off just 90 minutes before kick-off. Local police have confirmed that they are taking extra security measures in the Olympic Stadium area where Tuesday's game between Germany and the Netherlands is due to take place. ""We have a security concept for every game and this concept is adapted to the current situation,"" a police spokesman told German daily ""Berliner Zeitung."" ""We have 1,500 officers deployed, as always,"" added police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf. The threat of a bomb attack against the stadium in Hanover on Tuesday led to the friendly being cancelled and the evacuation of 70,000 fans. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned against ""despair"" in the wake of the attacks. ""We're going to have to deal with more attacks,"" Merkel said in Berlin. ""We know that terrorists are out to hurt us Germans. And we know that we are in the cross-hairs of international terrorism."" Following Tuesday's attacks in Brussels, which killed 31 people and wounded some 300, the international terror alert level in Belgium has been raised to the highest level. The European Union has warned of possible further attacks in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The threat in Belgium and the Netherlands remains at the maximum level, with Germany at the second-highest level. On Wednesday, the EU commission warned of a ""serious and imminent"" terror threat. On Thursday, British police arrested six people in connection with an alleged terror plot.",0,865
"From April 2016, those in England and Wales will have to pay a 3 surcharge on each stamp duty band. George Osborne said the new surcharge would raise PS1bn extra by 2021 and help deliver more than 400,000 affordable homes. The surcharge will not apply in Scotland, which has its own land and buildings transaction tax. The Treasury says the new rate is designed to curb the growing buy-to-let market and allow first-time buyers a chance to get on the housing ladder. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker says the buy-to-let sector has become increasingly significant in the housing market, as many people struggle to afford to buy their own homes. He said the government had come under pressure to dampen demand from investors, many of whom do not live in the UK. Anyone who has exchanged contracts on a buy-to-let property, or a second home, before 26 November 2015 will not be affected by the surcharge. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""We need a fair system of tax for housing. People buying a home to let should not be squeezing out families who can't afford a home to buy. ""That's why we are introducing new rates for stamp duty that are fair and work better for our country. ""If you buy a house to let out - or a holiday home - then you will be three percentage points higher on each stamp duty rate band. If you are buying your first home, you will not pay any stamp duty at all on the first 125,000.""",0,866
"Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish Governments should have negotiated an agreement with the DUP and Sinn Fein to make their devolved institutions work years ago, but they have repeatedly dodged the issue. There is no better time to act. Sinn Fein has been deliberately vague about what it wants and why it wants it, in the hope that the inevitable backlash against the IRA will force republicans to compromise and bring them to the table. They are not going to bend on their opposition to the police service of Northern Ireland and their ""dissidents"" will not accept any deal that does not entail the destruction of the police. We should not be seeking to change the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, but any deal which breaks the deadlock in the devolved institutions should be regarded as an interim settlement, with all parties accepting the need to move on. The IRA have been defeated, but the peace process is on hold. The DUP have been struggling to explain how they could achieve anything from a pact with the Conservatives, which is a sign of how little they have been able to achieve on their own. They have used the excuse of IRA violence to try and force republicans to concede defeat, but their electoral success has made it harder for them to accept that the game is up. They should be told that the Tories are prepared to work with a new coalition, so long as the police are accepted. The Irish Government have lost all credibility as honest brokers in the peace process and they should be sidelined. The British Government should make it clear that they will not tolerate any further obstruction from Sinn Fein and that the DUP must accept that they are not going to get everything their own way. The lesson of the Belfast Agreement is that there is no alternative to a negotiated settlement. Sinn Fein have failed to take their seats at Westminster, so they should be told that they must accept a transfer of policing and justice powers to the Stormont Assembly and that they can no longer pick and choose which parts of the peace process they will participate in. The ConservativeDUP coalition agreement announced today does not include any reference to the border in Ireland. The DUP are apparently insisting that Northern Ireland should be treated the same as the rest of the UK in relation to Brexit, but the Government has already said that the free movement of people will end and there will be a ""new customs arrangement"" with the EU. The DUP will no doubt be seeking to maximise the benefits for Northern Ireland from any special arrangements made to ensure the future of the Irish border and they are the ones with the most to lose from the ending of the CTA, since the Republic of Ireland is the destination for over 30 of goods exported from Northern Ireland. The Government has already said that any special deal for the border would be part of the overall agreement on the future relationship with the EU and this should give the DUP every incentive to be as flexible as possible in their negotiations. It would be far better for both sides if they can agree a ""soft"" Brexit deal for the UK as a whole, but the DUP may well be the first to find out what a ""hard"" Brexit really means. The Government has already said that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, so it is not clear why it is taking so long to confirm that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be insisting on special arrangements for the border, which would give them a bargaining chip in negotiations with the EU, but it is hard to see what could be agreed. There is nothing in the Conservative manifesto about a common travel area for the whole of the UK, but the Government has already said that they will seek a reciprocal agreement with the EU for the rights of UK and EU nationals to visit, work and live in each other's countries. There is no reason why this could not also apply to Ireland, so there should be no problem with the CTA. There will have to be some kind of border controls between the UK and the EU, which could cause problems for people crossing from Northern Ireland to the Republic and vice versa. The DUP are already insisting that there should be no border in the Irish sea, but it is hard to see how any other arrangements could be made. The Government has said that there would be no return to the borders of the past, but they are now talking about a ""flexible and imag",0,867
"""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving the ball around with the kind of aplomb that reveals a certain talent. Above him, on the balcony of the communal flats on the edge of the pitch, sit a group of men in their 30s and 40s. They're watching the game, but they're also chatting, and, if you look carefully, you'll see that one of them is trying to write a letter. This is a place where people can come and play football, but it's also a place where people can come to get advice about welfare and employment. The man writing the letter is Kevin Kane, who's been working in community development in the area for 25 years. He's one of the people behind Possilpark's ""community football team,"" a project that's been in operation for the past eight years, and which has had a remarkable impact on the area. Kane is watching the football from the balcony because the pitch is right next to the flats, and he's also keeping a watchful eye out for any of the older people in the area who might want to come and have a chat about a problem they're having with their benefits or taxes, or even to get some help writing a letter. When Kane started working in the area in the late 1980s, it was a notoriously difficult place. Possilpark was one of the most deprived areas in Glasgow, and the housing was some of the worst in the city. Now, it's a much more attractive place, with new housing, and the transformation has been taking place over the past eight years. Kane is modest about his role in the changes, but he acknowledges that the work he and others have done with the community football team has had a major effect. The team started in 2006. Kane, who works for the housing association in the area, was inspired by what he'd read about the Rangers Charity Foundation, which had started a community football team in Easterhouse, in the east of Glasgow. The community football teams were a kind of experiment, and a number of different clubs were involved. The idea was that a group of people would form a team, and they would play against other teams in the area. The fact that the teams were made up of people who would not normally have got a chance to play in a team was a big part of the appeal, but the idea of the teams was also that they would be able to reach out to people in the area. A lot of people would come to watch the matches, and the players would get the chance to talk to them. Kane took the idea and used it as a basis for something much wider. The players on the Possilpark team have to go on a training course to learn how to work in the community, and they're encouraged to be involved in all sorts of community projects, from drug awareness campaigns to projects aimed at helping older people. ""You're not just asking them to play football,"" says Kane. ""They're trained up and they're asked to be involved in a community project. It's a whole lifestyle change."" As well as the training, the players have to commit to 10 hours of volunteer work every week. The project has grown and grown, and now there are two teams, one of men and one of women. The two teams have won 30 trophies between them, but the real success of the project has been the impact it has had in the community. A lot of the players have gone on to get jobs and further training. They've been encouraged to do things that they would never have thought possible. For many of them, the experience has been life-changing. ""The programme has been massively successful,"" says Kane. ""It's been a great project."" It's a great success story, but Kane believes that the work he's doing now is even more important than the community football team. His latest idea is based on the fact that there are a lot of people in Possilpark who have experience of the criminal justice system. He's set up a mentoring programme that matches up people who are in prison or in the care of the social services with people who have been through the same experience and have managed to make a success of their lives. ""It's a chance for the person who's had the experience to talk to somebody who's had the same experience, but has managed to move on,"" says Kane.",0,868
"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had identified 33 local areas where pubs would not face sufficient competition after the deal. Heineken, which already owns 1,100 pubs, must now sell pubs in 31 areas to win approval of its takeover of Punch Taverns, the CMA said. Katherine Kendrick, a senior director at the CMA, said: ""Our findings show that the merger might lead to a worsening of these existing problems by removing competition between Heineken and Punch. In a joint statement, Punch and Heineken said they ""continue to engage positively"" with the CMA, adding: ""The companies have agreed a substantial package of undertakings, including the proposed divestment of up to 30 pubs. The CMA said it was consulting on its proposed undertakings until 12 April. The CMA first raised competition concerns over the deal in November 2017. The competition watchdog said the two firms owned pubs in many of the same areas and their beers, including Heineken and Strongbow, were often the only ones available to customers. The takeover would give the Dutch brewer control of more than 1,900 pubs in a deal that would be worth about 403m. Punch operates about 3,300 pubs nationwide.",0,869

"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. US President Barack Obama, in his last days in office, on Wednesday ordered the transfer of 221 million (204 million euros) to the Palestinian Authority (PA) that had been frozen by former Secretary of State John Kerry. Obama's move reportedly came at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. The Israeli premier had opposed the transfer in the past, saying the PA was supporting terrorism. The US State Department said it had released the money to the PA shortly before Kerry was to deliver a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The transfer, which was the last of the funds appropriated by Congress for the PA in 2015, had been delayed for months due to Israeli and US opposition. The Obama administration has been feuding with Israel over the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. While the administration has said that the expansion of the settlements is hampering the peace process, the Israeli government has rejected the claim. However, the Israeli government has accused the US of actively working to promote a UN resolution against the settlements. On Wednesday, Obama's National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Ned Price told reporters that the US administration had worked hard in the last eight years to facilitate a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. He said despite the best efforts, the two sides had failed to reach an agreement. ""We worked to preserve the possibility of the two-state solution, which is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" Price said. The spokesman, however, noted that the administration still hopes that the two sides will be able to reach an agreement. ""We will not try to dictate what a fair and viable solution looks like,"" Price said. Meanwhile, John Kerry was to deliver a speech later on Wednesday to lay out his vision for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The speech is expected to be one of Kerry's last major addresses on the Middle East peace process.",0,871

"Energy company BG Group said it was gradually taking workers from the Lomond installation - about 145 miles east of Aberdeen - by helicopter. A Norwegian vessel which caught fire earlier today is under tow to shore. There were no casualties in either incident. BG said it had ""taken the precautionary measure"" of evacuating the Lomond installation after an ""isolated gas release"" was detected on the West Brae platform. A spokesman for the company said: ""BG Group can confirm that at approximately 4pm today, an isolated gas release was detected on the West Brae platform. ""The Lomond installation, which is connected to West Brae by a bridge, was evacuated as a precautionary measure. ""All personnel are safe and the situation is under control. ""A further update will be provided when more information is available."" Meanwhile, the Norwegian Coastguard is heading to the scene of a blaze on an offshore supply vessel. The Coastguard said 31 people have been rescued from the CBO Mano Polaris, which was being used by Statoil, following the fire on Thursday. It said the blaze was now under control and the vessel was being towed to land. The Coastguard said all 31 people on board the vessel had been flown to safety and the fire extinguished. ""The fire is now out and the vessel is under tow by the supply vessel Olympic Challenger,"" a spokesman said. ""The vessel is on its way to Sandnessjoen."" Norway's oil safety authority said the fire broke out in the vessel's engine room but did not result in any pollution. The vessel was working on the Statoil-operated Troll B platform, which is located around 50km (30 miles) from the fire. Statoil said it was working to get the platform back in production as soon as possible. ""The platform is on its way back to normal operation after the fire on board CBO Mano Polaris,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The fire did not affect the production on Troll B."" Norway's oil safety authority said it had deployed its own investigation team to the scene to work alongside the police. The CBO Mano Polaris, which is owned by Norwegian firm Olympic Shipping, was built in 2005 and is 93.9 metres long. The blaze is the latest in a series of incidents to hit the North Sea in recent months. In October, Total said it had evacuated all 238 workers from its Elgin platform in the North Sea following a gas leak. The incident came just weeks after oil giant BP was forced to shut down its North Sea operations following a helicopter crash which killed all 16 people on board. British Energy Minister Charles Hendry welcomed news that all the workers had been evacuated from the Lomond installation. He said: ""This is an evolving situation, but I am pleased that all personnel have been evacuated from the Lomond installation and that the fire on board CBO Mano Polaris is under control.

"The 27-year-old Scot, who is back at number four in the world after dropping down the rankings following back surgery, is to marry girlfriend Kim Sears in April. Murray is to marry Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral in April. Andy Murray is to marry his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in April, it has been announced. The 27-year-old world number four will marry Miss Sears at Dunblane Cathedral, the town in central Scotland where the British number one grew up and where he still lives. Miss Sears' father Nigel confirmed the wedding date and venue after watching his daughter play in a mixed doubles match at the Hopman Cup in Perth, Australia, where she is partnering her fiance. It has been reported that the wedding reception will be held at the 16th Century Cromlix Hotel, which Murray bought for 1.8 million last year and which has since been refurbished and opened to the public. The couple met in 2005 when Murray was playing at the Sunderland Challenger tennis tournament and Miss Sears, 26, was watching with her father Nigel, who is a tennis coach. Murray was a teenage prodigy at the time, while Miss Sears, a 20-year-old student, was studying English at Sussex University. They began dating in 2006 and have been together ever since, with Miss Sears travelling the world to support Murray. The couple briefly split in 2009 but reunited within months. They became engaged in November 2014 and have since been trying to keep the venue for their wedding a secret. Miss Sears and her father refused to comment on the wedding venue after she was knocked out of the Hopman Cup with a 6-4 6-2 defeat to Australian pair Ajla Tomljanovic and Lleyton Hewitt. Miss Sears was cheered on by her mother Judy, Murray's mother and his brother Jamie and his wife Alejandra. Judy Murray, a tennis coach and captain of Britain's Fed Cup team, said: ""We are all thrilled for Andy and Kim. They make a lovely couple. After Murray's victory over Kohlschreiber, the world number four said: ""It's been a little bit stressful trying to arrange that for the last few weeks, so I'm happy that that's done and I can relax and concentrate on tennis again. Murray has been back in Dunblane this week as he took part in a promotional video for the Andy Murray Live event on September 11, a charity exhibition at Glasgow's SSE Hydro which is being held to raise money for Unicef and local charity Sunny-sid3up. He is due to play Roger Federer and Tim Henman, while other guests include Sir Alex Ferguson and Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

"Another 130 people were wounded in what authorities said was a ""premeditated, violent terrorist attack."" Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought Xinhua said. City officials said the death toll was expected to rise. China's Ministry of Public Security has sent a team to Urumqi to investigate the violence, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The violence comes as tension has been rising in Xinjiang in recent months following riots in July in Urumqi that left nearly 200 people dead. Uighur groups say Chinese restrictions on their religion, culture and language have fueled ethnic tensions in Xinjiang. The region is home to 8 million Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people, many of whom resent rule by China's Han majority. State media said most of the attackers were men, but some were women. Calls to local hospitals and the police rang unanswered. Pictures posted on the Internet by Uighurs in exile showed police with riot shields on the streets, smoke and debris, and what appeared to be a seriously wounded person. The attacks began at 7:10 p.m. Sunday (1310 GMT) when a group of armed people drove two vehicles into a vegetable market in Gongyuan Alley near Renmin Park, Xinhua said. They then attacked bystanders, stabbing many and setting fire to shops, the report said. Another group of attackers carried out similar violence at the South Railway Station. Pictures on the Internet showed two lines of police with riot shields clashing with a group of people. Others showed people lying on the ground, including a child with bloody clothing next to a bicycle. Xinhua said no other information about the suspects was immediately available. The Urumqi attack came on the anniversary of the 1949 founding of the People's Republic of China, a holiday marked by a large military parade in Beijing. ""It was very scary at the scene. I saw several armed Uighurs trying to break into the train station,"" a witness told CCTV. ""The police were shooting them. The rail station was on fire."" The attacks come as the city was on edge ahead of a widely expected verdict in the trial of 20 people charged in the July riots. The region has been under heavy police presence in the lead-up to the Oct. 1 verdict, with more police and armored vehicles on the streets. Uighurs say the Han Chinese migrants are gradually squeezing them out of their homeland by dominating its economy. The region has abundant oil reserves and borders Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Central Asia. The Urumqi violence in July was the worst ethnic unrest in China in decades and followed a demonstration by Uighur youths demanding an investigation into the deaths of Uighur factory workers in a brawl in southern China. The protest was violently suppressed by police, who Uighurs say killed scores of people. The official death toll was 197, most of them Han Chinese. China has already blamed Uighur militants based abroad for carrying out the July violence, which prompted a sweeping crackdown in the region. The July violence and the subsequent crackdown have heightened tensions between China and the U.S. and the West, with Beijing accusing Washington and other governments of meddling in its internal affairs. Last week, the U.S. State Department said it had granted refuge to a prominent Uighur businesswoman who was jailed for life in China after the July riots. China's Foreign Ministry said Friday that the U.S. action constituted interference in its internal affairs. Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen contributed to this report.",0,878
"Boyle struck the only goal in the 18th minute after lobbing over Graham Doyle following a moment of hesitancy in the Wexford defence. Derry needed fine saves from Gerard Doherty to deny Wexford's Conor English and Danny Furlong while Cillian Morrison should have done better with a first-half header. Wexford were much better in the second half with English, Furlong and Joe O'Brien all forcing Doherty into fine saves. But the away side couldn't find an equaliser as Derry took the win and a massive step towards promotion.",0,879

"He was chairman for 16 years, during which time the club enjoyed an 11-year stint in the Premier League and two Uefa Cup campaigns. ""This is a very sad day for our club,"" said current manager Martin O'Neill, who played for the club under Robson. Robson, who died at the age of 76 after a long battle with cancer, managed at St James' Park between 1999 and 2004 and led the Magpies to two successive top-five finishes. Robson, who was born in the mining village of Sacriston, County Durham, was also England's longest-serving manager, holding the post from 1982 to 1990. The club said Robson was ""a hugely popular figure within the club and held in immense affection by staff and supporters alike."" He also had a spell as manager of his boyhood club Middlesbrough, leading them to the League Cup final and promotion to the Premier League in 1998. Robson was famed for his work ethic, passion and tactical nous as a player and a manager. Newcastle United have announced that their stadium will be renamed ""The Sir Bobby Robson stand"" in his honour. After an illustrious playing career with Fulham and West Bromwich Albion, Sir Bobby managed a number of England's top clubs, including Ipswich Town, PSV Eindhoven, Sporting Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona. Robson, who led England to the World Cup semi-finals in 1990, was 76. ""He was a great man and a fantastic football manager,"" said Keegan. ""His character was he just loved being at the training ground and working with players, he was never afraid of hard work."" Current manager Martin O'Neill said the club was devastated by the news. ""The club was devastated to learn of Sir Bobby's passing today and our condolences go out to Lady Elsie and the family,"" he said. ""He was a great football man, a real gentleman and a great ambassador for the game,"" the former Boro boss added. ""In my time at Middlesbrough he was always a huge support and it was great to have him around the place."" ""We have had a lot of great managers here but he is the greatest."" Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear added: ""I will never forget the passion and pride he showed for this club and the city. ""He loved the fans and the region and he gave us some great days and memories, the like of which we had never seen before and may never see again."" St James' Park, home of Newcastle United football club, will be renamed the Sir Bobby Robson Stand in honour of the former England and Newcastle manager who died today after a long battle with cancer. In 2002, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his impact on the game as both a player and as a manager. Robson was knighted in 2002, and received the Freedom of the City of Durham the same year. Sir Bobby Robson dies at 76 Sir Bobby Robson: his life in football",0,881
"Slovakia is launching a legal challenge to mandatory quotas that were passed in a majority vote on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister has proposed a radical budgetary revamp to raise money for its refugee program. Slovakia's foreign minister said on Wednesday the country would challenge the European Union's quota plan for distributing refugees to member states. ""In the past two days, the Slovak government has been consulting over the possibility of a legal challenge to the adopted decision, and it decided to take that step,"" Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak told the parliament. ""The question is whether we will be able to change something,"" Lajcak said. ""I think it is worth it because we have to take into account what the consequences of this decision would be for Slovakia."" Slovakia has been vehemently opposed to the quota plan, with Prime Minister Robert Fico threatening to go to court over the issue. Meanwhile, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Wednesday proposed a radical budgetary revamp that would raise money for his country's refugee program. The new budget would increase personal income taxes and introduce new taxes on banking and telecommunications companies, among other measures. The government would also be able to divert 35 percent of Hungary's EU funds to support refugees. Orban's nationalist, anti-refugee policies have made him a pariah in Brussels, but he remains popular in Hungary. The European Commission on Tuesday announced a plan to relocate 120,000 refugees from Italy, Greece and Hungary to other EU countries. Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Romania all voted against the quotas, while Finland abstained. EU states will have to accept the allocated number of migrants, although the plan allows for some flexibility. The plan would give Italy and Greece 30,000 and 40,000 resettlement places respectively. Hungary would receive 54,000 places, although the country will be able to count any refugees that it allows to pass through its territory towards the total. The other EU states will have to take up to 32,000 refugees between them, with 4,000 to be distributed to Finland and 16,000 to be allocated to France and Germany. The resettlement plan was proposed by EU leaders in June. Greece's prime minister has said that his country is under pressure from both refugees and creditors. Alexis Tsipras called on the European Union to help secure the country's borders and to speed up refugee relocations.",0,882

"That phrase hinted both at an ideal flexible arrangement in the future and an ideal shared approach from both the UK and Irish governments, together stressing to the EU the need for the least disruptive approach to the Border. Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney had also pointed to ""new thinking"" on the Border from the European Commission last week in a paper on the practicalities of Border arrangements in a no-deal scenario. The commission paper - outlining checks away from the Border on goods travelling between the Republic and Northern Ireland - did not outline how such a scheme would work in practice and would need a clear political agreement, it said. The Government's language in its statement on Tuesday was that it would ""not countenance"" any hard border, with the Taoiseach saying afterwards that if the UK pushed ahead with a no-deal departure, it would have to come up with its own ideas as to how to avoid a hard Border. In their meeting on Wednesday, the Taoiseach and Mr Barnier reviewed the Government's no-deal contingency planning, including on the land border. Mr Varadkar said Ireland was working to ensure that the EU's no-deal preparations were consistent with those of Ireland. Mr Varadkar also raised the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit on the Northern Ireland institutions and the Good Friday Agreement, the Government said.",0,884

"The mayor of London has been criticised for pedalling his barrister wife Marina Wheeler through the capital on Thursday on a bicycle designed for one person. Giving a backie is, as they say, ""against the law."" That's not the only thing about the incident that's likely to draw the ire of Londoners. Giving a backie is also thought to be a dangerous activity that will risk not only their lives, but those of other road users and pedestrians. Mrs Wheeler, 45, was sitting on the back of the bicycle's basket as Johnson rode it through Kensington, where he was campaigning. The couple have been married since 1993 and have four children together. The incident happened as Johnson continued his campaign to be elected the next Conservative mayor of London in May. The candidate is no stranger to controversy, and has been in the headlines before after being spotted riding his bike with his mobile phone clamped to his ear. London's cycling commissioner Andrew Gilligan was reportedly among those to criticise the stunt. ""I would not recommend that anybody try to get on a bike with a passenger on the back,"" he told the Evening Standard. Giving a backie, as it's known, is against the law.",0,886

"Edwards, 23, has scored three goals in 127 games for the Shrimps since joining from Blackburn Rovers in May 2014, with two in 50 appearances last season. The centre-half was one of the first names on the team sheet in his first season at the Globe Arena, but was sent off twice in his first 11 games and was then dropped by boss Jim Bentley. That was when the former England Under-18 international, who can also play in midfield, decided to take drastic action to get his career back on track. Edwards, who said he is now fully focused on the game after learning his trade as a joiner during his time out of the game, is hoping to make his first start for the club in this afternoon's friendly against Barrow at Holker Street. Bentley has brought in four new players this summer - goalkeeper Chris Neal, defender Zak Mills, midfielder Kelvin Etuhu and striker Vadaine Oliver - and Edwards says he is looking forward to fighting for his place. ""Pre-season has been hard but enjoyable,"" he said. ""I'm feeling fit and strong and I'm looking forward to this season.

"Greg Dyke has invited Astle's widow Laraine and his daughters, Claire and Dawn, to Wembley Stadium on 10 August. The ex-West Bromwich Albion and England forward died in 2002. A post-mortem examination discovered he was suffering from dementia brought on by heading the ball. In a statement, Dyke said: ""This is about saying 'sorry' to the family. It's not about saying the FA is responsible for what has happened. ""We're not trying to make a judgement, we're trying to say 'sorry', we recognise something happened, we're very sad Jeff died and we're very sad for the family."" Dyke said he expected the Football Association would also be ""making a donation to the Jeff Astle Foundation"" but he had not discussed any amount with them. Astle's daughter Dawn has been campaigning for football's governing bodies to admit there is a link between heading a football and brain damage. ""We welcome this invitation and I am sure the family will be very appreciative,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live. ""But it will be a very emotional day for us. It is not just about Jeff Astle. It is about all the other players who suffered this, like the great Nat Lofthouse and all the others. ""And it is not just about the players - it is the fans who were always told 'this ball is safe, head it, kick it, there's nothing wrong with it'."" Astle was just 59 when he died in 2002, having been suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease. A 2002 coroner's report found that the West Brom and England striker died from ""industrial disease"" as a result of heading the ball during his football career. The FA said in 2002 it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the coroner's findings. It has since said there is no conclusive proof that heading a football causes brain damage and that it is important to wait for further research. ""I think this is a welcome move by the FA. It is a positive step,"" said Alan Buck, a partner at law firm Silverman Sherliker, who are representing the Astle family in their claim. ""It is a long overdue acknowledgement that Jeff Astle suffered from brain damage as a result of heading a football during his career. ""The Astle family have fought for many years to highlight this issue and have campaigned for more research to be carried out to help players and their families. ""Until now, the FA has refused to accept that there is a link between brain damage and heading a football. ""It is now hoped that this can lead to further research into this matter and we are pleased that the FA is acknowledging that Jeff Astle died as a result of heading a football."" Dawn Astle says she will not be satisfied until there is a full admission from the FA that heading a football caused her father's death. ""I have met with Greg Dyke a few times now and we are getting closer and closer to that admission,"" she added. ""It would be a fantastic move forward in football if the FA could make that statement. ""This is not just about Jeff Astle, there are lots of other families out there and I am sure they would want the same thing - they would want the FA to say 'we accept that heading the football caused your husband's death'."" The FA and the Football League said in December that they would support any players who had concerns about heading a football. They said there was ""no conclusive scientific proof that heading the ball can lead to permanent brain damage."" ""We are now conducting our own research in this area to see if there needs to be more done to protect players who head the ball,"" they added. ""We are pleased to announce a partnership with The Drake Foundation which will see the creation of a research fellowship in the field of head trauma in football."" The Drake Foundation was set up in memory of former England and Nottingham Forest defender Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Draisey, who died of brain injuries in 2012. An inquest found that Drake, who was 52 when he died, had brain damage consistent with ""repeated blows to the head."" The foundation has been researching football-related brain injury since 2009.

"The report found that although alcohol consumption has dropped since 2008, those in poorer communities are more likely to suffer or die from alcohol-related disease. The coalition government rejected a minimum unit price (MUP) on alcohol in 2012, claiming that it would penalise those who drink responsibly and would not have a significant impact on harmful drinking. However, the report found that ""for every 10 increase in the MUP, there was a reduction of 30 in the number of deaths."" The report also found that the 70 of alcohol that is consumed by hazardous and harmful drinkers is drunk in the cheapest third of drinks. A MUP would work because, instead of taxing all alcohol equally, regardless of its strength or the amount consumed, it targets the type of alcohol that is consumed by hazardous and harmful drinkers. This is important because one person drinking a lot of alcohol is more damaging to their health than several people drinking smaller amounts, even if the total amount of alcohol consumed is the same. MUP also has the advantage of not unfairly penalising moderate drinkers. The 4 duty escalator, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, meant that the cost of alcohol increased by 2 above inflation every year. This increased the price of alcohol for everyone, including those who drink responsibly. In contrast, a MUP is only targeted at cheaper alcohol. In the 2012 budget, the coalition government rejected a MUP and instead increased duty on beer by 2, cider by 3 and wine by 5. This move was strongly criticised by Alcohol Concern as it increased the price of alcohol across the board, instead of targeting the cheaper, stronger drinks that are most likely to be consumed by hazardous and harmful drinkers. The government's own figures show that a 45p MUP would affect 7 of alcohol sales, whereas the 2012 duty increase affected 57 of alcohol sales. The government's rejection of a MUP was criticised by the British Medical Association, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Although the 2012 budget saw alcohol duty rise by 2, 3 and 5 for beer, cider and wine respectively, the effects of the duty escalator, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, are still being felt. Between 2008 and 2013, alcohol duty increased by 2 above inflation every year. This table shows how much alcohol duty increased between 2008 and 2013. The effect of the duty escalator was to penalise moderate drinkers as well as problem drinkers, which is why the coalition government replaced it with a below inflation rise in duty in the 2014 budget. Alcohol duty rates have been frozen since 2014. However, the alcohol duty rates set by George Osborne in the March 2016 Budget, which came into force on 13 March 2016, mean that a bottle of wine will be 10p cheaper and a bottle of spirits will be 38p cheaper. A can of normal-strength beer and cider will be 3p cheaper. The duty rates for high-strength beer, wine and cider will rise in line with inflation. However, the budget also contained a levy on soft drinks, which will come into force in April 2018. The levy, which will be applied to the manufacturer price of soft drinks that contain added sugar, will be charged at a rate of 18p per litre if the drink has 5g of sugar per 100ml and 24p per litre if the drink has 8g of sugar per 100ml or more. Pure fruit juices and milk-based drinks will be excluded. Campaigners such as Sustain and the Children's Food Campaign have welcomed the introduction of the levy, but have called on the government to extend it to milkshakes. Milkshakes, some of which contain as much sugar as cola, are currently excluded from the levy, as they are regarded as milk-based drinks.",0,896

""We've been inundated with people wanting to know what's going on, people wanting to know about the restaurant, and the bar,"" he said. The pier was opened in 1853 as Victoria Dock Pier and was built to attract tourists and holiday makers to the city. It was purchased in the 1880s by the Hull and Barnsley Railway Company and was renamed the Hull and Barnsley Pier. During the First World War, the pier was used to land fish for the war effort, but it became an amusement park in the 1930s, and a pier ballroom was built. The ballroom was destroyed by fire in 1941 and the pier closed in 1974, having fallen into a state of disrepair. It was restored and reopened in 1983, but it again closed in 2007 after it was damaged in a storm.",0,897
"Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA testing has revealed that the genetic make-up of modern Europe was largely shaped during the Bronze Age. Ancient human DNA research is revealing the genetic roots of modern Europeans. A recent study found that the genetic make-up of modern Europeans was largely shaped during the Bronze Age and in particular by two major migrations at the start and the end of this period. The study was based on a large dataset of genome-wide DNA data from present-day Europeans and from ancient DNA extracted from prehistoric skeletons of Europeans who lived 3,000 to 8,000 years ago. It was published in Science magazine in February 2015. The researchers compared the ancient genetic data to the genetic make-up of modern-day Europeans to find out when different groups arrived in the continent. They found that the genetic make-up of Europe was largely shaped during the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age began around 5,000 years ago and was marked by an explosion in bronze tools, weapons and ornaments. This was a result of the introduction of metalworking technology from the Middle East. Between 4,800 and 3,000 years ago, there was a major migration into Europe from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, a vast area stretching from Moldova to Western Kazakhstan. These people brought with them technologies that included the wheel and plough and the Indo-European languages. These languages include the ancestors of English, German, Greek, Russian, Persian, Hindi and many others. This research has also shown that this migration was the source of at least a third of Europe's genetic ancestry today. This migration was previously thought to have taken place thousands of years later, in the early Iron Age. In addition, the study shows that previous analysis of prehistoric populations was incorrect in suggesting that there had been a major genetic turnover in Europe around 4,500 years ago. This was based on the comparison of ancient and modern-day DNA from central Europe. It appears that the genetic discontinuity is the result of extensive population discontinuity in central Europe, while other parts of Europe remained connected. In the later Bronze Age, there was a second major migration into Europe. This time it was from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), which acted as a genetic conduit from the Middle East. These newcomers seem to have integrated into the local genetic make-up. This study provides a powerful new dataset to explore the history of European populations. It shows that migration and population movement have played a major role in shaping the genetic make-up of the continent. The new information will be useful for future studies, as it will allow scientists to disentangle the genetic contributions of Europe's ancient ancestors. The study shows that Europe's genetic make-up today is the result of a mixture of three major ancestral populations: indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population from the east that arrived in the Bronze Age.",0,898
"A referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is to be held later this year. The survey indicates that only 11 of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland intend to vote to leave, while 35 said they will vote to remain in the EU. Christianity was in its infancy. An image of the iconic battle scene at the end of the movie ""Gladiator"" came to mind. It's not just a matter of finding out who you are, but of finding out who you aren't. They also discovered a large number of documents, photographs and videos which ""will be of significant investigative interest to the inquiry,"" Mr Murray said. It is understood that the two men were not in custody in relation to the missing teenagers. The Commission set out a timeline for settling the claims of 47 million consumers who were potentially mis-sold PPI between 2005 and 2010. More than 18 million PPI policies were sold in the United Kingdom, mostly between 1990 and 2010, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, and some 12 million people have already received compensation. The City watchdog said that banks have been making progress in improving the way they handle the complaints, but added that there are still many people who are waiting for their cases to be dealt with. A spokeswoman for Lloyds said: ""We will continue to work closely with the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure that all remaining complaints are resolved as quickly as possible."" ""Firms must continue to improve their complaint handling and ensure customers get the right outcome as quickly as possible,"" the regulator's director of supervision, Clive Adamson, said. The FCA and the City regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, had to step in when there were concerns about the slow pace of progress. ""The regulator has been clear that banks have done far too little, far too slowly, to resolve these complaints,"" said Andrew Bailey, the FCA's chief executive. Lloyds Banking Group has already set aside 12bn to cover compensation costs. ""It's now been seven years since we first told the banks to put their customers first and clean up the mess they made of complaints,"" he said. ""Banks still have a lot to do to get this right, and while they have made some progress there is more to do."" HSBC said it ""regrets the way PPI was sold and we have been working hard to get compensation to customers.""",0,899
"Media playback is not supported on this device ""You're not wanted any more"" rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on West Ham's chant about Dimitri Payet. The Frenchman is, of course, the star of the Hammers, the Premier League's highest-paid player and the man who can turn a game on its head with a moment of magic. The odds were stacked in the visitors' favour, with Slaven Bilic's men entering this game on the back of a nine-match unbeaten run. But Payet was not the man to decide this contest as the hosts beat West Ham for the first time in 18 years to reach the FA Cup fifth round for the first time since 2004. ""I think Payet was the best player on the pitch,"" said AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley. ""He's a world-class player and he showed that at times today. ""But what we showed is that if we're set up right, we're organised, we work hard, we stick together and we stay in the game, we've got a chance of beating anybody. ""If we go out and try to play, we'd be here all day."" Payet has been linked with a move to Manchester United this month, and it's easy to see why. He has a wand of a left foot and has scored eight goals in 23 appearances this season. The 29-year-old had the best chance of the first half, but fired wide from the edge of the box. He also hit the bar and forced James Shea to make a smart save. But he was unable to find a way through Wimbledon's well-organised defence. The Dons were, at times, content to sit back and soak up pressure but they were solid and disciplined. They did not offer much of a threat going forward, but on the few occasions they did, they looked dangerous. Lyle Taylor was a nuisance, Tom Elliott was a handful and Sean Rigg's pace caused West Ham problems. Rigg was also a key part of the move that led to the only goal of the game. He won a corner on the left, and midfielder Dannie Bulman fired a low delivery into the box. Elliott's header across goal was palmed away by Hammers goalkeeper Darren Randolph but only as far as Tom Beere, who tapped home. The 22-year-old has been with the Dons since the age of eight, and his strike gave the League One side a memorable win. ""There was one moment in the second half where I thought to myself, 'wow, this is the FA Cup',"" said Beere. ""There were about 7,000 West Ham fans singing Payet's name, but we came through it and we're delighted with the win."" It wasn't pretty at times but Wimbledon did what they needed to do. In front of a record crowd of 4,880 at Cherry Red Records Stadium, they booked their place in the fifth round for the first time since they lifted the trophy in 1988. ""You can't always come out and play well,"" added Ardley. ""Sometimes you have to get a bit of luck and today we got that. We're not going to win many games playing like that. ""But at the end of the day, it's the FA Cup and we're in the fifth round."" Scored one, saved one. James Shea was at fault for Chelsea's goal in the fourth round, but he more than made up for it with a string of saves against West Ham. He denied Emmanuel Emenike and Payet, and helped AFC Wimbledon to a famous win. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: ""It was a very tight game. They were 100 committed and we were not. ""We had a couple of chances. It is not just Payet, he is not superman. If you don't score, you are not going to win."" On Andy Carroll: ""I am very happy. He is getting better and better. He is one of our best players in training and in games he is getting better. I am very happy with him.""

"The Anglo-Dutch giant's chief executive Ben van Beurden accepted that Arctic drilling ""divides society,"" but said the world needs new sources of oil. Greenpeace said Shell was taking a ""massive gamble."" Shell has become the first major energy firm to confirm it will start drilling for oil in the Arctic. The company announced on Thursday that it had received final permits to drill in the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska. ""We will drill two wells in the coming months,"" Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden told AFP in The Hague. The Anglo-Dutch giant's announcement comes despite a groundswell of protests from environmental activists who say it is too risky to drill for oil in the remote, frigid Arctic region. Van Beurden acknowledged that Arctic drilling ""divides society,"" but said the world needed new sources of oil and gas. ""We have to take the higher costs of this kind of operation into consideration,"" he said. ""The opportunities in this part of the world are huge."" Shell suspended operations in 2012 after one of its drilling rigs ran aground. Four environmental groups have challenged the government's approval of Shell's exploration plan in the US Court of Appeals, saying that regulators have failed to consider the impact on the ecosystem. The UN's climate change panel warned last month that most fossil fuels must be left in the ground to avoid dangerous warming, but Van Beurden insisted that more oil would be needed to meet rising global demand. ""It is not acceptable to have society say, 'We don't want fossil fuels' and then expect us to supply the rest of it,"" he told The Guardian newspaper. The Arctic holds about 20 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources, according to the US Geological Survey. Greenpeace spokesman Ben Ayliffe said Shell was taking a ""massive gamble"" in the Arctic.

"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being used to download photographs from hacked Apple IDs. The utility has been shown to be able to download pictures and documents from an iCloud account without the account's owner's knowledge. The attack that targeted the celebrity accounts is said to have used a bug in the software to give the hackers access to personal information. Its discovery prompted security researcher Kenneth White to publish details of a new tool that could download iCloud back-ups without permission. In response Apple told the BBC: ""We're aware of intermittent organized network attacks using insecure certificates to obtain user information, and we take this very seriously. ""These attacks don't compromise iCloud servers, and they don't impact iCloud sign in on iOS devices or Macs running OS X Yosemite using the Safari browser."" The iCloud software was not affected by the bug used to hack the celebrity accounts, Apple said. ""We are working closely with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved,"" said the firm. Apple is due to release an update to iCloud that will prevent the tool from working. ""The update will create a client-side certificate that will be required for requests to certain iCloud endpoints,"" said Mr White. ""This is definitely the best approach to the problem."" The iCloud bug, he added, had been patched by Apple. In the past, security researchers have been criticized for revealing details of vulnerabilities before the companies involved have had a chance to fix them. Mr White said that he had given Apple two weeks to deal with the bug and had delayed publication to give the firm longer. ""Apple is very responsive to reports of vulnerabilities in their products,"" he said. ""I would encourage people to report to Apple."" Given the high profile nature of the recent attack on celebrity accounts, he added, it was right that Apple had acted fast to prevent a repeat.

"Barcelona said it paid EUR57m (PS43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to EUR83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour at the court, where he was summoned to testify. The case stems from a complaint by DIS, a Brazilian company that owned 40 percent of the rights of the Brazilian star at the time of the transfer. DIS received just 6.8m for the transfer in 2013 but believes it was cheated out of its real share. Neymar's current club, Paris Saint-Germain, said it was not worried about the outcome of the case and the possible payment of millions in back taxes and possible match sanctions. ""Neymar was summoned to declare in an investigation following a complaint from DIS to determine the circumstances of the signing of the player in 2013,"" the statement said. Barcelona spokesman Josep Vives said Neymar's move ""was carried out in line with existing laws."" Neymar moved from Barcelona to PSG in August for a record 222 million euros (then 246 million) as part of its strategy to build a superteam. He is under contract with PSG until 2022. Neymar's decision to leave Barcelona angered the club and its fans. He had been one of the club's biggest stars, and the team had won the Champions League, Spain's La Liga and Copa del Rey, and the Club World Cup during the four years he played there.

"The poverty rate was 15 in 2011, meaning 46.2 million Americans were in poverty, staying flat after three previous years of increases. Real median income of households in the country fell by 1.5 to 50,054, the report showed. In the United States, the poverty threshold for a family of four, consisting of two adults and two children, was 23,283 in 2011. The poverty threshold for two adults living alone was 14,318, and for a single person living alone, the poverty threshold was 11,702. Poverty is a critical problem that affects many people of the world, including the United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that 15.1 of the United States population is living in poverty. The official poverty rate for 2011 was 15 percent, representing 46.2 million people living in poverty. Statistics show that children are more likely to be poor than any other age group. In fact, 21 of people under the age of 18 are living in poverty. As poverty continues to be a major problem in the United States, understanding the causes of poverty is critical. The 2012 poverty rate was 15 percent, representing 46.5 million people living in poverty. Causes of poverty include single parenting, unemployment, divorce, lack of education, lack of job skills, substance abuse, unplanned pregnancies, natural disasters, discrimination, racism, prejudice, economic recession, foreclosure, incarceration, health problems, and family problems. Increases in the poverty rate also affect the population of homeless Americans. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that there are 633,782 homeless people in America. This number has continued to rise since 2007. With the population of the homeless increasing, the causes of poverty continue to be a major problem that affects the United States. While the causes of poverty are very complex, there are two main solutions to poverty. The first solution is for individuals to increase their income. This can be done by obtaining a job, or by seeking higher education. The second solution is for individuals to cut their expenses. This can be done by reducing their spending, or by reducing their debt. Poverty is a very complex social problem. There are many factors that contribute to poverty, including lack of education, unemployment, and other factors. For example, homeless people tend to spend more on transportation. This is because they move around more, and they use public transportation. This is especially true for people who do not own a car. One of the best ways to reduce poverty is by increasing education. The more educated people are, the more likely they are to find employment. In addition, the more education people have, the more money they are likely to make. A good education is the best way to solve poverty. The United States Census Bureau has established the poverty thresholds, and they are updated each year. These thresholds represent the income that is required for basic food and shelter. While these thresholds are updated each year, they do not necessarily reflect the actual poverty rate. This is because the cost of living is continuing to increase. The United States Census Bureau identifies 4 levels of poverty thresholds. Poverty Thresholds: Poverty Threshold (Dollars) Family (Four People) 23,283 Family (Two People) 14,318 Family (One Person) 11,702 Poverty is a social problem that affects many people in the United States. It is important to understand the causes of poverty in order to understand how to reduce poverty in the United States. Poverty affects many people in the United States, and is a very complex social problem. Some of the causes of poverty include low levels of education, unemployment, divorce, and single parenting. Increasing education and employment is the best way to reduce poverty in the United States. In addition, increasing welfare programs and the minimum wage is another way to reduce poverty.

"Jordan Edwards, 15, died after Officer Roy Oliver fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs. Police initially said the vehicle was reversing ""in an aggressive manner"" toward officers, but police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver was fired and charged with murder on May 5, the same day as Edwards' funeral. Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson announced the indictment Monday, saying her office ""will prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law."" ""I have heard the community's cries for justice and accountability, and we are committed to a fair and thorough presentation of this case,"" Johnson said in a statement. Evidence presented to the grand jury was both forensic and testimonial, and included statements from several officers who were on the scene, Johnson said. The indictment was issued without a recommendation of a specific charge by prosecutors, allowing the grand jury to consider the more serious charge of murder, her office said. Johnson became district attorney in January, after predecessor Susan Hawk stepped down to get treatment for depression. Oliver's attorney, Jim Lane, did not respond to multiple phone messages seeking comment. The Dallas County Sheriff's Office, which is conducting the criminal investigation into Oliver's actions, said in a statement Monday that its probe was still ongoing and that no additional information would be released until the case is presented to a judge. The Edwards family and their attorney, Lee Merritt, said they were pleased by the indictment. ""This is the first time in history that a Dallas County grand jury has indicted a police officer for killing a black child,"" Merritt said. ""We're still saddened by the loss of Jordan. We're still saddened by the cowardly nature in which he was killed. We're still saddened by the fact that his brother had to watch him die. But we're grateful."" The Edwards family filed a federal civil lawsuit against Oliver and the Balch Springs Police Department in May, alleging Oliver ""unjustifiably and recklessly"" used deadly force. The family's attorneys said Edwards' death was part of a pattern of violence by police, particularly against people of color. Edwards' father, Odell Edwards, said Monday that the family's ""faith in the justice system is restored."" ""This is the first time that I've seen that the Dallas County justice system will treat African-American young men fairly and we will continue to monitor the situation and continue to push for justice until the end,"" he said. Prosecutors, who are required by law to present cases to a grand jury when a police officer is involved in a fatal shooting, did not have to bring charges against Oliver. But Johnson, a black woman who grew up in Dallas, has pledged since she was appointed that the community would see ""equal justice"" under her watch. Oliver has also been indicted on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant related to the shooting, Dallas County District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Brittany Dunn said. The second count is related to the shooting of the teenager's vehicle. Edwards and his two brothers and two other teenagers were driving away from an unruly house party in Balch Springs late April 29 when Oliver opened fire on their vehicle with a rifle. The bullets shattered the front passenger-side window and struck Edwards. Edwards' 16-year-old brother was driving. The Dallas County medical examiner's office ruled his death a homicide. Oliver, who joined the Balch Springs department in 2011, was fired days after the shooting for violating department policies. Oliver was indicted last year on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in an unrelated incident, court records show. Oliver was accused of displaying a gun during a traffic accident. Oliver pleaded not guilty to the charges in May and was released on bond. The district attorney's office said the new indictment ""will have no effect on the pending case."" A message left for Oliver's attorney in the aggravated assault case was not returned Monday. Johnson said that after the shooting she spoke with Edwards' father, who ""pled for justice."" ""As district attorney, my job is to seek justice on behalf of victims of violent crimes,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""As I",0,916

Local TV showed the heavily damaged Boeing 727 Allied Air plane lying on its belly with only the rear part intact. The wreckage of an Allied Air cargo plane is pictured after it crashed at an airport in Accra, Ghana, Saturday June 3, 2012. The Boeing 727 had 10 people on board and was arriving from the Gambia's capital, Banjul, on Saturday. All four crew members survived, but at least one of them is in critical condition, said the country's president John Atta Mills, in a statement. Allied Air is an aviation company based in Nigeria.

The crashed plane was a Boeing 727 operated by Nigeria's Allied Air Cargo. Witnesses told Reuters the plane hit a passenger bus after it skidded off the runway while trying to land. Witnesses said the plane, which was arriving from the Gambia's capital, Banjul, was also carrying food and some passengers, but the number was not clear. The plane is believed to have been carrying food and some passengers. President John Dramani Mahama said all four crew members had survived. He said at least two people on the ground had been killed and that it appeared the plane had been overloaded.

"Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who will start second, was fifth-fastest. The Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas took third and fourth, with the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in sixth and seventh. McLaren's Jenson Button was eighth, while Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat were ninth and 10th. Ricciardo's team-mate Sebastian Vettel had a dismal session, coming 16th and being eliminated in the first part of qualifying. The Red Bulls were expected to struggle in Singapore, and the first part of qualifying saw Vettel eliminated along with Sauber's Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez and Lotus's Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Gutierrez and Grosjean were the only two to make it to Q2 on the super-soft tyre, and both were unable to improve on the option tyre, so did not make it to Q3. That left a nine-car shoot-out for pole, with Mercedes' Hamilton and Rosberg split by the two Williams. Raikkonen and Alonso were next, followed by Ricciardo, Button, Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne, Kvyat and Force India's Sergio Perez. Hamilton had already set a time more than half a second faster than Rosberg's, before a mistake on his final lap left the German on pole. He had a mistake-strewn final lap, leaving the door open for Rosberg to take pole. ""We know we are not the best in the race but it is a really good start and in the race anything can happen,"" Rosberg said. ""The conditions were changing all the time and you need to be at the top of your game to get it right. ""It's a great day for us. I feel really good and I can't wait for tomorrow. There is a great car behind me and I need to go for it. It is a long race and anything can happen."" Hamilton said: ""Congratulations to Nico. He did a great lap. I had a great lap going until the last corner. I was really happy with the lap I had done. ""I was feeling good with the car. It was going really well, I was really excited. I had it under control and I made a mistake and unfortunately that is the way it goes. ""It doesn't make the race any easier, it is still a hard race to get through. I have to keep my head up.

"The group were convicted of Tuesday of assaulting social worker and activist Ken Tsang as he took part in the 2014 pro-democracy rallies. TV cameras caught the officers removing Mr Tsang's handcuffs, then pushing him to the ground and kicking and punching him. Mr Tsang was left with bruises to his face and body, and the trial judge, David Dufton, said that he believed the officers had assaulted Mr Tsang. However, he said there was reasonable doubt that it was a premeditated attack and acquitted the men of the most serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Mr Tsang's lawyer, Margaret Louis, said she was disappointed that the officers were not convicted of the more serious charge, but was encouraged that the judge had concluded that the attack was intentional. The two officers are expected to be sentenced on Friday. Seven officers were originally arrested in relation to the incident, but only two were charged. The incident was captured on video by a local television station and broadcast live. It was a shocking moment in Hong Kong's normally restrained and disciplined police force and caused a huge public outcry. The city is currently being convulsed by the Umbrella Movement, with thousands of people occupying roads and bridges to protest against China's decision to impose restrictions on who can stand in the city's next election. It is the latest stage in a long-running campaign for full democracy in the city. The pro-democracy campaigners are demanding that the Chinese government allow the people of Hong Kong to elect the city's next leader, rather than a committee of Beijing-friendly businessmen. The protests have seen sporadic clashes between the protesters and the police, but have mostly been peaceful.

"The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at Marseille's main railway station on Friday, carrying weapons including a Kalashnikov automatic rifle. He was identified by the owner of a car that was seen on camera footage in the area around the Jewish Museum at the time of the attack. The gunman fired on the entrance to the Jewish Museum in central Brussels on 24 May, killing an Israeli couple and two employees. The Jewish Museum in Brussels is not a Jewish institution. It is a museum about Jews. The majority of its visitors are not Jews. The museum is situated in the heart of the European quarter, between the headquarters of NATO and the European Commission, and opposite the Belgian Parliament. The museum opened in 1998, just as Belgium's 30,000-strong Jewish community was beginning to recover from the assassination of four Jews at the Delhaize supermarket in the city of Aalst in 1989. The museum is part of the network of Jewish museums in Europe and has regular contact with other Jewish museums, such as in Paris, Berlin, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. In a statement, Mr Nemmouche's family said it was ""shocked"" by the allegations. Nemmouche was known to French authorities, having been arrested and convicted in the past for drug and robbery offences. He was jailed for five years in 2008 for robbery with violence. He was known to have spent time in Syria and was flagged up as a ""returning foreign fighter"" by the authorities. But after a period of surveillance, his case was closed in September 2013. Belgium has announced it is sending more than 100 extra police officers to Brussels to boost security at Jewish sites. France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the French authorities would help Belgium to investigate the attack. ""The Jewish community is part of the French nation and deserves all of our attention,"" he said. Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said the attack was ""terribly shocking."" ""This was a hit on the Jewish community,"" he said, adding that Belgium ""is not an anti-Semitic country and we will fight all forms of anti-Semitism with the greatest determination."" Belgian police have appealed for information on the shooter, who wore a baseball cap, sunglasses and was carrying two bags. Eyewitnesses said he opened fire with a Kalashnikov-style assault rifle before entering the museum. The dead Israeli couple have been named as Emanuel and Miriam Riva, from Tel Aviv. The museum's receptionist was named as Dominique Sabrier and the volunteer as Alexandre Strens. The couple's 26-year-old daughter said her father, who was shot in the head, had worked at the museum for 11 years. ""He was a good man, very good,"" Lea Riva told Israeli radio. The Belgian government's crisis centre has called a meeting on Sunday morning to discuss security arrangements. France is also holding an emergency security meeting on Sunday. In the wake of the shootings, the European Jewish Congress (EJC) said many Jews are living in fear in Europe. ""This was a targeted attack on Jews. It is clear that this attack was aimed exclusively at the Jewish community and is another example of the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe,"" EJC President Moshe Kantor said. ""This was a murder of innocent people who were gunned down simply because of their origin. This attack is the direct consequence of the climate of hate and incitement to genocide propagated by extremists."" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ""belated"" condemnation of anti-Semitism by European leaders was ""not enough"" and urged them to take ""action"" against it. ""The wave of hatred is reminiscent of the worst pages of modern history,"" he said.

"Ackerman was initially banned in October last year after being found guilty of corruption. He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win. Ackerman was found guilty of misconduct and banned from racing for three years. The decision was challenged by Ackerman at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which has now dismissed the appeal. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said Ackerman had been properly sanctioned by the British Horseracing Authority and that the appeal had no chance of success. The court said Ackerman was involved in a conspiracy with other people in the racing industry and his actions damaged the integrity of the sport. The court was told Ackerman laid 1,000 on a horse to lose at a major meeting in 2010 after he found out the jockey had been instructed not to win.

The university said developer Balfour Beatty confirmed the remaining 300 rooms would be finished and available by January 2016. The opening of the new student accommodation, known as Penglais Farm, has been delayed by six weeks. Aberystwyth University said construction works were ""very close"" to completion, but delays in obtaining final building certification meant it would be the beginning of October before students could move in. ""We are continuing to work very closely with Balfour Beatty, the university's accommodation partner and the developer of Penglais Farm, and we are in a position to confirm that the accommodation will be available for occupation in October,"" said a spokesman for the university. The university said there was a high demand for accommodation and an additional 130 rooms were currently being built to meet the demand. The university said it hoped students would understand the ""difficulties that have arisen."" ""We will do everything we can to ensure that any inconvenience caused to students by this delay will be minimised,"" said the spokesman. This is not the first time the new accommodation has run into problems.

"Four US tourists and an Australian pilot died after their light plane came down on a shopping centre on Tuesday. It had just taken off from the small Essendon Airport, 13km (8 miles) from the city. Witnesses said the plane appeared to have experienced a catastrophic engine failure. The pilot was Max Quartermain, a 63-year-old veteran aviator who had flown tourists, journalists and politicians. He was honoured in 2016 for flying Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to remote indigenous communities, and had also flown former PM Julia Gillard. The passengers were Greg Reynolds De Haven, Russell Munsch, Glenn Garland and John Washburn, who had been staying in Melbourne with their wives. The plane came down on the roof of the Direct Factory Outlets shopping centre, narrowly missing a primary school and the Tullamarine Freeway, which carries thousands of cars a day. In a statement, Victoria Police said: ""The pilot is believed to be the only person on the plane. The four US citizens were on a tourist trip to Australia."" The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the plane was a Beechcraft Super King Air. The US National Transportation Safety Board said it would send an investigator to assist with the investigation into the cause of the crash. The shopping centre was evacuated, and the fire service said firefighters were at the scene within minutes. The freeway reopened later. The pilot, Max Quartermain, was described as ""one of the best pilots"" in Australia. Premier Daniel Andrews described it as ""an absolute tragedy"" and said he would not speculate on the cause of the crash. ""This is a desperately sad day,"" he said. ""This is just terribly, terribly sad news."" A senior police officer said the plane had ""completely imploded,"" leaving a ""scene of devastation."" The shopping centre was busy with people buying gifts on the first day of the school holidays, the BBC's Hywel Griffith reports from Melbourne. Most witnesses heard the crash rather than saw it. ""I was getting out of the car and heard this big bang and saw all this smoke,"" shopper Jane Parsons told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I thought it was a bomb going off or something - then we saw all the smoke and the car park attendants told us to get out of the car park."" ""I was sitting in the car waiting for my wife to return to the car when I heard this horrific explosion and saw this fireball come up, then lots of black smoke,"" witness Michael Howard said. ""It appears that the plane has impacted the rear of the building, which is a cafe, and there's no doubt that there would be casualties involved,"" he added. ""There's also a primary school there and that's all been evacuated, the kids have all been taken away to a safe area."" Ms Parsons said: ""I can't believe it. You feel so sorry for the people, and their poor families."" Another witness, Sarah, told the ABC: ""All I saw was a massive fireball. I didn't see a plane. I didn't see anything.

"Adrian Simut, 35, travelled to Newport train station, where he thought he was meeting a 14-year-old girl called Sam. But he was confronted by so-called ""paedophile hunters"" and later arrested, Newport Crown Court heard. He was given an immediate jail term after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence. Simut, of Woolwich, London, was jailed for 18 months by Judge Daniel Williams. Judge Williams said: ""This is not the first occasion on which you have been caught communicating with a child in such circumstances. ""You must have appreciated the seriousness of this matter."" In September 2017 Simut was caught in an online sting operation by a group calling themselves 'Dark Justice', the court heard. He was given a 10-week jail term suspended for two years and ordered to take part in a sex offenders' treatment programme. Prosecutor David Williams said the 'Dark Justice' group set up a fake profile on social media and Simut made contact. He asked for pictures and arranged to meet at Newcastle railway station. Simut was arrested and said he was travelling to Newcastle to go to a gym and had not intended to meet anyone. Simut pleaded guilty to attempting to incite a girl aged 13 to 15 to engage in sexual activity. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court sentenced him to 10 weeks jail suspended for two years with a 25-day rehabilitation activity requirement. The court heard he had two previous convictions for possessing indecent images of children. He was caught in an online sting operation by a group calling themselves 'Dark Justice', the court heard.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Saturday's loss to Liverpool was the Swans' third in succession, leaving them a point above the bottom three and increasing the pressure on manager Paul Clement. ""Our form has not been good enough, we have not got enough points, we have not scored enough goals and we have conceded too many,"" Clement said at his post-match press conference. Swansea City's head coach Paul Clement gestures on the touchline during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Swansea City at the Emirates Stadium in London on October 28, 2017. ""I've been in the game a long time, I've managed and coached a lot of games and I've never been in a situation like that."" ""I've got to understand that."" ""I have to understand the game, the club I'm at, the league I'm in and the players that I'm dealing with."" It was a bitter-sweet afternoon for Liverpool as a narrow 1-0 victory over Swansea City was marred by the loss of Sadio Mane to injury. ""I'm sure he's going to be disappointed, I'm disappointed to lose a player like that."" Reds boss Jurgen Klopp later confirmed the Senegal worldwide, who has scored six goals in 13 appearances in all competitions for the Reds so far this season, would be out of action until the New Year. ""I'm a little bit concerned because when I was a player, when I saw a player in that situation I would try and avoid the touch completely."" Swansea are yet to win at Anfield in seven attempts. The Reds' boss will be hoping to have Adam Lallana and Nathaniel Clyne available for selection in the New Year. It was a fairly even contest until Mane limped off, with Swansea having several good chances before the break. ""I know how my players are and I know their character."" ""We have got to show the character that we showed in the second half after we went 1-0 down."" The full-back was sent off in the fifth minute of stoppage time for a foul on Daniel Sturridge and will be suspended for the visit of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

"Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) aims to reduce radiation leaks in three months and to cool the reactors within nine months. The firm said it also planned to cover the damaged reactor buildings at the Fukushima Daiichi plant with special sheets to prevent the spread of radioactive substances. In a news conference, Tepco's president, Masataka Shimizu, admitted that the company had been caught unprepared by the magnitude of the disaster. On Monday, the company announced that it would step up safety checks at its other nuclear plants after two more incidents at the Fukushima plant. The latest attempt to restore power to the stricken reactors could be put at risk by a faulty cable. Earlier, smoke was seen coming from the No 3 reactor, and the No 2 reactor was reported to have briefly reached 500 degrees. Meanwhile, officials say two workers have been exposed to high levels of radiation and burns while trying to stabilise the reactors. The two men, who were among the 50 staff who stayed at the plant, were burned on the face and legs when water seeped through their protective clothing. The water is thought to have contained radiation levels 10,000 times the normal level. At a news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said radiation levels at the plant were being reduced. ""We have been making utmost efforts to lower the level of radiation in the surrounding area of the nuclear plant, and to maintain a safe radiation level,"" he said. An official from Japan's nuclear safety agency told reporters that the authorities were taking seriously the threat that radiation could spread from the plant. The BBC's Mark Gregory in Fukushima says radiation levels around the plant have fallen. But a 15km (9 mile) exclusion zone remains in force and the Japanese government has told people living within 30km (19 miles) of the plant to stay indoors. Residents were told to cover their mouths with masks or cloth and towels when they went outside. Officials have been unable to say when they can restore the cooling systems at the plant. The quake and the tsunami are now known to have killed more than 7,300 people, with nearly 11,000 still unaccounted for. Aid is still being delivered to the affected region. The number of people living in shelters has risen to more than 400,000, and there have been reports of food shortages. The Japanese government is now considering the possibility of drafting in troops to assist in the distribution of aid. ""We need to make sure that the transportation network is functioning well,"" said Yukio Edano. ""We are considering, if necessary, seeking the cooperation of the Self-Defence Forces."" The government has said it will increase the number of police officers in the region to assist in distributing supplies, and has been criticised for being too slow to respond. Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko made a rare televised address on Monday to express their sympathy for the victims of the disasters. ""I am deeply hurt by the grievous situation in the affected areas,"" the emperor said. ""With all my heart, I hope for the safety of the people there and for the earliest possible recovery of the affected communities.""",0,933

"The new plan is for training to be split across three different sites. There would be some joint training, but the three services would each have their own facilities. The new plan also means that the MOD would be able to retain the existing Norton Manor camp, which it currently owns, and which is to be vacated by the RAF Regiment. Given that the Defence Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have been critical of the MOD's handling of this project, I think that it is only right that the MOD should come to the House to explain what the new plans are and why they are the right ones. John Woodcock: I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to share that view with his colleague the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. The Business Secretary has expressed the view that the Ministry of Defence has to play its part in the Government's deficit reduction plan. Given that it is the Ministry of Defence that makes the decisions on what is procured and on how it is procured, would it not be more appropriate for the Defence Secretary to say that the Treasury should make a greater effort to ensure that the Ministry of Defence's budget is sufficient to meet the objectives of both Departments? Mr Francois: The Ministry of Defence faces very difficult decisions over the next few years. There is a very heavy cost of running the equipment programme, which we inherited, and the Ministry of Defence needs to make changes to its estate, to its equipment programme and to its manpower to make the sort of savings that are required in the light of the economic position in which we find ourselves. Kevan Jones: The Minister will be aware of the concerns that have been expressed by the Plymouth Herald and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) about the impact of the proposals on the Plymouth area. May we have a debate in Government time on this issue, so that the Minister can outline the benefits that he sees for the Plymouth area? Mr Francois: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Plymouth Herald is a fine newspaper, and I am very pleased that it is supportive of the Government's proposals to base the Royal Marines in Plymouth, but I do not think that he would wish me to comment on what I might or might not have said to any individual hon. Member. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we are already doing a considerable amount of work to try to bring jobs to Plymouth, and in particular to the naval dockyard. I have held discussions with the First Sea Lord and the head of the Royal Navy to see what additional measures might be necessary. I am also in discussions with the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison), to see whether any additional announcements might be necessary. Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Nigel Evans): Order. May I say to the House that we have very little time to go before the wind-ups? It would be a pity if those who wish to speak did not have the opportunity to do so because the questions were long. I would like to get in as many people as possible. Oliver Colvile (Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree that Plymouth has a long and illustrious history in the Royal Marines? Will he also confirm that we have one of the most modern training facilities for the Royal Marines? Mr Francois: My hon. Friend is entirely right about the contribution that Plymouth has made to the Royal Marines over the centuries, and I am well aware of the first-class training facilities at Plymouth. Sir Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD): As a former member of the Public Accounts Committee, I endorse the Minister's comment that it was right for the project to be scrutinised by the Committee and criticised in the report. When the Minister talked about the proposed site in Northumberland, did he have in mind the former DIRFT site at Hepscott near Morpeth? If he did, would he like to tell us what conversations he has had with the owners of that site and the local community about the prospects for that site and how it might provide an answer to the problem?

"Culture Secretary Maria Miller said ""decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table"" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to a ""free-for-all"" and the current system was ""fair."" It comes after the BBC Trust ruled that 989,000 people in the UK should face a 1,000 fine for failing to pay the licence fee. The corporation told the BBC it hoped to recoup 204m in fees and court costs from those evading payment. The BBC said that under current rules, evaders could be prosecuted for non-payment but ""as a matter of policy"" the corporation only does so as a ""last resort."" It said it was not pursuing a ""zero evasion policy."" The BBC Trust added that the BBC's fee enforcement programme was ""fair and proportionate."" The broadcaster said: ""The fee is collected under a Royal Charter which requires that we seek to obtain payment from those evading the fee, and that we do so by taking legal action. The government has recently confirmed that it has no plans to change the current system."" But Ms Miller said: ""Licence fee payers have a right to expect better from the BBC than this bureaucratic bullying."" She added: ""This is something that I will be looking at as part of the charter review. Decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table."" Her comments came after it was reported the BBC had recruited private debt collectors to pursue people who owe the licence fee. On Thursday, a BBC spokesman said: ""We would not pursue people in this way if it were not necessary to ensure a good deal for the majority of licence fee payers who pay their way and support the BBC. ""If the licence fee system was abolished, the 100m spent annually on enforcement would need to be replaced in some other way."" Sir Roger Gale, a Conservative MP and former minister, also spoke out against the BBC, saying: ""The BBC is the only broadcaster in the country which is in a position to use the powers of the state to persecute people. ""They could change their policy today - they could stop prosecuting people tomorrow. It would save the taxpayer a fortune."" He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""The BBC is not a free-to-air broadcaster. It is a state broadcaster which is paid for by the people who receive it."" The BBC is funded by a TV licence fee of 145.50 per household. Last year the corporation spent 349m of licence fee income on enforcement. Some have suggested that the TV licence could be replaced by a subscription service, but the BBC says that would mean it could not offer universal services. ""Anyone who wants to opt out and not have the BBC would be at a disadvantage because they wouldn't be able to watch the Olympics or the World Cup,"" said BBC director general Lord Hall. ""If you think about a subscription model you would end up having to subscribe to lots of different things. It's a much more expensive way of funding the BBC.""",0,938
"A judge said there was a basis for concluding the officers, known as M and Q, may have perverted the course of justice and committed perjury while giving evidence. Pearse McGeough and Pearse McAuley were acquitted in 2015. An inquiry is under way into the massacre. The attack on the Heights Bar in Loughinisland was carried out by the UVF using weapons imported by loyalist paramilitaries with the help of a British agent. The weapons were also used in the killings of six Catholics at Sean Graham's bookmakers in Belfast's Lower Ormeau Road in 1992. The six men were watching Ireland play Italy in the World Cup on 18 June 1994 when the gunmen burst in and opened fire. The victims were Adrian Rogan, 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Green, 87, Daniel McCreanor, 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. Five others were also wounded. The men's relatives have spent 24 years seeking justice. They have always maintained the police knew the names of the suspects involved but did not arrest them. The suspects' details were recorded in a secret report compiled by the then RUC police chief Sir Hugh Orde in 2006. It concluded that there was evidence police colluded with the killers. It identified a chief suspect but the suspect's identity was never revealed to the families. In 2011 the families made a complaint to the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland (PONI) about alleged police collusion. The following year the PONI announced it was going to conduct a new investigation. In 2014 the ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, revealed that he had been given the names of the suspects by the police but that the suspects would never be arrested or interviewed. Dr Maguire said that the suspects had been questioned about other matters and had denied involvement in the attack. He added that in order to avoid prejudicing any prosecution, the names of the suspects were not being revealed. The families say that when police officers, known as M and Q, were questioned by the ombudsman they gave contradictory accounts of their actions in the days after the massacre. In 2016 the families went to court seeking to judicially review the ombudsman's decision not to question the suspects. The families also applied for a judicial review of the ombudsman's decision not to seek a court order compelling the police to hand over their intelligence reports on the suspects. A High Court judge ruled against the families on both matters but said there was a basis for concluding the officers may have perverted the course of justice and committed perjury. The families are now appealing against the High Court ruling. In February, the families' lawyers asked the Attorney General, John Larkin, to appoint an independent prosecutor to consider a possible perjury charge against the officers. Their lawyers have argued that the PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) - the organisation that investigated the Loughinisland massacre - and the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch are not the proper bodies to investigate the officers because of the ""appearance of bias."" They say that the HET and the Legacy Investigation Branch were set up by the police and have a ""limited remit."" The families' lawyers have argued that the police and the PPS could not be considered independent bodies in this matter. The lawyers have also argued that there is a ""real risk"" that the ""impartiality"" of the HET and the Legacy Investigation Branch investigators could be ""open to question"" because they are employed by the police. The lawyers have told the appeal court that the families believe the officers' ""false evidence"" goes to the ""core"" of the ombudsman's report on the killings. They have argued that the ombudsman's report into the massacre is ""flawed"" because the officer's statements about the killing were accepted as truthful. They have also pointed out that ""no attempt"" was made to obtain statements from the suspects. The families' lawyers say that the ""apparent perjury"" of the officers is a ""fundamental flaw"" in the ombuds",0,939
"The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans ""wrong"" information, including disputed international borders. The move has come amid an ongoing war between Moscow and Ukraine, which is supported by the US. The Russian parliament has passed the first reading of a bill that bans digital maps that have mislabeled international borders. It could also ban maps that do not show Crimea and the city of Sevastopol as part of Russia. The legislation, which is backed by the Russian Ministry of Defense, was adopted by the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, on Thursday. The bill was initiated by a Communist MP, Nikolai Ivanov, and has already been approved by the Russian government. The new legislation allows Russia's special services to file a court order demanding that online maps be removed or amended, if the maps display ""false information."" The bill also threatens to ban online maps that display international borders in a way that differs from the one described by Russian legislation. ""Maps that do not display Crimea and Sevastopol as parts of Russia must be banned in Russia,"" the bill states. The map with the Crimean Peninsula colored in blue and the disputed territories marked in green. A map of the so-called ""Novorossiya,"" an area that has been claimed by some Ukrainian rebels. The new legislation could affect the digital maps of the popular Russian services, Yandex and Mail.ru, as well as maps from the US-based companies, Google, Apple, and Uber. ""This law will make it possible to prevent the use of maps that provide wrong information about the territory of Russia, which can be used for criminal purposes,"" Ivanov said, according to the Interfax news agency. Campaign groups have been angered by the bill, saying it would violate freedom of expression and Russian citizens' right to obtain information. ""It is not the role of the state to dictate the information that people are exposed to,"" Sergei Nikitin, director of Amnesty International's Moscow office, said in a statement, RIA Novosti reported. ""This law is a step in the wrong direction. It is another example of the Russian authorities trying to control the dissemination of information in Russia, to the detriment of freedom of expression,"" Nikitin added. Last year, the Russian government adopted a law that allows the authorities to order any internet search engine to connect to the Russian state-controlled Federal State Information System (FGIS). It also requires all online map services to ""connect to the federal database of addresses"" by July 2017. Russia has been locked in a bitter feud with the West over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The US, Canada, the European Union, and several other countries have imposed sanctions against Moscow in response to the move. Russia has since been accused by the US of trying to ""redraw international borders by force,"" and of violating ""the sovereign and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" In March 2014, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution which declared Russia's actions in Crimea a violation of international law, and called on Moscow to withdraw its troops from the peninsula. The bill comes amid ongoing fighting between the Kiev government and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, which has killed over 9,500 people and displaced more than 23,000, according to UN figures.

""It's just a shame she took the route she did."" Ross Coulthart, a prison reform campaigner, said more needed to be done to help prisoners. ""If a letter like that is received by the prison service, then it should be acted upon immediately,"" he said. ""It should be acted upon because it's obviously a cry for help and we need to remember that within our prison system we have people, we have human beings.""

The PPO is currently investigating and said it would make its report available to Ms Thompson's family and the coroner.

"US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that are a major part of the immune system. ""Our findings suggest that high doses of B3, administered alone or in combination with other antimicrobials, may be a useful therapy to treat staph infections in some patients, particularly those with weakened immune systems,"" said George Liu, co-senior author of the study and chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The researchers tested B3 in laboratory mice, injecting them with S. aureus, the bacteria that causes staph infections. The results showed that B3 significantly increased survival in the mice and their ability to fight the infection. The researchers then tested human blood and found that B3 increased the ability of neutrophils to surround and destroy S. aureus, and also blocked the formation of a toxin that the bacteria use to disarm the immune system. B3 is already used to treat a variety of conditions, including diabetes, high cholesterol and arthritis, and is sold under the brand name niacin. The researchers noted that nicotinamide is very inexpensive and is usually well-tolerated. ""Clinical studies are now needed to translate these exciting findings to the bedside and determine if B3 can be used alone or in combination with existing antibiotics to cure staph infections in humans,"" said Michael A. Fischbach, co-senior author of the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Francisco. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine. Most of us have been affected by the ""stomach flu"" or gastroenteritis at some point in our lives. The most common cause of this condition is a food-borne virus or bacteria. The most common viruses that cause the ""stomach flu"" are rotavirus and norovirus. Gastroenteritis can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration. Most people recover on their own within a few days. However, those who are at risk for dehydration, especially children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, may need to be hospitalized for rehydration and further treatment. Vaccines are available to protect against rotavirus. Washing your hands can help prevent the spread of many of the viruses and bacteria that cause gastroenteritis. What to eat when you have gastroenteritis or stomach flu Let your stomach settle. Stop eating solid foods for a few hours. Sip on clear liquids to replace fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea. Clear liquids include water, broth, sports drinks, and diluted fruit juices. Sip small amounts of liquid every 15 to 20 minutes. Drink an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replace lost minerals and fluids. You can buy these at your local drug store. Avoid dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol until you feel better. Avoid sugary drinks, such as sodas or fruit juices. When should you eat solid foods again? Start eating solid, easy-to-digest foods when you can tolerate them. Good choices include: Saltine or soda crackers Applesauce or bananas Plain rice, noodles, or potatoes Foods containing whole grains and fiber, such as bran, oatmeal, nuts, and popcorn Foods that are greasy, fatty, or very sweet Foods that are high in fiber, such as beans, vegetables, and whole grains Dairy products or foods that contain lactose, such as milk or cheese, if you are lactose intolerant Highly seasoned, spicy, or fried foods Caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, tea, or soda Alcohol or tobacco (Source: Health Library) A new study has discovered that the immune system is greatly affected by an unhealthy diet.

Mr Doherty's brother John, 67, of Olney, Buckinghamshire, has been convicted of her murder and jailed for life. On the day she disappeared Mr Doherty was seen leaving the property with a suitcase and a laundry basket, the court heard. However, it was not until 2015 that he finally admitted that he had dismembered her body and buried it in the garden, the prosecution said. In a police interview, Mr Doherty said his brother had ""had an argument"" with Ms Wilkanowska when she came to visit. He said John had gone into the kitchen, where Ms Wilkanowska was sitting, and ""hit her from behind with a hammer,"" the court was told. 'Someone to blame' He admitted disposing of her body and said he ""couldn't face"" telling his elderly parents, who he cared for. Mr Doherty also told the police he had been ""under his brother's thumb"" and was ""scared"" of him. The court heard John Doherty had been in prison in the UK and in the US, and had a history of violence and aggression. The jury was told Mr Doherty had been in jail for fraud and was on parole at the time of the murder. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay QC said: ""The defendant has been described as a Jekyll and Hyde character. ""The defendant has never accepted any responsibility for Natalia's death. ""The prosecution case is that, having killed his wife, Gerald Doherty needed someone to blame for his actions.

"The injury-hit Hammers lost to Romanian champions Astra Giurgiu in the qualifying round for the second season in succession. The visitors won Thursday's second leg at the London Stadium 1-0 after last week's 1-1 draw in Romania. Hammers goalkeeper Adrian, who had to play out of position at left-back, had a disappointing evening, letting in a goal, getting booked and then substituted. The 29-year-old, who has been at West Ham since 2013, is out of contract at the end of the season and has been linked with a move away from the club. Adrian said on Twitter: ""I want to clarify this is not my last game for WHUFC. I'm proud to be part of the best football fans in England! Let's go!!!"" West Ham are yet to win a game under new manager Slaven Bilic, who was hired in the summer to replace Sam Allardyce.

"The group had been sailing around the County Down lough on Wednesday when three crew members went ashore on Green Island. The cabin cruiser then developed electrical problems as it attempted to depart, the Irish Coast Guard said. It sank approximately two miles north of the entrance to Strangford Lough and divers are to search for the boat. On Thursday evening, police said two bodies had been found. Insp Ian Magee said: ""Police can confirm that the body of a man, aged in his 50s, was discovered in the water at Strangford Lough just after 5.45pm today. ""A post-mortem examination will be carried out in due course. ""This follows the recovery of the body of a man in his 60s earlier today and enquiries are ongoing into the circumstances of both deaths."" Earlier, a body was found in the water about two miles north of the entrance to Strangford Lough, off Co Down. A coastguard spokesman said: ""The body was recovered from the water and has been brought to a local marina. ""The body has been handed over to the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland).""",0,947
"It seems in Northern Ireland we call it Tuesday. Politics dominates the front pages of the papers again today as the clock which was supposed to stop yesterday at 16:00, has kept ticking. It seems the negotiations have moved to the venue where the DUP and Sinn Fein negotiated the Good Friday Agreement. Yesterday a senior Sinn Fein source told the BBC, ""We are where we are. This is a last chance. That is not a cliche. That is where we are."" The DUP leader, Peter Robinson was more positive yesterday and said: ""The fact that we are still engaged in talks I think gives us all a sense of optimism and I think there is a will to make this work."" And the leader of the Ulster Unionists, Sir Reg Empey said: ""I think it is possible, but we have to recognise that the DUP and Sinn Fein have a lot of issues to sort out between themselves, and a lot of those issues are of their own making."" The Ulster Unionist Party was the second largest party at Stormont for almost 40 years until it lost the position to the DUP in the last election. But UTV is reporting the Ulster Unionist Party is now in the process of selecting a new leader, the third since Sir Reg Empey took over from David Trimble. The leading candidate is the former deputy leader Tom Elliott. Last week the party's only representative in the European parliament, Jim Nicholson, announced he would stand down from his position. I just wish they would get on with it. The Irish Times is reporting today that the price of a litre of petrol is set to fall 4p as oil prices slide. The price of petrol in Ireland is now the highest in the EU and according to the paper is set to go higher, at least for a while. When the price of petrol in Ireland was last at a record level, the government brought in a price watchdog to monitor the prices and prevent the oil companies from using the volatility of oil prices to increase their profit margins. The same thing should be done here. The companies are making enough money out of us already. Less than a week after the collapse of the top of a crane which killed two men, the Irish Independent is reporting that a crane which collapsed in Cork last year was not properly inspected. The Health and Safety Authority says that a breach of the safety law may have occurred when the crane was being used on the site. In Dublin the company which owned the crane has said that the crane was in excellent condition and that it had been inspected recently. And I'm sure that's why it collapsed. The Irish Examiner has a story today about 8,000 households in County Cork. They say that more than 8,000 homes have been left without access to a waste disposal collection service since the withdrawal of the service by the county council in 2003. The problem is now so bad that some people are burying their rubbish in their gardens or in plastic bags in the countryside. The council blames the waste collectors for not coming up with a suitable service but the waste collectors say that the council are to blame for the problems. It seems to me that if the council is going to withdraw a service then they should have something better to replace it. But then again, what do I know? There's only one thing more dangerous than politicians and that is children. And the children are out in force today. The Irish Independent is reporting that about 12,000 students are taking part in a second day of protests across the country. They are taking part in the protests because the government are not increasing the grants for third level education. Yesterday thousands of students protested against the government's decision not to increase the grant and many of them stormed the gates of Leinster House. A small number of protesters, most of them teenagers, broke down the gates and chanted ""Down with Cowen"" and ""Cowen out"" as they were surrounded by security guards and gardai. The protests took place outside the Dail yesterday but there is a fear that the protests could turn ugly today as there are fears that some of the teenagers will try to storm Leinster House again. It seems that the government is preparing for another assault on the gates of Leinster House by the students. Extra gardai have been drafted into the area to protect the",0,948
"The sentencing of David Gilroy, who killed Edinburgh woman Suzanne Pilley, is due to take place next Wednesday. Earlier this week permission was also granted to film the proceedings. Twitter has been aflutter with indignation at this turn of events, but is it such a bad thing? Trials are currently the subject of a pilot scheme, which allows for judges to permit the use of filming within the courtroom. It is a decision that is taken at the end of a trial and only where it is in the interest of open justice. It is not an automatic right. This is not the first time that a trial has been filmed, but it is certainly the first time that a sentencing has been permitted. Although filming will be restricted to the judge's sentencing remarks and will not include the other parties, it will still be of interest to the press and public alike. The pilot scheme was introduced with the aim of ensuring greater openness and transparency of the judicial process, something that has been called for over recent years. It is hoped that filming will lead to greater understanding of the justice system and how it operates. Allowing for filming has been much debated since the plans were first put forward. Concerns have been expressed that it will be a distraction for judges, who will be filmed, and will be a barrier to witnesses giving evidence. There is also a question of whether it will interfere with the fairness of proceedings. In this case it is unlikely that filming will be a distraction to the judge. He will have been aware that it may happen from the time he began presiding over the trial and will have taken that into account in his conduct of the proceedings. It is certainly not a factor that will sway him in his sentencing. There is also a question of whether filming will deter witnesses from giving evidence in future. I do not believe that it will. It is not uncommon for witnesses to be filmed in the course of proceedings. It is very likely that CCTV footage will be used as evidence and played back to the jury. It is also possible that a witness may have given a pre-recorded statement in evidence, which will have been filmed. Witnesses are already given the opportunity to speak to the court in private or behind a screen if they are worried about giving evidence in public. As for the fairness of proceedings, I do not see how filming the sentencing can interfere with that. The jury are not present and the focus is on the judge's remarks and not on the reactions of the victim's family or the convicted person. In the end it is a good thing that the public will be able to watch the sentencing of David Gilroy. It will provide a better understanding of the judicial process. The jury have decided that he killed Suzanne Pilley and it is now the job of the judge to decide what sentence he should receive. Filming will allow the public to see the decision-making process that goes into sentencing and will show them that it is not an arbitrary decision. It is likely to be a very lengthy and complex process. It is also worth bearing in mind that the judge will already have seen the defendant in the dock, he will have heard the jury convict him of murder and he will have witnessed his reaction to the verdict. None of that will be shown on film, but it will be a factor that the judge has to take into account when deciding what sentence to impose. What is also important is that the focus will be on the victim and her family. It will be a chance for them to see justice done and to see the man responsible for her death brought to justice. It will be a chance for them to see how the judge views the crime and the impact it has had on the family and those who knew her. David Gilroy is not the first person to have been convicted of murder in Scotland, but he will be the first person whose sentencing is filmed. It is not something that will happen every time and it is not something that will be a deterrent to witnesses giving evidence. It is an opportunity for the public to see how the judicial system works and how decisions are made. It is in the interests of open justice and transparency and is a good thing.

"The beach where Seifeddine Rezgui stood on Friday, pulled a Kalashnikov from his parasol and unleashed Tunisia's worst ever terror attack, has already reopened. Camera crews capture the spot; passers-by snatch up the shells left behind by the holidaymakers who fled. But the tragedy, which claimed 38 lives, seems barely to have dented the country's tourism. If anything, the recent attacks - of which this is the third in the last 18 months - have been seized upon as a marketing opportunity. ""In Tunisia there's no more dangerous than in any other European country,"" declared Prime Minister Habib Essid, unveiling an advertising campaign to revive the industry. The move has not been without controversy. ""We don't think it's the moment to talk about tourism,"" said a spokesman for the opposition Popular Front. But Essid is right: Tunisia is safer than many European countries. A tenth of the size of the UK, it has a fraction of the crime. Ahead of the attack, 2015 was on course to be Tunisia's most successful year for tourism since the Arab Spring, which brought down the government and ushered in a new constitution. But there is no doubt that, after 38 deaths - most of them British - Tunisia's tourist trade will be hit. The effects were already being felt, with a number of tour operators cancelling holidays for the next few weeks and the Foreign Office advising against all but essential travel to the country. British Airways cancelled all flights to Tunisia until further notice, and easyJet suspended flights until July 10. The UK's biggest tour operator, TUI Group, has cancelled its Tunisian beach holidays for the time being. The company, which owns Thomson and First Choice, said the decision was made with ""extreme regret"" and that it was contacting those who had booked. But there is a long way to go before the country's tourist industry is back to normal. ""It's a tragedy,"" said Lydia Ben Youssef, co-founder of tour operator Tunisia Live. ""It's not just for the tourists but the people here. This is their business - their life. This is all they have. A lot of people are worried and scared."" Most of the country's tourists come from Europe, with the UK the third biggest contributor behind France and Germany. Last year, Tunisia welcomed 6.3 million tourists, 425,000 of them from the UK. The vast majority of these stay on the coast, rather than heading inland to see the Roman ruins, Berber villages and Saharan desert. Tunisia has been targeted by militant groups before. In March 2015, 21 tourists were killed when gunmen stormed the Bardo Museum in Tunis. In June of the same year, 38 people were killed in an attack on the coastal resort of Sousse, a few miles south of where Friday's attack took place. The Tunisian government blamed both attacks on Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), which has been fighting the Tunisian army for control of the Chaambi mountains, near the Algerian border, since 2012. But while Isil has claimed the Sousse attacks, it has yet to confirm it was behind the museum attack. Instead, the Bardo killings were claimed by the little-known Okba Ibn Nafaa brigade, believed to have splintered from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The attack at the Bardo museum in Tunis, last year. Despite the rising tide of violence, Tunisia's tourist numbers were rising last year - up 5 per cent on 2014. But the Sousse attack, in which a gunman targeted a beach full of foreigners, hit the industry hard. ""Tourism is a very important industry for Tunisia,"" said Ben Youssef. ""We've been trying to push tourists to come back and not be afraid. But this attack was on a beach - a beach! People are worried to come now."" Most Tunisian hotels are all-inclusive - and luxurious. In Sousse, hotels are dotted along a coastal strip, with",0,950

"Andreu was denied from the spot by a brilliant save from Raith keeper Kevin Cuthbert 15 minutes from time. United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was dismissed for a second bookable offence. The win, United's fourth in a row in all competitions, lifted the Tangerines into fourth spot in the Championship table. It was a fairly even first half with the Tangerines having the better of the early stages but the hosts enjoying the better of the exchanges after the break. Already missing the suspended Paul Watson and the injured pair of Mark Durnan and Simon Murray, United were further weakened when defender William Edjenguele was ruled out through injury. Youngster Sam Wardrop was a surprise inclusion in the starting line up. Rovers threatened with a couple of early corners and in the 15th minute John Sullivan had to rush off his line to clear the ball to safety. Moments later United broke the deadlock. Wardrop got into the Raith box and his cross was turned into the net by fellow defender Callum Morris. The hosts stepped up the pace but United almost increased their lead on the half hour mark when, following a free kick, Wardrop headed against the post. The Tangerines had to wait until the 56th minute to create another decent scoring opportunity when Wardrop's cross was turned over by Fraser Fyvie. Raith Rovers went close in the 62nd minute when Grant Anderson's shot went narrowly past the post. United were reduced to ten men in the 75th minute when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was red-carded for a second bookable offence. Five minutes later, United were almost gifted a second goal when Sullivan's long clearance hit a post and came back off the back of Rovers keeper Kevin Cuthbert and bounced narrowly wide. At the other end, Andreu was brought down by Sullivan and the United keeper did well to deny the Spaniard from the penalty spot. The hosts almost snatched a late equaliser when, in the dying seconds, Scott Robertson's header was cleared off the line by United defender Mark Durnan.

"The 86-year-old first became prime minister in 1982, beginning a third spell as leader in 2014. In a televised address Mr Jugnauth said he was resigning in favour of a ""new generation"" of politicians. He said he would remain as leader of the ruling Militant Socialist Movement. Mr Jugnauth's father, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, also served as prime minister several times. The island nation is a popular tourist destination but is also a major centre for financial services. It has one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. ""I am resigning from the office of prime minister of the Republic of Mauritius after serving two and a half years,"" Mr Jugnauth said in a brief address on state television. ""I will hand over the prime ministership to my son, the Hon Pravind Jugnauth, who will be the next prime minister. The leader of the majority party will be invited by the president to form the new government."" Mr Jugnauth, who is also a qualified medical doctor, had earlier served as prime minister between 1982 and 1995 and then again from 2000 to 2003. The deputy prime minister will be appointed the new prime minister on Monday, with a new cabinet being sworn in at the same time. Mr Jugnauth's resignation comes after a constitutional amendment in July removed the age limit of 65 years for prime ministers. The constitution was first amended in 2016, when a clause which said that the president could not be elected to a second term was removed. Both amendments were widely seen as paving the way for Mr Jugnauth's son to become prime minister, as the president is also elected by the National Assembly. The father and son have worked closely together, and have been described as having a close relationship. In his speech, Mr Jugnauth did not give a reason for his decision. But in the past he has said he wanted to step aside for a younger person. ""There is a generation which wants to come to the fore and I am going to help them,"" he told Mauritius' Weekly magazine in April 2016. The resignation came shortly after the Mauritian government announced a budget which contained new taxes on both tourism and financial services.

"Five justices in the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge for an inquiry into the shootings at Batang Kali in 1948 by a four to one majority. The families, who say that 24 unarmed civilians were massacred by the Scots Guards, have lost their 63-year battle for justice. The judges said that the ""sorry saga"" had ended and that the UK government was not required to hold an inquiry into the killings. It was a ""one-off"" incident that occurred in an ""exceptionally troubled"" region of Malaysia. The soldiers have always denied claims that the villagers were unarmed. The case was brought by four elderly Malaysian women and a man, all the children or widows of the victims. Their lawyers said that the deaths were unlawful and that they wanted an inquiry to examine the claims of a cover-up by the British government. The families, who were in court, were ""bitterly disappointed"" at the decision. Judgment was handed down by Lord Kerr, who was joined by Lord Hope, Lord Rodger and Lord Walker. Lord Mance, the sole dissenting judge, said that there was a ""prima facie"" case that the killings were unlawful and that it was necessary to investigate what happened. The families' lawyer, John Halford, of Bindman Partridge, said: ""We are bitterly disappointed. We are going to fight on to achieve justice in Malaysia. The killings took place after the 7th Platoon of the Scots Guards had been ambushed and killed. The next day the patrol entered the village of Batang Kali, where the inhabitants were squatters who worked in a rubber plantation, and shot the 24 men. The soldiers claimed that the men were insurgents and that they shot them after being attacked. The families claimed that the men were unarmed and that they had been killed to make an example to the other villagers. The Scots Guards patrol was led by Lt Hugh Carlton-Smith, who was later awarded the Military Cross for his conduct. He was killed by a landmine in 1950. A police investigation in 1949 cleared the Scots Guards of any wrongdoing. A second inquiry, known as the Ford Inquiry, which was conducted in the 1960s, concluded that the killings were unjustified. Lord Kerr said that the Ford Inquiry could not be relied on because it had never been published. The families' case was also hampered by the fact that the Malaysian authorities had never provided a statement of their position on the matter. The families' lawyers said that a statement from Malaysia would have strengthened their case, but Lord Kerr said that it would not have made a ""jot of difference."" The families' lawyers said that the relatives were ""bitterly disappointed"" at the decision. Mr Halford added: ""The injustice which has been inflicted on these victims by the British government is now going to continue.",0,959

"The self-styled Islamic State group said two days ago that Abu-Zakariya al-Britani detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul. He is believed to have been killed in the explosion. Born Siddhartha Dhar, he was raised in a Hindu family in London but later converted to Islam and left Britain in 2014. He is reported to have been a friend of another suspected extremist, Michael Adebolajo, who is serving a life sentence for murdering the British soldier Lee Rigby in 2013. The 32-year-old is thought to have been a prominent pro-Islamic State social media user who went by the name Abu Rumaysah and was arrested on suspicion of supporting terrorism after he returned from a trip to Africa in 2014. Abu-Zakariya al-Britani appears in a video released by Isis A video of him at a demonstration in London in 2014 shows him calling for the establishment of an Islamic state in Britain. The following year he was charged with preparing terrorist acts but skipped bail and is believed to have made his way to Syria, where he appeared in several propaganda videos for Isis. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We do not comment on individual cases. The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. ""As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas.""

Meanwhile, the Iraqi Kurdish news agency Rudaw reported on Monday that the Iraqi army was on the verge of retaking the city's airport and were in control of the area around it.

I have not decided yet, but maybe I will go to another country,"" he told Reuters. ""If I can't do my best, maybe I will help in a different way. This was my question as an athlete, and this was a very good result for me."" Ethiopia has one of the most repressive governments in the world. It's a multi-ethnic state, and the dominant power is the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which is led by the country's president and is comprised of the Tigray ethnic group. The Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups make up a majority of the country's population and have been protesting for months to demand equal access to political power and economic resources. Ethiopian officials have described the protests as terrorism, and have responded with deadly force. Between November and December last year, more than 100 people were killed. Human rights groups have said that the real numbers are likely much higher. As recently as August 6, Ethiopian security forces killed 97 people in the course of a weekend during protests in the Oromia region. And Feyisa's gesture came just days after the Ethiopian government charged prominent opposition leader Bekele Gerba with inciting a terrorist act. He was arrested in December after allegedly meeting with US diplomats. Feyisa's protest wasn't the only one by Ethiopians at the Olympics. Marathon runner Kenenisa Bekele, who took third place, was also seen making a similar gesture at the end of the race. And Tamiru Demisse, an Ethiopian steeplechase runner, also raised his hands above his head after finishing the race. He said it was to protest Ethiopia's political system. ""I was protesting the unfair and unjust system in my country,"" Demisse told the AP. ""This is the right time to protest as the world is watching. I have a feeling of victory and that I did what I was called to do.""",0,962
"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was accompanied by a demand for access for humanitarian aid. The situation in Madaya, a town near the border with Lebanon besieged by the government, received attention in the media. However, areas besieged by rebel groups have also been affected by the lack of access to food, medicine and other necessities. Agreement on humanitarian access was hailed as a success, but in reality has been slow to materialise. The Syrian government has refused access to most areas under its control, and in some cases has even refused to allow the UN and the ICRC to distribute aid inside the country. The withdrawal of some rebel groups and their weapons from the city of Aleppo was also supposed to be part of the deal. While some groups have made good their escape, others, notably Jabhat al-Nusra, have remained. Many rebels and civilians also chose to stay. The most contentious issue, however, was what would happen to areas where Islamic State and the Nusra Front were present. While the ceasefire included both groups, Russia and the US were unable to agree on how to deal with them. The original Russian and American proposal was that fighting would continue against IS and the Nusra Front, with the US providing intelligence and Russia conducting the bombing. This plan was rejected by other members of the International Syria Support Group, which also includes Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who said that it would undermine the ceasefire. The group finally agreed to set up a Joint Implementation Group, based in Geneva and made up of members of the International Syria Support Group's ceasefire taskforce, to decide whether or not strikes against IS or the Nusra Front were appropriate in any given situation. The creation of the Joint Implementation Group was a victory for the US and its allies, who had feared that Russia would use the opportunity to bomb the moderate opposition while pretending to be attacking IS or the Nusra Front. The creation of the Joint Implementation Group would make that more difficult. However, the Joint Implementation Group has never met, and there is no sign that it will do so any time soon. The US appears to have backed down on its demand for it to approve strikes, and now seems willing to let Russia conduct bombing raids without this oversight. The Americans have been trying to encourage the Russians to accept the Geneva process, which would mean a transition away from Assad. In return, it seems, they have agreed to Russia's demand that the US separate the ""moderate"" rebels from the ""terrorists"" - i.e. from Jabhat al-Nusra, which is closely allied with many of the Free Syrian Army groups. This would mean the moderates becoming dependent on the US, rather than their current patrons, which include Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The Syrian rebels are understandably suspicious of American intentions. Many of the armed groups, which are all Islamist in one way or another, do not trust the US, and believe that it has betrayed the Syrian revolution in the past. The Geneva negotiations, which started on 1 February, are part of a long-running attempt to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The first Geneva conference, in June 2012, produced a document known as the Geneva Communique. This document was agreed by all the major powers, including Russia and the US, and set out a plan for a political transition in Syria. It called for the establishment of a transitional governing body with ""full executive powers"" which could include members of the Assad regime and the opposition. The Geneva negotiations, which started on 1 February, are part of a long-running attempt to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The document was vague about the future of Assad. It said that the transitional body ""could include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent,"" but it also said that the ""establishment of a transitional government"" was ""an indispensable step in the beginning of a political process leading to free and fair elections."" Many have interpreted this to mean that Assad would have to leave power, but the Syrian government and Russia have always denied this, insisting that Assad could stand in the elections mentioned at the end of the process.

"In the corner of a busy hospital ward, tucked behind a curtain for our arrival, lies Joshua Davies. His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down and you'll see his lower body is missing. Joshua was involved in a horrific accident five months ago when he was run over by a combine harvester while feeding cattle on his family's farm in Pembrokeshire, west Wales. His injuries were so severe doctors had to amputate both legs at the hip, his right arm above the elbow and the fingers on his left hand. But he doesn't dwell on what he's lost. ""I've accepted what's happened to me,"" he says, ""it's more important to look to the future and to do what I can to get better."" Joshua's recovery has been a remarkable story of courage. At the scene of the accident, his father Stephen used his belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. Joshua was airlifted to hospital in Swansea, but soon had to be transferred to a specialist unit in Bristol where he spent 12 weeks in intensive care. His internal injuries were severe. Joshua's trachea had to be rebuilt, his right lung was punctured, his stomach had to be repaired and his right arm was so badly damaged the surgeons had to take a bone from his leg to repair it. ""When I woke up I thought I was dead,"" he says. But while he was still in a coma, the doctors gave him a lot of medication, which is what he believes saved his life. ""The drugs made me so high, I didn't realise what had happened to me. The painkillers made me feel better than I've ever felt before."" The severity of his injuries was such that his family were warned to prepare for the worst. ""I felt like I'd lost my son,"" says his mother Helen. ""I was sitting next to him in hospital and I knew he was going to die. ""His injuries were so severe, they'd never seen anything like it before. They told me I'd need to consider his funeral arrangements."" In the first few weeks, Joshua was still in a coma, fighting for his life. ""They gave him a 10 chance of survival,"" says Helen. ""But he's a fighter. He's strong-willed and he was determined to live. ""The doctors said they'd never seen such a severe injury, but he came through it."" When he finally woke up, he was in a lot of pain, but the worst part, he says, was the initial shock when he realised what had happened to him. ""When I woke up, I saw the pain in my mum and dad's eyes. I realised how serious it was. ""I knew I'd been in an accident, but I didn't know the extent of it. The doctors took my dad aside to explain what had happened, but he didn't want to tell me. ""I knew I'd lost my legs, but it took a while to sink in. It was a huge shock."" Joshua's recovery has been a long and difficult process, but his determination has been a constant throughout. ""I had to learn to walk again,"" he says. ""It was really hard, I had to be patient and to keep going. ""They had to take my leg bone to replace my arm, so I can't have a prosthetic arm. But my mum said I could have a bionic one instead, so I'm looking forward to getting a new one. ""I'm hoping to get a sports one, so I can get back to playing golf, which I love."" His progress has been remarkable and he's already been fitted with two prosthetic legs. He's spent much of his time in hospital walking up and down the corridors and using the physiotherapy room. He's also been working on his hand and arm exercises, strengthening his left hand, learning to write again and getting used to the use of a prosthetic hook on his right arm. ""It's like being a toddler again,"" he says. ""I'm relearning how to do everything. I don't have a big left hand, so I have to relearn how to hold things. ""I'm learning how to write again,",0,964

The bishop's sermon was quite good, too. Thank you for providing links to the royal wedding. It was a beautiful wedding, wasn't it? I enjoyed it too and, like you, found the bishop's sermon inspiring. I particularly loved the Duke of Cambridge's speech (he's always so funny) and the hymns were fantastic too. I'm glad you enjoyed the links. I'm pleased that they've been shared so much. Yes, a beautiful wedding. I loved the singing by the choir, and I thought the bishop's sermon was well done. I especially liked the singing of ""Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer,"" and the reading from Romans 12. Thank you for sharing the links to the royal wedding.

"The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts. The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they said. Lenovo said it would disable Superfish from new computers and offered a tool to remove it from existing ones. The Superfish software was pre-installed on some Lenovo laptop and desktop PCs and tablets that have Windows 7 or 8.1 as their main operating system. Superfish injected shopping adverts into Google search results and other websites in a bid to make money. The software also used a self-signed security certificate that could be used to intercept and decipher encrypted traffic. It was this that most concerned security experts. It meant that all internet traffic could be decrypted and read by Superfish or any other piece of software that used the same self-signed certificate. The Superfish software was configured to decrypt traffic using a self-signed security certificate ""The Superfish software acts as a 'man in the middle' between the user and the web site,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, via email. ""It intercepts the connection, decrypts it using the key it has installed, then inserts its own ads into the page before re-encrypting and sending to the user. ""The problem is that there is no way for the user to know this is happening and there is no way of knowing what else it might be doing."" The Superfish software could be exploited to attack people visiting secure websites, he said. ""It can intercept and read your communications with those sites,"" said Prof Woodward. ""The big danger is that it can be hijacked to silently intercept all traffic."" Superfish poses a threat to privacy Adware-type programs that inject ads into web pages are not new. But the use of the self-signed security certificate was uncommon, said Prof Woodward. He said it was very similar to a technique he spotted being used by malware in 2010. ""A number of commentators have pointed out that if a criminal gang were to get hold of the key, then they could pretend to be the laptop and steal all the traffic that was intended for the user,"" he said. The use of a self-signed certificate was not unique to Superfish but was uncommon, said Prof Woodward The self-signed certificate was not a security vulnerability per se, said Prof Woodward, but it could be exploited to spy on people and steal their data. To make matters worse, the self-signed certificate was easy to extract from the Lenovo laptops and could be used by others to pretend to be a Lenovo PC. ""A criminal gang could now set up a fake Wi-Fi access point in a cafe or on a train that offers free internet access, the user would connect to it and get routed through the proxy which would be able to steal all their traffic,"" said Prof Woodward. The Superfish software is not part of the operating system and can be removed. It is possible to remove the Superfish software and the self-signed security certificate it uses. Lenovo has published a tool to do this. However, even when Superfish has been removed, it may still be possible to spoof the self-signed certificate on a Lenovo PC, said Prof Woodward. This is because the certificate is not automatically revoked or replaced with a new one when Superfish is removed. Lenovo said it was in talks with Microsoft to ensure that the certificate would be revoked. ""We are completely transparent about what Superfish is and what it does,"" said Lenovo in a statement. ""We have no intention of introducing any software that would compromise user security,"" it added. The company said it would no longer ship computers with Superfish installed and would provide a tool to permanently remove it. The software was introduced as a way to help people discover products that matched their interests, said Lenovo. ""The relationship with Superfish is not financially motivated in any way,"" it added. Lenovo has been contacted to comment on the fact that Superfish remains on the computers it sells. Superfish was designed to be difficult to remove and to persist even if a hard drive was wiped and a clean version of Windows installed. It appears to have been able to resist attempts to remove it manually using Windows' in-built tools. People using the affected Lenovo laptops should use the company's tool to remove Superfish. To be sure the Superfish certificate has been removed, they should also disable and then re-enable the wi-fi adaptor on their laptop. This forces the operating system to check that the certificate is",0,970

"As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man sitting there was, presumably, the person we were here to meet. Was he the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto? It was hard to tell: he hardly spoke a word, offering one-word answers, or just a nod or a shake of the head, to our questions. We hired a computer expert to dig deeper into the history of Nakamoto's online persona. While the name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" appeared on the 2008 Bitcoin paper, the email address had been used a few months before, to post technical information on a forum for fans of liberty and the free market. ""The whole reason geeks get excited about Bitcoin is that it is the most efficient way to do financial transactions, period,"" he wrote. He must have been shocked to hear that someone using the name of the Bitcoin founder was communicating with the outside world. ""When the person or persons who invented or created Bitcoin, however, are never seen or heard from again, that would be the more typical scenario."" He added: ""I'm not involved with Bitcoin. Wait, is it a fake name?"" The account's activity dwindled as interest in Bitcoin grew. In 2009, back when Bitcoin was worth less than a penny, the user was accepting payments for ""pizzas paid for in Bitcoin"" on several occasions. Then the trail went cold. Nakamoto made no blog posts after 2011, and the account sat unused for years. But on 29 April this year, a single message was posted on the account's public to-do list. A single comment appeared on a blog post about the Bitcoin inventor the same day. ""Thank you for your writings. They are a wealth of information,"" wrote ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" without disclosing which writing was being thanked for. ""That's not me,"" Dorian Nakamoto said, after I'd asked about the comment. He said he was not even aware of Bitcoin until his son told him he'd been contacted by a reporter two weeks before. ""I have no knowledge of that,"" he said of his alleged online comment. ""I didn't make that."" He insisted that he had only once used the Nakamoto name, when he worked for the base at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Ohio. Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto is 64. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and after that his biography gets hazy very quickly. In the wake of 911, he was laid off from his job as a systems engineer at Hughes Aircraft in southern California. A prolific writer, he posted hundreds of articles to free-market websites. He outlined a money-making scheme that required investors to buy casino chips to be held as collateral. A libertarian, he named his daughter Galaria, after Ayn Rand's novel Galts Gulch. It's not hard to imagine how someone like Nakamoto could ordain himself the inventor of Bitcoin. Computer engineers of his generation tend to be rugged individualists, and more than one has claimed to be Bitcoin's inventor. Hal Finney, an engineer and cryptographic genius, received the very first Bitcoin transaction. He was a close friend and correspondent of the Bitcoin founder, but said he never knew the inventor's name or where he lived. (Finney received the first Bitcoin transaction when he tested the software for his friend, and received 10 Bitcoins from the founder.) Gavin Andresen, who now helps maintain the software, also says he interacted with the founder during the early days, but never learned his identity: ""He was the perfect frontman, in that sense, because he was so anonymous. He could be anyone, anywhere."" The Bitcoin founder, whoever he is, may have created the perfect way to pay for things anonymously online, but it seems he didn't know how to do it himself. According to the Bitcoin detectives, he first used the Mt Gox exchange to buy a dollar's worth of Bitcoin on 12 February 2011. Mt Gox's records show he cashed out that same amount in March of that year,",0,972
"This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist: Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family. I would like to firstly thank our legal team, Adrian Hopkins, Ian Lewis, Neil Beckett, our barrister, Mr Pete Weatherby QC and our lovely Sue McGuinness for all the hours they have spent on our behalf and for their unswerving support and guidance throughout this process. We would also like to thank all of the Jury for giving up a year of their lives to listen to the evidence on behalf of the families. The actions of the disgraced David Duckenfield, the now retired Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Peter Wright and the senior officers under his command, together with the then Secretary of State, the late Douglas Hurd, resulted in the deaths of our son and brother, Gary, and 95 other innocent men, women and children on the 15th April 1989. No one, and I mean no one, will ever convince me that David Duckenfield didn't know where the gate was. He was the police match commander for God's sake. On the 19th June 2017, David Duckenfield was charged with the manslaughter of 95 men, women and children. The manslaughter charges were stayed by the judge when the prosecution sought a retrial of the case against him. To our great frustration and that of the many other families, the CPS decided to prosecute David Duckenfield on the charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. Many of us felt that he should have been charged with the offence of corporate manslaughter. We hoped that the inquests would reveal more evidence that would show he was guilty of this charge. I sincerely hope that after hearing all the evidence, this jury will decide that David Duckenfield is guilty of unlawfully killing Gary and 95 other men, women and children by his gross negligence. The senior police officers on the day were Peter Metcalf, Bernard Murray and Norman Bettison. Peter Metcalf and Norman Bettison are now deceased. I'm not sure about Bernard Murray. After the 3.15pm cut off point imposed by David Duckenfield, the senior officers were aware that the pens were full. They were aware that the fans were still pouring into the stadium and they were aware that they needed to delay kick off. Peter Metcalf and Bernard Murray should have taken charge of the situation and instructed Duckenfield to delay kick off. But no. Their attitude was, 'if we delay kick off, it will lead to a riot.' What? What riot? The inquests have heard that the vast majority of the crowd were fans of Liverpool FC, from Liverpool, who had come to watch the game in a peaceful manner. The 11 Liverpool fans who were arrested that day were all arrested after the game had kicked off, so how could they have caused a riot, which the senior officers were so concerned about? The inquests have revealed that Peter Metcalf lied about the events of that day. He said he didn't hear the order to open the gates at 2.52pm, but the jury have now heard that he was told of the decision to open the gates at 2.48pm, which he then supported. There was no reason to lie, other than the fact that he was trying to cover his backside, as were the other senior officers. He was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and jailed for two years. Peter Wright, the Chief Constable, was not at the game, but he allowed the senior officers to lie about the events of that day and he lied himself. He then advised the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to appoint Lord Justice Taylor to head the official inquiry into Hillsborough. He instructed the South Yorkshire Police solicitor, Peter Metcalf, to provide Taylor with only selected documents, which were all favourable to the police. The two officers who tried to blame the fans for the disaster, Norman Bettison and Sir Irvine Patnick, have since been exposed as liars and have since been discredited. It was only after the jury returned its verdicts in the fresh inquests, did the IPCC announce that it would consider prosecuting individuals for perverting the course of",0,973

"The Reverend Gavin Ashenden, a senior clergyman in the Church of England, left his position as chaplain in order to be free to criticise the move. A passage from the Koran which denies that Jesus was the Son of God was read at a Eucharist service in a Scottish cathedral. A passage from the Koran which denies that Jesus was the Son of God was read at a Eucharist service in a Scottish cathedral. The passage from Surah 19, which specifically denies that Jesus was the Son of God and should not be worshipped, was read out in St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Glasgow to mark the feast of the Epiphany. The Provost of the Cathedral, the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, said that the passage had been read to promote greater understanding between Muslims and Christians. ""The passage we hear from the Koran presents Jesus as a prophet teaching his followers to care for the vulnerable and those in need,"" he said.

""The authorities of the Scottish Episcopal Church should immediately repudiate this,"" he said. ""I think it's very serious that they should have read the Koran in the Eucharist, because they are denying the Lordship of Christ, which is a fundamental of the Christian faith."" He added that he had no problem with the passage being read in a public service. ""They could have had an open reading in the cathedral of the Koran, in which they could have talked about the issues, but to read it in the Eucharist is to confuse what the sacrament is all about,"" he said. A spokesman for the Scottish Episcopal Church said: ""The congregation at St Mary's Cathedral are deeply inclusive in their outlook and the reading of this passage from the Koran, which affirms God's revelation through his Son Jesus Christ, in a service celebrating the revelation of God as Christ, affirmed that inclusiveness.""

"The party secured about 19 of the vote, unofficial tallies show. But it is not clear if it will meet the 25 voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo to join the race to be the next president. The government is expected to announce the official results next week. Former general Prabowo Subianto's Gerindra party looks set to become the biggest party in parliament, with about 12 percent of the votes. His party has pledged support to the presidential bid of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, but the latter has yet to make a decision. Mr Yudhoyono's Democrat Party received about 10 percent of the votes. ""We will announce our presidential candidate later,"" said Democrat Party secretary-general Andi Nurpati. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) of Ms Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's founding president Sukarno, received about 19 percent of the votes, unofficial tallies show. The PDI-P has indicated it will nominate its chairwoman, Ms Megawati, to be the next president. But the party has said that if she is not ready to run, it will nominate Mr Joko Widodo. Mr Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, is Jakarta's popular governor and has been named as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine. The party has said it will wait until the official results are announced next week before making a decision. Ms Megawati has twice run for president, but lost to Mr Yudhoyono in 2004. The next presidential election is due to be held in July. The people have made their choice. While the counting process is not yet over, the final tally is not going to be very different from the unofficial tally. These are the parties that are going to make up the next parliament. The party with the most votes is Gerindra, the party of Prabowo Subianto. The party that has the second most votes is the PDI-P, the party of Megawati Soekarnoputri. The party with the third most votes is Golkar, the party of Aburizal Bakrie. Prabowo Subianto will be the leader of the new parliament. He is the kingmaker. He is going to determine who the next president will be. It is not going to be Megawati. She has only got 19 per cent of the vote. It is not going to be Joko Widodo. He is the man that Megawati would like to be the next president, but he is not even a member of the DPR. It is not going to be Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. He has only got 10 per cent of the vote. It is not going to be Jusuf Kalla. He has only got 12 per cent of the vote. It is going to be Prabowo Subianto. He has got 27 per cent of the vote. Now, Prabowo can decide that he will be the president. In that case, he will announce that he is going to be the president. If he is not ready to be the president, he can decide that he will be the vice-president. In that case, he will announce that he will be the vice-president. If he is not ready to be the president, and he is not ready to be the vice-president, he will announce that he will be the kingmaker. In that case, he will announce that he will make the decision. He will make a decision who the next president will be. Megawati will not be the next president. Joko Widodo will not be the next president. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will not be the next president.

His latest outburst was met with a range of responses, including the hashtag crylikeboehner, which was trending on Twitter on Wednesday. The CBC, Canada's public broadcaster, said ""the whole world was watching"" as Mr Boehner's tears began to flow during the anthem, which has been performed by various artists over the years, including Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston.

Democratic Senator Ben Cardin was quick to defend John Boehner, who is expected to resign as speaker of the House next month. The Maryland senator told CNN the Speaker was ""a good man"" who had been put in a ""very difficult"" position by the ""ultra-conservative"" wing of the Republican party. Mr Cardin went on to say that Congress would not be able to function effectively without bipartisan cooperation, and that a Republican-controlled Congress was ""not going to be able to get anything done."" ""We've got to come together to do the people's business,"" he said. Bloomberg Politics is reporting that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the second most powerful member of the House, is ""the front-runner"" to replace John Boehner as Speaker of the House.

"Mark McCarroll, a father-of-one, was working as a fork lift driver at Hayes Fuels depot in Belfast's Harbour estate when the accident happened. Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk manager Raymond Davison were also killed. The three men were trapped inside the building as it filled with carbon monoxide when the boiler they were repairing malfunctioned. The firm was fined 24,000 plus costs. The firm, which supplies oil to customers across Northern Ireland, pleaded guilty to three charges under the Health and Safety at Work Order (NI) 1978 and was fined 24,000 plus costs. The accident occurred on a Saturday morning in December 2009 when the men, who were friends, were trying to fix the boiler. They had all been working at the depot on the previous day and a fault had been discovered. The boiler was located inside the main storage shed where 60,000 litres of fuel oil were stored. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSENI) found that the boiler had been installed by a contractor who had failed to identify the location of an exhaust flue pipe. As a result, carbon monoxide emissions had built up inside the shed and when the men arrived to make repairs they were overcome by the fumes. As they were overcome, the men became separated inside the shed. Their bodies were discovered when an engineer arrived the next day to fix the boiler. Mr McCarroll, 37, from Belfast, was a father-of-one and was engaged to be married. Mr Hayes, 55, who was married with two children, was a director of the company which he founded 20 years ago. Mr Davison, 53, who was married with two children, was the risk manager at Hayes Fuels. After the hearing, the Health and Safety Executive said Hayes Fuels had not taken effective measures to ensure the safety of its employees while they worked at the premises. It said the case highlighted the need for companies to ensure that boilers were installed and maintained by competent engineers. A spokesperson said: ""The investigation into this incident found that Hayes Fuels had failed to ensure that the boiler was properly installed and inspected. ""During the installation, the flue pipe had been routed through a hole in the wall of the building, which had not been sealed. ""As a result, carbon monoxide emissions had built up inside the shed. ""On the morning of the incident, two Hayes Fuels employees had been called to the depot to fix the boiler. ""While attempting repairs, they were overcome by the fumes and tragically lost their lives. ""This incident could have been avoided if the boiler had been installed correctly. ""Hayes Fuels had failed to take effective measures to ensure the safety of its employees while they worked at the premises."" Ciaran McAteer, head of the Crown Solicitors' Health and Safety Unit said: ""This was a tragic accident which resulted in the deaths of three men who were all colleagues and friends. ""It highlights the dangers of the accumulation of carbon monoxide in the workplace. ""Had a proper risk assessment been carried out, this tragic accident could have been avoided. ""Through the prosecution, it is hoped that other companies will be encouraged to ensure that their workplaces are safe for employees.""",0,986

"The visitors took the lead when a clever dummy from the impressive Oscar Dorley set up Maksim Maksimov to net. Defender Joe Shaughnessy headed home Liam Craig's corner to level the score. After going ahead again through Craig's penalty, the hosts were pegged back by a second leveller from Gers defender David Bates. Kenny Miller's side were indebted to keeper Wes Foderingham for keeping them in the tie with a string of fine stops, with Scott Fraser, Dario Zanatta and the lively Dorley all denied by the stopper. The Gers looked to have won it when Kenny Miller converted from the penalty spot after Foderingham was penalised for bringing down Jamie Murphy in the box. But in the third minute of injury time, the hosts were rewarded for their pressure with Dorley netting to send the tie to extra-time. Rangers were reduced to 10 men when Miller was shown a second yellow card and County took advantage with Liam Boyce's header securing a spot in the last 16. The visitors made the perfect start when an excellent move saw Dorley slip a clever pass inside to Maksimov, who slotted home. The Staggies levelled with their first attempt on goal when Craig's corner was headed home by Shaughnessy. County should have taken the lead when Dorley raced through, but his effort was parried wide by Foderingham. Their joy was short-lived, however, when Miller was brought down in the box and Craig dispatched the penalty. The Ibrox men were pegged back once again when Foderingham rushed off his line and brought down Bates. Bates picked himself up to score from the spot. Murphy was denied by a fine save from Scott Fox before Miller hit the bar with a volley. The visitors were indebted to Foderingham, who first denied Fraser, and then turned a Zanatta effort behind. Murphy sent a shot wide from the edge of the box but County took the lead when Dorley netted. With two minutes remaining Miller was brought down in the box by Foderingham and the Rangers striker stepped up to convert from the spot. The Dingwall side thought they had won it when Boyce headed home, but referee Craig Thomson awarded a free-kick after consulting with the assistant.

"Visiting striker Harry Kane fired home from the spot in the second half after Raheem Sterling was controversially penalised for handball. Yaya Toure struck a 20-yard free-kick against the bar and Palace's Wilfried Zaha also went close. Tottenham were the better side, especially in the first half, but struggled to create chances until Kane's penalty. Palace, who are now 14th in the table, have lost 11 of their 17 league games this season, with six of those defeats coming at home. The visitors were on top from the start and could have taken the lead after just 13 seconds when Dele Alli met a Christian Eriksen corner, but his header went straight at Wayne Hennessey. Spurs then had a strong penalty appeal turned down when Scott Dann appeared to block Eric Dier's shot with his arm, before Kane shot wide from 20 yards. Palace were struggling to get out of their own half but did manage to create an opening when Zaha found space on the right and fired in a shot that Hugo Lloris pushed behind. Spurs then went close twice in quick succession as first Toby Alderweireld's header was saved at point-blank range by Hennessey, before Dier fired the rebound against the bar. Tottenham continued to dominate after the break and came close to scoring when Kane's shot was well saved by Hennessey. Spurs finally broke through in the 64th minute when Wilfried Zaha was penalised for handball, despite the Palace man's protests that the ball hit his face first. Kane stepped up to take the spot-kick and sent Hennessey the wrong way to score his fifth Premier League goal of the season. Palace were struggling to create anything but Zaha did go close to an equaliser when he fired a 25-yard free-kick against the bar. They also went close through Damien Delaney's header from a corner and an effort from Toure, before Toby Alderweireld went close at the other end when he shot wide from a tight angle. The hosts threw on Connor Wickham and Dwight Gayle in search of an equaliser but Spurs had the better chances late on and could have added a second when Hennessey saved from substitute Nacer Chadli. In the end, the visitors hung on to secure victory and move up to third place in the table. ""The first half was almost a one-way street,"" said Pardew. ""In the second half we showed a lot more spirit and, at 1-0, you're always in the game. ""We had some great moments at the end - the free-kick from Yaya is not far away and Dwight and Connor both had great moments. ""It's a shame for us because we really need those points.

"Around 155 countries are expected to formally sign the deal at the UN, setting in motion events that could see the treaty operational within a year. The UN says the treaty will ""set the world on a safer path"" and shift the responsibility for disarmament to countries that own nuclear weapons. The nine countries that have nuclear weapons will not be taking part in the signing ceremony. Israel has never admitted to having nuclear weapons but has never denied it either. The treaty, which prohibits the use, threat of use, development, testing, production, manufacturing and possession of nuclear weapons, was adopted by a UN conference in July. It will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by at least 50 countries. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the treaty represented ""an important step towards the universally-held goal of a world free of nuclear weapons."" ""There remain some fifteen thousand nuclear weapons in existence. We cannot allow these doomsday weapons to endanger our world and our children's future,"" he said. ""The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will make an important contribution towards our ultimate objective of achieving general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, including through a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons."" Those who support the treaty say it is a long overdue response to the grave risks posed by nuclear weapons, and also to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of these weapons. Nuclear disarmament campaigner Tim Wright, from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), said: ""The treaty represents the only rational response to the grave threat posed by nuclear weapons. ""It is also a clear indication of the majority opinion in the world, with a hundred and twenty-two countries having voted for the ban treaty at the UN, and only one against. ""There is no doubt that the ban treaty will provide a major boost for the disarmament movement, and I am confident that it will significantly increase the pressure on those countries that possess nuclear weapons to disarm."" However, those countries which have nuclear weapons - the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel - were not present during the negotiations and do not support the treaty. They say they will never give up their nuclear weapons. North Korea is the only country to have carried out a nuclear test this year. The US and Russia maintain around 14,000 nuclear weapons between them, and have been modernising their arsenals. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said during a visit to Japan that the treaty is ""simply not the answer."" ""This treaty will not make the world more peaceful, will not make the world safer, will not make the world more stable,"" she said. ""The hard reality in this day and age is that we need to ensure we have the defence and deterrence capabilities to respond to the growing threats that we see around the world.""",0,994
"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention was to cross into Syria to join ISIS, said Turkish media. ""They were planning to go to Syria to join the Islamic State,"" a security official told the Hurriyet Daily News. ""They were trying to join the Islamic State."" Authorities believe that the group, which was arrested on June 11, had been in contact with a Turkish citizen who had joined ISIS in Syria. The group was being held at a migrant reception center in Hatay, the security official said. The recent ISIS attack on Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, which killed 42 people, mostly foreigners, has highlighted the threat posed by the group to Turkey. The Istanbul attack has been followed by a series of ISIS attacks in Turkey's southeast, mainly in cities and towns near the Syrian border. Those attacks have mostly targeted security forces. Although Turkish authorities have prevented hundreds of Turkish citizens from leaving the country to join ISIS in Syria and Iraq, there have been frequent reports of ISIS-linked attacks in Turkey, particularly in the last year. The group has also been blamed for carrying out the March 19 bombing on Istanbul's Istiklal Avenue, which killed four people, including the suicide bomber, and wounded 36. It was also blamed for the Jan. 12 attack in Istanbul that killed 11 German tourists and wounded 15 people. Source: Hurriyet Daily",0,995
"The former Scunthorpe, Sheffield Wednesday and Preston player worked with Blackpool manager Gary Bowyer as a trainee at Blackburn. The 27-year-old was released by York in January after making 18 appearances in all competitions. Wes Fletcher is a 25 year old striker who was released by York City in January. Fletcher signed for York in 2012 after a short stint at Grimsby and went on to score 26 goals in 107 appearances. Bowyer said ""We wanted to do something about the strikers because we are a little bit short in that department. We have been looking at Wes for a while. He has come in and trained with us and done well. He fits the bill of what we want from our strikers. He has good energy, he is a good foil and he works really hard for the team. He is good in the air and we have been looking for someone like him. He gives us an option we have been looking for."" Jordan Richards is a 23 year old defender who has played for Chester, AFC Fylde, Droylsden and Guiseley in the last four seasons. Bowyer said ""We have had Jordan with us for about a week and he has done really well. He is a big centre-half who can play and he will come in and compete with the other centre-halves. We need people to come in and compete and he will do that.""",0,996
"Mobile measurement firm RootMetrics conducted over 840,000 checks, ranking operators for reliability and speed of voice, data and text services. While EE dominated for speed, Three was a close second with O2 third. O2 topped the reliability chart, with EE second and Three third. Vodafone didn't win any categories. Reliability is defined as the percentage of time users can successfully make calls, access texts and use data. Speed is the average download speed for mobile internet services. The report is an update to one published in March, in which EE won on speed and reliability but O2 topped the reliability chart. ""EE's dominance in the data category is a testament to its continued investment in the UK's fastest 4G network,"" said Scott Stonham, RootMetrics GM of Europe. ""We found that EE's 4G coverage is improving across the UK, which is positive news for consumers who are now seeing greater access to superfast mobile data speeds. Stonham said the report should help consumers to choose the best operator for their needs. ""If you live in a city and use your mobile device to access the internet, stream music, and upload pictures, EE's strong performance in the speed category means you should get a great experience,"" he said. ""However, if you use your device mainly for calling and texting, and live outside a large city, our report shows that O2, Three and Vodafone are reliable choices for you. RootMetrics has conducted over 400,000 checks in London, Manchester and Birmingham, with Leeds and Nottingham to be added this month. The company will expand its testing to other major UK cities.",0,997
"Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles, adorned with a pattern of crosses and roses, were created by skilled artisans for a royal building during the Byzantine Empire, which ruled the Holy Land between A.D. 324 and 640. The findings will be displayed to the public for the first time later this week, Arutz-7 reported. ""This type of floor decoration is typical in royal and church buildings in the Byzantine period,"" said Dr. Gabriel Barkay, an archaeologist from Bar-Ilan University. Barkay said the location of the find is a ""1,000 percent match"" with the site of the Jewish temple and suggests the temple was used as a ""garbage dump"" following its destruction. Rabbi Chaim Richman, director of the International Department at the Temple Institute, told WorldNetDaily the findings are ""definitely from the Second Temple."" ""If you ask me, they're from the Holy of Holies,"" he said. He said the floor tiles were found near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, which is the closest point to where the Holy of Holies was located. The Holy of Holies is the inner sanctuary of the temple that housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the Ten Commandments. Richman said the Byzantines were known for using Jewish artifacts in their buildings as a way of ""rubbing it in"" to the Jews, who were barred from Jerusalem during those years. ""This is another case where the Jews were humiliated,"" he said. Richman said the findings are a direct challenge to the ""propaganda"" of the Muslim Waqf, the custodians of the Temple Mount, who claim there is no archaeological evidence of the existence of the Jewish temple at the site. The Waqf has excavated the site at least twice, Richman said, once in 1999 to create a new mosque at an underground complex known as Solomon's Stables, and a second time in 2007 to create an exit for the tens of thousands of worshippers who visit the Al Aqsa Mosque each Friday. Both times, he said, the Waqf trucked out tons of dirt containing Jewish artifacts to dump in the nearby Kidron Valley. ""The Waqf is working very hard to erase history,"" he said. Richman said the Waqf is digging on the Temple Mount as part of a ""devious scheme"" to locate and destroy any Jewish artifacts and then replace them with mosques. He said the Temple Mount is the most important site in Judaism. Jews all over the world pray facing the Western Wall, a retaining wall for the compound that is the closest point to the Holy of Holies that Jews are permitted to pray. The Temple Mount was vacant during the period of the First Temple, which was built by King Solomon in the 10th century B.C., destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C., and rebuilt on the same site about 70 years later. The Second Temple was constructed in about 19 B.C. and destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70. Each temple stood for about four centuries. The Jewish Temple was the center of religious Jewish worship. It housed the Holy of Holies, which contained the Ark of the Covenant and was said to be the area upon which God's ""presence"" dwelt. All Jewish sacrifices were performed at the Temple, and it was said to be the place where God chose to ""put His Name."" The Temple Mount compound has remained a focal point for Jewish services over the millennia. Prayers for a return to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple have been uttered by Jews since the Second Temple was destroyed, according to Jewish tradition. Jews worldwide pray facing toward the Western Wall, a portion of an outer courtyard of the Temple left intact. The Al Aqsa Mosque was constructed around A.D. 709 to serve as a shrine near another shrine, the Dome of the Rock, which was built by an Islamic caliph. Al Aqsa was meant to mark what Muslims came to believe was the place at which Muhammad, the founder of Islam, ascended to heaven to receive revelations from Allah.

"Performers from the comic opera L'elisir d'amore gathered outside the Bow Street venue in full costume at 20:30 BST, alongside members of the audience. The theatre said the interruption was ""not a protest"" and that audience members would be given refunds. The interruption was the latest in a series of protests against the Labour MP, who has been criticised for comparing Israel's treatment of Palestinians to apartheid in South Africa. Police said they were investigating. A spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of a demonstration outside the Coliseum Theatre in St Martin's Lane and enquiries are being made."" The singer who sang the role of Adina, Mary Plazas, said: ""We were performing L'elisir d'amore and a man stood up in the middle of the performance and started making a speech about Israel and Gaza. ""He was screaming about the treatment of the Palestinian people and then the music stopped and there was a bit of an awkward silence while he was escorted out of the theatre. ""I think he was a member of the audience who had got dressed up and blended in. It was a very strange thing to happen."" Ms Plazas said the ""strange incident"" was handled ""very well"" by the staff of the English National Opera. Audience member Chris Green tweeted that ""someone in the audience in full evening dress started shouting about the Gaza Strip."" He added: ""Finally got him out. Security in theatre very good, but not sure how he got past security in first place."" The Metropolitan Police said a ""loud, aggressive male"" had been removed from the theatre.",0,999
