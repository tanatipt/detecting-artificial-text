"This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope. For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems. It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that ""no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems."" Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer. Will anyone help the Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds The'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election Aung San Suu Kyi where are you? So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to? Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama. The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission. But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers. Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship. In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the ""Trojan Horse"" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate. There are of course plenty of caveats. Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh. After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation. Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country. Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make. Implementing any ""solution"" will be even harder. But the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it's the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.",1,0
"Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of 80,000 (PS62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for ""lone-wolf"" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: ""Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. ""The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect."" Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold ""can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies,"" said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: ""In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. ""The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities.""",1,1
"The boys, aged 12 and 13, were seriously injured in the attack in Havant, Hampshire, on Friday and remain in hospital. Richard Michael Walsh, 43, of no fixed address, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count of assault. He will appear before magistrates in Portsmouth on Monday, police said. The attack happened shortly before 15:00 BST at the junction of Southleigh Road and Eastleigh Road.

"Trafford Council closed Bollin Primary School in Bowdon, Greater Manchester on Monday after concerns about a ""reduced capacity of senior leadership."" The council said the school had appointed an interim head teacher and it would reopen for Key Stage 2 pupils on Thursday. Other classes will return in the next few days, said the council. It follows a strike by teachers on Thursday, supported by some parents who demonstrated outside school. The school has appointed Kylie Spark as interim head teacher while Michelle Brindle was ""not in school,"" the council said. There are no details about how long Mrs Spark, of Sale's Tyntesfield Primary School, will be in post. A number of staff have been neutrally suspended while investigations continue into a video purporting to show teaching staff at a party making comments about Ms Brindle. Trafford Council added it has applied to the Department for Education for approval for an interim executive board consisting of experienced governors. One parent of a pupil at the school, which was rated as ""outstanding"" in its last Ofsted inspection, said she was worried many of the teachers will not return. Julie Saunders said: ""That is massively disruptive and upsetting for the children. ""It is not just a building with a few supply teachers; a school is a community which knows and understands the kids."" Sean Anstee, leader of Trafford Council, said he understood parents' concerns and the council had been working with the governing body to resolve issues. He added: ""We are doing everything we can to reopen the school and return it to the wonderful school we know it to be."" Key Stage 1 pupils will be invited back into school on Friday and early years pupils will return on Monday. A petition of no confidence in Ms Brindle has been signed by more than 900 people. The head teacher told the BBC she did not want to comment. The school teaches more than 200 pupils from the age of three to 11.",1,3
"Apple Music performed a U-turn over payment policy a day after the pop star threatened to prevent the US firm from streaming her album 1989. Swift had argued that Apple withholding payments during a three-month trial period was not fair for artists. But photographer Jason Sheldon said the singer herself did not ""play fair"" when it came to image rights. Some of the claims he has made in an open letter to Swift have been disputed by representatives of the 25-year-old singer. In it he wrote: ""If you don't like being exploited, that's great - make a huge statement about it, and you'll have my support. But how about making sure you're not guilty of the very same tactic before you have a pop at someone else? ""With all due respect to you too Taylor, you can do the right thing and change your photo policy. Photographers don't ask for your music for free. Please don't ask us to provide you with your marketing material for free."" Mr Sheldon, who runs the Walsall-based Junction 10 agency, said he and other photographers had been called to hand over some rights to their images from Swift's live concerts. To cover a performance in March 2011 at Birmingham's LG Arena, Mr Sheldon said he had to sign a permission form that granted Swift's management company long-term rights to reuse the images and prevented him from featuring them after the initial coverage. ""I can't use it in my portfolio, feature it on my website and even the original newspaper couldn't reuse it,"" Mr Sheldon said. ""What's more, they can give my image to my clients for press purposes. It's giving my work away for free."" He said the photo authorisation form included a section that gave the management firm ""perpetual worldwide right to use (and to authorise others to use) any or all of the photographs for any non-commercial purpose."" Mr Sheldon said clauses such as this were becoming more common in photo agreement forms. He said it was Swift's stance with Apple that ""jarred"" - with her ""lambasting"" the firm over using music for free, when her management firm was ""guilty of doing the same thing with photos."" In a statement, a spokesperson for Swift said: ""The standard photography agreement has been misrepresented in that it clearly states that any photographer shooting The 1989 World Tour has the opportunity for further use of said photographs with management's approval. ""Another distinct misrepresentation is the claim that the copyright of the photographs will be with anyone other than the photographer - this agreement does not transfer copyright away from the photographer. ""Every artist has the right to, and should, protect the use of their name and likeness."" Mr Sheldon said he had seen a 2015 version of the same contract that was even more strict, although he had not applied for one. ""I fully agree with Taylor Swift's stance against Apple, but it's about her playing by the same rules she wants to live by,"" he said.",1,4

"Police have charged a 32-year-old Norwegian man over both attacks. The man dressed as a police officer was arrested on tiny Utoeya island after an hour-long shooting spree. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said many people were still looking for their children and had not so far been able to locate them. He was speaking after meeting victims and relatives with Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon in the town of Sundvollen near the island. Values attackedHome-grown plot?In pictures: Shock Mr Stoltenberg said he was ""deeply touched"" by the meetings. ""We will do whatever we can to give them as much support as possible,"" he said. Earlier he said that he was due to have been on Utoeya - ""a youth paradise turned into a hell"" - a few hours after the attack took place. The suspect is reported by local media to have had links with right-wing extremists. He has been named as Anders Behring Breivik. Police searched his Oslo apartment overnight and are questioning him. The BBC's Richard Galpin, near the island which is currently cordoned off by police, says that Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat. Police say they are investigating whether the attacks were the work of one man or whether others helped. ""At Utoeya, the water is still being searched for more victims,"" deputy police chief Roger Andresen told reporters. ""We have no more information than.... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist."" By Richard GalpinBBC News, near Utoeya A search is going on not just on the island itself, but also in the waters around it because a lot of people tried to escape by jumping in the water and trying to swim away. Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them. The chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island. Of course that gave the gunman so much time to kill so many people. Also crucially, the police were throwing all their resources at the huge bomb attack which had just taken place in the centre of Oslo. But still, the question will be asked: Were there not police nearer to this area who could have moved in much more quickly? Local media report that police are investigating claims by witnesses that a second person was involved, apparently not disguised in a police uniform. A farm supply firm has confirmed selling six tonnes of fertiliser to Mr Breivik who is reported to have run a farming company. Speculation has been rife that fertiliser could have been used in the Oslo bomb. The number killed in the island shooting spree, which is among the world's most deadly, had been put at 10 on Friday - but soared overnight. Hundreds of young people had been attending the summer camp organised by the governing Labour Party on Utoeya island. Eyewitnesses described how a tall, blond man dressed as a policeman opened fire indiscriminately, prompting camp attendees to jump into the water to try to escape the hail of bullets. Some of the teenagers were shot at as they tried to swim to safety. Armed police were deployed to the island but details of the operation to capture the suspect remain unclear. After his arrest he was charged with committing acts of terrorism. Profile: Anders Behring Breivik Police say they discovered many more victims after searching the area around the island. They have warned the death toll may rise further as rescue teams continue to scour the waters around the island. The gunman is reported to have been armed with a handgun, an automatic weapon and a shotgun. ""He travelled on the ferry boat from the mainland over to that little inland island posing as a police officer, saying he was there to do research in connection with the bomb blasts,"" NRK journalist Ole Torp told the BBC. ""He asked people to gather round and then he started shooting, so these young people fled into the bushes and woods and some even swam off the island to get to safety."" One 15-year-old eyewitness described how she saw what she thought was a police officer open fire. ""He first shot people on the island. Afterward he started shooting people in the water,"" youth camp delegate Elise told Associated Press. The attacks sparked strong international condemnation, with US President Barack Obama expressing his condolences and offering support. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II spoke of her shock and sadness in a letter to King Harald. In Oslo, government officials urged people to stay at home and avoid central areas of the city. Shards of twisted metal, rubble and glass littered the streets of central Oslo left devastated by Friday's enormous explosion. Windows in the buildings of the government quarter were shattered and witnesses described how smoke filled the atmosphere around the blast site. The BBC's John Sopel in Oslo says there is a heavy military presence, with checkpoints around the quarter. Mr Stoltenberg said civil servants were among the dead in Oslo and he knew some of those killed. There are also concerns that more victims may still be inside buildings hit by the initial massive explosion.",1,7
"Firefighters tackled the blaze, which started just before 21:00 on Monday in Carron Valley. The home owners and their dog escaped from the building after being alerted by a smoke alarm. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze, although it is not believed to be suspicious. Station manager Dave Wishart said: ""Firefighters were deployed in strategic positions surrounding the building with high-pressure jets and worked through the night to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. ""Unfortunately the intensity of the fire meant the house was completely destroyed."" ""The home owners became aware of the fire quickly and had a working smoke alarm. ""This helped them to get themselves and their dog out safely.""",1,8
"The idea will be looked at as part of a wider study of transport issues across southern Scotland. Campaign for Border Rail spokesman Simon Walton said they would have preferred a report looking solely at rail services in the area. However, he said it was welcome progress nonetheless. Transport Scotland announced earlier this week that it intended to award the contract to look at wider transport issues across the south of the country to Jacobs UK Ltd. It is hoped the study can get under way later this month and will take about seven months to complete. Mr Walton said it was good to see the CBR's case for extending the railway was being recognised. ""It is a first step if not exactly a giant leap - it is certainly a move in the right direction,"" he said. ""We at the CBR would have been happier with a feasibility study looking solely at railway extension but this is a positive move. ""It does back our findings that it makes sense locally, socially and strategically to take the railway through Hawick and on to Carlisle.""",1,9
"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in ""secret."" It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was ""another of these secret trials."" He said: ""Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome ""might come today, it might come next week."" There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was ""more fight in her"" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was ""unpredictable"" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""I have watched her grow up on Skype. ""She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. ""Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a ""prisoner of conscience"" who was being held for ""peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association."" Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: ""Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.""",1,10
"Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years. We asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition so unique. The earliest surviving manuscript of harp music in Europe - the manuscript of Robert ap Huw, comes from Wales. ""The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a vital insight into early, traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely"" said internationally renowned harpist, Catrin Finch. ""Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd"" (The Song of the White Piper) demonstrates his music's amazing ability to sound contemporary, even though it was written nearly five centuries ago."" This unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp accompaniment is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes. Gwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries. Considered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community. ""The'shimmering' voice of the Triple Harp's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the Welsh language itself"" said Robin Huw Bowen, a full-time professional Welsh harpist specializing solely in the Welsh Triple Harp. The track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect. In many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church. Singer Arfon Gwilym was brought up in the tradition and explains more: ""The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year."" ""After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique."" Listen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog. Welsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. In recent years, folk singer Sian James has been at the forefront of this movement: ""A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod (The rejected maiden) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala, which tells the story of a young girl who, finding herself pregnant out of wedlock, is thrown out of her family home by her father, ostracised by her community and left destitute."" ""It ends with the girl drowning herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand, asking to be buried without a headstone, so her existence would be forgotten."" Due to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales's leading folk musicians and musicologists: ""This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi performed by Nansi Richards, the original'Queen of the Welsh Harp' conveys the'hwyl' or spirit of our traditional dance music."" During the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic. Cerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose Can Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909. Its words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century. The 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world was engaged in the hippy movement and the'summer of love', Wales was rediscovering its folk music and traditions, fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music. ""We formed Ar Log in 1976, with the dream of being able to earn a living solely by playing traditional Welsh music"" said Dafydd Roberts, one of the founding members of Ar Log. ""By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our disposal, from haunting love songs and harp airs, to melodic dance tunes, and rousing sea shanties."" This medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log's own repertoire: Twll yn y to Cymro o Ble Pedwar Post y Gwely Dafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s for official status for the Welsh language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Movement. ""Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme,"" he said. Peintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language. More and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations. Welsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn has recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin, tabla and Welsh harp. Another recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language. Gwyneth chose the track Cariad Mam (Mother's Love) from that album. Today, musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaborations around the world. WOMEX - The World's Music Comes To Wales is broadcast on BBC Two Wales, Sunday 27 October at 22:00 BST.",1,11
"Akinfenwa chested down in the box and saw his deflected shot fly past Bobby Olejnik to continue Wycombe's impressive home form - they have lost just one of six league games at Adams Park this term. Paul Hayes should have given the hosts the lead after 18 minutes when a bouncing ball fell to him five yards out but his looping header cleared the crossbar.

"The state newspaper says the ""suave"" liquor will spare you wincing when you wake, despite boasting 30-40 alcohol. The brew is reportedly made from a type of indigenous ginseng called insam and glutinous rice, and cultivated by an organic farming method. North Korean media is known for making often outlandish claims about its domestic achievements. Last year, it said medical products containing extracts from the insam plant could cure Mers, Sars and even Aids, NK News reported. The Pyongyang Times said the new alcohol ""exudes national flavour,"" without dampening your national fervour the following morning. Among its other unique selling points, according to the paper - the spirit ""is highly appreciated by experts and lovers."" The newspaper article, titled, ""Liquor wins quality medal for preserving national smack,"" says the Taedonggang Foodstuff Factory has been working for years on the elixir. The drink derives from Kaesong Koryo insam - a natural herb thought to have medicinal properties. According to the Pyongyang Times, replacing sugar with the scorched, glutinous rice removed the bitterness from the insam and, crucially, the hangover. ""Koryo Liquor, which is made of six-year-old Kaesong Koryo insam, known as being highest in medicinal effect, and the scorched rice, is highly appreciated by experts and lovers as it is suave and causes no hangover,"" the article reads. The liquor ""has already been registered as a national scientific and technological hit,"" it adds. Andray Abrahamian, who travels to North Korea on business for Chosong Exchange, told the UK-based North Korean News website that insam liquors were ""OK"" but he is ""not that keen on it as a tasty treat."" ""There are some high quality liquors made in North Korea, though in my experience there is no such thing as hangover-free booze anywhere in the world,"" he said.",1,14

Last year, the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - launched a formal investigation into Amazon's tax arrangements with Luxembourg. And the EU is also looking into tech giant Apple's tax dealings in Ireland, coffee-shop chain Starbucks' dealings in the Netherlands, and Italian carmaker Fiat's agreement with Luxembourg.",1,15
"The council has launched an appeal to raise PS150,000 for a bronze sculpture in the Barkers Pool area. Former steelworker Kathleen Roberts said: ""It breaks my heart that we haven't been recognised and everyone else has been."" The planned sculpture has been designed by artist Martin Jennings. Mrs Roberts said: ""Times were tough in 1941, as a country we had our backs against the wall. We worked flat out for the war effort and we were just young girls. ""I think the Sheffield industry could give more because they give so freely to others."" Sheffield City Council put up a commemorative plaque to the women in 2011, while plans for the sculpture were already under way. Leader of Sheffield City Council, Julie Dore, said: ""We all owe it to these amazing women to make the statue a reality.""",1,16
"Bielsa, 60, a former Argentina and Chile boss, resigned from French club Marseille in August and is unattached. He led Spanish club Athletic Bilbao to the 2012 Europa League and Copa del Rey finals before a 2014 move to Marseille. Swansea parted company with Garry Monk on Wednesday and are thought to want a new boss before Sunday's West Ham game. Monk left the club following a run of just one win in 11 Premier League games. AEK Athens boss Gus Poyet was thought to be in the frame to replace him, but the Greek club said that they had not received an approach from Swansea regarding Poyet. Sevilla manager Unai Emery has also been linked with the job. Swansea's first-team coach Alan Curtis was in caretaker charge of Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Manchester City.",1,17
"The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think? No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it is reported. However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour. The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30 of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations. On 7 June Eugene convinced 33 of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human. Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal. Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013. Eugene was created by Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, who now lives in Russia. Transcripts of the conversations are currently unavailable, but may appear in a future academic paper. The judges and hidden human control groups were kept apart throughout the test. The event was organised by Reading University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies. Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science. The event has been labelled as ""historic"" by the organisers, who claim no computer has passed the test before. ""Some will claim that the Test has already been passed,"" said Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the University of Reading and deputy vice-chancellor for research at Coventry University. ""The words Turing test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However, this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted. ""A true Turing test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time on Saturday."" Prof Noel Sharkey, a leading expert in robotic technology and artificial intelligence, said: ""It is indeed a great achievement for Eugene. It was very clever ruse to pretend to be a 13-year-old Ukranian boy, which would constrain the conversation. But these competitions are really great to push developments."" But others have criticised the claim. ""It's nonsense,"" Prof Stevan Harnad told the Guardian newspaper. ""We have not passed the Turing test. We are not even close."" Hugh Loebner, creator of another Turing Test competition, has also criticised the University of Reading's experiment for only lasting five minutes. ""That's scarcely very penetrating,"" he told the Huffington Post, noting that Eugene had previously been ranked behind seven other systems in his own 25-minute long Loebner Prize test.",1,18
"Leinster fly-half Sexton was injured in Saturday's Pro12 final defeat by Connacht and requires surgery. Full-back Rob Kearney has a hamstring injury with his brother Dave, a winger, ruled out by a torn calf muscle. Ian Madigan, Craig Gilroy and uncapped Connacht duo Tiernan O'Halloran and Matt Healy have all been called up. With Munster's Simon Zebo already missing the tour, Ulster's Jared Payne looks in line to be switched from his regular centre role to full-back. Payne has played at full-back for most of his career but was moved to centre by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt to help fill the midfield void left following Brian O'Driscoll's retirement. Connacht's O'Halloran will be the other full-back option in Schmidt's squad. Bordeaux-bound Madigan was a notable omission from Schmidt's initial squad but Sexton's absence means a reprieve for the former Leinster fly-half. ""We initially hoped it [Sexton's injury] could be managed but it will require surgery,"" said Schmidt, who added the fly-half will be ruled out for three months. While Sexton's injury has meant a call up for Madigan, Ulster's Paddy Jackson now looks in position to start in the First Test in Cape Town on Saturday week. Wing Luke Fitzgerald, Sexton's club-mate, was ruled out of the tour earlier this week after also being injured in the Pro12 decider. Schmidt already has a long list of absentees, which includes backs Zebo and Tommy Bowe, and forwards Cian Healy, Denis Buckley, Nathan White, Sean O'Brien, Peter O'Mahony and Josh van der Flier. Despite the injuries, Schmidt believes his side can still strongly challenge the Springboks. ""My expectation is that the players will work hard, they'll unite really effectively under [captain] Rory Best's leadership and that we will be competitive,"" said the Ireland coach. ""Whether that's enough, we'll find out on the 11th, 18th and 25th of June (the dates for the three Tests)."" Ireland, who have never won in South Africa, face the Springboks in the first Test in Cape Town on 11 June, with the sides meeting again over the following two weekends in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth.

"Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over seafarers' pay. The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than PS4 an hour. The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month. The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink. Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents. Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept. Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised. He said: ""I'm very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles. ""The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved. Going forward, I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage."" Serco Northlink was awarded the six-year PS243m Northern Isles contract in 2012. It operates three ferries and two cargo boats to the Northern Isles on a route which is heavily subsidised by the Scottish government.",1,22

However, Smyth exited from the men's 100m as he finished fifth in his heat in 10.66 -.44 secs outside his best. Reid, meanwhile, false started in his heat and was disqualified. Paralympic star Smyth, 27, appeared to start well in heat four but faded after 50m as he finished fifth in 10.66 seconds. ""I got out of the blocks really well and was in a good position in the early stages, however, I then tightened up and people started to pass me,"" explained Smyth. ""I was hoping to do better but I still haven't fully recovered from my hamstring injury. But] It has been an incredible experience for me to represent Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games as I missed out on Delhi because of injury."" London-born Reid's first Northern Ireland outing proved a brief affair as he false started in heat three. Reid, 20, switched allegiance to Northern Ireland in February as his mother hails from the province. Birchfield Harrier Reid won European Junior Championship 200m silver last year and his main focus in Glasgow will be the longer sprint. Smyth is also scheduled to run the 200m at these championships but the Londonderry man's 2014 season has been badly affected by hamstring trouble and the 100m is regarded as his stronger event. A time of 10.45secs would have secured a fastest loser's progression to Monday's semi-finals. Foster looked to be in a tricky heat but her time of 11.62 - despite being.22secs outside her best - earned her second spot behind Australia's Melissa Breen [11.54].

The American-born runner was making her first appearance at a major championship at the age of 37. Ganiel is not a full-time athlete and her day job is working as an assistant professor in conflict resolution and reconciliation at Trinity College, Dublin.

Seleznyov side-footed a tame shot against the post after Denys Garmash had directed a powerful header straight at Handanovic under little pressure.

"Pae Jun-ho, known in the US as Kenneth Bae, smuggled anti-government materials and plotted the state's downfall, a Supreme Court spokesman told state news agency KCNA. He denied Mr Bae was being used as a ""political bargaining chip"" with the US. Mr Bae was detained last year after entering North Korea as a tourist. North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytism. They were released after intervention from high-profile American figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both of whom went to Pyongyang. The court spokesman told KCNA that Mr Bae was ""dispatched to China as a missionary."" There he was involved in setting up ""plot-breeding bases"" from which he ""infiltrated at least 250 students"" into the North Korean port city of Rason with the aim of ""bringing the government down."" US citizens held by N Korea ""He committed such hostile acts as egging on overseas [North Korean] citizens and foreigners to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign,"" he said. He added Mr Bae's full confession was the reason why he did not receive a possible death sentence. ""He dared commit such hideous crimes as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership,"" he said. The spokesman denied that Mr Bae was ""not tried in a transparent matter and [the North] was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip."" Mr Bae, 44, was arrested in November as he entered Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. South Korea activists believe he was arrested for taking pictures of starving children. Other reports have described him as a devout Christian. His conviction on 30 April came amid high tension between the US and North Korea, after Pyongyang's third nuclear test. The UN expanded sanctions against the communist state in March, in the wake of its 12 February nuclear test and December long-range rocket launch. Pyongyang reacted angrily both to the measures and the annual US-South Korea military exercises, threatening to attack US military bases and cutting key hotlines with its southern neighbour.",1,27
"Media playback is not supported on this device The wing, 34, scored in the last move of Wales' 24-18 defeat by Australia in Cardiff and was later in tears during a televised interview. Gatland said that the last-gasp try ""was fantastic for him [Williams]."" The New Zealander also says Wales' fans can look forward with excitement to the 2012 Six Nations and beyond. ""You've got to be excited about the Six Nations. I thought it was a really good game of rugby,"" said Gatland. ""And I thought we played some great rugby in that first half against one of the best defences in world rugby. Media playback is not supported on this device ""They had the best defence at the World Cup - they were hard to break down. ""We scored a couple of cracking tries and you've got to be excited about the youth in this team. ""Jamie Roberts, now that Shane Williams is gone, is the oldest in that backline at 25 years of age. ""There's a good young loose-forward trio, some second-rows are still very young so we've got to be really excited about not just the up-coming Six Nations, but the next cycle and looking forward to building up to 2015."" Gatland felt that Leigh Halfpenny's 50th-minute sin-binning was ""unlucky"" and that Australia fully exploited Wales' disadvantage while the full-back was absent. ""I felt sorry for Leigh because with the angle he came from and the way the ball bounced he thought it had gone in to [Australia fly-half James] O'Connor's hands and he has not been able to see the ball, but he thought he had the ball at the time,"" Gatland said. ""The referee has a different angle and we accept that decision, but unfortunately we conceded 21 points in that period and that's the game.

He [Shane Williams] is a once-in-a-generation player Gatland said: ""The game didn't go fantastic for him outside of that [try], but it was a fitting end for someone who's had a fantastic career.

"An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago. But the compound ""was not on our radar"" since then, the official said. The government of Pakistan has categorically denied any knowledge of the raid before it took place. No base within Pakistan was used by US forces, the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement. It went on: ""US helicopters entered Pakistani airspace making use of blind spots in the radar coverage due to hilly terrain."" However, the ministry defended the ISI, saying: ""As far as the target compound is concerned, ISI had been sharing information with CIA and other friendly intelligence agencies since 2009."" Bin Laden, 54, was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda. He is believed to have ordered the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, as well as a number of other deadly bombings. The ISI official gave new details of the raid, saying Bin Laden's young daughter had said she saw her father shot. He told the BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones in Islamabad that the compound in Abbottabad, just 100km (62 miles) from the capital, was raided when under construction in 2003. It was believed an al-Qaeda operative, Abu Faraj al-Libi, was there. But since then, ""the compound was not on our radar, it is an embarrassment for the ISI,"" the official said. ""We're good, but we're not God."" He added: ""This one failure should not make us look totally incompetent. Look at our track record. For the last 10 years, we have captured Taliban and al-Qaeda in their hundreds - more than any other countries put together."" The compound is about a kilometre from the Pakistan Military Academy - the country's equivalent of West Point or Sandhurst. The ISI official also gave new or differing accounts of some of the events of Sunday's raid. They included: The official said it was thought the Americans wanted to take away the surviving women and children but had to abandon the plan when one of the helicopters malfunctioned. By Owen Bennett-JonesBBC News, Islamabad Clearly there were people helping Bin Laden in this location.... were they state employees, were they simply from Taliban-related groups, were they from the intelligence agencies? For all Americans may ask the questions, I doubt they will get any answers. There will be ambiguity about this and the Pakistanis will deny they had any knowledge whatsoever. The establishment here is made up of army leadership, intelligence agency leadership and some senior civil servants, and they have always run Pakistan, whether democratic governments or military governments, and those people do have connections with jihadis. The difficulty the West has is in appreciating there are more than 20 different types of jihadi organisations, and al-Qaeda is just one of them. The state has different policies towards different types of group and that subtlety is often lost on Western policy-makers. The helicopter was destroyed by the special forces unit. The US has not commented on anyone it captured or had planned to capture, other than saying it had taken Bin Laden's body. The ISI official said the organisation had recovered some documents from the compound. The CIA is already said to be going through a large number of hard drives and storage devices seized in the raid. The White House has not disclosed whether anyone has claimed the 25m (PS15m) reward for leading the US to Bin Laden. White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan said there had been concern Pakistani forces would deploy to counter the US Navy Seal team conducting the raid but it had avoided any confrontation. The ISI official said: ""We were totally caught by surprise. They were in and out before we could react."" Our correspondent says residents near the compound in Abbottabad reported that Pakistani soldiers had asked them to switch off their lights an hour before the attack, but the ISI official said this was not true and that it had no advance knowledge of the raid. Earlier, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, President Asif Ali Zardari admitted Bin Laden ""was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be."" But he denied the killing suggested Pakistan was failing in its efforts to tackle terrorism. Mr Zardari said Pakistan had ""never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media."" ""Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact,"" he said. ""Pakistan had as much reason to despise al-Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan's war as it is America's."" Mr Brennan had said it was ""inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system"" in Pakistan. He estimated Bin Laden had been living in the compound in Abbottabad for five or six years. Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir tried to draw a line under the matter, saying: ""Who did what is beside the point.... This issue of Osama Bin Laden is history."" Bin Laden was America's most wanted man but had eluded capture for more than a decade. US officials say that after DNA tests they are ""99.9"" sure that the man they shot and killed and later buried at sea was Bin Laden. US President Barack Obama watched the entire operation in real time in the White House with his national security team. Mr Brennan said: ""The minutes passed like days."" CIA director Leon Panetta narrated via a video screen from a separate Washington office, with Bin Laden given the code name Geronimo. Mr Panetta's narration lasted several minutes. ""They've reached the target.... We have a visual on Geronimo.... Geronimo EKIA (enemy killed in action)."" Mr Obama said: ""We got him."" Bin Laden, his son Khalid, trusted personal courier Sheikh Abu Ahmed and the courier's brother were all killed, along with an unidentified woman. Bin Laden was shot above his left eye, blowing away a section of his skull, and was also shot in the chest. The BBC's Andrew North in Washington says the White House is still discussing whether to release a video that was made of Bin Laden's burial from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, which some Islamic scholars have said did not conform with tradition. Our correspondent says many people will want proof that Bin Laden is dead but the White House will be concerned about the reaction if the video, and still photographs of the body, are released.",1,32
"Ethan McKen, 24, was at the Black Sea resort of Sunny Beach, near Burgas, when he and a friend were hit by a wave, earlier on Saturday. Mr McKen was unable to get back to shore and his friends were unable to reach him, a family member said. Travel agent Thomas Cook is working with local authorities to find him. The UK Foreign Office has been made aware of the incident. Its spokesman said it was providing consular assistance to the family of a British man. A spokesman from Club 18-30, which is owned by Thomas Cook, confirmed one of its customers staying at its Sunny Beach resort went missing earlier on Saturday. A second person is safe and recovering in a local medical centre. He said: ""We are liaising closely with the British Embassy and the local authorities as the search effort continues, and can confirm that the local police are stopping anyone entering the water at present while this continues. ""Club 18-30's parent company Thomas Cook is liaising closely with the missing person's family in the UK, and are arranging for relatives to travel to Bulgaria at the first available opportunity.""",1,33
"Actresses including Meryl Streep, Sally Field, Sandra Bullock and Cameron Diaz saluted the 76-year-old Oscar-winner at Thursday's event in Hollywood. ""I'm so happy to add another woman's name to the list,"" she said. Fonda's brother, Easy Rider star Peter Fonda, said ""Jane, I've never been prouder of you, and I know Dad is too."" Their late father, actor Henry Fonda, was an Oscar-winner aged 76 for the 1981 film On Golden Pond and received the AFI award in 1978. Presenting the honour to Jane Fonda, actor Michael Douglas said: ""Jane, you are true film royalty, not through birth, but through your talent."" Fonda, nominated for seven Academy awards, has won two Oscars for 1971's Klute and 1978's Coming Home. Fellow Oscar-winner Meryl Streep, who made her film debut opposite Fonda in 1977's Julia, said of her initial meeting with the star: ""She had an almost feral alertness, like this bright blue attentiveness to everything around her. Sally Field added: ""She brought this new kind of raw sexuality, of gritty innocent honesty, vulnerable to the core - and I had never seen anything like it."" There were moments of lightness during the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, as actor Jeff Daniels, one of Fonda co-stars in the HBO series The Newsroom, sang a tribute to the actress, offering lyrics about her ""abs, buns and thighs"" as one of her exercise videos played on a screen behind him. And comic actress Wanda Sykes took the stage dress in a silver parody of the outfit worn by Fonda in her 1968 film Barbarella, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim. As she accepted the award, Fonda offered some advice on career longevity for the roomful of celebrities gathered: ""Ask questions, stay curious. It's much more important to be interested than to be interesting.""",1,34
"Liverpool-bound striker Dominic Solanke picked up Lewis Cook's pass to score the winner shortly after the interval. England played the last 17 minutes with 10 men after Josh Onomah was sent off. Freddie Woodman was required to make key saves late on as Paul Simpson's side held on to reach the semi-finals for the first time in 24 years. Italy beat Zambia 3-2 after extra time and will face England in Jeonju on Thursday. The other semi-final sees Uruguay take on Venezuela. After a goalless first half, Bournemouth midfielder Cook split the Mexico defence with an exquisite ball from deep that Solanke, who will join Liverpool from Chelsea next month, ran on to before firing past Abraham Romero. England also saw a goal-bound deflection cleared off the line and Onomah hit the post before the Tottenham midfielder was dismissed in contentious circumstances. The 20-year-old appeared to make accidental contact with Juan Aguayo as he ran past his marker but was shown a second yellow card that rules him out of the Italy game. England Under-20s last reached the final four of this competition in 1993, when a squad featuring Nicky Butt and Nick Barmby lost to Ghana in the semis before beating Australia to finish in third place. BBC sports editor Dan Roan These are encouraging times for English youth football. Last season, the Under-21s won the Toulon tournament for the first time in 22 years. Last month the Under-17s reached the final of the European Championships. The U20s have now done something no England team has managed since 1993. In fact, England failed to qualify for five of the last 11 Under-20 World Cups, and did not win a game in the other six. The FA believes this current success is testament to the continuity and technical support representative teams receive at the National Football Centre at St George's Park, and improved trust with clubs over the release of young players. But with the top clubs awash with TV money and increasingly able to buy proven foreign talent, the concern will be that the path to first-team football for home-grown youngsters is harder than ever.",1,35
"The hosts saw left-back Alex Telles dismissed after two bookings in a 74-second spell, the second after a wild sliding tackle on Stephan Lichtsteiner on 27 minutes. His side spent long spells in their own half and survived a Paulo Dybala strike against the post before the interval. But Juve - who had 77 possession - broke through when Pjaca drove low into the net five minutes after coming on and Alves finished from six yards 80 seconds after his own introduction. The goals ensured Juve's fourth successive 2-0 win on the road in all competitions and their advantage now looks huge ahead of the return on 14 March. Other than a penalty shootout defeat to Inter Milan in December, the last time the Old Lady lost on home soil was in August 2015. In Porto the Italian side were bettering possession when Telles lost control, first fouling Juan Cuadrado before hacking Lichtsteiner down with no apparent danger. The left-back was clearly emotional as he walked to the tunnel with his shirt covering much of his face. It allowed Juve to totally dominate, though Nuno Espirito Santo's side improved after the break and looked like they may hold out, deploying a compact 4-4-1 formation to stifle the Serie A leaders. But with the game in its final quarter, Pjaca benefited from a ricochet off Miguel Layun - who came on at left-back after Telles' dismissal - to slam his first goal since joining the club in July past Iker Casillas. Alves chested down Alex Sandro's delivery and hooked in on 74 minutes to tighten Juve's grip. Massimiliano Allegri's side hold a seven-point lead at the summit of Italy's top tier and remain undefeated in the Champions League, increasing their hopes of a first win in the competition since 1996. Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira: ""I think we can be happy tonight. It's a really good result. After the red card we had to win this game. We played 90 minutes with control and patience. ""We are happy for tonight but in three weeks we have to be very careful for the game because now they are angry. We know football is crazy, anything can happen. ""Sometimes you have a feeling and this year I have a really good feeling."" Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri: ""This team still has plenty of room for improvement but the lads showed great maturity tonight. ""We're entering a crucial period of the season and we need to approach it with enthusiasm, determination and be as clinical as possible. ""But we can't believe 2-0 is enough to see us through.

"William Johnston, of Walsham-le-Willows, Suffolk, admitted dumping the rubbish, described as building material and household waste, last April. Suffolk Police said it was a ""potential danger to motorists and other members of the public."" The 44-year-old admitted the whole episode was ""hugely embarrassing"" and ""regrettable"" as he left court. He dumped the rubbish, described as building material and household waste, at the side of Finningham Road on 9 April last year. Updates on this story and others from Suffolk Police officers and the Environment Agency removed the waste, which they believe was unloaded using a tractor and trailer. Johnston was fined PS1000 plus costs of PS1600 after pleading guilty to fly-tipping at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates Court. In a statement, he said the rubbish had been unlawfully dumped on his own land before he moved it, and he later paid PS4,000 for it to be cleared up from the side of the road. Jonathan Reed, prosecuting on behalf of Mid Suffolk District Council said he was pleased the court had recognised the ""severity of the offences as well as the dangers to users of the highway.""",1,37
"Voters here have yet to make their choice in the regional election. But already there's something of the victory march in the chancellor's step. It has been years since her party won here in Germany's most populous state. Sunday's vote in North Rhine-Westphalia is the last ahead of the general election in September. And it is viewed as a bellwether. This is Social Democrat country. The centre-left SPD currently rules in coalition with the Greens but polls suggest that could be about to change. In recent weeks Mrs Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) have been closing in and support for the SPD has dwindled. The rivals are now neck-and-neck in the polls. It is not often that a German regional election is considered so important. Martin Schulz, the charismatic SPD leader, has thrown down the gauntlet. If his party wins here, he declared recently, he will be the next German chancellor. It is a statement he may live to regret. When Mr Schulz, ex-president of the European Parliament, returned to domestic politics there was an immediate surge of support in the polls for his party. The CDU looked on nervously as commentators noted for the first time in years that Mrs Merkel was no longer unchallenged in her bid for a fourth term in the chancellery. But since then the Social Democrats have suffered two humiliating electoral defeats at the hands of Mrs Merkel's conservatives, in regional votes in Saarland and, last Sunday, in Schleswig-Holstein. The party has slipped in the national polls and, even here in the SPD heartland, the so called Schulz effect appears to have dwindled. ""His approval ratings will only stabilise once he says very clearly what he wants to do,"" says Brilon's SPD mayor, Christoph Bartsch. ""In the eyes of the voters that hasn't happened yet. We need a clear programme and clear policies on topics which matter to the electorate."" Here the issues that matter include internal security and the economy. On security, the CDU's candidate for North Rhine-Westphalia has promised to make the state the envy of other German regions. There is a powerful industrial lobby here. On the edge of town, under a chimney smoking into the clouds, huge lorries deliver logs to the sawmill. Martin Ansorge, finance officer at Egger wood processing, tells me that Germany's next chancellor will need the support of what Germans call the Mittelstand - medium-sized family firms. ""We need to cut bureaucracy, we need a modern education system, we need support for businesses in the digital future, and we need a better infrastructure in this region,"" he says. Mr Ansorge will not discuss his preferred choice of party or candidate, and Germany as a whole has four months left to make up its mind. In Brilon's market square, among the flower stalls and vans selling fish rolls, one enterprising pub was advertising ""Schnitzel Angela Merkel"" in honour of the chancellor's visit to the town. Few of the diners seemed tempted, and the cost of EUR19.54 (PS16.50, 21) - presumably chosen to reflect Mrs Merkel's birth year - was perhaps a little steep. ""I think she really will be chancellor again,"" said one stallholder. ""She's very self-assured, reliable and calm. And she's a woman - I like that."" An elderly man nearby wasn't convinced. ""She promised too much and invited too many people without asking us. She wasn't thinking properly and too many bad people came to the country."" Later, the rally finished, Angela Merkel posed for pictures with the band. She laughed as she refused to take the baton from the conductor. But make no mistake, this woman wants German voters to continue dancing to her tune. Unless Martin Schulz finds a way of reversing his fortunes, they may well do so.",1,38
"Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment ""problem solved."" It was shared in 2014, before she became Bradford West MP. The Board of Deputies said the post, highlighted by the Guido Fawkes political website, was ""appalling."" The graphic said relocating Israel would be a ""solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict,"" and that it would allow Palestinians to ""get their life and their land back."" In a statement, Ms Shah said: ""This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused."" Labour confirmed she had stepped down as Parliamentary Private Secretary - an unpaid backbench assistant - to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. In a second statement, the MP said: ""I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict. ""But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise."" She said she would be expanding her ""existing engagement and dialogue with Jewish community organisations and will be stepping up my efforts to combat all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were ""simply appalling,"" calling for an urgent meeting ""for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community.""",1,39
"Chasing 268 in the first Test, Australia were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia - the world's top-ranked Test side - had a first-innings lead of 86. But Kusal Mendis' superb 176 - his first Test century - and 5-54 from Rangana Herath proved decisive. Australia captain Steve Smith made a gritty 55 before tail-enders Steve O'Keefe and Peter Nevill resisted for 178 balls, scoring four. The second Test of the three-match series takes place in Galle, starting on Thursday, 4 August. O'Keefe and Nevill's ninth-wicket stand came at just 0.13 runs an over, before debutant Dhananjaya de Silva had Nevill caught behind. The previous record for a partnership lasting 100 balls or more was 0.64 by South Africa's Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers against India last December. Australia survived just 15 further deliveries before Herath claimed his ninth wicket of the match to secure Sri Lanka's first win over the Baggy Greens since 1999, and second in 27 attempts.",1,40
"The Slovenian club has knocked Hibernian, Rangers and Celtic out of Europe in recent seasons. Yet McInnes is adamant that his players are not fearful of the quality of the opposition or their record. ""We're not daunted by it,"" McInnes said. ""We're confident in our ability to get the right result."" Aberdeen's manager has told fans to expect an assertive first-leg display on Thursday and urged them to back the team. ""We've learned over the last few seasons to deal with European football,"" McInnes continued. ""I like the technical and tactical part of it. Our supporters should expect to see a confident Aberdeen team. ""They are favourites, we're the underdogs, but we were underdogs against Riejka [last season], we were underdogs against Groningen [in 2014]. ""They'll take confidence from their recent history, and not just against Scottish teams. ""We want to represent ourselves first and foremost, get the reputation of our club at the forefront of people's minds, and help Scottish football at the same time. ""Those first two rounds always have trepidation about them, because players aren't fully up to speed, they're playing against teams that are relatively unknown and there's pressure in that. ""We've now come out the other side of those ties and we're now the underdogs going into this game. I'm happy to deal with the favourites tag and happy to deal with the underdogs tag."" McInnes warns that Maribor will be accomplished and dangerous opponents in the first leg of the third qualifying round tie on Thursday at Pittodrie. He will send his side out in search of a victory, but also with the awareness that the contest can be won in Slovenia on away goals, so keeping a clean sheet is important. ""What was telling from [Maribor's win over Levski Sofia in the last round] was their maturity and calmness, even when they went behind they kept playing their game,"" McInnes said. ""That comes from playing European football and they look like a team confident within their shape. They've got a way of playing, very well organised, and the refusal to panic when they went behind has got them through into this tie. ""They play 4-4-1-1, they can play a bit deeper and they counter-attack quickly. We need to be aware of that and recognise the areas where we want to play and look after the ball, especially against a team that is quick to get forward. ""We want to win the game at home, [but] it's important we still have a result going over to Maribor. ""Ideally we want to impose ourselves and get that balance between attacking and defending right, but we don't want to be giving ourselves a mountain to climb by losing goals at Pittodrie.""",1,41
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the figure was up from 7.6 in the year to February. Separate figures showed the amount of money borrowed for home loans in March was the highest for nearly nine years. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said PS13.8bn was lent during the month, 59 more than in February. The figure was the highest for any month since August 2007. Landlords and buyers of second homes have had to pay an extra 3 in stamp duty since the start of April. ""While the increases are substantial, these supercharged levels of activity are likely to be temporary, and will fall back over the summer months,"" said Paul Smee, the director general of the CML. Landlords borrowed PS7.1bn in March, an 87 increase on February. The ONS figures show that UK house prices have increased five times faster than wages since 2011, according to the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns to improve living standards. Its analysis of the ONS data shows that house prices have increased by 36 over the past five years. Average weekly earnings have gone up by just 7 over the same period, it said. The think-tank said the growth gap between wages and house prices was even more pronounced in London and the South East. But even in Scotland and the North, house prices have risen at twice the rate of wages. However the ONS data shows that prices in Scotland fell by 6.1 in the year to March 2016. Recent surveys by both the Halifax and Nationwide have suggested that house price growth has already cooled since the stamp duty changes came into effect. The ONS said house price growth in March was particularly driven by London, where the cost of a house or flat rose by 13 over the year. In its last survey using the current methodology, the ONS said the average cost of a home in the UK reached PS292,000 in March.",1,42
"Scripps' channels include the Food Network and Travel Channel. The two companies are estimated to have 20 of ad-supported TV viewership in the US The two said the deal would enable them to compete better with online options. Firms such as Amazon and Netflix are increasing competition in the sector. Discovery and Scripps are also grappling with changing models of distribution, as cable companies respond to falling subscriber numbers with their own online platforms and less expensive packages with fewer channels. ""We believe that by coming together with Scripps, we will create a stronger, more flexible and more dynamic media company with a global content engine that can be fully optimised and monetised across our combined networks, products and services in every country around the world,"" said Discovery chief executive David Zaslav. The offer values Scripps stock at 90 per share, 34 higher than the price when reports of the deal first circulated earlier this month. The 14.6bn deal includes Discovery's assumption of 2.7bn in Scripps debt. The companies said they expect to make 350m in savings through the combination, which is subject to regulatory review. The deal is expected to be completed by early 2018. Discovery's channels also include Science, TurboVelocity and Eurosport. The company, which has its headquarters near Washington, DC, employed about 7,000 people at the end of 2016. Scripps, based in Tennessee, owns international ventures such as UKTV, a commercial joint venture with BBC Worldwide and TVN, a premiere multi-platform provider of entertainment, lifestyle and news content in Poland. Reports of a possible merger started circulating earlier this month, pushing up share values of both companies. Scripps shares held steady after the firms announced the deal on Monday, rising 0.7 in opening trade. Shares of Discovery, which also reported quarterly earnings, fell nearly 7. Analysts at research firm Moffett Nathanson said the deal could lead to some benefits, but was unlikely to change the long-term challenges faced by the two firms. ""While there will likely be ample cost synergies, international revenue opportunities and improved relative scale, we don't think this merger will fundamentally alter the long-term prospects of these companies.""",1,43
"Mr Osborne cited ""tentative signs of a balanced, broad based and sustainable recovery,"" but stressed it was still the ""early stages"" and ""plenty of risks"" remained. Mr Osborne said that recent months - which have seen more upbeat reports on the economy - had ""decisively ended"" questions about his economic policy. Labour has dismissed the comments. The speech comes ahead of the Conservative Party conference later this month, and after a number of forecasts and surveys pointed to an acceleration in the UK's economic recovery. Revised gross domestic product figures showed the UK economy grew by 0.7 in the second quarter of the year, with predictions it could reach 1 for the third quarter. And last week the OECD economic agency sharply increased its growth forecast for the UK economy this year to 1.5 from an earlier estimate of 0.8. By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor The Conservatives' fear is that in future voters may not accept that current policies need to be maintained Economic arguments have just begun Mr Osborne said: ""The economic collapse was even worse than we thought. Repairing it will take even longer than we hoped. ""But we held our nerve when many told us to abandon our plan. And as a result, thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of the British people, Britain is turning a corner. ""Of course, many risks remain. These are still the early stages of recovery. But we mustn't go back to square one. We mustn't lose what the British people have achieved. ""This is a hard, difficult road we have been following. But it is the only way to deliver a sustained, lasting improvement in the living standards of the British people."" The government's ""economic plan is the right response to Britain's macroeconomic imbalances and the evidence shows that it is working,"" he said, in his address to an audience of academics, think tanks and businesses. Mr Osborne said that those who advocated an alternative economic path could not explain recent improvements in the economic data. And ""the last few months have decisively ended"" the idea that the scale and pace of his measures were to blame for much slower than projected growth over recent years, he added. ""Those in favour of a Plan B have lost the argument,"" he said. Heeding calls to abandon the government's economic plan in order to spend and borrow more would have undermined the recovery and ""would be disastrous"" now, Mr Osborne said. He pledged to remain ""vigilant"" to threats from abroad - including growing instability in the Middle East pushing up the oil price and a fresh eurozone crisis - as well as at home. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group CBI, said the economy was gathering some momentum, business confidence was rising and he expected growth to continue into next year. ""We have always said that deficit reduction should be at the top of the government's'to-do list', but it must be coupled with an unrelenting focus on growth-boosting measures like infrastructure projects,"" he said. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor And he dismissed claims he was encouraging ""the wrong sort of growth"" - led by debt-fuelled consumer spending - insisting the evidence suggested ""tentative signs of a balanced, broad based and sustainable recovery."" He said there were many tough decisions still to be taken and that ""the only sustainable path to prosperity is to reject the old quick fixes and stick to the course we have set."" Labour accused Mr Osborne of ""extraordinary complacency."" Opposition leader Ed Miliband told the BBC that the chancellor was ""saying to people that he has saved the British economy at a time when, for ordinary families, life is getting worse."" ""If ever you wanted proof that the government is out of touch with most people, that it is on the side of the few, George Osborne has provided it today,"" he added.",1,44
"Authors including The English Patient writer Michael Ondaatje and Peter Carey will not attend the PEN Literary Gala in New York on 5 May.

Twelve people were killed during the attack, over the magazine's depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. Authors Rachel Kushner, Teju Cole, Taiye Selasi and Francine Prose are also against PEN handing the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo, as they are uncomfortable with the magazine's ""cultural intolerance."" Booker Prize-wining author Carey told the New York Times that the group of writers felt PEN's role was to protect freedom of expression against government oppression. ""A hideous crime was committed, but was it a freedom of speech issue for PEN America to be self-righteous about?"" said Carey. ""All this is complicated by PEN's seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population."" The boycott has been criticised by the author Salman Rushdie, a former president of PEN who was in hiding for years over Islamist threats in response to his novel The Satanic Verses. He said his friends were ""horribly wrong"" and he hoped nobody ever came after them. Charlie Hebdo essayist Jean-Baptiste Thoret, who escaped the attack by arriving late to work, will accept the award on behalf of his colleagues. PEN said it did not believe Charlie Hebdo's intent was to ""ostracise or insult Muslims, but rather to reject forcefully the efforts of a small minority of radical extremists to place broad categories of speech off limits.""

"The 35-year-old schoolteacher told the court that her digestive system sometimes converts food into alcohol. After her arrest, her doctor conducted tests that found that high levels of yeast in her intestines ferment high-carbohydrate foods. Prosecutors are seeking to have the charges against the woman reinstated. ""She can register a blood alcohol content that would have you or I falling down drunk, but she can function,"" her lawyer Joseph Marusak told the Buffalo News. Mr Marusak declined to name his client, citing medical confidentiality laws. The woman was arrested near Buffalo in October 2014 after police said she was driving erratically. A Breathalyzer test showed that her blood-alcohol level more than four times the legal limit. The arresting officer said she failed several field sobriety tests. Medical and legal experts say the condition, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is being raised more frequently as a defence in drink-driving cases. ""At first glance, it seems like a get-out-of-jail-free card,"" Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told the Associated Press. ""But it's not that easy. Courts tend to be sceptical of such claims. You have to be able to document the syndrome through recognized testing.""",1,46
"The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants ""public good"" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like pharmaceuticals - taking potential benefits into account. A new UK regulator similar to NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) should be set up, it says. The UK is a world leader in plant biotechnology research, but GM field trial applications have fallen from 37 in 1995 to just one in 2012. By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The controversy over genetically modifying plants is riddled with contradictions. Take the European Union. Its internal politics have caused a logjam in approvals but the EU science budget is also funding some of Britain's research. Europe grows very few GM plants but most of its imported animal feed is genetically modified. It was America's agricultural giants whose hard sell of GM put off so many European consumers but it is also US science that provides the evidence, gathered over the past two decades, that supports the assurance that GM plants and food are safe. And while Britain's leading plant scientists appeal to the prime minister to help foster this new technology, its leading supermarket chains avoid stocking GM products because no-one is asking for them. So can anything shift? The key is whether ministers can change minds in Brussels - and that's no easy task given the hostility towards GM in big players like France and Germany. A long haul lies ahead. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has spoken in favour of increasing UK research into GM, which he said offers the ""most wonderful opportunities to improve human health."" The CST was asked by Prime Minister David Cameron for the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of GM technologies in agriculture, and for advice on UK and EU regulation. In turn, it commissioned a group of leading plant scientists from Rothamsted Research, The Sainsbury Laboratory and Cambridge University to make recommendations to the prime minister. The scientists say they are being held back by strict EU regulations - based on the principle that GM crops are inherently more dangerous than conventionally-bred varieties. Only two GM varieties have been licensed for commercial harvest in Europe - despite the fact that 12 of the world's arable land is cultivating GM crops. The CST report argues GM crops have now been shown to be safe - and may be necessary in future for Britain to grow its own food supply, rather than depending on imports. It says the UK should regulate commercial GM varieties of wheat and potatoes based on their individual benefits and risks - rather than follow the EU's blanket approach. It also recommends a new programme of publicly-funded field trials to test ""public good"" GM crop varieties, which it calls ""PubGM."" ""Public good"" traits could include nutritional enhancement, such as antioxidants in tomatoes, or vitamin A in ""Golden Rice."" They could also include ""climate-proofing"" properties such as drought resistance or heat resistance. ""With PubGM, seed companies, consumers and regulators will be able to decide, based on results of experiments, whether a GM trait has proved its worth in UK crops under UK conditions,"" said Professor Jonathan Jones from The Sainsbury Laboratory, one of the report's authors. Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser and CST co-chair, said: ""We take it for granted that because our shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there are no problems in food security. But there are. ""We're part of a global food market. Competition is likely to increase. The world is already malnourished and the population is growing. ""The challenge is to get more yield from the same area. GM is not a magic bullet, but it is one of a range of technologies that we should consider."" The report was welcomed by Dr Julian Little, chair of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council (ABC), which represents companies including BASF, Monsanto and Syngenta. ""Current EU regulation has moved in the direction of increasing political influence and undermining science. ""Europe risks being left behind and it therefore remains essential that action is taken to address the dysfunctional EU approvals process so that UK farmers may, in the future, be able to realise the potential of great British biotechnology research right here in the UK."" But the environmental group Friends of the Earth say GM will not make food more affordable or sustainable. ""GM crops have been hugely over-hyped. Despite decades of research they have failed to deliver the benefits they have promised - and have been an expensive distraction from real solutions to the challenges we face,"" said senior food campaigner Vicki Hird. ""Our food production system needs a radical overhaul to ensure everyone has access to healthy, affordable food that doesn't wreck the planet - but putting more power into the hands of multi-nationals is not the answer."" Prof Cathie Martin, of the John Innes Centre, one of the creators of GM purple tomatoes, said changing regulations would help scientists make progress with GM varieties that benefit society. She told BBC News: ""It takes 10 years to get European regulators to approve a new GM trial, and costs in the order of 150m. How can any small company do that?"" ""NGOs complain that GM only benefits multinational companies - but that's because they're the only ones who can afford it. We can't afford to trial crops for the public good. ""If this promotes field trials where you can look at something for the public good that would be fantastic."" Dan Crossley, executive director of the Food Ethics Council, said: ""This report, like many focussing on GM technology, is framed around the question'how can science and technology help secure global food supplies'. ""Instead we need to ask people at the sharp end of food insecurity what can be done - by scientists and also by others - to help fix the food system. ""In a resource-constrained world where a billion people go to bed hungry and a billion are obese, we must also tackle the scandal of food waste, as well as the issue of what we eat.""",1,47
"Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed performance on memory tests also improved. Exercise may buffer against dementia as well as age-related memory loss. The latest work looked at healthy people in their 60s rather than people with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. But the findings have important implications for ageing societies faced with a dementia time bomb. In the UK, 820,000 people have dementia, and this figure is set to double by 2030. Until a cure is discovered, finding cheap and simple ways to reverse this trend is imperative, say experts. Professor Kirk Erickson and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh in the US set out to investigate the impact that even moderate exercise might have on preserving memory. They split their 120 volunteers into two groups. One group was asked to begin an exercise regimen of walking around a track for 40 minutes a day, three days a week, while the others were limited to doing simple stretching and toning exercises. Brain scans and memory tests were performed at the start of the study, halfway through the study and again at the end. Scans revealed hippocampus volume increased by around 2 in people who did regular aerobic exercise. The same region of the brain decreased in volume by 1.4 in those who did stretching exercises, consistent with the decrease seen in normal ageing. Both groups showed some improvement over time on memory tests. In the walking group, the improvement appeared to be linked with increased size of the hippocampus. Professor Erickson said: ""We think of the atrophy of the hippocampus in later life as almost inevitable. But we've shown that even moderate exercise for one year can increase the size of that structure. ""The brain at that stage remains modifiable."" Dr Simon Ridley of the Alzheimer's Research Trust said that although the study does not look at memory loss in Alzheimer's or dementia, it suggests ""it's never too late to start exercising to help keep our brains healthy."" ""Even modest exercise may improve memory and help protect the brain from normal decline caused by ageing. ""Increasing evidence suggests regular exercise and a healthy diet may help reduce our risk of developing dementia as well as reaping numerous other benefits from living a healthy lifestyle.""",1,48
"Joe Storey, 27, had denied murdering Kerri McAuley, 32, who was found dead at Southalls Way, Norwich, on 8 January, but admitted manslaughter. Storey was high on cocaine when he punched mother-of-two Ms McAuley after a row about an ex-girlfriend. The jury at Norwich Crown Court took less than an hour to find Storey guilty. He will be sentenced on Friday. The court had heard friends describe a history of domestic violence which left Ms McAuley ""disfigured"" and fearing for her life. In her texts Ms McAuley described Mr Storey's behaviour as ""not normal."" She wrote: ""you are not ready to care for anyone but yourself."" ""You were trying to kill me, you were suffocating me until I nearly passed out,"" adding that if he stays away ""hopefully you won't go to prison for beating me to a pulp."" Later Mr Storey and Ms McAuley agreed to meet up again. Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift said in the fatal attack Ms McAuley sustained multiple facial lacerations and one of her ears was torn. Dr Swift said some of the injuries were caused by ""blunt force impact."" Storey, of Murrells Court, Norwich, had admitted the pair had a turbulent relationship. He said he was staying at Ms McAuley's home when she confronted him about his ex-girlfriend who she thought was back in contact with him. Storey said he struck her five or six times and had a phone in his hand at the time but insisted he had ""not to hit her with it."" Prosecutor Simon Spence said Storey behaved like an animal and if ""he'd had a scrap of humanity"" Storey would have called an ambulance after the attack instead of leaving Ms McAuley to die in the flat.",1,49
"A man entered the store on Balmoral Place between 07:30 and 07:45, threatened a 33-year-old member of staff with a weapon and attacked him. The suspect fled with a four-figure sum of cash, cigarettes and the wallet and mobile of a 61-year-old customer who came into the shop and intervened. Police described it as a ""shocking"" and ""vicious"" attack. The suspect was described as white, in his early 20s, wearing black trousers, a black top, light pink trainers and a black scarf covering his face. He was also carrying a black backpack which may have had pink markings on it. Det Con Andrew Hope said: ""This was a shocking attack. It was vicious and the member of staff sustained a serious head injury during the attack. ""He was taken by ambulance to the Borders General Hospital where he was treated and has since been released. ""The suspect had no thought for the staff member or the customer who thankfully was not injured in the incident. ""The Post Office is a busy place, as is Gala Park where the suspect made off towards, so I would appeal to anyone who saw the attack and who hasn't already spoken to police, or anyone who can assist officers with their inquiries to contact us.""",1,50
"The Nikkei 225 closed down 0.4 at 18,916.02, although the index had been as much as 1.6 in earlier trade. Shares in Toshiba fell 9.8 on reports it was expecting record losses for the year to March. After the market closed, Toshiba said it would cut 6,800 jobs at its consumer electronics division and report a record loss of 550bn yen (4.53bn). The news follows findings that Toshiba had overstated its operating profit for the past six years by a total of 151.8bn yen. The US dollar fell to 121.20 yen, compared with last week's rate of 123 yen after the US rate rise, and the stronger yen weighed on Japan's major exporters. Toyota shares closed down more than 1 and Honda ended down 0.7. A stronger yen makes the products Japan's big exporters make more expensive to buy overseas. Lower oil prices continued to weigh on energy-related shares. The price of Brent Crude fell to its lowest since 2004 in overnight trade to 36.17 a barrel, before recovering slightly to 36.49.

"A third person had been arrested in the raid in Verviers and weapons are reported to have been recovered. Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters police had targeted a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch attacks in a matter of hours. Suspects had opened fire on police, he said. There were also overnight searches in the Brussels area. Speaking after Thursday's raids in Verviers, Mr Van Der Sypt said: ""The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised."" After the raid, four Kalashnikovs, bomb-making equipment and police clothing were found, according to local media. Security forces remain in the Verviers area. Anti-terror raids also took place late on Thursday in Brussels and surrounding towns, including Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Anderlecht and Schaerbeek. Earlier on Thursday two suspected Islamists were arrested in the Brussels suburb of Zaventem, local media reported. Belgian officials say more than 300 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic militant groups in Syria and Iraq. Belgian journalist Mark Eeckhaut told the BBC the suspects in Verviers had wanted to attack a police station and cause a large number of casualties. The terror threat level in Belgium has been raised to three - the second highest, Mr Van Der Sypt said. Witnesses in Verviers reported hearing heavy gunfire for several minutes and at least three explosions. Witness Marylou Fletcher told the BBC: ""We were going back from shopping and saw the police cars. We thought there was an accident then we heard something blowing up. There were a lot of gunshots. ""My children cried. They are just terrified."" The area around the train station has been cordoned off and reports on social media say there is a heavy police presence in the town centre. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel later said the security operation ""shows the government's determination to fight those who want to spread terror,"" his spokesman said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said events in Belgium ""look like yet another indication of the huge risk we face from Islamist extremist terror in Europe."" ""We have to remain extremely vigilant, we have to take all the steps we can to beat this evil,"" he told reporters in Washington where he is to hold talks with President Barack Obama. Verviers is in the province of Liege, close to the German border, and has a population of about 56,000. The incident comes a week after attacks in neighbouring France that killed 17 people. Belgian media has reported that some of the weapons used in those attacks were bought in Brussels. Mr Van Der Sypt said no weapons link with the killings in France had been established. However there are fears that the suspects captured or killed in this operation could have been inspired by the killings in France to accelerate their own plans, the BBC's Chris Morris in Verviers says. The attacks in and around Paris - on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market and police - have heightened security fears in several European countries. In May last year, four people were killed inside the Jewish museum in Brussels. A Frenchman of Algerian descent is in custody in Belgium over the attack.",1,52
"The US has said the bombing, which took place in the Afghan city of Kunduz, was a mistake and it was attempting to strike the Taliban. MSF wants the bombing to be investigated as a war crime. Mr Obama has also apologised to the president of Afghanistan. ""If it is necessary to hold individuals accountable, that will be done,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Mr Obama ""expressed his condolences"" to MSF president Joanne Liu, said Mr Earnest. ""In the United States when we make mistakes, we're honest about it. We own up to it,"" he said. Mr Earnest also hinted at the possibility of paying victims and their families, a Department of Defense policy. He said he could not say legally whether the bombing was a war crime but the US ""goes to great lengths to limit the loss of life"" of civilians. In a statement, MSF said they received the apology but it was still demanding the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission (IHFFC) investigate. MSF has said it would not trust internal military inquiries into the bombing. The IHFFC was set up in 1991 under the Geneva Conventions. MSF says the co-ordinates of the hospital were well-known and its bombing could not have been a mistake. A number of inquiries have been ordered - by the US justice department, the Pentagon, Nato and an American-Afghan team.",1,53

"Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would ""seriously undermine"" Britain's ""deterrent."" And he said he would be worried if such a view ""translated into power."" Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to ""take action"" against Sir Nicholas over his comments. In a statement, the Labour leader said: ""It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute. ""It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times. ""By publicly taking sides in current political arguments, Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle. Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld."" Mr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the ""nuclear button"" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident. Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to ""promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world."" Asked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: ""It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were."" He added: ""The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use. ""When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter. ""If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, ""the deterrent is then completely undermined,"" he added. ""Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation,'I understand how this thing works'."" Attending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been ""unhelpful."" ""I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions,"" he told Channel 4 News. ""If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate."" Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an ""open-minded"" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident. She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary. But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: ""I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said."" She defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue. ""I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms,"" she said. She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet. ""I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works. ""I think I would find it difficult [to continue in the shadow cabinet] but we are not there yet. We have got a big process to go through,"" she said.",1,55
"The small objects were hidden by artist Luke Jerram for his installation Treasure City, with clues hidden in paintings at the 20-21 Arts Centre. The first one, a replica Viking brooch, was found in a wall in Kingsway Gardens, Scunthorpe, by Rachel Welch. Ms Welch, of Grimsby, said she looked around town on the off-chance she could find one without cracking the codes. The object was found hours after the treasure hunt began on Saturday. She said: ""We had a look at them, but we didn't really spend much time with them because we are no good at codes. ""We thought we'd go out and have a look round and see if we are able to find one and we did."" Bristol-based artist Mr Jerram said a Scoutmaster had cracked the code in the corresponding painting moments before, and arrived at the park to see it had already been claimed. This particular artwork used semaphore to spell out the clue ""in the gardens seven metres from the flag is the Kingsway xx (rest)."" The gold was hidden in a dry stone wall near a flag, given to the gardens as an environmental award. Each of the objects is worth more than PS1,000 and Ms Welch said she was going to sell it to pay for a holiday. The second object, a small 18 carat gold lamb, was found in a bandstand in Brigg on Sunday night by a teacher from Beverley. She solved one of the painting's codes to lead her to a place which was ""an octagonal place to listen."" Mr Jerram said the woman searched Scunthorpe for somewhere that fit that description and settled on the bandstand but when she got to the one in Scunthorpe there was nothing there. It was that night that she realised there was one in nearby Brigg and went down there with her husband at midnight to claim the gold. The third piece, a model of a Tudor fisherwoman, was found on Monday but the exact details of where are not yet known.",1,56
"Adam Wilson, of Lostock Hall, was found with serious injuries at a property on Albrighton Crescent in Lostock Hall near Preston in September. Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall denied murder but was found guilty after a trial by jury. At Preston Court, he was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years. Mr Wilson died as a result of catastrophic bleeding from a stab wound in his thigh, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Sophie Lorimer from the CPS North West said the ""brutal attack"" in front of his ex-partner was ""purely motivated by jealousy."" ""He could not accept that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over,"" she said. Taylor's girlfriend said he bombarded her with text messages and phone calls which ""progressively became more and more abusive."" ""The final text he sent to her stated he was giving her one last chance before things turned sour. ""Minutes later he violently broke into her house where Adam Wilson was also present."" Ms Lorimer said Taylor then stabbed Mr Wilson numerous times with a large knife which he had taken with him. Taylor carried out the ""frenzied"" knife attack ""fully aware"" there were two young children also present at the house, she said. He then fled and hid from police in a neighbouring garden, she added. Ms Lorimer said Taylor had shown ""no remorse"" throughout the case in which he claimed he was acting in self-defence. Det Ch Insp Neil Ashton of Lancashire Police said Taylor's actions were carried out ""in anger and jealousy."" He said: ""His actions were completely unprecedented and resulted in the needless and very sad loss of a young man's life.""",1,57
"""We save people here every day,"" said the 46-year-old policeman - managing to sound both proud and chiding and the same time. Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to the lifeguard unit that patrols the beach. At high tide on a recent Friday afternoon, thousands of mostly young Somalis were playing in the surf - a scene of cheerful relaxation that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago in a city notorious for its decades of anarchy, famine and violence. ""This place is bangin'! Beautiful!"" said an exuberant 21-year-old named Hassan Mohammed. Like many others at the shore, he was from the diaspora and spoke English in a broad London accent. ""Never been here before. Very nice country. I'm born and raised in Europe. I thought it would be like seeing the end of the world. But it's improved very much,"" he said. Several restaurants have opened up at Lido beach, their shaded tables packed with Mogadishu's wealthier elites. ""Octopus, sea turtle, lobster, shrimp - it's all over this place! Somalia is the most rich in seafood,"" said Lule Dhan, an Ethiopian who is executive chef at the Benadir Beach Restaurant. ""This fabulous city.... is not what the media portrays,"" he declared. ""Absolutely, I'm here to stay,"" said the restaurant's slightly less effusive co-owner, Abdi Resak Jamcale, who has returned to Somalia after two decades in California. ""I'm not making a profit but I'm breaking even. We need new laws to have more foreign investment here. For years people here never knew what's wrong and what's right - whoever has the gun [was in control]. But we're getting there, slowly,"" he said. Read Andrew's other reports from Somalia: 'Why I left al-Shabab' Getting round remittance bans In a country famous for its entrepreneurial culture, Lido beach's popularity has attracted a range of new business ventures - the most visible being the stalls renting out bright red life jackets to the many less confident swimmers. ""When the security improves, everything gets better. Before there was no work at the seaside, but now we're very proud to have this business,"" said Mariam Hassan Ali, 45, sitting beside an inflated inner tube that she also rents by the hour. But if Lido beach is a clear indication of the growing sense of optimism in Mogadishu, this is not a city in which one can, or should, drop one's guard for long. Later in the afternoon, the local district police chief arrived and demanded that we leave the beach immediately, hinting darkly that our film crew might be working on behalf of al-Shabab. To reinforce his point, he was brandishing a grenade with some enthusiasm. Further down the beach, Hassan Mohammed - the young visitor from London - also began sounding slightly less emphatic about the city's charms when I asked him if he had any concerns about security, and al-Shabab. ""No. No. You talk about that and they'll come to you! You don't talk about that - not even a little bit. I'm scared of that. This country's un-trustable, the people are un-trustable. They're just like you but then they've got this different mentality. ""There's only certain people that you can trust but that's cos they're your family. Do you know what they say here [about al-Shabab]? Arsenal or Chelsea! They don't even call them by their name. They say Arsenal or Chelsea. And if you hear that, run! Run! Don't even turn around.

"The 23-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, saved a penalty in normal time and one in a shoot-out when the Chairboys knocked Blackpool out of the EFL Trophy in January. And, with four minutes left on the clock in this game, Blackman saved Brad Potts' spot-kick to preserve a point. The first chance of the game fell to Adebayo Akinfenwa who drilled wide after 10 minutes. Midway through the first half a speculative effort from Potts grazed Blackman's crossbar. On the stroke of half-time Paris Cowan-Hall's low drive brought a smart save from visiting goalkeeper Dean Lyness. Shortly after the break a Potts effort was acrobatically clawed back from the goal-line by Blackman. Blackpool claimed the ball had crossed the line but their appeals fell on deaf ears.

"The cub will be the first giant panda to be born in Hong Kong. Earlier this year, 10-year-old Ying Ying mated naturally and was also artificially inseminated. However, the staff at Ocean Park are unsure which method has resulted in the successful pregnancy. Ying Ying was sent to mainland China's Sichuan province this spring to take part in a breeding programme. The 100kg female - described by the park as ""inquisitive, active and vigilant"" - attempted to mate naturally with two male pandas on five different occasions and one of the attempts was deemed successful. But to improve the chances of a viable pregnancy, Ying Ying was also artificially inseminated. Repeated ultrasound scans in late September confirmed she was carrying a foetus, Ocean Park officials said. Two panda maternity specialists have travelled to Hong Kong from Sichuan to provide pre- and post-natal support and the park's executive director of zoological operations Suzanne Gendron said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the birth. Panda reproduction is a notoriously difficult process, with females only ovulating once a year. It is common for giant pandas to re-absorb the foetus into the womb in the late stages of pregnancy. The gestation period is typically five months and one or two cubs are usually born.",1,60
"The 25-year-old claimed her maiden able-bodied national title on Sunday and won team gold with England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. But to qualify for Rio, Brown would have to switch from her favoured compound bow to the recurve, something she will ""absolutely not"" do. Media playback is not supported on this device ""I love shooting the compound and think I still have a lot to give,"" she added. ""Paralympic sport is my job and I have to go out there and perform well, so that's the main thing."" Brown's stance is backed by ArcheryGB Paralympic head coach Michael Peart, a former world number two in the compound who swapped to recurve in 2001 but was never able to reach the same heights before his retirement earlier this year. ""Going to recurve would be a major change and it would take many years of training to go from the top of one [discipline] to the top of another. I tried, and in 10 years I never got there,"" Peart, who narrowly missed out on selection for London 2012, told BBC Sport. ""I think she has to concentrate on trying to maintain this Paralympic success and build on that stockpile of gold medals."" Brown will not be able to add to the team title she won at the 2010 Commonwealths in Delhi at Glasgow 2014 after archery was left out of the programme. ""It's pretty tough knowing that archery isn't going to be in Glasgow because I had such a great time in India and it was one of my first major able-bodied events,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It's a big shame, but I think it's one of those cases where you have to focus on what you can do rather than what you can't."" Brown is preparing to compete in both the able-bodied World Championships in Antalya, Turkey (29 September-6 October) and Para-archery Worlds in Bangkok, Thailand (1-7 November). Long-term, though, her focus is on further success in 2016. ""I'm aiming for Rio and it should be amazing,"" she said. ""It'll be my third Paralympics and hopefully third gold medal.""",1,61

Police said Melhem, 29, was the gunman who killed two Israelis at a bar, then the Israeli Arab driver of a taxi who picked him up after the attack. Security camera footage showed a suspect taking an automatic rifle out of his backpack and then firing at least 15 shots at people in the street before fleeing the scene. Alon Bakal, 26, who was a manager at the bar, and Shimon Ruimi, 30, were killed. Taxi driver Amin Shaban died after being found critically injured in the north of the city shortly after the shootings. Melhem's father, Mohammed, identified his son as the suspect and reported him to the police. Mohammed Melhem and several relatives have been arrested in connection with the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated security forces, who he said had ""worked tirelessly, methodically and professionally to locate and eliminate the terrorist."" Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Melhem was shot dead after opening fire. A witness, Hakim Younis, told Israel's Channel 10 TV he saw a fierce gun battle, the Associated Press news agency reported ""I was sitting on my balcony with my cousin.... when suddenly shooting began, hundreds of bullets, like in a war,"" he said. Police have not yet established a motive for the Tel Aviv killings. Israel was already on high alert amid a wave of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians and some Israeli Arabs which have killed 22 Israelis since the beginning of October. During that time 149 Palestinians - more than half said by Israel to be attackers - have been shot dead by security forces or their victims. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces. One Israeli Arab was also shot dead after carrying out an attack at a bus station in southern Israel in October in which an Israeli soldier was killed.",1,63
"The inquiry will look at historical abuse of children in care in Scotland. But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said money would be better spent supporting victims. He said the inquiry was ""yet another process"" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend. Mr Findlay was assaulted in his bed in a dormitory after being given what he described as a form of date rape drug. ""He fondled my genitalia. He put his head under the covers, He took photographs,"" said Mr Findlay of the attack. ""Once I was able to move afterwards I confronted him about it. I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened."" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child ""tainted"" his adult life, including work and personal relationships. On the inquiry, he said: ""I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process. ""I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse. ""It is all very well saying'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse."" Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation. In a statement. Gordonstoun said: ""We welcome the Scottish Abuse Inquiry's invitation to submit a report and will respond in full. ""Cases of non-recent abuse must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and their families and the work that the Scottish Abuse Inquiry is undertaking will, we hope, draw important lessons from the past and make children safer in the future. ""For everyone at Gordonstoun today, making sure our students are happy, healthy and safe is at the heart of everything we do. ""We are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all our students. Our ongoing work in this area was recognised in our most recent independent Care Inspectorate Report which gave us a rating of five - 'very good' - for pupil care and support and noted the'comprehensive child protection procedures' in place."" The Scottish government said it had established one of the widest ranging public inquiries that Scotland has ever seen into the abuse of children in care. A spokesperson said: ""It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them. ""We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors. ""Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse. ""We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of PS13.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care."" The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject. The spokesperson added: ""Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.""",1,64
"JP Nadeau was reportedly struck by lightning mid-sentence in his apple orchard in New Brunswick, Canada. ""And just as I told my new son-in-law'You're a lucky guy' - Boom!"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Aside from a small scar on his thumb, Mr Nadeau says he was unscathed and the wedding proceeded. Storm clouds had gathered behind him at the ceremony on 8 July, he said, and his daughter saw lightning strike the ground nearby. ""I had the microphone and the shock jumped into the sound system and my hand just lit up and I saw the spark,"" he told the CBC. ""And I'm looking at my hand and it's all flared up... It was like I was holding a lightning bolt in my hand, it was amazing."" Everyone was stunned at first, but that didn't stop the happy couple from continuing with the festivities. ""It was a beautiful wedding,"" Mr Nadeau's wife, Maggy Thomas, told the CBC. ""But that was pretty terrifying for a second."" Mr Nadeau says he's a lucky-unlucky man - in 2015, a cruise ship he was working on near the Falkland Islands caught fire, and he was rescued by the British Royal Air Force. ""I've had lots of brushes with death,"" said Mr Nadeau. ""But death keeps ignoring me.""",1,65
"The blast tore through the crowded Jameela market in the predominantly Shia district of Sadr City. The Sunni jihadist group, Islamic State (IS), said it was behind the bombing and that it targeted Shia militiamen. Meanwhile, medics say more than 20 civilians died when bombs dropped by the Iraqi air force hit a maternity and children's hospital in Falluja. The city lies west of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since January 2014. The violence comes after a top American general said the US should consider embedding American troops with Iraqi forces if progress was not made in the fight against IS. Raymond Odierno, the army's outgoing chief of staff, told reporters that such forces would have a support rather than a combat role. Thursday's bomb attack in Sadr City was one of the deadliest in the capital since Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi took office a year ago. In a statement posted on Twitter, IS said the truck bomb targeted Shia militiamen from the Mahdi Army and the Popular Mobilisation forces, who have been battling the jihadist group in northern and western Iraq for more than a year. Sadr City has been the target of several bomb attacks this year claimed by IS militants, who consider Shia to be heretics. Dozens of people have been killed in bombings across Baghdad in recent months. In May and July, large car bombs exploded outside two prominent hotels. IS also continues to control vast swathes of territory in northern and western Iraq, but air strikes by a US-led coalition have helped Iraqi pro-government forces regain some territory since last August. ""I believe that if we find in the next several months that we're not making the progress that we have, we should probably absolutely consider embedding some soldiers with them, and see if that would make a difference,"" said Gen Odierno, who retires as US Army chief of staff on Friday. ""I think that's an option we should present to the president."" Gen Odierno warned that swift and more aggressive US military action would be effective only in the short-term. ""We'd probably be right back where we are today six months later,"" he said. ""I absolutely believe that the region has to solve this problem. The US cannot solve this problem for the region."" The US has already sent some 3,500 military trainers and advisers to Iraq. But the Americans' aim of training 24,000 Iraqi troops has not been achieved, with only 9,000 coming forward, according to US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter.",1,66
"Instead of fees rising to PS9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to PS6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one. This is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades. It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour. It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt. Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth PS11.2bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further PS500m per year. This would be covered by the PS48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments. But there are lower estimates. Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students. But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around PS7.5bn to PS8bn. Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction. But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments. The most recent figures show PS76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years. From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the PS10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1. And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors. Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government. But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged? Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion. One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates. The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees. This year has seen a fall of 5 in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased. But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration. Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest. Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects? Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned PS10,000 per year more. Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at PS6,000 per year. But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade. Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections. The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote. The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives. Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government? Could they really entirely scrap fees? There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees. French undergraduates can study for low fees. In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about PS100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes. There are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton. And the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland. For England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.",1,67

"Notts' 39-run win against Essex at Trent Bridge on Monday sees them return to the showpiece event at Edgbaston for the first time since 2010. Read, who has won a Lord's one-day final and two County Championship titles with Notts, has been part their two previous Finals Day campaigns. ""Maybe this is our year,"" he said. ""We go to Finals Day full of confidence and hopefully pick up some silverware."" The only time Nottinghamshire have reached the final of the competition was in 2006 at Trent Bridge, with the Outlaws missing out on a maiden title when beaten by East Midlands rivals Leicestershire in the decider. Samit Patel ensured Notts progressed on Monday with a superb spell of 4-20 as the visitors collapsed to 123 all out chasing what seemed a modest target of 163. All-rounder Patel said victory brought a sense of ""relief from everyone"" as Notts had previously fallen at the quarter-final stage in four of the past five years. Talking to BBC Radio Nottingham, the 31-year-old said: ""We knew this was a big game for us. ""We will watch all the other quarter-finals and do as much homework as we can. ""It's good get Finals Day, but we'd like to go on and win it now.""",1,69
"So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's entire existence will be quite a renovation. Robinson, once the third-longest serving boss in England's top four divisions, oversaw the development of England international Dele Alli and led Dons to the Championship for the first time. So, having been engrained in the fundamental DNA of a club only founded in 2004, which prides itself on the football it plays and the development of youngsters, can this carry on under someone else? ""What we are talking about is playing modern football,"" chairman Pete Winkelman said. ""We're a young football club and we want to play football like the big boys play, we might not play it at the same speed or accuracy but I want our supporters to recognise that football. ""The way that we play can be interpreted in many different ways. Karl's interpreted one way, and there's a massive spectrum for other people to interpret it differently. ""You look at the difference between how Chelsea and Tottenham are playing, Bournemouth and Liverpool. They're all playing a similar kind of football but all doing it completely differently."" This club needs to be a Premier League club one day Robinson was aged just 29 in May 2010 when Winkelman promoted him from Paul Ince's assistant to full-time boss after former England midfielder Ince left Stadium:MK. Failures in successive League One play-off campaigns in his first two seasons in charge showed signs of things to come, and Robinson finally delivered promotion to the Championship in 2015 thanks in no small part to the goals of on-loan Will Grigg and Benik Afobe. But after a dismal Championship season in which they got relegated with only four wins from January onwards, Robinson left on Sunday with the Dons 19th in League One. ""Ironically it's that promotion that changes the whole nature of club and we came back to League One with this burden of expectation that we need to be a Championship club,"" said Winkelman. ""To be honest, this club needs to be a Premier League club one day. I've built a Premier League stadium, Milton Keynes is going to be a top-10 city in the country and we need to have a top-10 ambition. ""It's one thing thinking it, it's another thing delivering it. But where we cannot be is 19th in League One. It's the lowest position we've been in since this stadium. We're going backwards, not forwards."" It was during that promotion-winning campaign that one of the club's greatest nights to date came - when they defeated Louis van Gaal's Manchester United 4-0 in the League Cup. And Robinson, despite the club finding itself in one of its worst positions since he took over, said his overriding feeling after leaving the club is pride. Why? ""The people of Milton Keynes, the identity, the growth of youth in Milton Keynes and the net profit in transfer fees in six years, the development of young players,"" he told BBC Three Counties Radio. ""The dream was to fill the stadium - (I was the) first person to do that, the first person to beat AFC Wimbledon. ""50 of the squad is home-grown, which is phenomenal in modern-day football I think."" Instead of dissecting Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Southend United, a solitary Robinson pitched up at a golf course on Monday, trying to take a step back from what had happened. ""I still believed they'd finish in the play-offs. I said that to the chairman on Sunday,"" he continued. ""But I have no arguments with the decisions that were made. I have no problems with anybody."" Also left working out what has gone wrong are Dons fans, some of whom are unhappy with the recruitment strategy, overseen by the chairman's son Bobby. The club use a recruitment database first set up by Paul Mitchell, who went on to work with Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton and Tottenham, to help make a list of potential signings. But fan questions have arisen after players such as Matthew Upson, Dale Jennings and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas failed to make an impact in the club's Championship season. ""We've made mistakes when we haven't signed to the (recruitment) list: 85 of the players last year weren't on our recruitment list,"" said Pete Winkelman. ""It's something we've put more right this year, but again, not all of them were on the list. ""There are successes and failures in that recruitment list, but the successes hugely outweigh the failures. ""I want to get rid of this thing that we make decisions. I've never picked the team, other than the amount of money people can spend on somebody. I've never had any other influence in the football, and nor has Bob. ""People trying to get at me will get at Bob. It's an easy hit but what I can rely on is one of the strongest databases in football."" Winkelman now has to sift through ""around 200"" names and is even considering creating a technical director role to work alongside the new manager. Meanwhile, Robinson wants to get back into management as soon as possible and has already been asked whether he would ever want to return to MK Dons. ""It was a very strange question to be asked 24 hours after leaving. But, do you know what, my answer to that was'100',"" he said. ""I would love to manage the club again someday. That's the emotional ties we have with the football club.""",1,70
"A new programme, known as Drive, will be aimed at the most dangerous offenders, BBC News has been told. Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be piloted in Essex, Sussex and South Wales. But domestic violence charity Refuge said there was ""no evidence"" therapy for violent partners was effective. Rachel Williams from Newport, who suffered 18 years of domestic violence at the hands of her late husband, Darren Williams, said: ""If you don't deal with the perpetrator, who's the problem, all they'll do is go on to the next victim."" In 2011, after Ms Williams filed for divorce, her husband burst into her hair salon armed with a sawn-off shotgun and shot her in the leg, before hanging himself in woodland. Six weeks later, as she was recovering in hospital, the body of her 16-year-old son, Jack, was found hanged in the same spot. Ms Williams, 44, who has since remarried, said her former husband would have benefited from the scheme. ""He was a control freak and he needed his actions addressing,"" she said. ""We've got to try and change the mindset of the perpetrator and hold them accountable for their actions."" One woman who survived a ""hellish five-year marriage to a physically, emotionally and financially abusive man"" said she did not believe the Drive scheme would be effective and it would be better to spend the money on support for victims. ""The majority - although not all - of serial perpetrators of domestic violence do it out of choice, not because they have drug, alcohol, social or financial problems,"" she said. ""They will use this Drive scheme as a way to avoid prison and they will deliberately make it look as though they are reforming until they are'signed off' and deemed safe. ""They will then simply find another victim and go back to how they were."" Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said there was ""no evidence - here or abroad - that therapy programmes for violent partners work."" She added: ""On the face of it, it seems like a worthy thing to do. In an ideal world we would approach this from both sides. But we don't live in an ideal world. ""We live in a world were thousands and thousands of women and children are being terrorised and brutalised in their homes and they have nowhere to go. And sadly, finding a refuge space in this country is like finding gold dust."" Although there are already a number of schemes for perpetrators of domestic violence, the Drive project is intended to be different. It is aimed at dangerous offenders, including those thought to be at risk of causing serious harm or committing murder. Unlike most existing schemes, which involve group work or family therapy, offenders on the Drive programme will be given bespoke one-to-one sessions. They will be offered support to tackle any alcohol, drug or mental health problems they may have. Advice about employment, housing and parenting will also be available. Those who refuse to co-operate will be monitored closely by police; civil court orders and criminal sanctions will be considered to disrupt their offending behaviour. Diana Barran, chief executive officer of SafeLives, said: ""Despite significant improvements for victim safety in the UK there are still 100,000 women who live with high-risk domestic abuse at any one time. ""If you do not hold perpetrators to account, we will continue to see the statistics at a standstill. ""Focusing on crisis management is of course vital but we want to help victims today and reduce the number of victims of tomorrow - and we can only do this by getting to the root and the cause of the problem - the perpetrator."" It is expected that 900 offenders will be asked to take part in the scheme over the next three years. It also has support from Social Finance, a not-for-profit organisation, and is funded by police and crime commissioners in the three areas, as well as the Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and Wales and the Tudor Trust.",1,71
"Dame Rosemary Butler said it was ""critical"" that people voted, with more powers coming to Wales. She said fewer than half of those eligible to vote did so in 2011. ""Yet when I tell people that around PS16bn is spent on things like health and education, they quickly take an interest in how that money should be spent,"" she said. Elections for the assembly and police and crime commissioners take place on 5 May. There are concerns that up to 70,000 people in Wales - the number of voters in a typical constituency - have not registered to vote out of an adult population of 2.3m. Speaking on National Voter Registration Day on Friday, Dame Rosemary said: ""Encouraging more people to vote has been a key part of my role as Presiding Officer through campaigns like Women in Public Life, and tackling the democratic deficit. ""Devolution in Wales is moving into a new era with more powers set to lie here and more decisions made in Wales, for Wales."" Rhydian Thomas, head of the Electoral Commission in Wales, said they were fully behind the drive to recruit more voters. ""It's a fantastic opportunity to spread the message that young people, students, renters and home-movers are still much less likely to be registered to vote,"" he said. Details of how to register to vote are available online.",1,72
"The head of football's governing body outlined his vision for an expanded tournament comprising 16 groups of three teams earlier this month. The top two teams in each group would progress to the knockout rounds. A decision will be made in January but any change to the 32-team format is unlikely to come in before 2026. Fifa's council will discuss the proposal at a meeting on 9 January but Infantino, 46, made expansion part of his election manifesto. ""We have to be more inclusive,"" he said at a sports conference in Dubai, adding that a 48-team tournament was the most financially appealing. ""If we can have a format that does not add any additional matches but brings so much joy to those who don't have the chance to participate then we will have to think about that,"" Infantino said. ""When discussed with the associations in the summits they were overwhelmingly in favour, but more discussions will have to take place."" The number of competing teams at World Cups last changed in 1998, increasing from 24 to 32. The European Club Association, which represents the region's leading clubs, has rejected calls for the World Cup to be expanded. Infantino also said experiments around video technology in refereeing at the recent Club World Cup had been ""very positive"" and that he hoped the system would be used at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The system was first used to award a penalty in Kashima Antlers' semi-final win over Atletico Nacional, with the referee alerted by an assistant watching a monitor. But there was confusion in the other semi-final between Real Madrid and Club America when the technology was used again. After the referee asked for a consultation following a Cristiano Ronaldo goal, play briefly restarted from a free-kick for an infringement before the goal was eventually allowed to stand. Infantino said tests in Japan had moved the system in ""the right direction"" but added ""there is still a bit of fine-tuning to be made."" Richard Conway, BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Gianni Infantino may well have ""overwhelming"" support for Fifa's 48-country World Cup plan - but it is not universal. The European Clubs Association - which represents the biggest teams on the continent - is opposed. European teams provide 80 of the players to a World Cup so they are a significant stakeholder and will place pressure on Uefa. Uefa is still to make its position clear but other confederations are likely to welcome an expanded tournament. European nations take up a big proportion of the current 32 slots at the World Cup. Given there's no chance of any redistribution taking place, Fifa see an expanded World Cup as a way to appease many of its 211 members who miss out on the party. It also fulfils one of Infantino's key presidential manifesto pledges. Uefa may in the end go along with the 48-country plan given the likely support from the rest of the world. But it will likely want more of its countries to qualify too. Let the horse-trading begin.",1,73
"Joan Ostojic's daughters Katherine, 21, and Alice, 19, were on a boat carrying 25 people that went down between Lombok and the Komodo Islands on Saturday. They sat on the semi-submerged vessel's roof for 10 hours before embarking on their swim, their mother said. Mrs Ostojic, from Stevenage, said: ""It's a relief that they are safe."" She added: ""They are fine, carrying on with their travels, and will be home shortly."" Travellers from New Zealand, Spain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands were among those rescued after the boat hit a reef near Sangeang Api, a volcanic island off Sumbawa, in bad weather during the three-day journey. Mrs Ostojic said the girls sent an email to her and her husband Peter saying they had heard everyone had been found. They also revealed that after the boat sank in the middle of the night, they swam for eight hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and being rescued, their mother said. The Foreign Office said Alice Ostojic had been been travelling through Australia and south-east Asia as part of her gap year. Katherine, who is at Bristol University studying aerospace engineering, had joined her for a month in Indonesia.

"The hosts, chasing 379 to win, began slowly and Chopra's caution increased after a middle-order collapse of three wickets for 25 runs. The opener laboured for five and a half hours for his 17th first class century off 269 balls and ended on 119 not out. Tim Ambrose (29) also played a patient innings, despite being forced to use a runner after suffering a leg injury. Hampshire bowled tightly on a pitch that became easier for batting as the day went on, with Warwickshire scoring 65 runs in the morning session. Ian Westwood (40) was trapped lbw by Andre Adams before lunch and three quick wickets after the interval strengthened the home side's decision to play for the draw. James Tomlinson picked up two scalps, including Ireland captain William Porterfield (29), before Chopra guided his side to safety. Despite scoring just 26 runs in the post-lunch session, Chopra scored more freely as he moved towards his first century as Warwickshire skipper. The draw came shortly after Ambrose chipped a full delivery from Will Smith to Gareth Berg at extra-cover. The wicket-keeper batted for an hour with a runner after suffering a gluteal strain before tea, which may rule him out of Sunday's game against champions Yorkshire. Warwickshire captain Varun Chopra: ""They bowled well and made it hard for us to score on a pitch which got slower the longer the game went. ""At the start of the day our intention was to go for the win but it was a case of taking it session by session. After Sam Hain got out and we were four wickets down, and we didn't really have any momentum to the scoring, it was always going to be pretty tough. ""But overall I was quite pleased with the way we played. There were some good performances from us, with a six-for and two centuries."" Hampshire captain Jimmy Adams: ""At the start of the last day I thought a draw was probably the least likely result. ""The previous evening Warwickshire had got away from us a little bit and if they had started the same way today then things could have been a lot different. ""But the guys bowled well and I am really happy with the way we played over the four days.""",1,75

"The so-called New Deal will reshape how they are trained as their career develops and help them to deliver the new ""made in Wales curriculum."" Each of Wales' 37,600 teachers will be given a learning passport by September to record professional development. Education Minister Huw Lewis said having ""high capacity, high skilled professionals"" was essential. Policies for recruiting and developing teachers and other school staff are ""underdeveloped,"" according to a report by the OECD think-tank, looking at schools in Wales last year. There has been a small improvement in the quality of teaching, which is now good or better in half of schools, says the schools watchdog Estyn in its annual report. But there are fewer schools where teaching is excellent. The quality of assessment was also found to be variable in a minority of schools. Teachers will be offered support but be expected to continually update their skills. Mr Lewis will visit Brynnau Primary school in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, to highlight its record in developing its staff to benefit pupils. He said: ""We are currently undertaking one of the most ambitious series of educational reforms Wales has ever seen, aimed squarely at improving standards right across the board. ""However we know that excellent teaching and leadership is crucial to the learner experience and to our ongoing work of raising outcomes for all learners at all levels."" He added that ""the quality of the professional at the chalk face has a huge impact on the quality of teaching and learning.""",1,79
"The net benefit is about PS257m each year and takes into account the impact on public services such as the NHS. In 2014, 34,670 students travelled from outside the European Union (EU) to study in Scotland. But PwC said its research showed the overall experience of foreign students is compromised by the UK's complex immigration system. The auditors claim this also has an impact on their ability to secure work following graduation and has called on the UK government to improve its data collection around migration. The PwC calculation does not include the value to Scotland of non-fee spending (including accommodation, travel and leisure) by students from outside the UK, or non-fee spending by EU students, most of whom do not have to pay tuition fees. Lindsey Paterson, from PwC in Scotland, said: ""With a lot at stake, not just for the Scottish and UK economy but for the future growth and prosperity of our higher education establishments, it's clear that more needs to be done to inform and improve immigration policies and targets."" She added: ""Our Scottish universities and colleges are competing in a global marketplace and it's vital that government supports them in attracting the brightest academic talent not just from here in the UK, but from the EU and further afield. ""International students not only help to broaden our own students' vision and perspective in the classroom but have a major economic impact through their fees and consumer spending."" PwC has recommended that the UK classify students as temporary visitors, not migrants, as is the case in Canada and Australia. It claims this will make it easier for international students to work in the UK post-graduation.",1,80
"Lib Dem sources say 30,000 local authority places are being lost as money is diverted to new free schools. They said Mr Gove was ""ideologically obsessed"" about backing free schools. Tory education sources called the Lib Dems ""pathetic,"" saying more school places were being created overall. Asked about the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, David Cameron said free schools were ""an excellent innovation"" and he would ""get on with delivering what matters, which is good schools for our children."" The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, Malcolm Bruce, said the budget for free schools was ""completely out of control"" and accused the education secretary of being ""monetarily obsessed."" He told the BBC: ""He [Mr Gove] is basically raiding money that should be going to the vast majority of schools that have real needs for a small number of free schools, many of which are in places where there isn't a pressure or a need."" Mr Bruce added: ""Michael Gove needs to be reined back, the programme needs to be properly costed and controlled."" The row is not the first within the coalition government over education policy. But BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the ""striking"" language used was evidence that both parts of the coalition were becoming more willing to air their disagreements and grievances in public a year ahead of the general election and less than two weeks before local and European elections. According to sources in Mr Clegg's office, last December Mr Gove overruled the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws to take PS400m from the Basic Need Budget for 2015-17. They claim the money was diverted to help cover a projected PS800m overspend between 2013 and 2016 in the budget of free schools - a project close to Mr Gove's heart. By Alex ForsythBBC Political Correspondent With less than two weeks to go before the local and European elections, increasing tensions between political parties are no surprise. The coalition parties in particular are trying to put clear water between them, and this isn't their first public disagreement. But on this occasion both sides have bandied round strong language - calling the other'pathetic' or'laughable' and describing funding decisions as'lunacy'. Those involved may see it as an opportunity to promote their party's policy and convince voters of what they stand for - in the strongest possible terms. To others it might be viewed as two political parties, both in government, attacking each other and policies they've officially both agreed. They may view this as good tactics. The public may view it differently. Free schools can be set up by parents, teachers, charities, businesses, universities, trusts, religious or voluntary groups, but are funded directly by central government. There are currently 174 free schools in England with another 116 approved to open from this September. A Lib Dem source said the Conservatives were ""putting the needs of a handful of their pet projects ahead of the requirements of the other 24,000 schools in the country."" ""Michael Gove was warned by the schools minister David Laws that this was a bad idea but the zealot pressed on anyway,"" said the source. Mr Gove's allies say the Basic Need Budget will still rise by more than PS200m a year in 2015-17 and argue that expansion of free schools will lead to more school places overall. Research last month highlighted by the Labour Party suggested the government was currently funding free schools for 1,500 more pupils than were actually attending. A spokesman for Mr Gove disputed the claim by critics of free schools that the places being created were not necessarily where they were most needed. He said: ""The suggestion we are cutting money for new places in areas of need to pay for free schools where they are not needed is totally wrong. ""These claims pretend that money spent in free schools is not creating new places in areas of need. That is simply not true."" Research by the Times Educational Supplement suggests that: The row comes days after emails leaked to the BBC indicated senior Department for Education officials had raised concerns school places may have to be cut if the Lib Dems' free school meals policy for infant children was implemented. A Conservative source at the Department for Education said: ""This is a pathetic attempt by the Lib Dems to divert attention from their botched school food policy which councils are being forced to fund by cutting money for school places. ""They opted for free schools and backed them from the start. For the Lib Dems to attack them now is frankly risible."" Labour's shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said free schools ""had the Lib Dem stamp of approval from day one. ""They're as much to blame for the failings as the Tories."" Mr Hunt said there was a ""national crisis"" over primary school places and said the secretary of state was behaving irresponsibly. The Lib Dems and Tories have also previously clashed over the employment of classroom staff without formal teaching qualifications and Mr Gove's decision not to re-appoint Labour peer Sally Morgan to watchdog Ofsted. Two days ago, a report by a cross-party group of MPs said financial management of some free schools was inadequate. The Public Accounts Committee said procedures were ""overly reliant"" on whistleblowers to uncover financial problems. The government said many of the committee's concerns were ""misplaced.""",1,81

"He's been refused somewhere to stay because he comes from Ebola hotspot, Sierra Leone. Amara arrived in Norwich from West Africa a fortnight ago and was turned down by two landlords - one by letter. Both were happy for him to stay until he handed over his passport and they realised he was from a country at the centre of the current epidemic. He told Newsbeat that he was ""devastated to be turned down."" The letter said: ""Under normal circumstance. Your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers. ""However, given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic, we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the ebola outbreak within the last two months, or is likely to visit those areas in the near future."" Amara, 35, told Newsbeat that it is wrong to assume all people from Sierra Leone carry the disease. He says: ""It's very unreasonable. And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected, then that's just completely unfair."" The good news for Amara is that after a few weeks of looking, he's found somewhere to stay so he can continue his studies. More than 4,400 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mainly in West Africa. Britain has now begun screening passengers at Heathrow airport. People arriving from the worst-affected countries will be questioned and may have their temperatures taken. Professor Tom Solomon is an expert on diseases like Ebola and how they spread. How worried should we be here in the UK? I think we should be worried about Ebola in West Africa because sadly the cases have gone up and up but the situation in the UK is very different from the situation in West Africa. Was the landlord right to be so cautious? I understand why people are concerned about Ebola but what people need to do is look at the facts and then make sensible decisions. You're not going to get Ebola from renting your flat to someone from Sierra Leone. How do people get Ebola? Ebola is passed on if someone is in contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actually sick with the disease. So clearly letting out your property wont put people at risk.

""It's like taking the bar exam at Coachella,"" he said. ""I really need to concentrate on this!"" Some have labelled his portrayal of female characters, including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, as sexist. The criticism came as a surprise - as the writer-turned-director had previously been praised for creating strong female leads in his TV shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse. He said, ""I saw a lot of people say,'Well, the social justice warriors destroyed one of their own!' It's like, nope. That didn't happen."" Whedon also denied the accusation that he quit Twitter because of specific criticism from campaigning group Feminist Frequency. ""Literally the second person to write me to ask if I was okay when I dropped out was [Feminist Frequency founder] Anita [Sarkeesian],""he said. Immediately prior to deleting his account, Whedon tweeted: ""Thank you to all the people who've been so kind and funny and inspiring up in here."" Soon after, a search for an account under the josswhedon handle returned a ""page not found"" error. One critic had created a widely shared montage image showing many of the messages sent to Whedon. Some called him misogynistic and said he had done a ""hatchet job"" on Black Widow, whose big storyline in the latest Avengers film is a doomed romance.

"The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: ""Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York."" This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a ""whinge-o-rama."" Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was ""normal"" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as ""probably.... my closest international partner these eight years."" In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: ""Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America.... but unique did not mean affectionate."" So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. ""For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,"" he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.",1,85
"The industry group said sales of the fish leapt more than 50 by value - to PS186.7m - and 13 by volume. British food and drink exports as a whole grew by 8.3 year-on-year to PS4.9bn - the largest first quarter figure on record. FDF credited better promotion of UK goods abroad, and the weaker pound. Sterling has fallen by about 16 against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June, making UK produce more competitive overseas. Quoting UK government figures, the group said whisky had remained the top food and drink export during the period, with sales of PS895.9m. This was followed by Scottish salmon and chocolate. 2016, as a whole, was a record-breaking year for food and drink exports. That momentum appears to be continuing in 2017. This is good news for the industry and the government as it seeks new markets for British goods. Exports to non-EU countries have been growing at a faster rate than those to the EU for the last couple of years. A growth rate of 40 in South Korea is pretty impressive. But that still only amounts to some PS50m worth of business. Compare that to Ireland, where we generated some PS854m worth of exports in the first three months of this year. Ireland remains our most important trading partner by far when it comes to food and drink. Today's figures are yet more evidence that protecting this relationship post-Brexit will be key. The rise in the value of UK salmon sales is thanks in part to rising global demand for the fish, that has been hard to meet due to widespread lice infestations that have hampered production. That has led to higher prices for salmon across the board. The weakness of sterling has also helped to make Scottish salmon less expensive than salmon from Chile and Norway. British wine exports saw the greatest growth by volume, climbing 13.8, while the value of the UK's cheese exports jumped 29.1 to PS145.3m, thanks in part to a spike in sales to France. However, while the weaker pound benefited UK exporters, the FDF said it had also pushed up costs for British businesses that bring food into the UK from abroad. As a result, the UK's food and drink trade deficit - the difference between how much the UK imports and exports - actually widened 19 to PS6.2bn in the quarter.

However at 9.4, growth in exports to non-EU countries outpaced those to the EU, which climbed 7.4. Ian Wright, Director General of FDF, said it was ""pleasing to see non-EU exports performing beyond expectations."" Food and drink sales to South Korea rose 40, driven by beer sales, while exports to South Africa grew 31 thanks to animal feed. However, Elsa Fairbanks, director of the Food Drink Exporters Association, another trade organisation, said: ""Ease of access to EU markets will continue to be vital to our industry in future as many food and drink products are not suited to export to distant markets. ""Although we recognise the need to explore new opportunities, leaving the EU should not mean ignoring those we already have.""",1,86
"The new charge will be imposed from April 2017 and help ensure that big business shoulders the cost of training workers, George Osborne said. But business groups have described the levy as a new ""payroll tax."" The Institute of Directors said it would be a big cost for many companies, including medium-sized firms. The CBI said it was a significant extra tax for business that would hit many smaller companies. Only businesses with a wage bill of more than PS3m will pay the levy, which the government said would exempt 98 of employers. Mr Osborne told the Commons: ""It's a huge reform to raise the skills of the nation and address one of the enduring weaknesses of the British economy."" But Institute of Directors director-general Simon Walker said: ""We are very concerned by the government's assumption that a quarter of the money collected will be spent on just administering the levy. ""Firms have been promised they will get back more than they put in, but it's not clear how this will happen if so much is being lost in bureaucracy."" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the levy was the sting in the tail for business in the chancellor's statement. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the organisation that compiles forecasts for the government, said that the levy would help reduce wage growth over the next five years by 0.7. The OBR added: ""We assume that most of the cost will ultimately be borne by employees."" Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, said the chancellor had tried to sugar-coat the introduction a new tax, which accounted for more than half of the tax rises announced in the Autumn Statement. British Retail Consortium director-general Helen Dickinson said: ""The government is absolutely right to want to increase the number of apprenticeships but in doing so it must make sure the quality is increased too."" However, Petra Wilton, of the Chartered Management Institute, said: ""If businesses want a skilled workforce then it's only right that they pay for it."" In other announcements affecting business, PS165m of research and development grants distributed through Innovate UK will be turned into loans. The chancellor said this approach had been used successfully in France for years. An Innovate UK spokesman said the change meant that it would ""have to focus its work within a new operational funding framework."" John Longworth, British Chambers of Commerce director-general, said it was important that replacing grants with loans did not ""reduce our dynamism in the global economy."" The BCC also welcomed increased spending on infrastructure, particularly for the road network, which it said would help businesses to expand. Support for the aerospace and automotive industries will be maintained at existing levels for the next decade. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS Group, which represents aerospace, defence, space and security companies, said the move was ""an unprecedented vote of confidence"" for the UK aerospace industry. ""Long-term funding for aerospace RD will ensure our industry remains globally competitive and one of the most attractive locations for this high value and high skilled activity,"" he said. Mr Osborne said the business rate relief scheme would be extended for another year, helping 600,000 small firms. John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said its members would be relieved by the extension, although the CBI's Ms Fairbairn added: ""Many firms will be disappointed to have been kept hanging on for a much-needed review of business rates until next year's Budget."" The BRC said that the High Street retail discount - worth up to PS1,500 a year to shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants - had not been renewed in a move that retailers would find ""very disappointing."" Annual business rates for the average small shop will breach the PS9,000 level for the first time next year, according to retail expert Paul Turner-Mitchell. ""The Autumn Statement was terrible for both the retail sector and those who have campaigned long and hard for the meaningful structural reform of the system,"" he said. ""It's a real kick in the teeth and the government has just simply not listened.""

"The typical home in the East increased in cost by 8.3 in the year to the end of July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Prices in London, which saw big rises last year, rose by 5.5, slightly lower than the average in England of 5.6. Overall, UK house prices increased by 5.2 in the year to the end of July. The other area to see significant price growth was Northern Ireland, up 7.4. Property values in Northern Ireland are recovering from a massive fall during the financial crisis, and remain 42 below the peak of August 2007, the ONS figures show, Prices rose by 6.7 in the South East of England, the ONS figures show, although here - as in the East and in seven other regions - the pace of price rises has slowed. Analysts suggest that the time of double-digit price rises in London is over for now. ""There is very much a ripple effect - the action has moved out from prime central London to the outskirts and those commuter areas where there is better value to be had, although not as much if prices continue to rise as they have been,"" said Jonathan Adams, director of central London estate agency Napier Watt. The 5.2 average price increase in the UK was down from the 5.7 rate recorded in the previous month. Prices in Scotland fell by 1.3 and were 0.7 lower in the North East of England. Excluding London and the South East of England, UK house prices increased by 4.4. The average home cost PS295,000 in England, PS173,000 in Wales, PS154,000 in Northern Ireland and PS196,000 in Scotland. In England, the highest average price was paid in London (PS525,000) and the lowest in the North East (PS156,000). The average price paid in the UK was PS282,000, and analysts expect this to continue to rise, not least as a result of a lack of properties in the market. Writing in the Guardian, Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst for Savills, said that the cost of buying a property, rather than the cost of owning it, is the biggest barrier to people buying their first home. That is because a large amount is needed for a deposit, while mortgage costs are well below the norm. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the number of homeowners remortgaging - in order to take advantage of low rates - rose by 26 in July compared with the same month a year earlier.",1,88
"Labour suffered heavy losses at the hands of the SNP, with the Tories defying opinion polls to secure a House of Commons majority. In a speech in London, Mr Miliband said it was ""time for someone else"" to take over the leadership and that he was ""truly sorry"" he did not succeed. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls was among the party's big-name casualties. It also lost its election campaign chief Douglas Alexander and its leader in Scotland Jim Murphy. Mr Miliband was applauded by staff as he arrived at Labour headquarters in central London. He confirmed deputy leader Harriet Harman would be interim leader. ""I joined this party aged 17,"" he said.

He had spent much of the first 40 years of his life in the shadow of his older brother David, the former foreign secretary. He did the same course - Philosophy, Politics and Economics - at Oxford University, at the same college, and followed David into a similar backroom role in the Labour Party, albeit on different sides of the Tony BlairGordon Brown divide.

He urged supporters not to ""mourn"" the defeat. ""We have come back before and this party will come back again,"" he added. Speaking earlier after retaining his Doncaster North seat, Mr Miliband said his party had been overwhelmed by a ""surge of nationalism."" Ms Harman confirmed she would step down as deputy leader once the new leadership is in place. Labour MP Tom Watson - the party's former campaign co-ordinator - confirmed that he would consider running to replace her. ""I've always thought that the deputy leader role is the campaigning role,"" he told BBC News. ""We've got a mayoral election in Tower Hamlets to fight in six weeks' time. Who knows, we might even have a by-election for London mayor. ""So this party has got to keep campaigning whilst we try and understand what's gone on in the general election."" Mr Balls lost his Morley and Outwood seat to Conservative candidate Andrea Jenkyns by 422 votes. ""Any personal disappointment I have at this result is as nothing compared to the sense of sorrow I have at the result Labour has achieved across the UK, and the sense of concern I have about the future,"" he said. Mr Balls said questions would arise about the future of the United Kingdom and Britain's position in Europe over the next five years. Labour also lost previous leader Gordon Brown's former constituency to the SNP as the nationalist party almost swept the board in Scotland. Mr Alexander lost his seat to a 20-year-old student after a massive 26.9 swing from Labour to the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South. Conceding defeat, Mr Murphy said: ""The party that has traditionally been the tireless champion of the underdog now finds itself in the position of being the underdog. ""Scotland needs a strong Labour Party and our fight-back starts tomorrow morning."" Former Labour Home Secretary Lord Reid told the BBC ""changing the captain"" would not necessarily improve Labour's electoral prospects. ""They (the public) thought we were on the wrong side of all the major arguments - our economic competence, on the question of creating wealth rather than just distributing wealth, on the question of immigration, on the question of reform of the public services,"" he said. Another Labour peer, former First Minister Lord McConnell, said his party had experienced a ""catastrophic night."" ""I think the Labour strategy for this election was always going to end up in this situation,"" he said. ""The idea that we could poll between 30 and 35 and pull off a victory was not going to work.""",1,89
"The incident happened at the Co-op store in Thornton at about 02:15 on 17 May. A Ford Transit flatbed van, stolen in Station Road, reversed into the premises. Extensive damage was caused to the building and an attempt was made to steal an ATM. A 25-year-old man is expected to appear at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court court on Monday. Det Insp Stewart Andrew of Glenrothes CID said: ""Officers have been pursuing various lines of enquiry ever since this incident took place, which has included liaison with our colleagues in Durham Constabulary.

"The Perth club has suspended the team-mates pending a club investigation. Wright told BBC Scotland that ""if what's alleged"" to have occurred did in fact happen ""we'll come down severely hard on both."" Referee Don Robertson sent off both players during the break. Wright, whose side confirmed their top six place due to results elsewhere, says he did not see the incident as he had already started walking up the tunnel following the half time whistle. BBC Scotland reporter Jonathan Sutherland saw Foster throw a punch at Swanson, who retaliated by aiming a kick at the defender after he had slipped. ""I haven't seen it with my own eyes but obviously something happened,"" said Wright. ""I'm going to wait and see for myself. The players have been told they let themselves down, and let the team down. We should be celebrating confirming our top six place tonight. ""Under no circumstance will they get off lightly if what is alleged to have happened has happened. The hardest punishment I can do legally with them, I'll do it."" Media playback is not supported on this device Wright was angry that the incident left his side up against it in the second half, and that the shine was taken off the Saints confirming a top six berth. ""It's another great achievement getting the top six,"" he added. ""We showed a lot of character and should have had a penalty. (Georgios) Sarris has got arms all over Murray Davidson and that should have been a penalty kick. ""The boys were magnificent and probably deserved a point but they didn't get it."" Hamilton player Ali Crawford was shown a yellow card and assistant manager Guillaume Beuzelin sent to the stand after becoming involved in the chaotic scenes that followed the incident between Foster and Swanson. However, manager Martin Canning told BBC Scotland: ""I would rather be talking about us. It is not something you want to see, but it is a passionate game and sometimes it spills over. ""My players acted well. I think Darian MacKinnon was just trying to separate them and calm things down. ""I don't think I have to take any action against my players."" Hamilton moved off bottom spot in the table thanks to the win, sealed by a late Alex D'Acol goal. They are 11th on 27 points, two clear of bottom club Inverness Caledonian Thistle. ""With 11 against 11 in the first half, I thought we were excellent and we kept going and got a huge three points,"" Canning added.",1,91
"Spencer Wilding, who hails from Rhyl, was the guest of honour at a special screening of Rogue One. He had to muster all powers of the force to keep his Vader role secret until the film's release. ""It's a hell of a secret to keep,"" said Wilding, who was cast as the body actor for the role. ""But when you're a professional actor - when you sign that black and white sheet of paper saying you cannot say a word.... I'm true to my word and I didn't say anything."" Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme, the 44-year-old said it proved a tricky task after rumours of the role leaked a year ago. ""I've been having hundreds of people every day for a year asking me if I'm Vader,"" he said. ""If I had a pound for everyone who asked I'd be buying myself a new Death Star - and it'd be gold plated."" The 6ft 7in (2m) tall actor already has a string of Hollywood appearances to his name, including Guardians of the Galaxy, Green Lantern, three Harry Potter films and the TV blockbuster Game of Thrones. He said the Vader role came from a regular casting call, first with a self-filmed tape, then a recall to Pinewood Studios. ""It's very, very secretive. We didn't even know exactly what the character was and what film it was until we got there,"" he said. ""I opened up the curtain when I went in the dressing room and there he was - Vader. ""Anybody out there who got into that costume and got an audition to be Darth Vader alone is very exciting, so to pull the character off as well, it's like'What!' ""I'm always pinching myself - I am definitely awake - it is not a dream, it is just another dream come true."" While the actor has the body role, just like his predecessor in the original Star Wars films David Prowse, the voice of Lord Vader is actor James Earl Jones. That did not stop Wilding trying out the voice during filming. ""I'm not James Earl Jones - nowhere near him - but you know I got close to him I think, which helped the other actors - you know, you've got Vader in front of you.""",1,92
"Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same ""nursery"" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago. and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",1,93
"Saints' 3-0 reverse at Everton on Monday completed a difficult Christmas period for Claude Puel's side. But Stephens, who made his Premier League debut at Goodison Park, believes a change of form is on the cards. ""We just need that little bit of extra luck, or extra quality to go 1-0 up,"" he told BBC Radio Solent. ""These things happen and we'll bounce back."" Stephens, 22, found himself introduced in the sixth minute at Everton, when injury forced Cedric Soares off. ""I enjoyed playing the game,"" he said.

"Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks. It's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens. ""There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,"" he said. ""There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty."" Small wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling. Thankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. ""Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,"" he told the BBC. Sadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around. Studies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people. ""We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,"" he said. ""You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US."" Touchscreens can be ""reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens,"" said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets. It is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low. ""For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,"" he said. ""It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time."" The study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour. Thankfully, other fixes are at hand. To begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale. ""They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,"" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen. Also, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought. There are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50 more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp. The fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years. Then there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet. By mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use. ""Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,"" said Mr Block.",1,95

"The PRI is set to win about 30, with the conservative National Action Party on about 22, said the head of the National Electoral Institute. On current projections, the PRI will see its number of seats drop slightly. The run-up to the poll was marked by violence with drug cartels blamed for the deaths of several candidates. On Sunday morning, protesters and parents of 43 students who disappeared last year burned election material in the town of Tixtla. They say they want answers about what happened to the students before elections are held. A dissident teachers' union also burned ballots and ransacked offices of political parties to express its anger at education reforms. Ahead of the elections, there was a great deal of pessimism - the feeling among many that votes do not really matter, politicians here are all the same, and violence will continue no matter what. But at a polling stations on Sunday, in relatively peaceful Mexico City, there was a sense of duty among many - that voting was the only way to make a difference. Asked what their main concern was and almost without exception, the response among voters was:'Security.' People here are worried about where the country is heading. Despite President Pena Nieto's promises to restore peace in Mexico, these elections have proved otherwise. They have been some of the most violent in recent history. President Pena Nieto deployed federal police and troops to guard polling stations. His spokesman Eduard Sanchez said on Saturday: ""Mexicans have the right to vote in peace.... [we] will take all necessary measures within the framework of legality"" to protect the elections. Ahead of the polls opening, the CNTE teachers' union attacked the offices of five political parties in Chiapas state in the south of the country.

"The MarkitCIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4 in the first quarter of the year from 0.6 in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The MarkitCIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",1,101
"Reuben Lewis from Llanidloes was driven 45 minutes from Ysgol Cedewain, Newtown, without teachers or transport staff realising he was still on board. BBC Wales understands he was then left alone on the parked bus in Rhayader on two separate occasions. Powys council said there had been a ""serious breakdown in communication."" A spokesman added it had spoken to the school and all contractors to ensure immediate safeguards were put in place to prevent any similar incidents in future. The most recent incident was on Monday, when it was only noticed Reuben was missing after his sister spotted he was not present at a school swimming lesson she was teaching at Maldwyn Leisure Centre in Newtown. Police were told and Reuben was found at the Simon Price Cars bus depot. Reuben's father, Rob Lewis, said there had been ""several mistakes"" by the school and transport provider in the past year. He said Reuben was left on the bus in May last year and left at school the following December. ""I was in total and utter shock that this had happened again,"" he said. ""I'm always happy to give someone a second chance, but now I wish I'd never given them a first chance. This beggars belief. ""It was sheer luck that it was noticed Reuben was missing on Monday because his older sister works part time as a lifeguard in the leisure centre. ""She knew her brother was meant to be at the swimming lessons and when she couldn't see him she rang her mother and we alerted the school and the police."" Mr Lewis said he had an agreement with the school to notify them before 09:00 if Reuben would not be attending, so the alarm would be raised if he was not there. ""So how could this happen again on Monday, after we were given so many reassurances?"" he added. Simon Price, owner of Simon Price Cars, said the company was contractually unable to comment while the investigation was ongoing. A council spokesman added: ""Although we have undertaken an internal review of the circumstances surrounding this incident we have advised the parents to make a formal complaint so that we can investigate all of the circumstances in the fullest detail as a matter of urgency.

"The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.

He added: ""It's easy to ask for money but I think we need to be looking at what the root causes of those issues are We looked at life chances in the cabinet today, we looked at what the barriers were to allowing people to get on. ""Why are white working class people less likely than their peers to go on to university? Those are the sorts of issues that we need to be addressing, those sorts of literacy skills, those sorts of numeracy skills that we need to overcome, the opportunities we need to give to people so that every person feels that they've got a part to play in society.

"The mutation was also present in our evolutionary ""cousins"" - the Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it is not found in humans' closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. As early humans evolved, they developed larger and more complex brains, which can process and store a lot of information. Last year, scientists pinpointed a human gene that they think was behind the expansion of a key brain region known as the neocortex. They believe the gene arose about five or six million years ago, after the human line had split off from chimpanzees. Now, researchers have found a tiny DNA change - a point mutation - that appears to have changed the function of the gene, sparking the process of expansion of the neocortex. The human brain Source: Smithsonian Museum It may have paved the way for the brain's expansion by dramatically boosting the number of brain cells found in this region. Dr Wieland Huttner of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany, led the research. ""A point mutation in a human-specific gene gave it a function that allows expansion of the relevant stem cells that make a brain big,"" he told BBC News. ""This one, as it is fixed in the human genome - so all living humans have the gene - apparently gave a tremendous selection advantage, and that's why we believe it spread in the human population."" Between two and six million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans began to walk upright and use simple tools. During this extended period of time, their brain size started to increase. They began to spread around the world, encountering different environments. From about 800,000 years ago, their brain size increased further, helping them to survive in a changing world. Still, many questions remain about how early humans evolved larger brains. It is likely that the gene is one of many genetic changes that gave humans their unique intelligence and thinking ability.

"Julian Lewis, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said the former prime minister had ""charm and ability."" But he had ""dangerously"" delayed renewing Trident, Mr Lewis said, also questioning Mr Cameron's roles in Libya, Brexit and armed forces cuts. The ex-PM was mooted as Nato secretary-general over the Christmas period. The incumbent, former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, is due to stand down within the next couple of years. In a speech as part of the Speaker's Lecture series, Mr Lewis said: ""During the Christmas recess, an obviously planted story appeared in a tabloid newspaper suggesting that our most recent former prime minister should be the UK's candidate as next Nato secretary-general. ""It was duly taken up by the wider media, with heavy hints suggesting that Number 10 was actively considering the proposal."" He added: ""David Cameron is a man of charm and ability. He deserves to find a role commensurate with his talents, and I am sure that he will. ""But those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues, whether when toppling Arab dictators in places like Libya, increasing military commitments whilst cutting the armed forces, predicting a Third World War in consequence of Brexit, or dangerously delaying the renewal of Trident for the sake of coalition politics - as he did."" Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister last summer after his Remain campaign lost the EU referendum. He stood down as MP for Witney, Oxfordshire, in September. In an interview with the Times, published on Monday, US President-elect Donald Trump branded Nato ""obsolete"" for failing to adapt to the threat posed by terrorism, but he also said the 28-member military alliance was ""very important."" Mr Lewis warned that if the US turned away from the organisation, Europe would have ""little chance"" of deterring non-nuclear threats. But he claimed Mr Trump was trying to strengthen the alliance by confronting countries which failed to meet the membership requirement of spending more than 2 of GDP on defence. Mr Lewis said: ""It seems to me far more likely that, by confronting the'free-riders' within the alliance, he actually aims to strengthen Nato by ensuring that all its members properly fund their armed forces in the future.""",1,113
"Media playback is not supported on this device Platini wants to restore the image of world football's governing body in the wake of serious corruption allegations. ""We want a reform candidate,"" said FA chairman Greg Dyke. ""We believe he will reform Fifa in the way that reform is needed."" Sepp Blatter has already announced he will quit as Fifa president, with an election set for 26 February. Frenchman Platini, president of European football governing body Uefa, is likely to face a number of challengers, among them Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan and Liberian FA president Musa Bility. Dyke added: ""We understand there will be a number of candidates, which should result in a strong and healthy debate. ""However, we should not underestimate how challenging it will be for anyone to lead an organisation that has been so tainted. The whole structure of Fifa must be reviewed and fundamentally changed."" Platini has found himself at odds with the FA over Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. The 60-year-old championed the Gulf nation despite concerns over its human rights record and severe summer temperatures. But Dyke attempted to play down any differences for the time being, saying: ""Mr Platini has always made it very clear that he voted for Qatar. ""If all the other people who voted for Qatar had been quite as transparent it would have been more helpful."" Not everyone shares the FA's confidence in Platini, a former France international who won the coveted Ballon d'Or three times. Just hours after confirming his candidacy on Wednesday, he was criticised by two potential presidential rivals. Prince Ali and Bility both claim Platini would be a bad choice as a successor. Prince Ali, who stood against Blatter in the last presidential election, said that ""football's fans and players deserve better."" A member of the Jordanian royal family, he added that Fifa needed a ""new, independent leadership, untainted by the practices of the past."" Bility agreed, telling the BBC's World Football programme that Platini would bring ""chaos,"" ""more division"" and ""more problems.""",1,114
"The Amateur International Boxing Association has said pro boxers will compete in Rio if a constitutional change is agreed next month. But Tyson, 49, a former Junior Olympic winner, said: ""Some pro fighters are going to get beat by the amateurs. ""It's just going to happen, I really believe that."" Tyson won gold at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympics and, speaking at the 33rd IBF convention in China, said professional boxers would find the fast-paced fighting style of their amateur counterparts difficult to contend with. ""If they are like the amateur fighters that I was fighting in the 80s.... they are going to beat some of the champions, it's just going to happen,"" he insisted. Lennox Lewis, another former world heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medallist, is also not in favour of the idea, branding it ""preposterous."" Tyson has also revealed he is an admirer of Briton and controversial current world champion Tyson Fury. Fury ended Wladimir Klitschko's nine-year reign as champion in November but has become better know since for a string of outspoken remarks. ""One guy, Tyson Fury, I like to watch him because he has my name and stuff,"" Tyson said. ""Everybody says'ah, he's a bum', but I like him. ""He beat Klitschko, so what are you going to say?

The pieces have images of Russian ruler Catherine the Great and Prussian king Frederick William II, and were made between 1770 and 1775. The cups and saucers, which are made of Berlin porcelain, are described as dark blue and painted'en grisaille' with heavy gilding, flower sprays, finials and branch handles. Det Con Ray Swan, from the Mets Art's and Antiques Unit, said: ""The cups and saucers are of significant historical value, we believe that whoever took them specifically targeted these pieces.

"Food price inflation was 4.9 in June, compared with 3.2 in May, with rising pork prices partly to blame. While the headline inflation number was above analysts' expectations, it remains below the government's target figure of 3.5. Analysts say the latest figure reduces the prospect of interest rate cuts in 2013. Cutting interest rates risks inflating a property bubble, while tightening may put additional pressure on the economy in the middle of the current global economic uncertainty. Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists Lu Ting and Zhi Xiaojia expect authorities to keep monetary policy neutral with ""neither easing nor tightening.""

"In the footage, which has been widely shared on social media, the policeman headbutts, slaps and kicks the driver as they quarrel beside the lorry. The incident happened at Wadi Joz, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem. Police said the officer involved had shown ""severe and unusual behaviour"" and had been placed on forced leave. The video, which was recorded by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, has been passed to the police investigation unit. Apparently filmed on a dashcam of another vehicle, it shows the officer remonstrating with the lorry driver. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said the incident reportedly arose over an issue with the parking of the lorry. The Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. As the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. At this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. The edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. The footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. ""It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order,"" he said. Israel's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. ""There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law,"" he said.",1,120
"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites illegally sell drugs like Ritalin and Modafinil without a valid prescription. The drugs can cause dependency, heart problems and psychosis. So far this year, the MHRA has closed nearly 5,000 websites selling fake or unlicensed medicines. Modafinil is designed to be used for a health condition called narcolepsy - a rare but serious brain disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. But some students take it to stay alert. Others take Ritalin, a treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), for a cognitive boost. MHRA Senior Policy Manager Lynda Scammell said: ""You may be offered'smart drugs' or'cognitive enhancers' at university - some of them may be potent medicines which should only be prescribed by a doctor. ""Modafinil is licensed for specific medical conditions - not for use as a'boost' during exams. Don't put your health at risk by self-medication - it could have serious side-effects. ""It's a criminal offence to supply prescription-only medicines without a valid prescription - websites offering them are acting illegally.

"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a deeply cultural thing,"" says Sir Vince, who held office during the Coalition government. ""It got built into the British mindset.... if you're clever, you go to university, and if you're not so clever you go off and do a trade of some sort,"" he says. ""It's still the case that if you're academically inclined and you don't know what to do, you go to university. ""The others are told,'Why not do an apprenticeship?' without being given much of a steer as to how to do it. ""And that's completely wrong, for many people it would be better if they went down that route from day one."" Sir Vince, who once taught Open University economics courses, is now getting back to his own educational roots. He is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University. There will be no shortage of contemporary upheavals for these online students to talk about. Sir Vince talks of a ""bizarre Alice in Wonderland world"" in which the Chinese Communists are now the advocates of free trade while the United States, under President Donald Trump, is raising the banner of protectionism. ""You've got a hard-line Communist out there defending the liberal international economic order,"" he says. He describes himself as a ""big fan of the Chinese,"" adding: ""like George Osborne."" Sir Vince had a close-up view of economic decision-making by politicians. He ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations. George Osborne's approach to cutting the deficit, in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was shaped by the rules set by US economist Kenneth Rogoff, says Sir Vince. And he says that the current rise of nationalism, populism and the push for protectionism are the direct fallout from the economic hangover from the recession. ""The real energy behind this new populism does come from 2008,"" he says. ""Real wages have declined, particularly in deprived parts of the country, public spending has been cut because of the deficit."" He says this has delivered a shock to a political system built on a post-War assumption of rising living standards. Sir Vince's new teaching project forms part of the wave of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. Moocs are also characterised by being free - and his period in office as business secretary saw him taking the controversial decision to raise university tuition fees in England to PS9,000 per year. Tuition fees have hung like a dark cloud over the Liberal Democrats ever since - but he remains a stout defender of the fee increase. ""It was the right thing to do, but very, very politically painful,"" he says. The alternative was to cut the further education budget. ""I wasn't willing to go along with that."" The fees are in effect a graduate tax, rather than a fee, he says, and the Liberal Democrats' big mistake was signing a pledge not to increase fees. He says he was ""vehemently opposed"" to this promise before the 2010 election. ""I could see that if ever we got into government, it would be a disaster. ""But there was a very strong head of steam and the leader felt he had to go along with it, and once we were in government we were inevitably exposed.""

Following successive 3-0 defeats away to Slovakia and England, he took time to consider his position but decided in November to carry on after receiving the backing of the Scottish Football Association board. As he announced his squad for the 22 March warm-up friendly against Canada, followed by the qualifier against Slovenia, Strachan underlined his belief that the Scots could still reach the 2018 finals in Russia. ""If we win that game, we will only be one point behind Slovenia, who are in second at the moment,"" he said. Strachan, whose side lie fifth with four points from four matches, insisted he had ""no idea"" how many points they might require from their final six matches to qualify, while admitting that the Scots could not afford further setbacks. ""But we are looking forward to that challenge and I think the fans will be looking forward to that challenge of going to a game that you must win,"" he said.

""Everyone who wants to see us go to the World Cup will be backing us to win this game. ""The most important thing is three points and enjoying the build-up, which we will be doing.

"Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. ""Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,"" he told the BBC. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3 to 5, he said. The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium. As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012. Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1 next year. He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover ""even though it will be impacted by Brexit."" The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, ""not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,"" Mr Ghosn said. The company will be keeping a close eye on future negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union. Nissan employs 6,700 staff at its plant in Sunderland in northern England. ""We are reasonably optimistic at the end of the day common sense will prevail from both sides,"" Mr Ghosn said. The Nissan boss thinks that the UK will continue to be a ""big partner"" for the European Union, but he said: ""The question is what will happen to customs, trade and circulation of products. ""That will determine how, and how much we will invest in the UK,"" he said. Mr Ghosn said there was ""no doubt"" that prices for Renaults, and other cars made in Europe and sold in the UK, will rise due to the falling value of the British pound. However, he thinks final prices will only be determined once the currency stabilises.",1,126
"The Public Health Wales study looks at adverse experiences in childhood (ACEs) which include parents separating. Children with four or more ACEs, around 14, are three times more likely to get lung or heart disease later in life. One senior health figure said instead of ""mending broken adults"" a focus was needed on ""building stronger children."" The findings are being published to coincide with a major international public health conference, hosted by PHW in Cardiff. It is the last of three PHW studies looking at the first 1,000 days of life. More than 2,000 adults in Wales were interviewed. The importance of giving children the best start in life has long been appreciated. But this research looks at the long term impact of bad experiences in those crucial early years and how it could mean more chronic illness and more pressure on frontline services further down the line. Those having had four or more ACEs are also: Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy and research at Public Health Wales said: ""Most of us have the odd shock in childhood and after that we relax and we're comforted by parents and our bodies develop at that lower, more relaxed level. ""But if you get constant exposure to adverse childhood experiences, your body develops at a higher state of tension, it's always looking out for more threats. ""That means as your body develops, it's used to being ready to be injured or hurt in some way and it wears out quicker. ""You're also more ill at ease, you may develop poorer metal health, you're more likely to use alcohol and drugs - and they increase your risks of ill health later on in life. All that adds up to you developing poor health, earlier."" But a child can experience adverse incidents even from within the womb. NSPCC midwife Nikki Rhys-Jones said: ""In the second trimester [the period from 13 to 27 weeks] of a woman's pregnancy, the baby can hear - so the baby will be aware of the sounds around her. ""So the baby can start relating and connecting to parents, however things like domestic abuse, violence in the household, shouting - a baby will experience that and those things will cause stress to a baby and impact on its development."" Emerging research suggests the effects could also be passed on from one generation to the next. Genomic expert Dr Tom Connor, consultant for Public Health Wales and senior lecturer at Cardiff University, said: ""As individuals, we're almost a symphony of genes, firing off at different times. ""Epigenetics [which looks at changes in genes] actually controls expression of genes - and so things like smoking and drinking can actually affect the expression of genes, which can be passed on to our children. ""There's growing evidence that the lifestyle choices we make ourselves have an effect on our children. That's an immediate effect when they're born and potentially if we do things, for example smoking which can do damage to our children's DNA, that can be a long term effect for their entire lifetime."" But this is not just a challenge for the NHS. Children who have had four or more adverse incidents are also 15 times more likely to be a perpetrator of violence, and 14 times more likely to be a victim. If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks Alun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner said the force was being made more aware of the impact of domestic incidents on children in the background - and it can only improve with all agencies working better together. ""There's tended to be an attempt to deal with those things by making referrals - pieces of paper passing from one organisation to another. You're never quite sure where they go,"" he said. But a coordinated approach is not always easy to achieve, he argues, at a time when public spending is being squeezed. ""If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks and the consequences are more complex and dangerous further down the line,"" said Mr Michael. ""There's been a general feeling within Wales we must shrink together and not shrink apart. It's more important that we don't allow those gaps, that we don't let people fall down the cracks; we work together for a joined up approach."" The Welsh Government said the evidence on the negative impact of ACEs was ""overwhelming"" and it was ""working relentlessly"" to prevent and reduce the long term impact on children who have experienced them. A spokesperson pointed to the Flying Start, Families First, and Supporting People programmes, as well as investing directly in children's health and well-being programmes. For Prof Bellis it is crucial for the future to get it right. ""The long term costs of leaving these things untreated are enormous,"" he said. ""What we've got to focus on is instead of mending broken adults we must build stronger children.""",1,127
"Diana Sacayan, a well-known activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, was found dead in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. It is the third violent transgender death in the country in the past month. Latin America accounts for most transgender murders worldwide, rights groups say. Rights group Amnesty International said on Wednesday that the body of Ms Sacayan, discovered in her flat, showed signs of violence. ""A dark cloud has set over Argentina's trans community,"" said Mariela Belski, Executive Director of Amnesty International Argentina. ""Unless this latest wave of murders is effectively investigated and those responsible taken to justice, a message will be sent that attacking trans women is actually ok."" President Fernandez echoed Amnesty's concerns. ""I ask the national security services and the metropolitan police to solve this horrible crime,"" she said during a public address. Ms Sacayan, 40, had been the leader of a number of organisations seeking equality for Argentina's LGBT community. In 2012 she was personally given her national identity card by President Fernandez, recognising her as a woman - a first for Argentina. Ms Sacayan's death followed the killings of Marcela Chocobar and Coty Olmos, two transgender women whose bodies were found over the last month in the provinces of Santa Fe and Santa Cruz.

"A report commissioned by Food Standards Scotland found that in-store promotions were heavily weighted in favour of food with high levels of salt or sugar. The Stirling University academics behind the report called for a ""retail revolution"" to help people choose healthier options. However, the study was criticised by the Scottish Grocers' Federation. It said the report failed to take account of the efforts already being made to promote healthy eating. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said Scottish obesity levels, currently 30, were projected to rise to 40 by 2030. Professor Leigh Sparks, who wrote the report, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was an imbalance in the type of food promoted in shops. ""If you look at the environment in store in retailing, then most of the promotions are pushing the products that are less healthy for consumers,"" he said. ""A lot of the products have been supersized as well - boxes of crisps, bags of crisps are good examples of that."" He said that manufacturers needed to make changes to the composition of their products, while retailers should provide more information for consumers and change their ""balance of promotions."" ""I think retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and they're looking at what they can do,"" he added. ""But most of the voluntary schemes that have gone on so far have not had the impact because of this overwhelming tide in terms of unhealthy promotions as well."" The report also backs the idea of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr Gillian Purdon said: ""The report supports Food Standards Scotland views and recommendations for the need to extend sugar tax beyond soft drinks, to reformulate products to reduce sugar fat and salt, to resize portions, address less healthy food promotion and to provide clearer consumer information on products in both the retail and out of home sectors. ""This report will help us to develop new approaches to improve the balance of food offered and promoted by the retail sector. ""It is clear that a combination of measures will be needed overall to enable healthier eating. Regulation of promotions of high fat, salt andor sugar food and drink within retail stores and out of home premises should be taken forward as a priority."" Previous research by FSS indicated about 50 of less healthy food choices are purchased on promotions. For healthier foods, the figure is about 30. The report added: ""We conclude that the current context for consumer choice in-store is affecting the health and diet of consumers in Scotland. ""Voluntary and self-regulatory approaches or relying on consumers to make'good' decisions are not having sufficient impact. ""It will thus be necessary to regulate to make the changes have real impact."" Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers' Federation, which represents food retailers in Scotland, said: ""This report seems to ignore the significant efforts of retailers to actively promote healthy products in-store and the efforts of manufacturers to reformulate products and reduce calories. ""Additionally, extending the sugar tax will make no real or lasting impact on diet-related problems. Improved food education and awareness should be the priority rather than constantly shifting the responsibility for population health onto retailers."" SGF said more than 200 stores were participating in its Scottish government-supported Healthy Living Programme. The Scottish Retail Consortium said its members were committed to helping consumers make healthier choices and called for ""regulation or legislation"" on the issue. Ewan MacDonald-Russell, its head of policy, said: ""Fruit and vegetables are heavily price promoted and there has been a proliferation of healthy alternatives. Just as importantly, our industry has led the way on reformulating products to reduce salt, sugar and fats from products, and in producing clearer and more informative labelling. ""It's worth highlighting the number of products being promoted in total is falling in response to customer demands for simpler pricing. We will continue to engage directly with FSS and the Scottish government on this issue. However, any measures on pricing and promotions will have to be done through regulation or legislation; it's not feasible, or legal, to ask retailers to voluntarily take collective measures in this area. ""Ultimately however, the best way to help improve Scotland's health is for government to take steps to ensure the whole food and drink industry is working collectively, on a level playing field, to ensure no matter where customers shop or consume they are able to make healthy informed choices.""",1,129

"Jason Van Dyke was heckled as he arrived at court where he denied six counts of first-degree murder. Video released earlier this year showing the shooting of Laquan McDonald sparked an outcry and the resignation of the chief of police. A federal investigation into the city's police is under way amid a national debate about the police use of force. The inquiry will explore whether race plays a part in the police use of force and whether officers are properly held accountable. McDonald, who was 17 at the time, was armed with a knife when he was stopped by police. But the dashcam footage showed him moving away from police when Mr Van Dyke opened fire. Step-by-step guide to what happened How a whistleblower brought down the police chief Days of protests followed the release of the video, which President Barack Obama said was ""disturbing.""

"Sharnford Traffic Action Group (STAG) said some motorists were clocked at ""eye watering"" speeds topping 100mph. It has campaigned against dangerous driving on Aston Lane and the B4114 in Leicestershire for more than 10 years. The county council has offered to install speed bumps on Aston Lane at a cost of PS12,000 to the parish council. More on this story and other news in Leicestershire Motorists have been recorded by the village's speed monitor, which is moved around Sharnford - located near Hinckley and about 11 miles (17.7 km) from Leicester. STAG, which owns the monitor, sends the speeds of the vehicles to Leicestershire Police and the county council every month. It said according to its data, more than 13,000 motorists drove above 50mph in a 30mph zone in the past year and about 562,000 since November 2015. In the space of about 15 months, a total of 2.75m vehicles travelled through the village and about one in five - around 21 - were speeding, the data suggested. The group claims that if they had the powers to fine drivers the charges would total PS5.6m. Sharnford parish councillor Mike Shirley, secretary of STAG, said: ""The eye-watering figures demonstrate the inarguable need for proper, enforceable speed monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the interests of safety."" He added that homes have been damaged, lampposts and signs felled and pedestrians knocked over by lorries trying to navigate the narrow streets. Leicestershire County Council said their own speed survey showed the village would ""not qualify"" for speed cameras and it cannot afford to build a bypass without government funding.",1,132

"She left after her GCSEs to work in a factory but the money was poor, as were the conditions. So when she got better exam results than she expected she went back to do her A-levels. In those days she dreamed of being a television newsreader. Moira Stuart was a big role model, she said. Now she is back at Tonypandy Community College - or ""Pandy Comp"" - this time to speak to sixth formers. And she has a new career aspiration in mind - winning May's assembly election. Year 12's Georgia Harrison wants to know why someone from the traditional Labour stronghold of the Rhondda opted for Plaid Cymru? Ms Wood said being a traditional Labour stronghold has held the area back. Voters are not listened to, she said, and it is time to ""shake up the political system."" The message to this group of teenagers in the Rhondda - most of whom are too young to vote - is the same message Plaid will take across Wales in the election campaign. But are voters listening? There is not a huge amount of polling data yet, but what polls there are suggest Labour is still out in front, with Plaid battling for second place. ""The polls are not where I would like them to be at the moment,"" Ms Wood told me. ""I would obviously like to see some improvement, but I think that will be achieved by making sure that we communicate with people on the ground. ""We know that there's a limit to how much of our message we can get across through the media so it is all dependent on the grassroots conversations."" Plaid's media profile was boosted last year when Ms Wood took part in the general election leaders' debates alongside David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nicola Sturgeon, Nigel Farage, Nick Clegg and Natalie Bennett. But the added publicity failed to translate into winning more seats in Parliament, in contrast to the near clean sweep of seats achieved by the Scottish Nationalists. The goal for Plaid now is to capitalise on that enhanced profile and to demonstrate that they are talking voters' language on the issues that matter most. Nine key policies - three each on health, education and the economy - will form the core of the party's assembly election campaign. It's ""absolutely clear"" that those three issues are voters' top priorities, Ms Wood said. ""And so they are our top priorities as well, and all of our focus has gone into providing solutions in those areas."" But does she encounter people who pigeonhole the party, who think Plaid prioritises the Welsh language and the constitution above everything else? ""There are still misconceptions about Plaid Cymru,"" she says. ""I was in a meeting last night in Mountain Ash in the Cynon Valley talking about just exactly these things. ""It is up to our party workers to make sure that we scotch those misconceptions."" Ms Wood is the first Plaid leader not to come from a Welsh-speaking background. She is also the party's first female leader. Now she hopes to achieve another first - to become Plaid's first First Minister.",1,135

"The IFG says legislation will be needed to establish new policies on areas such as customs and immigration. The extra measures will place ""a huge burden"" on Parliament and government departments, the think tank says. The attitude of the SNP may also affect the passage of Brexit laws, it adds. In its report, Legislating Brexit, the IFG says that with the average Queen's Speech announcing only 20 new bills, the introduction of 15 Brexit bills before the UK even exits the EU ""will leave very little space for non-Brexit related legislation."" The report comes as Theresa May travels to Swansea with Brexit Secretary David Davis, where she will talk about the ""precious union"" of the UK. The prime minister will meet First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones, as well as local businesses, as she tries to show she is including all areas of Britain in negotiations with the EU. Mrs May will say: ""I want every part of the United Kingdom to be able to make the most of the opportunities ahead."" The IFG report anticipates the new bills will be in addition to the Great Repeal Bill, which will scrap the 1972 European Communities Act that paved the way for the UK to enter the then-EEC, ending the legal authority of EU law. The IFG - an independent charity that aims to increase government effectiveness - says departments will need ""ruthlessly to prioritise"" other legislation and find non-legislative routes to get the laws through, particularly given the government's narrow Commons majority. It warns that this will mean ministers having to achieve a fine balance between giving too little parliamentary scrutiny and too prolonged, in-depth examination of Brexit-related legislation. The IFG also argued that ""a lack of clarity"" about the role the devolved legislatures will play in legislating for Brexit could pose a problem. ""The attitude that the Scottish National Party (SNP) takes to the passage of Brexit-related legislation in Westminster could affect the smoothness with which that legislation passes through Parliament if they join forces with the Labour Party and Conservative rebels,"" the report says. Dr Hannah White, IFG's director of research, said the government had finite resources to draft new legislation and Brexit bills would take a ""big chunk"" out of its capacity to legislate in other areas. ""In the first session after the 2015 election the government passed 23 bills,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""So that's roughly the capacity that there is in government to draft these bills and in Parliament, in terms of parliamentary time, to pass them."" The reality, she suggested, was that the government's domestic priorities would ""take a hit in the next couple of sessions."" ""There'll have to be some really tight prioritisation in government to work out what else is going to be done aside from the Brexit legislation. ""The legislation required for Brexit will leave little parliamentary time for anything else - and making a success of it will require a large volume of bills and secondary legislation to be passed by Parliament against a hard deadline."" The Queen gave Royal Assent to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill last week, clearing the way for Theresa May to start talks to leave the European Union. The Bill allows the prime minister to notify Brussels that the UK is leaving the EU, with a two-year process of exit negotiations to follow. Mrs May says she will trigger the process by the end of the month.",1,137
"The striker took his tally to five goals in two games when hitting the opener and winner in an ABAX Stadium thriller. Marriott fired Posh ahead two minutes into the second half with a low shot that crept in courtesy of a kiss off the inside of the far post. But Rotherham were soon back on level terms as Kieffer Moore, who like Marriott hit a hat-trick in his previous league appearance, headed in captain Lee Frecklington's left-wing cross. Marriott then steered a Marcus Maddison cross against a post to be denied by the woodwork for the second time after seeing an early effort hit the underside of the crossbar. Rotherham thought they had hit the front moments later only to see their celebrations cut short by a raised flag when Jamie Proctor nodded in from close range. But a cracking contest was settled with 15 minutes to go when Marriott got the better of dithering defender Semi Ajayi and lobbed a glorious finish over stranded Rotherham goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell.

"Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Herbert Diess, head of the VW brand, said the company would have a fix in the coming weeks or months. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was less certain, saying that Volkswagen ""have not produced an acceptable way forward."" The EPA disclosed VW's use of ""defeat devices"" in diesel cars in September. The devices disguised diesel cars' emissions levels that were, in fact, up to 40 times above the US legal limit. The EPA has insisted that the German carmaker comes up with a solution that will not cost money for VW owners. Mr Diess told the CES show, in Las Vegas: ""I'm optimistic that we will find a solution. We will bring a package together which satisfies our customers first and foremost and then also the regulators."" Mr Diess said Volkswagen has reached an agreement with European regulators to fix 8.5 million cars affected there.

"This year's award was won jointly by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian peace activist, and Yemeni pro-democracy campaigner Tawakkol Karman. They were recognised for their ""non-violent struggle"" for women's safety and for women's rights to participate in peace-building work. Chinese lawyer Liu Xiaobo won in 2010. Each of this year's winners was presented with a gold medal and a diploma. The prize money of 1.5 million (PS958,000) will be shared between them. Mrs Sirleaf, 72, is Africa's first elected female head of state and is credited with helping to end Liberia's 14 year civil war. The announcement of her award came days before the country's presidential election. She went on to win a run-off poll last month but her rival boycotted the vote alleging the first round was rigged. The Liberian president told delegates that she was honoured to be following in the footsteps of the Africans who had won the prize before her, including South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Kofi Annan, the Ghana-born former UN secretary-general. Mrs Sirleaf also expressed her ""deepest sympathy"" for the people of Norway in the wake of the twin attacks carried out by Anders Behring Breivik on 22 July that led to the deaths of 77 people. ""On behalf of all the women of Liberia, the women of Africa, and women everywhere in the world who have struggled for peace, justice and equality, I accept with humility the 2011 Nobel Prize for Peace,"" she said. Ms Gbowee, 39, led a peaceful campaign to end Liberia's civil war and oust its ex-President Charles Taylor. She said: ""I am humbled and honoured to have been selected and I receive the prize in the name of women who continue to work for peace, equality and justice across the world."" ""I believe that the prize this year not only recognises our struggle in Liberia and Yemen.

"The availability of psychoactive drugs was also a concern following a spate of hospital admissions. Progress had been made since the last report but concerns remained, the chief inspector of prisons said. The National Offender Management Service said it would ""work hard to improve."" HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) carried out the inspection last autumn during 29 September and 3 October. Inspectors said levels of violence had risen since the last inspection and ""were now considerably higher than in similar prisons."" They said not enough was being done to ""investigate individual violent incidents"" and the prison was not dealing with perpetrators and victims. Concern was also raised over the ""availability of new psychoactive substances such as'Spice - a substance which is a synthetic cannabinoid and acts like cannabis. The inspection report cited seven ""Spice-related emergency admissions to hospital"" in the past six months. But ""the governor and staff had made huge efforts to respond to recommendations,"" HMIP said in its report. Inspectors said they were ""pleased"" to find ""a marked improvement in the staff culture and attitudes of staff since 2013."" They also said mental health provision was ""very good,"" with prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm feeling ""well-supported."" But although ""considerable progress"" had been made, the prison still required support to make further improvements. Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said: ""HMP Bristol has come a long way in a relatively short time since the last inspection. ""The distance the prison has already travelled has involved real determination, hard work and resilience from managers and staff which needs to be recognised.

"Stephen Pearson and Martyn Woolford gave the hosts a deserved half-time lead after a dominant first half. Joe Mason's header gave Cardiff hope, but a slick counter attack saw Woolford restore the two-goal advantage. Cardiff again replied through Heidar Helguson only for debutant Sam Baldock to finally put the result beyond doubt with three minutes remaining. Bristol City's final two goals epitomised the difference between the two sides as they broke with pace and purpose to rip open Cardiff's defence. Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors, who offered virtually nothing in the first half of a match which kicked off before the day's other Championship fixtures, sorely missed Craig Bellamy's penetration as the starting front three of Helguson, debutant Tommy Smith and Don Cowie failed to make any impact. Mason's introduction and a change of formation at half-time transformed Cardiff, giving manager Malky Mackay food for thought as he considers how best to mould a new-look side. But there were plenty of positives for Robins manager Derek McInnes as his side scored four goals for a successive Championship match to secure only a second win over Cardiff in the last 10 league meetings. Bristol City's pressure gradually grew as the first half wore on, with the pacey Albert Adomah exploiting the space vacated by Cardiff's advancing full-backs. Adomah wasted the first clear chance when he shot wide and then Ryan Taylor's header found the side netting. But the opener was a complete gift as Aron Gunnarsson's misplaced pass deep in his own half exposed the Cardiff defence. Adomah penetrated before his cut-back found Pearson, who arced the ball into the bottom-left corner from the just inside the penalty area. The outstanding Jonathan Stead was the next architect as more sloppy Cardiff play led to the home side's second on the stroke of half-time. The rangy striker used his frame to protect the ball and the on-rushing Woolford passed the ball past Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall. Mackay responded to his side's lacklustre show by replacing Gunnarsson with Mason, and the change bore immediate dividends as the substitute found space in a crowded six-yard box to head home after Peter Whittingham's corner. The Bluebirds, back in their more familiar blue shirts, immediately found more purpose and energy, with Mason's direct running finally testing the home defenders. Whittingham, whose long-range efforts were all Cardiff managed in the first half, went close with another shot after Smith had broken through. But the Robins responded to the warning signs with a textbook counter attack to score their third. The Cardiff defence, which included debutant Matthew Connolly in Ben Turner's absence with injury, was ripped apart down the middle and Woolford had a simple task to score after Baldock's shot rebounded off the post. Helguson, scoring his first league goal since joining Cardiff from Queens Park Rangers, ensured a tense final minutes when he slotted through Tom Heaton's legs. But the home nerves were calmed five minutes later when Baldock, a 64th-minute substitute, ensured a scoring debut when he beat Marshall after being played through the heart of the static Cardiff defence. Bristol City manager Derek McInnes: ""We are getting goals from the middle of the park, which we didn't do last season and now have some great options up front. ""With Sam [Baldock] and Steve [Davies] on board, we have a lot of different strikers, who pose threats in various ways. All the clubs I have been at, who were successful, had good strength in depth when it came to strikers. ""It is very early days, but after last season I'm delighted to be challenging at the right end of the table even at this stage of the campaign."" Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay: ""Without taking anything away from Bristol's performance, we conceded some bad goals. ""We gave the ball away in poor areas, which is not like us. We started the season defensively strong, but today we didn't keep to that standard. ""If you gift possession to good teams they are going to punish you. We will look at the DVD and identify where we could have done a lot better."" Live text commentary",1,143

Asked to pinpoint what has led to Alan Solomons' men losing five of their last six matches in all competitions, he replied: ""It's hard to know exactly what's gone wrong. ""We have let ourselves down with errors, a couple of soft tries at times, which have killed us. ""Sometimes these breaks between the Six Nations (games) don't help, you lose a bit of momentum, but this morning we had a good session so we are looking at things we need to improve on, just little things. ""The guys who haven't been away with the national squad are good enough to win these games. ""It's just touching up on our detail and being clinical and finishing the opportunities that we get and in the last few games we just haven't managed to do that.""",1,145
"But they have also had three points deducted after the game on 14 October was disrupted when a drone flew over the stadium with a political message. The drone carried a pro-Albania flag. Crowd disturbance and a brawl between players followed at Partizan Stadium. Both countries have confirmed they will appeal against the rulings. Uefa's Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) deemed that Albania had forfeited the match and in doing so lost 3-0. But it also decided to penalise Serbia over the crowd trouble. It ruled Serbia must also play two home qualifying games behind closed doors and fined both FAs 100,000 euros each. A statement from the Serbian FA confirmed it will submit an appeal within five days of receiving Uefa's full written decisions. The Albanian FA earlier released a similar response. Bardhyl Minxhozi, a senior member of the Albanian Football Federation's executive committee, told BBC Sport it was ""a very sad day for European football."" Media playback is not supported on this device He added: ""It's a very disappointing decision, not only for Albanian fans from a football point of view, but it's a decision which is unacceptable from a legal and a technical point of view. ""We have a very dangerous precedent from this decision."" Serbia will have to play their Group I Euro 2016 qualifiers against Denmark and Armenia in an empty stadium. The match between the Balkan sides earlier this month, at which no away fans were permitted, was interrupted late in the first half when a flag depicting a notional'Greater Albania', was flown over the terraces and pitch by what appeared to be a remote-controlled drone. Serbia's Stefan Mitrovic grabbed the flag, prompting an angry reaction from Albanian players. A brawl between the players followed after several Albanian players snatched the flag from Mitrovic and they then had to run into the tunnel for cover as some home fans invaded the pitch and attacked them. Premier League referee Martin Atkinson suspended play in the 41st minute with the score at 0-0 and Uefa confirmed the match had been abandoned after a delay of about 30 minutes. Albanian fans had been banned from entering the stadium by Uefa on safety grounds and the match was set against a backdrop of tight security. There are long-standing tensions between the nations over Kosovo, the province with which both share a disputed border, and which is recognised as independent by the United States and major European Union countries. It is not recognised as independent by Serbia - a bone of contention with Albania. The two sides are due to meet in their return fixture next October.",1,146
"Prime Minister David Cameron announced the deal as he started a Jamaica visit. The project has been agreed to break the deadlock in negotiations over a prisoner transfer deal between the two countries. More than 600 Jamaican nationals are in UK jails but cannot be deported because of Jamaica's poor prison conditions. Officials say the foreign aid-funded deal could save taxpayers PS10m a year when transfers begin in 2020. More than 300 existing offenders are expected to be sent back under the Jamaica prison scheme, which covers those sentenced to at least four years who have 18 months or more left to serve in custody. Currently they cannot be sent to Jamaica because of fears that jail conditions in the country would allow a successful challenge under human rights law. Jamaica is third highest in the list of foreign countries with nationals serving prison sentences in the UK.. Almost 70 of the Jamaicans in prison in Britain are serving sentences for violence and drug offences. The UK is contributing about 40 of the cost of building the planned jail, which would hold 1,500 people. Mr Cameron, who had been at the United Nations in New York for talks on the fight against the Islamic State group, said: ""It is absolutely right that foreign criminals who break our laws are properly punished but this shouldn't be at the expense of the hard-working British taxpayer,"" he said. ""That's why this agreement is so important. It will mean Jamaican criminals are sent back home to serve their sentences, saving the British guard of honourtaxpayer millions of pounds but still ensuring justice is done. ""And it will help Jamaica by helping to provide a new prison, strengthening their criminal justice system."" Mr Cameron, the first British prime minister to visit the island in 14 years, is also set to announce PS300m of aid funding on infrastructure projects across the Caribbean, including roads, bridges and ports. He said the regional infrastructure fund, which will be delivered in collaboration with the Caribbean Development Bank, would help support economic growth in the Caribbean. Mr Cameron was greeted on his arrival at Kingston Airport by an honour guard and national anthems before he visited RFA Lyme Bay, the British ship currently on anti-drug smuggling and emergency relief duties in the Caribbean. He is due to finish the day by having talks with Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and attending a reception. BBC political correspondent Carole Walker says that the PM has said he wants to improve a neglected relationship between the UK and Jamaica.",1,147
"Chernova, now 27, beat Briton Ennis-Hill to gold at the 2011 World Championships in Korea. This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-tested - but kept her world title. ""She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use,"" Minichiello said. Russian anti-doping agency punished Chernova with a two-year ban, backdated to 22 June 2013. It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before she won world gold in Daegu with a personal best of 6,880 points, beating defending champion Ennis-Hill's 6,751. Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken. Minichiello wants athletics' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to have a ""long, hard look"" at the Russian anti-doping agency's punishment. The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action. ""Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test,"" added Minichiello. ""I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time. Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective."" Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics. ""It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them,"" said Minichiello. ""That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at."" Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences. Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year. The IAAF said last week it was concerned about the number of Russian doping cases in the sport.",1,148
"Ron Stone has been described as a ""true champion"" of St George West, the ward he had represented on Bristol City Council since 1985. The leader of the Labour group at the council, Helen Holland, said: ""Ron will be remembered as a steadfast campaigner and committed socialist."" Mr Stone died aged 73 on Wednesday. Ms Holland said he was ""dedicated to furthering social justice and equality in Bristol and beyond."" She added: ""The Labour Party has lost one of its most committed councillors. ""Bristol is a better city because of Ron Stone's unwavering public service."" The city's mayor, George Ferguson, said Mr Stone had ""an undying passion for Bristol."" ""I always enjoyed his directness and wry humour - even when directed at me. ""As a councillor for St George West for 30 years, Ron had a vast knowledge of his neighbourhood and the people he served, making him an excellent ward councillor who made a real difference. ""With his keen sense of social justice, Ron made an enormous contribution to life in Bristol. He was an'establishment rebel', always without his civic robes but seldom without his camera, recording people and events."" Mr Stone's roles at the council included chairing the licensing committee and the St George Neighbourhood Partnership. The lord mayor of Bristol, councillor Clare Campion-Smith, said: ""Ron was a hugely dedicated councillor who made a great contribution to his community, constituents, the council and the city over his 30 years of service. ""He was an active and passionate councillor whose presence in the chamber enlivened and enriched any debate.""",1,149

"Speaking during a parliamentary debate, Philip Hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister Jo Johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well. The debate came after a petition to restrict the use of fireworks attracted more than 100,000 names. The petition, which called for restrictions on when fireworks can be used, was started by Jill Cutsforth, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Julie Doorne, from Sleaford, Lincolnshire in a bid to reduce stress and fear in people and animals. But, Mr Hollobone, MP for Kettering, called for the government to go further. He said: ""I think there's great merit in saying all fireworks displays need to be licensed with a licensed operator, and frankly, amateur family-organised fireworks displays in people's back gardens are basically rubbish."" Labour's Angela Smith, a member of the the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, also backed the petition, arguing that restricting the number of days the public and organised events can set off fireworks should be restricted. She said: ""Ideally, we would end the use of fireworks in back gardens. But I do understand the difficulty in delivering that as policy."" Instead, she called for tighter regulations to govern how people use fireworks. Mr Johnson acknowledged the concerns raised but said restricting their use to traditional holidays would be ineffective. ""It is likely that those who already use fireworks in an anti-social or inconsiderate way would not be deterred by further regulation,"" he said. He added: ""Restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales, leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses."" Bracknell MP Phillip Lee also warned the debate that restricting the number of days that displays are permitted could reduce the viability of well-performing fireworks businesses. The government said following the debate it would continue to monitor the situation closely.",1,151
"Jamie Spendiff's attack on Craig Logie, who was out with friends on a stag night, was captured on CCTV. Spendiff took part in a further assault on other men with a co-accused after killing the married 36-year-old last August. Spendiff, 26, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing in July. In CCTV footage shown to the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr Logie could be seen lying motionless on the ground after the assault. Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court: ""Witnesses speak to hearing the sound of a crack as the deceased's head hit the ground and he did not move thereafter."" The construction manager suffered a brain injury and fracture to the back of his head following the attack at Friars Street on 7 August. Spendiff, of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, admitted assaulting and killing Mr Logie by punching him on the head causing him to fall to the ground where he struck his head. He also pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace along with Shaun McCarthy by conducting themselves in a disorderly manner and fighting with others. Both also pled guilty to assaulting Paul Stubberfield and Stuart McKee in a taxi in Friars Street. The court heard that Spendiff and McCarthy had gone out drinking for the evening after working together as technicians on wind turbines. Mr Brown said that everyone appeared to be in good spirits, but a member of the stag party and another drinker then became involved in a heated argument. After patrons left the pub, a general melee broke out which ended with the fatal blow to Mr Logie. Mr Brown said: ""Spendiff punched the deceased, who again had his arms up and out to the side, once on the face with force causing him to collapse to the ground. ""He swung another punch at the deceased as he fell but missed. ""With the deceased now on the ground Spendiff initially moved away before returning and danced round the deceased, at all times being moved away by the accused McCarthy and at one stage a female passer-by."" Mark Stewart QC, for Spendiff, said the killer had expressed his sorrow for the victim and his family. Judge Lady Stacey remanded both accused in custody, saying the culpable homicide charge had ""led to tragic consequences and a man has lost his life.""",1,152
"The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their captain and colour sergeant. It took place in February while on exercise in Kenya. Fifteen were sentenced to detention, one of whom was dismissed from the Army. A 16th was also dismissed. All the soldiers pleaded guilty to disobeying a lawful command - an offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. The soldiers complained of being ""led by muppets,"" the court martial heard. The prosecutor at the court martial said members of the platoon had been seething at the way they were being managed, and felt that they were ""not appreciated."" The court heard a captain and sergeant apparently got drunk before a lengthy training march in the Brecon Beacons last winter. The troops were said to have been furious at finding their two commanders asleep, rather than greeting the soldiers as they crossed the finish line. Tensions came to a head at the end of a training exercise in Kenya in February, when 16 soldiers decided to protest. Ahead of a parade, a ringleader shouted ""sit down"" and members of the platoon did so. The commanders ordered each man in turn to stand up, but were ignored. Corporal Anthony Brown, said to be the ringleader, was stripped of his rank, dismissed from the Army and sentenced to 60 days' detention. Two lance corporals were reduced to privates and sentenced to 60 days' detention, while a third was reduced to private and dismissed without detention. Twelve privates were sentenced to 40 days' detention. The soldiers were in the 1st Battalion at the time of the protest. However, the 1st has now become the 2nd, following Army restructuring. John Wilson, a retired colonel and former editor of the British Army Review who lectures in military history, described the nature of the soldiers' protest as ""unprecedented."" The sentences given to the troops at the court martial were ""strong enough to make the point,"" added Col Wilson. ""I don't think a corporal, whatever his grievances, can expect to orchestrate such a public protest in front of the entire battle group parade and get away with it."" An Army spokesman said it was ""not appropriate"" to comment on the sentencing.",1,153

"As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday. Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that has happened. He said the deal - an effort to deal with diseased larch - was a success. Although he was happy with the decision, Mr Roberts admitted that its documentation was ""not good,"" that there should have been more discussion with Welsh Government and that the executive board could have had a greater role in scrutinising the deal. A member of the committee, Lee Waters, later dubbed the answers ""unconvincing."" In 2014 a company was awarded a PS39m deal to purchased both spruce and larch timber - the latter of which was forests where a fungus disease causing extensive damage - Phytophthora ramorum - was present. No other company was given the opportunity to bid for the contracts. As part of that deal the company was meant to have built a new saw line by 31 March 2016. That deadline was missed and extended by 12 months to March 2017. During a session of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Labour Llanelli AM Lee Waters asked Mr Roberts if the line had been built. ""We are in on going discussions with the operator on that,"" said Mr Roberts. Mr Waters pressed him again, pointing out that the date of the committee's meeting was 28 March. Mr Roberts repeated the answer, adding later it was a ""commercial matter."" Mr Waters asked if Mr Roberts felt the firm ""pulled the wool over your eyes in making you feel that the only way they were going to deal with this crisis was by investing in new expensive capital equipment."" Mr Roberts replied with a denial: ""No, I don't think they have pulled the wool over our eyes at all."" ""At the time, there was no market for larch,"" he said, claiming timber merchants at the time ""would not touch larch, let alone diseased larch."" ""What the operator did and the rest of the industry did was actually build up that market."" Mr Roberts said there was a ""real crisis on our hands at the time"" and there had been a danger the timber market would collapse. ""The situation today was a lot more stable than it was in 2013-14. Our policy, our decisions on these contracts together with the overarching policy in treating larch disease has been successful,"" he said. ""It's stopped the spread, but it's meant the timber market has been able to carry on as well."" A report by auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas released earlier in March expressed doubt over whether the decision met state aid rules and said the decision-making process was not transparent. In a qualification to the body's accounts he said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful. NRW disputed the auditor's findings on state aid and had said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful. Neither NRW or the auditors have identified the company involved. Following the meeting Mr Waters said the answers given by the chief executive ""were not satisfactory"" and that the evidence was ""unconvincing."" He said it was a ""serious issue which has been badly handled."" Mr Waters said it was clear from the evidence ""with two days to go before the end of March the saw mill line has not been installed by this company."" ""I think the whole committee felt that the performance was complacent and this was a sufficiently grave situation for the auditor general to qualify the accounts, which rarely happens,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I think the committee will be referring this to the full assembly to draw this to their attention,"" he said.",1,157
"It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister. ""There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And that's Benjamin Netanyahu. ""I say to my friends here on the left that they should not be opening the champagne after these results."" Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. ""I am going to seek as broad a government as possible,"" he said. "" I'm going to seek out many partners."" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away. Israel and the wider Middle East must now wait to see what sort of government will eventually emerge.",1,158
"The UK must go further to ensure those settling learn English ""so they can be more integrated into our country."" Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said the last government had made progress on the issue, but more had to be done. He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English. Conservative MP for Keighley Kris Hopkins asked if the PM agreed that there was ""a responsibility and an obligation"" on parents to make sure their children can speak English when they start school. Mr Cameron replied: ""I completely agree.... in too many cases this isn't happening."" Since last autumn, people from outside the EU applying for a visa to join their spouse or partner now have to prove they have a basic command of English before their application is approved. Previously, visa applicants had to show only that their marriage or partnership was genuine and that they could financially support themselves. The prime minister told the Commons: ""The last government did make some progress on making sure people learnt English when they came to our country, I think we need to go further. ""If you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly from the Indian sub-continent, we should be putting in place - and we will be putting in place - tougher rules to make sure they do learn English and so when they come, if they come, they can be more integrated into our country."" The weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions was dominated by foreign affairs with Labour leader Ed Miliband focusing all his six questions on events in Egypt and the UK's mission in Afghanistan. Mr Miliband, who visited Afghanistan for the first time as Labour leader last week, paid an extended tribute to soldiers' work there, acknowledged the difference in the Commons session from the normal political point scoring. Mr Cameron welcomed the opportunity to have a ""serious conversation"" about the work of British soldiers in Afghanistan, saying they wanted politicians to discuss their efforts, although he also noted many MPs often ""preferred a bunfight"" about domestic issues.",1,159
"As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile. He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football. ""I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,"" he said. ""The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper. ""It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence."" He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better. ""You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march."" E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe. ""In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,"" he said. ""Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going. ""We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next."" But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale. ""The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,"" he said. ""We asked,'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question. ""We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums. ""Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football. ""Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up."" Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau. ""You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,"" he said. ""Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes. ""But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared.'We didn't need to know','they didn't know','it was nothing', and even if it was, then'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'."" ""I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through. ""Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves."" As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs. ""We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria."" ""I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone."" Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones. ""I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,"" he said. ""I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.""",1,160
"Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane. About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's roster of 3,500 possible trips. The firm's boss, Justin Francis, took the decision after watching a BBC TV programme ""Should we close our zoos?"" ""Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant,"" he told the BBC. ""They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up."" Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity. Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK. The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad. It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago. It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species. Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays. Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer. The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation. Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments,"" said the president of Born Free, Will Travers. ""A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide,"" he added. Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision. ""They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree,"" he said.",1,161
"Radical preachers will be banned from posting material online and anyone with convictions for extremist activity will be barred from working with children. Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for others deemed a threat. But Muslim leaders warned the strategy ""continues down a flawed path"" and risks ""alienating"" Muslims in the UK. Also among the measures within the counter-extremism strategy are: Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would work because it was ""comprehensive."" ""It's no good leaving this simply to the police or the intelligence services. It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,"" he said. He said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having ""more cohesive and integrated communities."" Home Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go ""uncontested"" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities ""from the mainstream."" She said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine. The Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans. Secretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would ""reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country."" ""These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,"" he said. Dr Shafi also said he detected ""McCarthyist undertones"" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists. Mr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a ""missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community."" But Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could ""help in the battle against those who promote extremism."" Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent At the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law. Getting inciteful content off the web and getting ""counter narrative"" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered. There has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about. The process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing. On the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy. The government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right. Police estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the government believes tackling non-violent extremism is key to stemming the flow of people. Parents of children aged under 16 have had the power to request the cancellation of passports - even where a child has taken or hidden the actual document - since July. That power is being extended to parents of 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing families to contact a passport office where officials will investigate their concerns before a final decision is taken by the home secretary. Mrs May said the measure had only been used by ""a small number"" of parents since July, but it was part of a package of new powers that would help tackle extremism. Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was ""crucial we get the balance right"" and that Mr Cameron must ""be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcements amounted to ""rhetoric that may well divide communities and make our job of working with those communities to find and isolate terrorists and potential terrorists that much harder.""",1,162
"Venera Minakhmetova died when she was struck by lorry at Bow Roundabout, on Wednesday. The Russian, who had been on the Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) just before the collision, was the fourth of five cyclists to die in London in nine days. Her sister Dina said: ""If you know something, if you witnessed it, please come forward and contact police."" She also thanked people for their support following her sister's death. Ms Minakhmetova had worked at London-based Edelau and investment bank Merrill Lynch and was living in the Bethnal Green area to develop her financial services business. So far this year, 13 cyclists have been killed, eight of which have involved HGVs. The leader of Southwark Council, Peter John, has called for HGVs to be banned during rush hour to protect cyclists. Currently, the movement of HGVs are restricted in London between 21:00 and 0700 on weekdays, and between 13:00 on Saturdays through to 07:00 on Mondays. Speaking to BBC Sunday Politics London Ben Plowden, of Transport for London, said the Olympics showed it was possible to achieve a very significant change in when and how deliveries take place. ""Something like a fifth of freight activity moved out of the busiest times in the day and that was because we worked closely with the boroughs and the councils, the freight industry and the supermarkets and other people to make that happen,"" he said. ""So what that shows is you can make a big change, the question is how do you make that part of everyday life rather than a one-off thing for the Olympics?"" Catherine West, head of transport on London Councils, said a balance was needed so that Londoners could get a good night's sleep. ""A lot of people live on busy roads and they live above shops. We just have to be mindful that a lorry delivery at 4am may not be great for residents,"" she said.",1,163
"Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute, failed to return from a plant-hunting trip to the northern mountainous area. He has not been seen since 2 November, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house in Sapa. Mr Taggart, 41, runs Linn Botanic Gardens in the village of Cove on the Rosneath peninsula and serves the area as a retained firefighter. Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed about his disappearance. Friend and fellow botanist Ian Sinclair, who has been liaising with the search parties, said they had been hampered by horrendous weather. ""The snow is continuing to melt, but there is a massive amount of snow damage to the forest such as collapsed trees,"" he said. ""The weather has been horrendous, with snow down to Sapa. This is extremely unusual as Sapa is upper tropical rainforest. ""A large group from the national park will be doing an intensive search once the snow melts."" A search due to begin on Tuesday will concentrate on four trails inside the forest of Lai Chau and Lao Cai, he said. Family and friends of Mr Taggart in his hometown of Cove have issued an appeal for funds to help cover the cost of the search. A Facebook page - Jamie Taggart Search - has also been set up. Organisations and individuals have so far raised thousands of pounds, including six-year-old Annie Ferguson of Cove who donated her PS14.50 savings. The botanist's father, Jim Taggart, found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on 29 November. He had arrived at a guest house in Sapa on 30 October and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills. On 2 November his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation. Dr Taggart previously told BBC Radio Scotland that he had received a handful of text messages from his son before contact stopped. ""I don't think he had got lost. Either something happened to him on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at,"" he said. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ""We are still in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.""",1,164
"In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra PS84m annually. Economist Gillian Paull told BBC Wales the ""upper limit"" could reach PS200m if ""nearly all"" parents took up the offer. The Welsh Government said it was currently analysing the likely costs. The promise to provide 30 hours free childcare a week was one of Labour's key election pledges and is now part of its five-year programme for government. The childcare will be made available to working parents of three- and four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year. In a report for the Welsh Government in February, Ms Paull, of Frontier Economics, produced various cost estimates for the policy. It said the cost would be PS84m a year if the childcare was offered to working parents and if 87 of them took up the offer at a cost of PS5 per hour. However, Ms Paull warned that she thought the policy was unlikely to encourage many non-working parents to take up jobs. The Welsh Government insists the policy will remove one of the ""major barriers to employment."" Ms Paull said if the policy proved to be successful in enabling large numbers of parents take up jobs, its annual cost would increase considerably. ""The cost estimate [in the report] is based on a very small response in working behaviour,"" she told the Sunday Politics Wales programme. ""If there is a bigger response, the cost could be considerably higher. ""A reasonable upper limit would be around PS200m, based on an extreme response of nearly all parents becoming eligible by working."" David Dallimore, a social policy researcher at Bangor University, warned that money would also have to be spent expanding the availability of childcare in Wales, which he claimed was already ""patchy."" ""It's very dependent on where you live,"" he said. ""Wales has a measurably lower rate of childcare than other nations in the UK. ""In Wales it's about 30 childcare places for every 100 children - it's about 40 in England and it's nearly 50 in Scotland."" He added: ""I think there's a lot of concern within the sector that there isn't enough provision to be able to deliver this [policy] in the current form we have."" Indicating the end of the Communities First anti-poverty programme on Tuesday, Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant cited the childcare policy as a way of helping parents find work. ""Across government we are ensuring prosperity for all,"" he said. ""The creation of a generous childcare offer for working parents will help to remove one of the major barriers to employment."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We know there are issues with capacity and cost in some parts of Wales and we are working with the childcare sector to address this. ""We are also currently undertaking complex modelling of costs. ""We have a cost range, and the purpose of our modelling and analysis is to look at key factors such as the number of eligible children, take-up rates, number of hours utilised and hourly cost, all of which impact on the overall cost estimates.""

"Alistair Spagnoletti, 21, of Luton, and Curtis Walker, 23, of Watford, pleaded guilty to controlling a child at Harrow Crown Court. Callum Ward, 19, of Watford, was found guilty of the same charge. Police said the men groomed a 17-year-old girl into prostitution in one of the most ""damaging"" cases of child sexual exploitation they had seen. Det Sgt Iain MacPherson, of Hertfordshire police, said: ""This is one of the most damaging cases of child sexual exploitation we have encountered in Hertfordshire. ""It has also been an extremely complex case. These men had groomed their 17-year-old victim into having sex with men for money which they took, she believed that by providing her with food, drink, drugs, they were looking after her and they were people she could trust. ""The power they wielded over her was so great that she felt she could not support police action against them. Sadly she may never recover from what they have done to her. ""These acts are deplorable and I am in no doubt these men pose a risk to other children. It is right they are now serving time in prison.""

Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were ""absolutely supportive"" of his decision and that he has ""wrapped up"" his affairs and was ""ready to go"" to ""put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort."" ""I can't do anything but lie here thinking'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,"" he said. He added the doctors and nurses ""do their best for me"" but that it was ""not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that."" He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die."" Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this.

"Tandridge District Council leader Martin Fisher gave planners a shortlist of five areas for such a scheme. He said one new Surrey village is better than ""scatter-gunning"" homes and cramping the current infrastructure. But Andrea Watson from Lingfield Parish Council said it will not solve infrastructure problems and there has been ""poor local consultation."" Areas around Godstone, Blindley Heath, Redhill Aerodrome, Chaldon and Lingfield are all in the running under the new Local Plan. The district is 94 greenbelt and Mr Fisher said the council cannot meet the government's housing targets without building on some of it. In January, the government announced Longcross as the site of one of 14 garden villages across the country. Councillor Fisher said: ""The key is infrastructure. If you do the scattergun approach you may put 300 houses somewhere and that might deliver you half an extra classroom. ""Whereas if you put 4,000 house in a new village you can actually plan the proper infrastructure in for the village [and] it's relieving the pressure on the health centres and the schools in other parts of the district."" But Mrs Watson claimed most people interested in the new homes will be London commuters, where the most pressing housing shortage lies, and so ""London needs to solve the problem it is now trying to devolve to us."" She added: ""The new settlement will not solve the infrastructure problems, and the infrastructure will not come until many houses have been built, if it comes at all.""

"The incident on 23 April involved a Russian SU-27 Flanker fighter and a US intelligence-gathering RC-135U. The US plane was flying a routine mission in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk, officials said. The incident came amid tension between the US and Russia over Russia's involvement in Ukraine. ""The SU-27 approached the RC-135 and crossed the nose of the US aircraft,"" Lt Col Myles Caggins III told the BBC. The Russian aircraft manoeuvred aggressively and exposed its belly to the American pilots to demonstrate it was armed with air-to-air missiles, Defense News and CNN reported. US and Russian defence officials are said to have later discussed the incident. Earlier in April, another Russian fighter jet made repeated low-altitude passes over US Navy destroyer Donald Cook in the Black Sea.

Closures remain in place in Devon at Slapton, Taw and Torridge and in Jersey. An FSA spokesman said: ""Recent tests have shown high levels of E.coli contamination in 30 shellfish beds in Cornwall and Devon. ""However, a number of factors have led us to question circumstances which may have led to these unusual results, including the unprecedented nature of the results, the lack of a clear cause and the fact that other testing does not support the view that there is an obvious risk to public health.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Bottom side United's first win in Perth in four years, and Kilmarnock's draw away to Partick Thistle, means the gap between them is down to five points.

Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan Dow had put United into a deserved lead midway through the first half. However, Saints came back into the match and when Coll Donaldson was sent off for denying Chris Kane an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the visiting fans may have feared another damaging day in their bid to avoid automatic relegation. St Johnstone midfielder Murray Davidson hit the crossbar as the home side pressed for an equaliser but United held firm. ""We still have a long way to go but that was a small step towards it,"" continued Paatelainen. ""The mood is positive. Killie will pick up points so we need to be strong.

""I'm really pleased with everybody's effort."" Saints manager Tommy Wright was frustrated at his team's lack of bite in the first quarter of the match. ""Up until they scored we didn't compete well enough, didn't make enough tackles, didn't win enough first headers or second headers,"" he lamented. ""I thought we got a slap in the face with the goal and we were much better after that. Probably they've defended well enough overall to win the game. ""When you give a team something to hold on to, even with 10 men, it makes it really difficult."" Alan Mannus had made two impressive saves prior to the United goal but he will have been disappointed to have allowed Dow's shot past him. ""I think in the build-up to the goal we should have done better,"" said Wright. ""We dropped too deep and we should have dealt with the cross better. He got a free contact inside the box.

"Tevez, who missed a penalty against Wigan last Saturday, was back on the bench for the midweek Champions League game against Napoli.

I don't know if he is happy but every player that can't play is not happy. This is normal. ""He will have his moment."" The form of fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero, who have scored six league goals apiece so far this season, mean that the 27-year-old Argentina international's chances have been limited, while Mario Balotelli has also played just one league game.

"Scotland's health boards paid more than PS20m in overtime and additional pay to some doctors in 201516, up from the PS14m paid out in 201415. The British Medical Association said there were not enough consultants. But Health Secretary Shona Robison said overtime was a ""tiny percentage"" of the overall spend on consultants. And she said the government was ""determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland."" The BBC asked all 186 organisations running NHS hospitals in the UK about overtime and extra payments over the last three years. Across the UK, overtime and additional payments have increased by more than a third, to PS168m, in 201516 - with one doctor in Lancashire making almost PS375,000 in the space of 12 months. In total, 23 NHS trusts had to pay at least one consultant more than PS100,00 for extra work, with another 39 paying at least one more than PS50,000. Much of the overtime work involves non-emergency procedures designed to meet waiting times targets. It is up to hospitals to negotiate their own rates for extra work, with the most lucrative ones in place for routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements. Consultants doing overtime in these areas commonly make PS600 for a four-hour shift - three to four times what they normally get. Overtime for urgent and emergency work tends to be much lower - around PS300 for a shift. Of Scotland's 14 health boards, 12 responded to the freedom of information requests. This showed spending going up from PS14.27m in 201314 to PS20.92m in 201516. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde paid out the most, with an outlay of PS7,749,870 on higher rate payments for additional shifts, while NHS Orkney did not make any payments. NHS Grampian had the greatest increase in payments, from zero in 201314 to PS1.6m two years later. There were also sharp increases at NHS Lanarkshire, from PS1.8m to PS3.4m, and NHS Lothian, from PS1.3m to PS2.1m. A number of hospitals asked about the payments UK-wide said there was a shortage of consultants, meaning they had to try to get existing staff to do extra work. They also said high emergency-room pressures had led to the cancellation of more routine treatments, increasing the need for overtime. A spokesman for the British Medical Association said: ""The fact is the NHS is only paying overtime on this scale because it does not have enough doctors to do the work."" However, Scotland's health secretary insisted that consultant staffing was at a record high. Ms Robison said: ""NHS consultant numbers have increased by almost 43 under this government to a record high level. This spend on overtime represents a tiny percentage of the overall spend on consultants. ""We are determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland, which is why we have launched a national programme for the effective management of all temporary staffing, to help boards move away from reliance on high cost temporary staff, reduce overall costs and ensure value for money for NHS Scotland. ""We have also set up and championed the use of local'staff bank' systems, which are a pool of flexible NHS-employed staff who fill the majority of short term vacant shifts at NHS pay rates. Work is now underway to develop these local banks into integrated regional and national staff banks to allow greater flexibility across NHS Scotland and minimise reliance on agency staff. ""In the meantime the use of overtime and locum staff allows NHS Boards to respond to periods of planned and unplanned absence including long term sickness, unexpected vacancies and maternity and paternity leave ensuring service continuity during these times.""",1,179

He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media. Syed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months. Last year, his brother was jailed for life for plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday. Judge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out ""an act of mass murder"" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted. Prosecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise. Instead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry. After he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf. This second man was, in fact, a group of MI5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with Syed. Teen admits planning'London bomb attack' Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some ""suspicion on both sides"" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a ""committed brother"" he could deal with. Syed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted ""do martyrdom"" after first causing ""damage"" with a machine gun. ""Can you get the gear?"" asked Syed. ""You will be involved right? ""Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one. So after some damage with machine gun then do itishadi [martyrdom].... that's what I'm planning to do."" The undercover officer told Syed guns were expensive - but he might be able to get someone to build a bomb. Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities. He tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan. Over two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over PS150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded. ""I was thinking of Oxford Street,"" he told his contact. ""If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails? Those sharp things - lots of them inside. ""Good man, can't wait akhi [brother]. If I go to prison, I go to prison. If I die, I die, you understand? I have got to get to Jannah [heaven]."" The undercover officer later told Syed a ""bomb-making brother"" would have the device ready within days - and the suspect went online to narrow his list of targets. His web searches included ""packed places in London"" and ""Elton John, Hyde Park, 11 September"" - a major concert hosted by BBC Radio 2 which also featured Status Quo and Madness. Prosecutors say Syed's character had begun to change outwardly in late 2014, coinciding with the growing support among British extremists for the self-styled Islamic State group. During the course of the investigation, detectives found his web searches jumped about as he tried to satisfy himself that an attack on civilians was theologically justifiable. One of his last searches, a week before his arrest, was: ""How can I stop being upset about the UK killing innocent Syrians and get on with my day?"" When counter-terrorist detectives arrested him in September and asked him for the password for his phone, he replied: ""ISIS - you like that?"" Syed's was one of 18 terror plots to have been foiled since 2013. Mitigating, Mark Summers QC said it was a ""crude, ill-thought-out"" plan made at the behest of others. The court heard Syed had fallen under the influence of members of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, and that he now publicly rejected his past beliefs and condemned the recent bomb attack in Manchester. But Judge Topolski told Syed: ""You were not lured, you were not enticed, you were not entrapped. ""You became, and in my judgement as shown by your online activities away from your contact with Abu Yusuf, deeply committed to the ideology of a brutal and barbaric organisation that sought to hijack and corrupt an ancient and venerable religion for its own purposes and you wanted to be part of it."" Deb Walsh, deputy head of the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Haroon Syed is clearly a danger to the public who was prepared to carry out indiscriminate attacks against innocent people. ""The compelling evidence presented by the CPS left him with no choice but to plead guilty.""",1,183
"Most MSPs on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: ""All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. ""While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience."" The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom French, of the Equality Network charity, said backing the Bill would help remove discrimination from law. ""With just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage Bill, we urge MSPs to stand up for a fairer and more equal Scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support,"" he said. ""The large majority of people in Scotland believe it's time LGBT people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This Bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are."" But campaign group Scotland for Marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: ""The Scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. ""Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don't support this law. ""No one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected."" In England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July. It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place. The act will allow religious organisations to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so.",1,184
"Media playback is not supported on this device The 26-year-old British number one is taking a short break before preparing for the US Open in August. ""I've got a massive amount of room to grow in all areas of my game to be quite honest,"" she told BBC Sport. Australia-born Konta said she is proud to represent Great Britain after her nationality was questioned. Konta became the first British woman since Virginia Wade 39 years earlier to reach the Wimbledon last four. But she is determined to make further progress towards her goals of becoming world number one and winning Grand Slams. ""I know there's a lot of work to be done between now and achieving such things,"" she said. ""I definitely feel I can physically improve. I'd like to get stronger, move even better on the court - maximise my movement."" Konta, who was ranked 150 at the start of 2015, often speaks of the mental ""process"" she relies upon during her rise up the rankings and believes experience will improve her tactical game. ""I'm constantly looking to be more mentally strong and technically sound. I'm trying to leave no stone unturned,"" she said. Konta said she was proud to represent Great Britain after her nationality was questioned by BBC presenter John Humphrys on Radio 4's Today programme. The veteran interviewer said: ""We talk about you as being British, but you were born in Hungary, Australian citizenship, and I seem to remember that the Australian high commissioner, when you won the quarter-final, said:'Great to see an Aussie win', and we were saying:'Great to see a Brit win' - so, what are you?"" She laughed before replying: ""I was actually born in Australia to Hungarian parents, but I have lived half my life here now, almost. So, I'm a British citizen, and I'm incredibly proud to represent Great Britain. I have done so officially since 2012."" Konta, who came to the UK aged 14, later told BBC Sport of her bond with Britain. ""This is my home, where I consider to be from and where I come back to. This is the place I miss when I am away,"" she said. ""People are entitled to their opinion, but this is the only place I've truly represented and will continue to do so. ""I'm a British citizen and representing Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics was one of the proudest moments of my career."" Some newspaper reports during Wimbledon referenced the fact that five years ago Konta did not know the words to the national anthem. ""Seeing as I've sung the national anthem at both the Olympics and many Fed Cup ties, I do know the words to my national anthem, yes,"" she said. Media playback is not supported on this device Konta reached the Wimbledon semi-finals with a thrilling defeat of Romanian second seed Simona Halep which was watched by a peak of 7.4 million viewers, the BBC's best TV figures for the 2017 tournament. ""It's a massive compliment and a brilliant thing for tennis. It's great that so many people got invested and involved in my match and were living the moment with me,"" she said. ""I've definitely noticed that I've been recognised on the street more but it's always positive. People have only said good things and congratulated me on my run and said I've inspired them or their children."" She went out with a 6-4 6-2 defeat by five-time champion Venus Williams. ""I digested the match quite quickly and understood the things I could have done better, and acknowledge how well she played,"" said Konta. A higher profile has led to greater analysis of Konta by tennis pundits - but she tries to keep her focus. ""I employ the team around me to bring the most out of myself, and leave it to them to listen to lot of external things,"" she said. ""I limit the amount I open my ears to because it can be a little bit overwhelming and confusing. Within my career, the simpler I've kept it, the better. I don't listen too much to what's going on outside."" Away from the court, Konta has been enjoying her new-found love of baking, although admits it brought her to tears during Wimbledon. ""It was very random, I forgot to buy some chocolate chips (for muffins) in the supermarket and I only realised when I got home. I think I was a bit tired that day,"" she said. ""I'm a massive fan of food. I like exploring new restaurants and cuisines. I've only just started baking so the only thing I can make is muffins - I've been making blueberry ones, chocolate and banana, white chocolate and raspberry."" She also lists live music and the cinema as two other interests in her downtime. ""I'm going to see U2 soon and I'm very excited about that, and then I'm going to see Celine Dion with my mum,"" she said. Konta is next due on court at the Rogers Cup, which starts in Toronto on 7 August, having chosen not to defend her title at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California. Another tilt at a Grand Slam title will begin on 28 August at the US Open, where Konta has reached the fourth round for the past two years. ""I only finished Wimbledon on Thursday and haven't played since. I'm resting for the rest of this week and start training again on Monday. This is the only chance in the year when I can take more than two or three days off at one time,"" she said. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. ""We play a lot of tennis in the season and the season is very long. So to be able to find those moments where you can remove yourself from it and take care of your body goes towards ensuring the longevity and you being able to play many years. ""I need to remind myself to do that because I am a bit of a busybody. I like lists and ticking things off lists, so I need to make sure I do chill out and relax and try to get a day on the sofa here and there."" Longer term she hopes to play again for Britain in the Fed Cup team event after this year's controversy which led to Romania captain Ilie Nastase being suspended by the International Tennis Federation after swearing at the umpire and abusing Konta and her captain Anne Keothavong. ""It is not something that anyone should experience. It's not something I think about or look to revisit. My life has moved on from it,"" she said. ""One of the biggest honours you get as an athlete is to represent your country, especially in a team event. I would definitely love to keep participating.""

"Aston Villa's Jordan Ayew opened the scoring on 62 minutes, curling the ball past Ley Matampi in the Leopards goal. Paul-Jose M'Poku equalised for DR Congo with a sensational long-range effort from outside the box. West Ham's Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched a winning penalty, sending Matampi the wrong way to seal the win. It marks Ghana's sixth consecutive Nations Cup semi-finals appearance, as they seek to end an agonising 35-year wait for a continental title. In a game that only properly sparked to life in the second half in Oyem, DR Congo - and their captain Dieumerci Mbokani in particular - were left to rue several missed chances early on. The Hull City striker's best opportunity came on six minutes, after a terrible mix-up in the Ghana defence, but he hit the post when he had the goal at his mercy. Mbokani then teed up the competition's top scorer Junior Kabananga on 25 minutes, who fired high over the bar. The Congolese talisman again broke through the Ghana defence, only to slice his chance into the side netting. Ghana showed a lot more intent in the second half, with Wakaso whipping a free-kick at Matampi, who saved with his feet. Jordan Ayew - the younger of the two brothers - scored his first of the tournament, surging into the box and stroking the ball home confidently and decisively. The lead lasted all of five minutes, with M'Poku unleashing a breathtaking long-range shot with the outside of the boot that arrowed into the top corner. Ghana continued to press and were awarded a penalty when Christian Atsu went down in the box after contact from Lomalisa Mutambala, who was lucky not to receive a second yellow card. Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched the spot-kick, sending Matampi the wrong way, to grab his second of the competition. Leopards substitute Cedric Bakambu missed several chances to equalise in the final minutes, forcing a good save from Razak and finding space in the box at the death before shooting badly wide from close range. Atsu could have finished it for Ghana in injury time, but the busy Matampi produced a great save at his feet.

"Emergency services were called to the scene at Main Road, where the A78 Largs to Seamill road was closed to traffic. The woman's 60-year-old husband and the lorry driver, 54, were rescued and taken to hospital with minor injuries. The building is split into five homes and the couple had been watching television in their bottom-floor flat. One other man who was in the building at the time was evacuated unhurt. Another resident Callum Calvey had been out at work when the lorry struck the building at about 13:45. ""My bathroom has been wiped out,"" said the 21-year-old tree surgeon, who lives directly upstairs from the the couple. ""There are five flats and none of the other residents are about, but I believe the couple's dog got out as well."" Photographer Arlene Foster, who works for Anna Conway Photography, was quickly at the scene from her local shop. ""The lorry is literally in someone's front room,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""The lorry seems to have been going towards Ardrossan but hit the building on the opposite side of the road. ""Fortunately, it was quite quiet at the time - school kids could have been affected as well if it happened later."" Police are urging drivers to stay away from the area, with southbound traffic being diverted at Largs onto the A760 at Hayley Brae and northbound traffic being diverted at the Hunterston Roundabout. The local community had been pressing for a widening of the main road to Hunterston power station and Clyde Port. Steve Graham, chairman of Fairlie Community Council, said: ""This was an accident waiting to happen. ""There have been a number of near misses, but nothing on this scale. It is a very narrow road with premises adjacent to the road. ""We in the community council have been complaining about the weight of traffic coming through the A78, which it's not built for. It would not meet current standards for a trunk road."" A Strathclyde Police spokesman added: ""The ground floor of the building has been seriously damaged and has been deemed structurally unsound.""",1,187
"The singer - who is the first woman to win the award twice - also won best pop vocal album and best music video for her track Bad Blood. Rapper Kendrick Lamar won the most prizes on the night with five awards. British singer Ed Sheeran also won his first two Grammys for song of the year and best pop solo performance for his number one hit Thinking Out Loud. See the list of key winners A surprised Sheeran beat Lamar, Swift, country group Little Big Town and Wiz Khalifa to the song of the year accolade. ""We wrote [the song] on a couch in my house. Thanks to my parents who've flown to the Grammys every year for the last four years and every time I lose I say'maybe next year',"" he said as he collected the award. ""If you'd told my 11-year-old self I would receive an award from Stevie Wonder I'd be chuffed."" Swift was equally surprised at winning the top honour. Her album, which was released in 2014, came out too late to be eligible for last year's awards so was finally recognised at this year's ceremony. She gave a powerful acceptance speech saying: ""As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to young women: There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. ""But if you focus on your work and don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you'll look around and you'll know it was you and the people that love you that put you there. And that will be the greatest feeling in the world."" Lamar's wins included best rap album for To Pimp A Butterfly; best rap song and rap performance for Alright; best rapsung collaboration and best music video, which he shared with Swift for Bad Blood. Alabama Shakes were triple winners. They collected best alternative music album while their song Don't Wanna Fight won best rock song and rock performance. The Weeknd also picked up two Grammys for best urban contemporary album and best RB performance. Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars won two awards for their hit Uptown Funk, including record of the year, while Meghan Trainor was named best new artist. British rock band Muse also won best rock album for Drones, and Tony Bennett collected his 18th Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. Justin Bieber also won his first Grammy for his collaboration with Skrillex and Diplo, winning best dance recording for Where Are U Now. Outside the main categories, Amy - Asif Kapadia's documentary on the life of Amy Winehouse - won the Grammy for best music film. Swift opened the ceremony with a rendition of her song Out of the Woods and was one of many who performed during the show, along with Lamar, Adele, Ellie Goulding, James Bay and The Weeknd. Adele's performance was slightly hampered, however, by audio problems which appeared to throw the singer. She later tweeted: ""The piano mics fell on to the piano strings, that's what the guitar sound was. It made it sound out of tune."" Rihanna had also been due to perform, but pulled out at the last minute on doctor's orders due to bronchitis.

Championship side Birmingham City said: ""The club have not used the services of Mark Bonar and has no knowledge or record of any of our players, past or present, doing so."" The Sunday Times says it has secretly filmed Bonar claiming he has prescribed drugs such as EPO, steroids and human growth hormone to elite sports professionals from the UK and abroad over the past six years, including: The Sunday Times says it has no independent evidence Bonar treated the footballers or the other sportspeople. Bonar told the Sunday Times he treated the athletes for medical reasons and not to enhance their performance. There is no suggestion the substances were illegal, but they are banned by sporting bodies. Bonar had his professional services agreement with the Omniya Clinic terminated on Friday, after it emerged he does not have a licence to practise medicine in the UK. The Football Association released a statement regarding the claims, saying: ""These are very serious allegations. As such, The FA welcomes UK Anti-Doping's decision to immediately launch an independent review into the matters raised by the Sunday Times. ""The FA is fully committed to maintaining the integrity of English football and will work with Ukad and other relevant agencies in seeking to do so. The FA urges anyone with information that may be relevant to come forward as soon as possible."" The case is now the subject of a government investigation, following claims made by a whistleblower athlete who was banned for breaching anti-doping rules in 2014. According to the newspaper, the sportsman - who wishes to remain anonymous - approached Ukad with evidence that alleged Bonar had prescribed him performance-enhancing drugs. Ukad says it did begin an investigation into Bonar but decided he was outside of its jurisdiction as he was not governed by a sport. Ukad also decided not to pass the case to the General Medical Council (GMC) or to contact the doctor. Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the organisation was ""deeply concerned and shocked by the allegations"" and it would conduct an independent review into the case. World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie told BBC Radio 5 live it was ""pretty dreadful news"" and backed calls for an inquiry, but added: ""It is best to wait for Ukad to do their own investigation, then we have full knowledge of the facts to work with.

"Whether or not he is on the formal menu, Mr Snowden will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows. Ms Merkel's trip to the US is markedly different in tone and substance from her last visit to Washington in June 2011. Back then, there was a state dinner during which Mr Obama presented her the Medal of Freedom. He talked of a productive partnership with Ms Merkel, one of the few world leaders with whom he has established a warm connection. She referred to him more than once as ""dear Barack."" This week's meeting is much shorter and will be all business. Three years ago, the leaders spent considerable time talking about the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, and G8 efforts to support those democratic transitions. They reiterated the desire to achieve negotiated settlements to the vexing challenges of the Iranian nuclear programme. They discussed the pending change in military strategy in Afghanistan and the need to overcome trade barriers and accelerate economic growth. Three years later, the policy outlook is vastly different, although thankfully not all bad. For example, not only are negotiations with Iran under way, there is a decent chance they will be successful. The war in Afghanistan is winding down. The Afghan presidential election is going surprisingly well. Whoever replaces President Hamid Karzai is likely to agree to a follow-on Nato mission there. The most urgent regional transformation is not the Middle East, where an Arab Spring has, with the exception of Tunisia, become a humanitarian nightmare, but Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin has already overseen the redrawing of the European map and may be agitating for more. There is no longer a G8, but a G7, trying to co-ordinate sanctions that impose costs on Mr Putin while minimising the impact on the European economy, not as easy a task as some suggest. The costs to Mr Putin are increasing, even if the ramp is not as steep as pundits and even some government officials on this side of the Atlantic would prefer. This week the US imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia's high tech sector and the EU quickly followed suit. Such co-ordination is important since the lift over time will be much heavier in Europe. Its level of integration with Russia exceeds that of the US. Mr Obama is right to be patient while maintaining firm pressure on Europe to move beyond its comfort zone. Ms Merkel is not only crucial to meaningful European action, she is the only Western leader with real potential to influence Mr Putin. The Obama-Putin relationship has hit a brick wall. She arrives in Washington undoubtedly stung that a German-led European monitoring team is being held by separatists in Sloviansk, Ukraine. She has every right to expect Russia to use its influence to gain their release. The fact they have not is a clear indication of its intent to further escalate the crisis. While in Washington, Ms Merkel will also meet the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. As much as the crisis is about getting Mr Putin to stand down, it is about the need for Kiev to stand up, and for the West to redeem Ukraine's decision to integrate with the West. A vital step in resolving the crisis is enabling Ukraine to conduct a free, fair and legitimate election on 25 May. This is the object of Mr Putin's agitation, to manipulate conditions in ways that favour Russia's interests and undermine Kiev's. The West needs a comparable game plan to help Ukraine stand up a new government that Russia is unable to discredit. The meeting should touch on the long-term strategic implications of the crisis. The US has done an effective job of reassuring Nato allies regarding their mutual security interests. The presence of Nato forces in Poland and the Baltic states is a welcome manifestation of that commitment. Mr Obama and Ms Merkel will discuss the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which faces headwinds in both Europe and the US. It would be useful to make energy a centrepiece of these trade negotiations. Several European countries, including Germany, rely heavily on Russian energy, which gives Mr Putin important leverage in the current crisis. As US Secretary of State John Kerry told an Atlantic Council conference this week, the US has a new energy card in its policy arsenal. The Ukraine crisis presents a perfect opportunity to diversify Europe's energy sources over the next decade. While Russia and Ukraine will dominate the discussion, Ms Merkel cannot afford to ignore the Snowden issue and neither should Mr Obama. This is the first formal meeting between the two leaders since revelations that the US National Security Agency was monitoring her mobile phone. Americans should not underestimate the impact that the issue has had in Europe. Europeans have welcomed the reforms that Mr Obama and Congress are considering. Even if the issue has receded from the headlines, Washington needs to follow through. Ms Merkel herself has suggested it will take more than one meeting to repair the damage Edward Snowden's revelations have generated. This meeting is a necessary step in that process. PJ Crowley is a former US assistant secretary of state and now a professor of practice and fellow at The George Washington University Institute of Public Diplomacy Global Communication",1,191
"The region's number of under 15s taking alcohol remains above the national average, according to the Highland Alcohol and Drugs Partnership. Its campaign Meet the MacPhersons draws on evidence gathered from 200 young people and 20 parents. They were asked for their experiences of the dilemmas faced by children, teenagers and parents in relation to alcohol. Almost three quarters of young people in the Highlands have drunk alcohol by the time they turn 15, according to the partnership, whose members include NHS Highland. The partnership said there has been a 10 reduction in underage drinking in the region since 2010, but it remained above the national average. Deborah Stewart, co-ordinator for Highland Alcohol and Drugs Partnership, said families have an important part to play in tackling underage drinking. She said: ""Underage drinking remains a concern as it contributes to a range of negative health and social outcomes. ""There is also evidence that shows early alcohol use is associated with increased risk of dependency in adulthood and chronic diseases associated with excessive drinking in adults. ""By reducing underage drinking we can reduce the risk of alcohol problems developing in adulthood and families can play a part in that by modelling sensible drinking, communicating risks associated with drinking and participating in positive activities. That's why we would like families to Meet the MacPhersons."" Last month, NHS Highland's director of public health said children as young as three can recognise the smell associated with alcohol. Dr Hugo van Woerden said he recognised that responsible drinking was ""a normal part of a healthy society."" But he has raised concerns about levels of alcohol abuse and children's exposure to it. He said in the health board's area 9.4 of men and 7.2 of women were classed as problem drinkers. His report mentions ""children as young as three can recognise the smell associated with alcoholic drinks."" Dr van Woerden also said there had been a rise in alcohol intake by women aged 16-24.",1,192
"Couples have been decorating the Ponte Milvio bridge on the river Tiber with locks for several years. They are meant to symbolise the locking of hearts, inspired by a story described in a novel. The city council said rust from the locks, which hang off chains, is harming the fabric of the bridge. The custom is inspired by a book by novelist Federico Moccia in which a couple place a bicycle lock around a lamppost and throw the key into the Tiber. The gesture was meant to symbolise the couple eternally locking their hearts together. It took off and clusters of padlocks can be found near other landmarks in other Italian cities. It is not the first time city authorities have stepped-in to break the locks apart. Last year the council started a round of padlock cutting after complaints from residents that it equated to vandalism. In 2007 the then mayor of Rome introduced a 50 euro (PS40) a fine on couples found attaching padlocks to the bridge. The BBC's Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says many people in Rome like the custom, and the writer behind the trend has said the locks ought to be left alone.",1,193
"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) missed a deadline to name a squad for the tournament after the International Cricket Council (ICC) changed its revenue-sharing model. However, a BCCI statement said it ""unanimously decided that the Indian cricket team will participate."" A meeting to select the team will now take place on Monday, 8 May. The initial deadline to name a Champions Trophy squad was 25 April but India will not face a sanction for not doing so. At a recent ICC meeting, the BCCI was outvoted 13-1 in a bid to halt the revised deal which considerably reduces India's share from global events in the 2015-2023 cycle. Acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhary will now continue to negotiate with the world governing body over the issue. The BCCI statement added: ""The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.""",1,194
"The base will be home to HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the largest ships ever built for the navy. Work on Portsmouth's jetty, built in the 1920s and last upgraded in the 1970s, has begun, with upgrades expected to be completed next autumn. It forms part of a PS100m infrastructure package to prepare the base for the arrival of the first carrier. HMS Queen Elizabeth measures 280m (300 yards) long and can travel up to 500 miles (800km) a day. The ship's systems are being tested and it will conduct sea trials next year before being handed over to the Royal Navy. It is expected to come into service in 2020. HMS Prince of Wales is being constructed at shipyards around the UK before it is assembled at Rosyth. Once completed, the revamped naval base is expected to create hundreds of jobs in Portsmouth. In November 2013, BAE Systems announced it was ending shipbuilding in Portsmouth, leading to 585 voluntary redundancies, 160 compulsory redundancies, and the redeployment of 175 members of staff.",1,195
"But Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says the process to close such schools is ""inadequate."" Where there is such ""illegal activity,"" he says, the ""full force of the law"" should be brought to bear. Sir Michael has written to the education secretary to say 15 such schools have been found and they should be ""registered or closed down."" He says there are ""serious concerns"" about the safety of children being taught in these ""so-called schools."" In response, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says the government has taken ""robust steps to tackle unregistered schools and improve safeguarding."" ""However we agree with Sir Michael that more needs to be done."" As such Mrs Morgan says there are plans for ""further powers to regulate settings which teach children intensively and to intervene and impose sanctions where there are safety or welfare concerns. We will be consulting on these proposals shortly."" The Ofsted chief says inspectors visited 28 institutions where there were concerns and found 15 unregistered schools. The schools that are still operating have not been identified, although some are believed to be in Birmingham and London. They include some linked to faith groups. These are schools providing at least 20 hours a week of lessons, operating outside the supervision of the Department for Education, local authorities or Ofsted inspections. Ofsted accuses the operators of some of these institutions of ""using the freedoms afforded to genuine home educators as a cover for their activities."" But Sir Michael is calling on the education secretary for greater urgency in closing unregistered schools and in the response of councils and the Department for Education. And he warns against ""bureaucracy, legislation or lack of resources"" being used as a ""reason for inaction."" In one ""deeply troubling case,"" Ofsted says inspectors had to return for a fifth visit to Bordesley independent school in Birmingham, which inspectors now believe has closed. Sir Michael says inspectors had been delayed from entering, but once inside had found ""squalid conditions, including three single mattresses covered in filthy sheets in one room and no running water in the toilet areas."" There was also ""clear evidence of segregation, with separate classrooms for boys and girls"" and ""no evidence of appropriate vetting checks being carried out on staff."" Inspectors also warned of ""pupils being taught a narrow curriculum that was failing to prepare them for life in modern Britain."" Sir Michael's letter says there were subsequent questions about rights of access for the local authority - and as such ""I arranged for police officers from the West Midlands force to accompany inspectors to facilitate entry to the premises."" Mrs Morgan said: ""We understand Bordesley has now closed and are keeping in close contact with Birmingham local authority as they work to urgently ensure the children involved are safe and are receiving suitable education."" The Ofsted chief has told the education secretary: ""The arrangements for closing down unregistered schools are inadequate. ""Too many children remain at significant risk of harm. I will continue to do all that I can to identify and inspect unregistered schools."" Labour's shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, said: ""It is hard to fathom why arrangements for closing down unregistered schools remain inadequate and swift action on this issue has not been taken. ""With children at risk of being exposed to harm, exploitation or undue influences, more inertia from this government simply isn't good enough."" Ms Powell warned of a ""dangerous void"" in the local oversight of schools.",1,196
"Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was handed over to a delegation of tribal leaders. He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a ""manoeuvre."" He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. ""We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership,"" he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. ""Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling."" A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed. They seized Mr Bin Mubarak on 17 January to stop him attending a meeting to discuss the draft, saying they had become aware of ""irregularities"" in the text.",1,197

"Media playback is not supported on this device The hosts had the better of the chances against their League One rivals and were denied three times by the woodwork in the second half. Chances were in short supply during the first half. Shrewsbury's best opportunity in the early stages fell to Ivan Toney but the Newcastle loanee's header from a Louis Dodds cross was comfortably saved by Alex Cairns. Dodds then had a close-range effort blocked as Shrewsbury, who reached the fifth round last season before bowing out to Manchester United, pushed for a breakthrough. Fleetwood midfielder Bobby Grant's overhead kick cleared the bar before visiting captain Nathan Pond's header from Kyle Dempsey's free-kick was acrobatically saved by Jayson Leutwiler, diving low to his right. Shrewsbury hit the same post twice within a minute early in the second half. A low shot from Dodds beat keeper Cairns but came out off the inside of a post before Junior Brown's flick from a Dom Smith cross also struck the woodwork. The Shrews continued to look the most likely side to break the deadlock and Toney's 25-yard free-kick clipped the top of the bar before Grant hammered a late shot from distance narrowly wide for Fleetwood as deadlock ensued.

"Trouble prompted police involvement outside the ground before violence behind one goal as players warmed up. ""Projectiles and fireworks launched from the stands require fans to take refuge on the pitch,"" Lyon tweeted. The game kicked off 45 minutes late with Lyon scoring twice in the closing 10 minutes to win 2-1. Authorities had categorised the fixture'high risk', with about 500 police reportedly stationed at Parc Olympique Lyonnais - more than double the usual amount. Both teams left the field as fans spilled on to the playing surface before kick-off, with Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas going into the crowd in an effort to calm supporters. When the French and Turkish sides eventually emerged, both sets of players clapped supporters all round the stadium, before going through brief warm-up drills ahead of a 20:50 BST kick-off. Before Beskitas' fixture against Greek side Olympiakos in the previous round, both clubs worked with Uefa and took the decision to ban away fans in a bid to avoid crowd trouble. It is the third incident at a Uefa competition this week, following Tuesday's bomb attack on Borussia Dortmund's team bus and Wednesday's clashes between Leicester City supporters and police in Madrid. When the match got under way, former Liverpool striker Ryan Babel put Besiktas ahead but moments after Corentin Tolisso's equaliser on 83 minutes, Jeremy Morel robbed Spanish goalkeeper Fabri in the area to tap into an empty net.

"A letter sent by party activists in north Wales claimed Michelle Brown has been ""abrasive and discourteous"" to them. It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group."" In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably ""too extreme"" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to ""ostracise"" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn. Mr Nuttall resigned after the general election in June when the party failed to win any seats and saw its vote plummet.",1,202
"The deal will see the firm taken over by holding company Cheil Industries, another part of the Samsung group. The merger is strongly opposed by some of Samsung CT's shareholders, led by US hedge fund Elliott Associates. For Samsung's founding family, the move is a crucial step in consolidating control of the conglomerate. Shareholders in Cheil Industries approved the merger earlier on Friday. Shares in Samsung CT fell 10.4 and Cheil Industries dropped 7.7 after the merger was approved. Elliott Associates, which is the second largest single shareholder in CT, says the takeover significantly undervalues the company's stock. The hedge fund had filed several unsuccessful law suits to stop the vote from going ahead. The takeover is key to consolidating the Samsung founding family's control of the multi-headed conglomerate. It is of particular significance as it comes ahead of a generational power transfer at Samsung.

"The New Zealand fighter failed to impress against the Romanian who took the bout at two weeks' notice, winning a 119-108 117-110 117-110 decision. The champion landed sporadic flurries throughout but never looked like scoring a stoppage in Auckland. He has said he will campaign overseas, with Britain's WBA and IBF champion Anthony Joshua a potential opponent. Though he remains unbeaten in 23 fights, the manner of this win may make Parker a tougher sell for pay-per-view audiences overseas. The 25-year-old - who claimed the vacant WBO belt against Andy Ruiz in December - did land some shots when in close to Cojanu but when at distance he looked incapable of finding ways to rock a man three inches taller and around two stone heavier. Cojanu, who now has 16 wins and three losses to his name, was one of Parker's sparring partners but stepped in to the main event when Britain's Hughie Fury withdrew through injury. Cojanu landed a left hook of his own in the 10th round and chased a stoppage win in the 12th. But, in truth, he always looked occupied with spoiling Parker's work, most notably when having a point deducted for leaning on the champion's neck in the fourth. Parker said afterwards: ""You can all see why we bring Razvan into camp for us. He put on a great fight. ""I've done my best to keep fights here in New Zealand but it's down to us to go and get some exposure overseas now.""",1,204

"Vicky Cherry, 44, had been missing for 15 months when police found her body wrapped in a duvet and plastic sheeting at a house in Toronto Street, Bolton, in January. Andrew Reade, 43, admitted preventing the lawful burial of a body and perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to four years and four months in jail. Miss Cherry's cause of death could not be ascertained because of heavy decomposition but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation, as injuries to her neck were detected. Sentencing Reade, Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant could not be held responsible for Miss Cherry's death but what followed was ""inexcusable."" Officers had launched a ""non-body"" murder investigation because Miss Cherry, from Fulwood, Lancashire had not been seen since October 2015. Reade, of Toronto Street, Bolton, told her family they had split up and she had moved to Blackburn. However, police discovered that her unemployment benefits were still being withdrawn in Bolton. When officers arrested Reade on suspicion of murder, he claimed he had panicked upon waking to find his girlfriend dead after they had binged on a cocktail of drugs. The 43-year-old admitted hiding her body and lying to her family and police. He also admitted taking her benefits for several months after her death. In a victim statement to the court, Miss Cherry's daughter said: ""Reade has held her body in a cupboard with things on top of her like she was a piece of rubbish. ""I will never forgive Reade. Reade himself is the only person who truly knows what happened to my mother. We will be forever tormented by this."" Nick Ross, defending, said his client, a long-standing user of Class A drugs, had exercised ""very poor judgment"" after grief and panic had set in following Miss Cherry's death.

Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: ""Reade's deliberately deceptive and misleading actions seriously obstructed the investigation into how Vicky died and cost us valuable opportunities to investigate.""",1,206
"The US-owned retail firm, which processes hundreds of thousands of online orders each week, could have put millions of transactions at risk, security expert Paul Moore estimates. He first noticed the issue in March 2014 and contacted Asda to report it. Asda said it had now fixed the problem and no customers had been affected. The firm, whose website is run by US retail giant Walmart, told the BBC: ""Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website."" ""The points flagged pose a low risk to customers and our monitoring of these security issues indicate that no customer information has been compromised over that two-year period."" Since Mr Moore went public with the information it has acted to improve its security. ""The small risk to customer information has been removed and an update has been applied, we're now adding further enhancements which will be completed by this evening. In short, one of the two issues is fixed but nothing that remains poses any risk to any customer information or card details,"" it told the BBC. The issue occurred because of two well-known exploits, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which combined, can offer hackers access to all the information users put on the site, said Mr Moore. It means that - if someone had both the Asda website open and another site that is infected with malware - they could be vulnerable to attack. ""CSRF exploits the trust a site has in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to issue requests on your behalf and from your own PC. XSS allows an attacker to embed malicious content into the page to alter anything and everything the user can see,"" he explained. Asda is by no means alone in having a website open to these security flaws but Mr Moore believes that it should have acted more quickly to rectify the problem. ""Back in March 2014, I contacted Asda to report several security vulnerabilities and despite a fix promised'in the next few weeks', little appears to have changed,"" he said. ""Asda also failed to issue adequate security headers which help mitigate the risk by instructing the browser to discard content which ASDA deem malicious or unnecessary. The majority of modern browsers support content security policy (CSP) which effectively blocks this type of attack, but very few sites adopt this technique,"" he added. When he published his blog, he advised users ""to shop elsewhere."" ""AsdaWalmart have had ample opportunity to fix these issues and have failed to do so. If you must continue shopping with Asda, open a private window and do not open any other tabs or windows until you've logged out,"" he added. Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey, said that Asda's assertion that its site is secure is correct but that does not mean that users are not at risk. ""Cross-site scripting can easily be exploited by hackers if someone has a website open that has this malware embedded at the same time as they are shopping online and the shopping site has not protected the data entry fields appropriately,"" he said. ""Most people do have dozens of tabs open at any given time."" He did not go as far as suggesting people stop shopping there but added: ""I think I'd play safe and make sure you have only one tab open just in case one of your other sites is infected."" ""This is an example of of how companies need to look beyond the boundaries of their own website. This is a common exploit but it can be very easily fixed. It is half a line of code that can fix it,"" he added. There are scanners available online that can immediately tell whether websites have the correct security headers. One such site that scans the web for such headers found that, out of the million most popular websites, only 1,365 sites had them in place.",1,207
"Media playback is not supported on this device Malan targeted South Africa's seamers, striking 12 fours and two sixes in a 44-ball knock as England posted 181-8. Chris Jordan took 3-31 and Tom Curran - in only his second game - 2-22 to restrict the Proteas in their chase. AB de Villiers made 39 and Mangaliso Mosehle 36 off 22 balls but South Africa could manage only 162-7. England, returning to the venue of their Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, put in a professional performance to wrap up the series. Middlesex left-hander Malan, 29, made the highest score by an England player on T20 debut, beating Paul Collingwood's 46 in England's maiden match in this format in 2005. England, whose next white-ball series is not until September against West Indies, begin a four-Test series against South Africa on 6 July. It was a polished performance from England's bowlers, using the short ball to discomfort South Africa, and they were backed up by some strong fielding. Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who played in the opening T20 at Southampton, was put under pressure as de Villiers struck him for consecutive sixes. However, the 20-year-old showed admirable confidence as he continued to toss the ball up and was rewarded when he drew an error out of the tourists' skipper, who slapped the ball to Alex Hales on the deep square leg boundary. Crane rounded off his spell with a superb over, conceding only two runs as England turned the screw. The Proteas were lacklustre. Of the top six, only De Villiers and opener JJ Smuts (29) reached double figures and it took some big hitting from wicketkeeper Mosehle to push their total up. England's seamers were excellent, with Curran in particular showing a maturity at the end of the innings as he bowled full and straight. The result means the visitors have won only two of their six limited-overs matches on this tour. England captain Eoin Morgan chose to rest himself for the match, a decision that initially drew criticism given this was a must-win game for England, but big-hitting Malan adapted quickly to international cricket. Arriving at the crease after Jason Roy fell for eight, Malan left his first delivery but pulled the second ferociously into the stands for six. On a pitch tinged with green, he took on the short ball against the seamers. He did not let up against a change of pace, nonchalantly flicking leg-spinner Imran Tahir over his shoulder to bring up his half-century from 31 deliveries. Malan and Hales, who was struggling to run after edging the ball on to his knee, put on 105 in 10.3 overs. When Malan finally fell, caught at long-on off Tahir, stand-in captain Jos Buttler struck two flat sixes to push England above 180. Media playback is not supported on this device The manner in which England went about such a calm and assured victory will be more heartening giving the changes they made to their side. As well as Morgan being rested, England gave Crane another opportunity, as well as Curran. For South Africa, it was a disappointing return, given how strong they were in the closing stages at Taunton. They were sloppy in the field to begin with. Andile Phehlukwayo's drop to reprieve Hales on 13 was so surprising the batsman had turned to walk back to the pavilion. South Africa will take some comfort in the performance of right-armer Paterson, who was twice on a hat-trick in the final overs thanks to his mixture of yorkers and slower balls. However, it was England who controlled the majority of the game. England stand-in captain Jos Buttler: ""Dawid Malan was fantastic on debut. It is not easy to come in and show that much composure under pressure. On debut it was a fantastic effort. ""Mason Crane, for a 20-year-old, has got great character. He was bowling at one of the best players that have ever played the game on a ground with a short boundary. ""It was very tough on him but all credit for having the bravery and guts to keep going and get the wicket. I am sure he will remember it for a long time. ""We have found some really great players. You find out a lot about players - international cricket is different and those guys have stepped up. Tom Curran was brilliant for his two games. ""Taunton is not an easy place to make your debut and he took three wickets and two today. He looks a real find."" South Africa captain AB de Villiers: ""We were outplayed in both of these series. Well done to England and Eoin Morgan in the majority of the games, and Jos Buttler today, for leading them. ""England put in an all-round better performance today. We were not far off but it was disappointing. ""England do have some really good youngsters. They have good depth and all round are a really good team. ""They seem to be going through a good patch and have a lot of talent. They have a bright five to 10 years ahead of them."" On Mason Crane: ""I was always going to go after him. Well done to him for sticking to his guns."" Dawid Malan, who was named man of the match: ""It is a fantastic experience to play for your country and to contribute in a win like that on debut is fantastic. ""I thought this day might never come. I had a chat with Adam Voges, who played later for Australia. ""I asked what he did and how he kept motivated when you keep getting overlooked for younger and younger players. He gave me some advice and fortunately I had a good Lions series and got picked when players were rested.""",1,208
"A long, slow sigh sounded in the room. Then a consolatory hand on her shoulder. Shortly after, the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. Canon Enid Morgan remembers the moment a bill to enable women to become bishops failed by three votes in 2008. She was sat among the church's governing body in Lampeter, Ceredigion, when the result was announced. ""There was this feeling of'we're going to carry on discussing this yet again',"" she recalled. Ever since the first woman was made an Anglican deaconess in Usk, Monmouthshire, in 1884, women have been campaigning for greater equality in the church, fighting to prove they were capable of holding the same positions as men. Just 11 years before the failed vote for bishops, the Church in Wales governing body had accepted women becoming priests by one vote in 1997. Canon Morgan, of Aberystwyth, who was among the first 61 women to be ordained, said: ""There were women there who had been deacons for many years, I had been one for 12 years, so there was a lot of frustration. ""So much energy had gone into arguing the case which would have been better going into our work. ""Yet there was also the realisation this had not happened before and will not happen again. It was hugely important."" Canon Morgan, now 76, has been among the ""lucky ones"" who has received much support over the years. She was a lay reader for a decade and studied at the Theological College, Aberystwyth, before being ordained deacon in 1984. She saw her ordination as a priest ""as a sign that times were changing"" and would later become director of the Board of Mission of the Church in Wales. ""I didn't have much in the way of humiliation or rudeness but some women got a rough ride,"" she said. ""Some bishops were very suspicious of us, some thought we might plot. ""If men and women can't get along in the church, then how are they expected to do so anywhere else?"" The move for women bishops would go on to be passed five years later, in 2013. But the barriers women faced in the past still remain today. As Revd Mary Stallard, of Llangollen, Denbighshire, said: ""The whole gender debate has a long way to go. Having women bishops is fabulous but it's not the end of the road in terms of how the church looks at gender. ""The decision-making committee for the finances of the church, for example, has 26 places on the representative body but only two are women. ""Yet if you look across Wales at who balances the books of households, I'm betting women are doing the lion's share."" She and her husband Andrew were the first paid ordained couple in the Church in Wales before both becoming priests - she was among the first women in 1997 - and have gone on to achieve similar qualifications and experiences. Yet Revd Stallard, a chaplain at an Anglican school, said jobs have been more readily offered to her husband while she has often been asked to work part-time or even without a salary. When she found herself in a higher position than her husband, she said she had to ""argue that bit harder for it."" ""I hope we continue on a trajectory of change and if we are going slower in the church, it doesn't mean we won't catch up,"" she said. ""The future for the church is a struggle, but it would be less of a struggle if we stop fighting internally about matters like this. ""We are so much more empowered if we harness the powers of everyone."" Both Canon Morgan and Revd Stallard hope the appointment of Canon Joanna Penberthy as Wales' first female bishop will inspire other women and open further opportunities in the church. ""It matters a great deal for the church, for women and for the women who died before their hopes were realised,"" Canon Morgan said. ""It's a wonderful feeling of completion but in fact it's only really the start.""",1,209
"Mourinho, 52, is halfway through a four-year deal signed on his return to Stamford Bridge in June 2013. And further talks are expected in the coming weeks with the club and the Portuguese keen on a long-term option. In his first spell at the club between 2004 and 2007, Mourinho won consecutive Premier League titles and succeeded this season with three games to spare. Media playback is not supported on this device The 2005 title was Chelsea's first top-flight success in 50 years and he also delivered two League Cups and an FA Cup. But he left the club to eventually join Inter Milan after falling out with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Since his return after a six-and-a-half-year absence, which included three seasons at Real Madrid, Mourinho has spoken of his desire to stay as long as the Russian billionaire wishes to keep him. The Blues boss repeated that after Sunday's 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace, which secured Chelsea's first title since 2010 and the eighth of his prolific career. ""As I was saying since the beginning of the season, I stay here until Mr Abramovich wants me to stay. The day he tells me to go, I go,"" said Mourinho.

"Towell, 25, was knocked down twice during the bout in Glasgow on Thursday and died in hospital on Friday night. His partner Chloe Ross revealed he had been suffering migraines for weeks but had dismissed it as pre-match stress. Towell was taking part in a welterweight title eliminator against Welsh fighter Dale Evans Many tributes have been paid to the young fighter from Dundee - known as ""Iron Mike"" - who is only the third professional boxer to die in the UK from apparently fight-related injuries in 21 years. He passed away with his family at his bedside at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. In a Facebook post, his partner Ms Ross said he had suffered brain damage but ""fought right to the end,"" surviving for 12 hours after life support was turned off. ""I'm absolutely heartbroken to say my annoying best friend passed away tonight at 11.02 very peacefully,"" she wrote. ""Michael had severe bleeding and swelling to his brain. ""He had been complaining of headaches for the last few weeks but we put it down to migraines with the stress of his fight. ""It has been the longest 24 hours of our lives. My baby has lost his daddy. But he will be so so proud of his dad in what he achieved."" Ms Ross added: ""Once he was taken off of his life support he managed 12 hours, 12 whole rounds off his life support, he fought right to the end and he's done us all so proud.... He left doing the thing he's best at.... there's only one."" The St Andrew's Sporting Club fight took place at Glasgow's Radisson Blu Hotel on Thursday evening. Towell was knocked down in the first round of the fight before recovering to continue the match. Referee Victor Loughlin stopped the fight in the fifth round shortly after Towell was knocked down by Carmarthen fighter Evans for a second time. He received treatment in the ring and was given oxygen before being taken to an ambulance on a stretcher. A spokesman for St Andrew's Sporting Club later said that Towell's management team was not aware of any headache problems leading up to the fight. Spencer Oliver, the former European Super Bantamweight champion who was placed in a coma after being injured in a fight in 1998, said Towell would not have been allowed to fight if there had been doubts about his health. He said: ""He would have to have had all his medical tests. He was in a British title eliminator so all his brain scans would have been up to date and everything would have been in place with Mike going into that contest."" But boxing promoter Frank Warren raised concerns about the reports that Towell had been suffering from headaches. He said: ""If that's true, obviously he shouldn't have been fighting. And I'm quite sure, the doctor, who examines the boxers and the medicals, if they had of known that, they would not have allowed him to box. ""So, obviously once the British Boxing Board of Control complete their investigation into the matter, they'll be able to give further comment on that."" Boxing tragedies Towell's family were joined by his manager, Tommy Gilmour, during his final hours. Mr Gilmour said: ""He was Iron Mike to the end, he kept fighting till the last, and we have lost an exciting boxer but, more importantly, a very special man. ""I am devastated and all my thoughts are with Mike's mum Tracey, his partner Chloe and their little son Rocco."" Many well known figures in boxing paid tribute to Towell. Professional boxer turned promoter Ricky Hatton set up a JustGiving page to raise PS20,000 to support Towell's family. Trainer Shane McGuigan said on Twitter: ""Heartbreaking news that Mike Towell has lost his life. May he rest in peace, thoughts go out to his loved ones. RIP"" Promoter Eddie Hearn tweeted: ""Absolutely devastated by the passing of Mike Towell - all of our thoughts with his friends and family at this time."" The boxer had been undefeated going into Thursday's fight, with 11 previous wins and one draw on his professional record. Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn described Mike Towell's death as ""a terrible tragedy"" and renewed his call for blows to the head to be banned in sport. The shadow cabinet member twice called for the rule change through private member's bills in 1998 and and 2005 but failed on both occasions. Mr Flynn said: ""I think the consciences of people in the sport are aroused by tragedies of this kind and I think people should be aware of the dangers. ""We ought to change the rules in many sports and realise that the head is a very delicate part of the body and to protect it, and minimise the number of blows the brain suffers.""",1,212
"Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal. His landmark moment came in Iceland when he opened the scoring in a 5-0 win over K.R. Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur in 1964. ""The great Roger Hunt went to the by-line, squared it back to me and from all of those six yards out I powered it in,"" said Wallace who was only playing because Ian St John was ill. It's more than 55 years since he left Llanelli for Liverpool, but Wallace has not lost a trace of his Welsh accent. So how did the son of a Scotland international claim his place in footballing history? And why does he have a south Wales lilt when he speaks? It's a story that takes in one of Wales' most famous rugby academies and Huddersfield Town. Wallace, now 71, recalls it all with fondness. Wallace was five years old when his father, former Scotland centre forward Dougie Wallace, was appointed player-manager at Llanelli AFC. As a teenager he went to Gwendraeth School, where Barry John - nicknamed The King - and before him Carwyn James took their first steps to rugby stardom. ""The school was rugby orientated. Barry was two years younger than me and even then I used to love to watch him play,"" Wallace told BBC Wales. ""But my childhood dream was to become a footballer. I wanted to be just like my dad."" Wallace played in the Llanelli junior league between the ages of 11 to 14, before playing for Glan Morfa where his talent was discovered. ""It was late October 1959. I remember it well,"" he says of the day Bill Shankly's scout spotted him. ""There's somebody I want you to have a look at"" was the message sent back to Shankly, then manager of Huddersfield Town. Wallace had trials with the Terriers and when Shankly went to Liverpool, he took Wallace with him. ""At the end of my third trial at Huddersfield, Bill Shankly signed on the Monday to become manager of Liverpool Football Club,"" Wallace continued. After Liverpool won the Division One title in 1963-64, they were offered automatic qualification for the European Cup for the first time. ""Liverpool in the 60s was vibrant - The Beatles, 50,000 in the stadium, 28,000 in the Kop swaying to their songs. I remember it like yesterday,"" Wallace said. ""I wasn't always on the pitch but I was always part of the party. We had a fabulous squad. Ronnie Yates, Ian Callaghan, Roger Hunt, Ian St John. An odd person might get injured so you might get a game now and then."" And it was sickness that gave Wallace his break when fellow Scot St John had suffered appendicitis a few weeks before Liverpool's first European tie in Iceland. Wallace recalls the journey was as memorable as the game, ""Back then you couldn't get a direct flight to Iceland. We flew to Glasgow with a six-hour wait, Shankly] didn't want us lounging around so off we went on a bus to a holiday camp. I'll always remember the fella stopping us at the gate. ""The boss went over and said,'I'm Bill Shankly, I'm going to Reykjavik in Iceland and this is Liverpool Football Club'. The guy replied,'Well you're on the wrong road, Mr Shankly, You should have taken a right back that way'."" Wallace and the team got through the gate, onto the flight for Iceland, and a little piece of history followed. ""The goal came after three minutes,"" recalls Wallace, ""It hadn't dawned on me it was the first-ever goal in Europe until about six months later when someone mentioned it would be a good quiz question."" He also played a leading part in another landmark game, scoring twice in a 3-2 win over Arsenal - a game televised by the BBC on the first Match of the Day. He spent another two seasons at the club before moving on to Crewe Alexandra in 1967 for PS9,000. ""I would have loved to have played a lot more games than what I did, but I was so proud to be part of that squad. Shankly started what Liverpool Football Club is today,"" he said. Wallace draws comparisons between Shankly and current Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has steered the club to Europa League final in his first season at Anfield. ""They're very, very similar,"" Wallace said, ""Klopp's so enthusiastic, he's got a great character about him. He's got the players motivated. ""The Dortmund game [where Liverpool fought back to win 5-4 on aggregate in the Europa League quarter-final] - that was second only to the Inter Milan [European Cup] semi-final [first leg] in 1965 [which Liverpool won 3-1]. ""To see Klopp on the line, chanting and running, when the players see that, they play for him like we played for Shankly.""",1,213
"The Austrian opened the scoring with a penalty after Ashley Westwood brought down Phil Bardsley. He set up his second with a looping header which he then chested in. Leandro Bacuna's late goal gave Villa hope of an unlikely point but the Premier League's bottom club remain eight points from safety. Stoke's second victory in succession moves them up two places to eighth. Villa midfielder Westwood said this week that it has been difficult to watch Match of the Day alongside his son this season because of his team's desperate form. Sadly for Westwood, it will not be any easier this weekend as it was he who conceded the penalty that led to Stoke's first goal, clumsily stopping right-back Bardsley as he broke forward after 50 minutes. When Villa fell 2-0 behind five minutes later there was still over half an hour to play but the visitors' heads dropped, with morale rock-bottom following a 6-0 loss to Liverpool in their previous game and only three league wins all season. Before the match, Villa manager Remi Garde said he was not seeing enough commitment from all his players in training. While they did pull one goal back when Bacuna slotted in as Stoke appealed for handball against Rudy Gestede in the build-up, they never looked like taking anything from the game. Apart from Bacuna's strike, the only occasions when a Villa player looked like putting the ball in the net was when defender Jores Okore twice nearly scored own goals, both times being spared by excellent saves from Mark Bunn. It might be stating the obvious but relegation is surely a certainty. Mark Hughes' side went into this game on the same points total as this stage last season and the victory keeps them on target for another top-10 finish. After three successive 3-0 losses in the league, Stoke have rebounded by beating Bournemouth and Aston Villa and look again like one of the Premier League's most stubborn opponents. Arnautovic was their catalyst throughout, creating their best openings in a poor first half before netting both their goals as the Potters effectively won the game in the first 15 minutes of the second period. While Stoke's set-pieces were often poor, they were always a threat from the flanks in open play. Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri - who created the second goal - were frequent providers as the home team sent over 26 crosses. Hosting Newcastle on Wednesday - another team in the bottom three - gives Stoke the chance to keep up the momentum. Managers' reaction Stoke boss Mark Hughes speaking to BBC Sport: ""We needed to be a little more dynamic in the second half and we were. Media playback is not supported on this device ""At 2-0 we were quite comfortable and cruising to a conclusion. The referee should have given a free-kick to ourselves [in the build-up to Aston Villa's goal] but at 2-1.... that was a threat to us but all in all I felt we coped with it. ""Every time we have had a little blip we have bounced back very quickly and we have done that today."" Aston Villa boss Remi Garde, speaking to BBC Sport: ""The players did what they can. Media playback is not supported on this device ""The first 45 minutes we were OK and defended well.

"Ethnically it is highly diverse, with more than 300 local languages. The people range from rural hunter-gatherers to a modern urban elite. Sophisticated kingdoms existed before the arrival of the Dutch, who consolidated their hold over two centuries, eventually uniting the archipelago in around 1900. After Japan's wartime occupation ended, independence was proclaimed in 1945 by Sukarno, the independence movement's leader. The Dutch transferred sovereignty in 1949 after an armed struggle. Indonesia profile - home Read more country profiles Profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring Long-term leader General Suharto came to power in the wake of an abortive coup in 1965. He imposed authoritarian rule while allowing technocrats to run the economy with considerable success. But his policy of allowing army involvement in all levels of government, down to village level, fostered corruption. His ""transmigration"" programmes - which moved large numbers of landless farmers from Java to other parts of the country - fanned ethnic conflict. Suharto fell from power after riots in 1998 and escaped efforts to bring him to justice for decades of dictatorship. Post-Suharto Indonesia has made the transition to democracy. Power has been devolved away from the central government and the first direct presidential elections were held in 2004. Indonesia has undergone a resurgence since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, becoming one of the world's major emerging economies. Investors are attracted by a large consumer base, rich natural resources and political stability, but often equally deterred by poor infrastructure, rampant corruption and growing calls for economic protectionism. The country faces demands for independence in several provinces, where secessionists have been encouraged by East Timor's 1999 success in breaking away after a traumatic 25 years of occupation. Militant Islamic groups have flexed their muscles over the past few years. Some have been accused of having links with al-Qaeda, including the group blamed for the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, and others more recently with Islamic State. Lying near the intersection of shifting tectonic plates, Indonesia is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. A powerful undersea quake in late 2004 sent massive waves crashing into coastal areas of Sumatra, and into coastal communities across south and east Asia.

"Ties have sharply deteriorated in recent years, and the government in Warsaw has sharply criticised Russia's conduct in Ukraine. But Mr Andreyev's interpretation of history brought relations to a new low. He told reporters his remarks had not been ""sufficiently precise."" The ambassador was speaking outside the Polish foreign ministry, after he was summoned over his comments on Polish TV channel TVN24 on Friday. However, his comments to Russian media later made clear that there was unlikely to be any immediate improvement in relations. ""I am not retracting my remarks, I am simply making a clarification because they were misinterpreted,"" he said, adamant that he was referring not to the start of the war but to the catastrophe in Poland. There had been no discussion about his possible expulsion from Poland, he added. A Polish official said that during the meeting it was noted that the envoy's remarks had been ""untrue and contrary to the findings of Polish and Russian historians."" He said the Russian parliament itself had in 2010 directly blamed Soviet dictator Josef Stalin for ordering the 1940 massacre of 20,000 Polish prisoners of war at Katyn. Mr Andreyev had argued that Poland was partly responsible for what happened in September 1939, because ""during the 1930s Poland repeatedly blocked the formation of a coalition against Hitler's Germany."" The war erupted in September 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland from the west, little over a week after the USSR and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Soviet forces entered Poland from the east that same month, as part of the secret agreement. Mr Andreyev had also suggested that the Soviet invasion was ""to ensure the safety of the USSR"" and was not an aggressive act. Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz pointed out at the weekend that ""even children in Poland know that neither Ribbentrop nor Molotov was Polish,"" condemning the Nazi-Soviet carve-up of her country. The ambassador's interview on Friday was broadcast hours after Poland's ambassador to Moscow, Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz, was herself summoned to the Russian foreign ministry because the graves of 57 Soviet soldiers were vandalised at a cemetery in Milejczyce in north-eastern Poland. The vandalism was strongly condemned by the Polish government.

The Metropolitan, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Jersey and Kent forces are conducting separate inquiries into the late MP. The BBC understands Wiltshire Police halted an inquiry into Forde in the 1990s. On Monday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would look at whether a case was dropped by Wiltshire Police when a person involved made claims against Sir Edward. Forde was later convicted of controlling prostitutes after a successful prosecution by the same force. She was jailed for six years after a trial that included allegations that she had supplied children as young as 13 to her clients. Fourteen years later Forde was prosecuted and jailed again for inciting prostitution. Richard Griffiths, Forde's solicitor in 1992, has now spoken on her behalf to the Salisbury Journal. He told the newspaper: ""My former client wishes me to make it very clear that at no stage did she state that Ted Heath was a client and at no stage did she threaten to expose him as a client of hers if the prosecution was continued. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, Myra Forde wishes me to make it clear that she had no involvement with Ted Heath of any kind and has no knowledge of any misconduct on his part."" He also said that, at the time of that case, the prosecution ""took what, at the time, seemed a sensible decision that they could not prove their case and offered no evidence."" Historical child abuse: Key investigations A spokesman for the UK's ongoing independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard, said that although the allegations about Sir Edward fell within its terms of reference, it had not received any direct allegations. Sir Edward, who was Conservative prime minister from 1970 to 1974, died aged 89 in 2005 at his home in Salisbury. Wiltshire Police has declined to comment on the claims that it did not follow up accusations against him during his lifetime, but has appealed for information regarding allegations against Sir Edward. Meanwhile, Labour MP Tom Watson said he had referred two allegations of child sexual abuse by Sir Edward to the police since 2012, with police confirming that at least one of those allegations was being investigated. Friends of Sir Edward have dismissed the claims, saying there is not a shred of evidence to link him to abuse. The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, which operates the museum at Arundells, his home in Salisbury, said it ""wholeheartedly"" believed the investigation would clear Sir Edward's name.",1,223
"The announcement of the coaching changes at Surrey on the day of the Australia-Sri Lanka Champions Trophy game at The Oval meant juggling meetings and phone calls with stints in the commentary box for Test Match Special. It was an 18-hour rollercoaster and I must admit there will be a few more similar lengthy working days ahead for me. Sport can be a ruthless business and both Chris Adams and Ian Salisbury have been thanked for their efforts over the last four and half years by Surrey as the club now looks to move things forward in a new direction. My new role is to oversee professional cricket at the club. Due to my other working commitments, I will not be at every day of every match but I will be putting structures in place for the immediate future and beyond while our bowling coach Stuart Barnes will step up and run the side on a day-to-day basis. With good communication and planning we're optimistic that this new-set up can help take the team forward while the club seeks a long-term successor to Chris. The Champions Trophy has delivered two fascinating semi-finals this week, with England taking on South Africa at The Oval on Wednesday before India and Sri Lanka meet in Cardiff the following day. Alastair Cook's men will have their work cut out to overcome a South Africa side who seem to be growing into the tournament. Despite the loss of Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and Morne Morkel, they have stepped up to the mark, with Colin Ingram and David Miller showing against West Indies that they can be dangerous batsman at this level. Dale Steyn's return to fitness has given them added potency with the ball at just the right time, alongside useful contributions from Chris Morris and Ryan McLaren. England have reached the last four after sticking to a method that may have come in for a fair bit of criticism but has proved successful. Much of the scrutiny has focused on the top three batsmen and their perceived reluctance to play high-risk cricket, but I am more concerned by the lack of runs from the middle order to date. Ravi Bopara showed the way with his 13-ball 33 against Sri Lanka, but now is the time for Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler to come to the party. I think the new ball will be the key to deciding the outcome of this match. Can England's top order handle the pace and skill of Steyn? How will South Africa fare against Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad? My heart says England, but my head says South Africa. The all-Asian second semi-final is a repeat of the 2011 World Cup final and if it proves half as good a game as that was, the spectators in Cardiff will be in for a treat. Sri Lanka have shown they are a dangerous team with good wins over England and Australia, but India are a level above any other side in this tournament and I fully expect them to go on and reach the final. From numbers one to 11 they have played outstanding cricket. They are younger and hungrier than Indian sides of the past and their athletic fielding has added another dimension to their play. They have the tournament's outstanding batsman in Shikhar Dhawan and a richly-varied bowling attack that blends the pace of Ishant Sharma and the swing of Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the exceptional spin axis of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Sri Lanka will be looking to one of their proven match-winners - Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene or Lasith Malinga - to tilt things their way, but unless India have an off day, I can only see one winner. Alec Stewart was talking to BBC Sport's Sam Sheringham.",1,224
"At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims. It has called on the government to offer tax breaks to encourage building and investment in the sector. The Conservative Party has indicated its focus remains on home ownership. The number of UK households renting property rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 5.4 million in 2014, according to Rics. It said that any further investment in property by landlords had been hit by changes to stamp duty in April. Anyone buying a home that is not their main residence must now pay a 3 stamp duty surcharge. In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated. This led to a spike in property purchases in March, with transactions falling quickly again thereafter. Next year, landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill is removed. Rics suggests that the stamp duty increase should be reversed, a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors. Generation Rent, a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants, said the higher rate of stamp duty was a good thing. ""It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up,"" said Dan Wilson Craw, the policy manager of Generation Rent. ""In the first three months of the surcharge, the tax on second homes raised PS424m - that cash could help build new homes for people on low incomes."" A body that represents landlords said that rents were likely to rise. ""Tenants will be hurt most, as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more,"" said David Cox, the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA). ""The simple answer is that we need to build more homes."" In addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase, Rics also called for: Rics' call comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take ""unprecedented steps"" to encourage construction of homes for people to buy. He told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was ""a huge issue for our country"" and would be his ""number-one priority."" He said: ""Far too many young people cannot get a foot on the housing ladder. Many are being forced to live back with mum and dad as rents soar faster than wages."" Among the plans announced was an Accelerated Construction scheme, using PS2bn of new public sector borrowing to make public land with outline planning permission available to builders.

"Georg Niedermeier's own goal gave Pep Guardiola's side a half-time lead, which David Alaba doubled. Daniel Didavi fired into the top corner for Stuttgart, but Douglas Costa's long-range shot sealed Bayern's win. Borussia Dortmund, in second, can cut the gap to five points with a win at Schalke on Sunday. Bayern need a maximum of 11 points from their final five league matches to secure the title for Guardiola before he leaves to join Manchester City at the end of the season. The Bayern boss rotated his squad with Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg trip to Benfica in mind, beginning with Thomas Muller, Philipp Lahm, Costa and Thiago on the bench. But he brought on Muller after just 27 minutes, concerned that Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal was in danger of getting sent off after making two reckless challenges and collecting an early booking. Stuttgart captain Niedermeier scored at the wrong end as he stretched to prevent Franck Ribery's cross reaching Robert Lewandowski. Austria international Alaba added another early in the second half, showing neat footwork before beating goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton at the near post. Didavi, Stuttgart's leading scorer, improvised superbly to pull a goal back with just under half-an-hour left as he hooked the ball past Manuel Neuer while on the ground for his 11th of the season, but Costa's 25-yard drive ended hopes of a comeback. Augsburg moved out of the bottom three as they came from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Werder Bremen, who dropped into the relegation play-off place. Alfred Finnbogason and Hong Jeong-ho scored for the visitors after Florian Grillitsch's first goal of the season had put Bremen in front just before half-time. Hoffenheim are three points above Bremen after a third victory in four games as they won 2-0 at next-to-bottom at Eintracht Frankfurt. Darmstadt improved their survival chances with a 2-1 win at Hamburg, while Ingolstadt are eighth thanks to a 1-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach.",1,227
"Last year's runner-up will bid to become the first top weight to triumph since Red Rum in 1974. A sell-out crowd of 70,000 is expected at Aintree Racecourse on Merseyside. Vieux Lion Rouge and Definitly Red are among the favourites with bookmakers expecting up to PS300m to be wagered on the race. Travel for racegoers was expected to be disrupted as workers at three rail companies carried out a a 24-hour strike on the day of the Grand National. The official going at the track is described as Good, Good to Soft in places and a dry, sunny day is forecast with temperatures reaching 16C. Jockey Liam Treadwell will miss the big race after a fall at Aintree on Friday. Treadwell, who won the National in 2009 on 100-1 shot Mon Mome, will be replaced on 40-1 chance Tenor Nivernais by Aidan Coleman. Vieux Lion Rouge, which translates from French to Old Red Lion, is a leading fancy after winning the Becher Chase over the National fences in December and February's Grand National Trial at Haydock. Seventh in the National last year, he is one of four runners trained by David Pipe, and is about a 10-1 chance along with Definitly Red, an impressive winner at Doncaster last month for Brian Ellison. The National is a handicap chase, with each runner allotted a different weight to carry by the official handicapper Phil Smith. With 11st 10lb, The Last Samuri will be carrying more than a stone more than last year. Other contenders near the top of the betting include the JP McManus-owned pair More Of That and Cause Of Causes, Haydock runner-up Blaklion, and the Scottish-trained One For Arthur. However, the National has a habit of throwing up surprise results, as evidenced by recent years. The past five winners have started at odds of 33-1, 25-1, 25-1, 66-1 and 33-1. Irish trainer Mouse Morris scored an emotional victory last year with the now-retired Rule The World - 10 months after the death of his son Christopher. Morris, who runs Irish National winners Rogue Angel and Thunder and Roses this time, said: ""We're going there with no pressure as the likelihood of winning it two years in a row is probably non-existent."" Coverage of the National, over 30 fences and more than four and a quarter miles, is said to be followed by 600 million people worldwide. The marathon test see runners negotiate iconic obstacles such as Becher's Brook and The Chair. Terminally ill five-year-old boy Bradley Lowery is to be given honorary 41st place in the National racecard. The race is again due to start at 17:15 BST, having been put back an hour by organisers last year in an effort to further increase the audience. Armed police have been in attendance at the course during the three-day meeting which started on Thursday. This year's race comes in the wake of the Westminster terror attack and marks the 20th anniversary of the National being delayed by an IRA bomb scare. Media playback is not supported on this device Katie Walsh will seek to become the first female jockey to win the National after overcoming a late injury scare. Walsh was initially reported to be ruled out with a broken arm following a fall in the Foxhunters' Chase over the big fences on Thursday, but escaped with bruising. ""I feel fine, a bit sore but I'm 100,"" said 32-year-old Walsh, who will ride 33-1 chance Wonderful Charm, with opponents including brother Ruby on Pleasant Company. ""There is only one Grand National and to get the opportunity to ride in the race again is brilliant."" Wonderful Charm is one of five runners for Paul Nicholls - along with Cheltenham Gold Cup fifth Saphir Du Rheu, Scottish National winner Vicente, Le Mercurey and Just A Par. Media playback is not supported on this device Known as a unique challenge for horse and rider, the race draws criticism from opponents, including animal welfare groups. Officials believe amendments to the fences, and other alterations, introduced four years ago have helped improve safety. The course spent PS1.5m on changes after two horses were fatally injured in each of the Grand Nationals of 2011 and 2012. Since then there have been no fatalities in the National itself, although in the same period there have been six in the four other races staged over the track during the year. BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght Pleasant Company is my selection to win for trainer Willie Mullins and jockey Ruby Walsh. The team triumphed with Hedgehunter in 2005 and Walsh was also successful on Papillon, trained by his father Ted, five years earlier. Pleasant Company put in a most encouraging performance to win at Fairyhouse. He'll keep out of trouble, before - hopefully - gradually picking off rivals and arriving late on the scene. The Jonjo O'Neill-trained More Of That was a champion over hurdles, and a respectable sixth in this season's Cheltenham Gold Cup, giving the impression he's coming to the boil. Scotland's One For Arthur is another gradually building his reputation, while Lord Windermere - who's not won since the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup - had top weight two years ago, but much less this time, and will have his favoured drier ground conditions. I can see him going well at big odds. Cornelius' 1-2-3-4: 1 Pleasant Company 2 More Of That 3 One For Arthur 4 Lord Windermere Jump jockey and BBC Radio 5 live pundit Andrew Thornton ""It's still a great test of skill. You need some luck and your horse to take to the fences. ""There's 40 runners, when most races wouldn't be near half that size, so you're hoping for a clear passage. ""It's wide open this year. Definitly Red is likely to be popular on Merseyside with supporters of Liverpool FC. ""I like Blaklion. The better ground will suit him, his jockey's in red-hot form and his trainer has won the race twice before.""",1,228
"Aiden Hughes, with an address of Balmoral Road, Bangor, posed as a teenage boy before meeting his victim in a Belfast park. During the meeting, he touched the girl over her clothes. He later admitted the charge against him. Belfast Crown Court heard Hughes had marriage problems and took to the internet to ""escape the stress."" A prosecution lawyer told the court that Hughes met the girl on a social networking site, while pretending to be a 14-year-old called Matt Smith. They began exchanging emails which soon became sexual. Hughes asked the girl for meetings and later told her he was 20, and not 14 as previously stated, and admitted his name was Aiden. His victim reported that he made her feel ""a little bit sorry for him."" A defence solicitor for Hughes said he was a young man who did an extremely stupid thing and was deeply ashamed of his actions. The judge ruled Hughes be put on the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years and also made him the subject of a ten-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order, disqualifying him from working with children and restricting his use of the internet. On his release from prison, he will be required to live at an address approved by the authorities. The judge told Hughes the impact on the then 14-year-old could not be ignored or forgotten and that adults deliberately making contact with young children for sexual activity would not be tolerated.",1,229
"Radwan Hamed collapsed during a game in Belgium in 2006. Last year a judge ruled Spurs breached its duties to him. In a screening prior to signing for the club, an electrocardiogram test showed his heart was ""unequivocally abnormal"" but he was not stopped from playing. The club regretted a former employee had been remiss in their duties. In a statement, the family of Mr Hamed, who is now 27, said they were ""relieved"" a settlement had been reached, following a decade-long legal battle. ""Just as Radwan had no choice but to start his difficult journey towards recovery, we had no choice but to start the difficult journey to obtain justice,"" they said. ""We risked losing our home and faced personal financial ruin in order to pursue justice for our son. ""The club did not tell us or Radwan about his potentially fatal condition. Had they done so, Radwan would not have continued to play football."" The teenager collapsed during the game against Cercle Bruges on 4 August 2006 and was rushed to an intensive care unit but suffered oxygen starvation to his brain. In the 2015 hearing, Mr Justice Hickinbottom ruled the club was 70 liable or Mr Hamed's injuries and Dr Peter Mills, the Football Association's regional cardiologist for South East England, was 30 liable. The Premier League club will not be hit with a fee directly as their 70 portion was incurred by physicians they previously employed, who have agreed to indemnify the club. Football Association rules require all football academy recruits to be referred to a cardiologist to help identify those prone to potentially fatal heart conditions. Mr Hamed's MRI scan showed no obvious signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Dr Mills wrote to Spurs saying the condition could not be excluded on these findings alone. Eleven months later, the teenager, who was unaware his tests had revealed an ""abnormal"" heart condition, signed a contract with Spurs. A spokesman for Spurs said: ""The club wholeheartedly regrets that a former employee, as adjudged, was remiss in their duties to Radwan. ""This judgment will hopefully now secure the best possible treatment and care for him.""",1,230

"General Vladimir Padrino tweeted that the ""leaders and masterminds of the paramilitary and terrorist assault"" had been arrested. The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and a lieutenant, Jefferson Garcia. Two of the rebels were killed and eight seized after the incident in Valencia. Venezuela has seen four months of violent anti-government protests, and almost 130 people have died in clashes. Just before the barracks attack, a video released on social media showed the uniformed men saying they were rising against the ""murderous tyranny of President Nicolas Maduro."" ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caguaripano was discharged from the army in 2014. They claim he commanded around 20 uniformed men during the attack. He then escaped with Lieutenant Garcia and some stolen weaponry, they say. The 6 August incident raised tensions in the divided country, where critics of President Maduro say he is trying to cement a dictatorship. Mr Maduro insists his actions - which include creating a pro-government assembly with the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution - are the only way to re-establish peace. The US has led a chorus of international alarm against the Maduro government in recent weeks, and has imposed sanctions on several high-ranking Venezuelans - including the president. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had not ruled out ""a possible military option if necessary"" against Venezuela. Gen Padrino dismissed the claim as an act of ""craziness."" He told Venezuela's state television: ""It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States. ""As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela."" The White House said Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with his US counterpart on Friday. It said President Trump would speak to Venezuela's leader ""as soon as democracy is restored in that country.""",1,232

"No, President Xi Jinping of China isn't back for second helpings from the Buckingham Palace banquet, this time it is the Indian prime minister who is stopping by. India has overtaken China to take the top spot in the tables of international economic good health and David Cameron is getting ready to roll out the red carpet for Narendra Modi. Mr Cameron will be pulling out all the stops. The Indian prime minister isn't a head of state so he won't get the full bearskin and gilded carriage reception accorded to the Chinese president last month. He will, however, get lunch with the Queen and a superstar appearance at Wembley stadium where we are told he will be joined on stage by Mr Cameron. The warmth of the welcome is evidence of how the terms of trade between the two countries have shifted in recent years. Now Britain is the eager suitor proffering bouquets on bended knee; India the slightly aloof object of desire. 110,000 people are employed by Indian companies operating in the UK 13 Indian companies each employ more than 1,000 people in the UK 65,000 people work for Tata Group, which owns 5 of those 13 companies 28,000 of those work for Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover Mr Modi sells himself as a non-nonsense technocrat who transformed his home state, Gujarat, into an economic powerhouse. He won a landslide a year-and-a-half ago on the promise that he would do the same for the entire country. He has suffered some setbacks. Many of his reforms have been blocked in parliament but India is still a formidable economic force, growing at some 7 a year. Mr Cameron told Mr Modi last year that ""relations with India are at the top of the priorities of UK's foreign policy."" And he has put in the air miles to prove he is serious. He has visited India three times since he came to power, even leading the largest trade mission ever made by a British prime minister to any nation. He brought enough government ministers and business people to Mumbai in February last year to fill a jumbo jet. It is easy to see why he's so keen. India is now the third biggest source of foreign investment in the UK with billions staked. The jewel in the crown - so to speak - is Jaguar Land Rover. The carmaker is now part of the vast Indian multinational, Tata, which also owns that other emblematic English business, Tetley Tea. Indian entrepreneurs, including the Tatas, also control what is left of the once mighty British steel industry, though that has been going through tough times recently. Nevertheless, to date Mr Modi has not exactly swooned before Britain's charms. He acknowledges David Cameron is a ""good friend"" of India but has not rushed to buddy up. He's visited dozens of countries in his effort to persuade the world to ""Make in India"" but, until now, has bypassed Britain. In part that is because so much else bypasses Britain these days. The sad truth is the UK doesn't even make India's top 10 trading partners. Mr Modi has - rather generously - suggested he sees this as opportunity. He announced on Facebook that he sees ""immense scope for our economic and trade relations to improve and this will benefit both our economies."" And the two nations' deep ties of history and people - Britain is home to one of the largest Indian diaspora in the world - do still count for something. British behemoths like Unilever, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and British American Tobacco still have deep roots in India. Meanwhile, a new generation - think Costa Coffee, JCB, Vodafone - is proving that with patience and hard work British brands can prosper in India. Even the British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver wants a bite of the action. He's just opened his first restaurant in Delhi. Publicly the leaders say they hope the two countries will build on successes like these next week, but behind the scenes we are already being warned not to expect too much. Word is there won't be any single multi-billion mega-project, instead we'll be told a lower-key story about closer financial ties, a smoothing of obstacles to trade, together with news of a clutch of smaller trade and investment deals. But the trip comes at a propitious time for Mr Modi. He's just received a battering in a key election in the poorest state in India and this visit could be just the tonic he needs. A photo-opportunity with Her Majesty, a rousing reception at the mother of parliaments and what the organisers of his Wembley gig claim will be the biggest fireworks display in British history should all help to burnish his image before he returns home to face his growing host of challenges.",1,236
"Cyber-attacks, trolls, terrorist propaganda, sexism, racism, Twitter mobs.... stop the web now, Mr Berners-Lee, we want to get off. So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most viral videos and memes (see 2012's, 2013's and 2014's), I decided to impose a couple of ground rules to keep things upbeat. Rule number one: nothing miserable. The world was a scary place in 2015. Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven. Rule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral. As in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit. Of course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun. Off we go! One of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career. Asked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world. His ""frostbit"" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single. If you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza. And not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe ""malfunction"" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance. She was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up. Left Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world. Katy Perry's lawyers tried to trademark ""left shark,"" but were denied. Also in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply ""the dress"" was stirring debate. Optical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the whitegold or blueblack dress became one of the most shared of the year. And then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we? If Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences. ""Weasels are fearless,"" commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke. Evidently! Also in March, shocking footage emerged from Thailand showing an elephant, clearly intoxicated, clambering into a bath. Did I say intoxicated? I meant adorable. Annual sense-of-humour-vacuum April Fools' Day brings a flood of prank videos. Most are terrible, but some are beautifully executed - like this magic from a maths teacher in California. It racked up an impressive 13 million views. Maths was a continuing theme in April.

In May, the Dancing Man had a huge party thrown for him in Los Angeles - attended by Monica Lewinsky, Moby and Andrew WK. ""I'm still pinching myself,"" Mr O'Brien said. Back in London, it was a ""hipster cop"" that had people talking. Peter Swinger - who sports a stylish, curly moustache - was spotted on duty at a protest march. However, according to the Daily Mail, a close relative said Mr Singer, a father of three, was ""definitely not a hipster."" What a hipster thing to say. Behold, the best double-take ever captured on film. Champion surfer Mick Fanning waiting just six days to get back into the water after this terrifying incident. The 34-year-old was competing in South Africa when two sharks appeared in the water. No problem for Mr Fanning, though - he just punched one of them and swam off, avoiding probable death. Kevin Innes found a pile of dog toys in a shop in Norway. And then he pressed them. The Guardian called the resulting clip the ""best thing on the internet today."" I'd go as far as declaring it the best thing on the internet this entire year. Why? It sums up the very best thing about viral hits - that ability to give the entire world that ""oh, you had to be there"" experience. Also in August, everyone melted after watching this little lad who definitely isn't going to miss his mum when he's at school. The undoubted star of this next clip is the woman in the passenger seat. Quiet, stoic... resigned. Next to her, the now world-famous Ronnie Pickering. Who? Ronnie Pickering. Who? RONNIE PICKERING! Mr Pickering's road rage was captured on film by cyclist Steve Middleton, and spread around the world as people asked: ""Who's Ronnie Pickering?"" The video can be viewed here, but be warned it contains a flood of swear words. Mr Pickering's son later took to Twitter to say his Dad's a great guy and a great laugh. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt - we all have our off days. Meanwhile, in September, this Manhattan rat was having the ""on"" day to end them all. In this internet age, it's quite reassuring that the humble music video format still has the ability to get people talking. Though now, it's not enough to merely like a music video - you have to remix it. Hip hop artistdancing visionary Drake's video for Hotline Bling spawned hundreds of remakes. To save you the time, just watch this one - it's by far the best. For a short while in October it seemed that every cat owner in the world was buying up cucumbers to scare their cats. (Although it must be said that experts later advised against it - it's pretty mean.) There are numerous theories as to why cats seem to jump out of their skin at the sight of a cucumber - one expert, speaking to ABC News, said it's because cats are genetically wired to bounce away from snakes. Ever since the demise of CBBC's Record Breakers, the public's appetite for world-beaters has been left unsatisfied. Good job we've got Otto, then, a bulldog who rode a skateboard through the legs of 30 people. If there's one thing we've learned this year, it's that being Irish increases your viral potential by roughly 100x. Here, TV news reporter Teresa Mannion took to the coastline of Galway, in the west of Ireland, to broadcast to RTE viewers. But Storm Desmond had other ideas, giving poor Ms Mannion a right blustering. ""Don't swim in the sea!"" she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the internet got to work. And on Christmas Day, a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards. So, there we have it. An eclectic year of road rage, Irishness, dresses and sharks of varying ferocity. The next year could see big changes to the internet. Debates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this series of tubes works. But through it all, let's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously. When life gives you cucumbers, make a video.

"The scooter Danny Glass was riding on with Sophie Emma Rose Anderson collided with a truck in Phuket on 8 May. Mr Glass, 29, originally from Margate, escaped serious injury. Now he and the lorry driver Natt Awut Timsue are to be charged with causing death by reckless driving, Thai police said. Mr Glass - who lived in Thailand with Ms Anderson - is to hear the charges formally on Thursday and a translator has been called in for the hearing. His family is expected to attend. Ms Anderson, 41, originally from Blackpool, was a keen video blogger, as was Mr Glass. She had a YouTube channel called Sophie's Joy Breastfeeding Mama, on which she uploaded videos about nursing her son until the age of eight. After her death Mr Glass paid tribute to her in a video he uploaded on YouTube. He said he ""missed her so much"" and added: ""Somebody wake me up from this nightmare.... she is meant to be having my baby in three months."" On Tuesday he posted another video titled'When will I come back to Youtube', in which he stated he would not be posting any more videos for ""a while"" and did not know when he would return online. He said: ""It's not the right time at the moment, I need to get my life in order and get through this death.""

"The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to ""reduce significantly"" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the changes are yet to be announced. Downing Street said the prime minister accepted reforms needed to take place. However, officials have refused to say when any decisions might be taken. Critics say stop and search unfairly targets the black community. In November, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that, overall, black people were six times more likely than white people to be stopped, with Asian or other ethnic minority groups two times more likely to be stopped. On 4 December, Home Secretary Theresa May wrote seeking approval from the cabinet's home affairs committee to a ""package of measures."" This included a plan to ""amend section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 so that the test for the power's use is'necessary' and'expedient', (to prevent incidents involving serious violence)."" Under Section 60, police can stop and search someone for weapons in a designated area, for a specific time, without suspicion that the individual is involved in wrongdoing. However, a senior officer must hold a reasonable belief that violence has happened or may occur in the area. Mrs May told cabinet colleagues she intended to ""raise the level of authorisation to a senior officer who must reasonably believe that violence'will' take place (as opposed to'may ."" She continued: ""I expect this to reduce significantly the number of stop and searches under section 60. Section 60 is only one kind of stop and search."" One minister told Newsnight's chief correspondent Laura Kuenssberg that ""we all want to get on"" with the changes. But sources told her they feared ""there's just a lack of will, a fear of looking soft on crime."" The Liberal Democrats agree with the proposals and Labour has offered cross party talks to push the policy forward. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""Instead of internal rows over this, Theresa May should accept our offer to work together to change stop and search."" The prime minister's former adviser on youth and crime, Shaun Bailey, said: ""Not getting stop and search right, certainly in urban communities, would be very dangerous because I believe it breeds criminals. ""If I was talking to someone in government I'd say:'Take the brave pill, you'll be rewarded for taking the brave pill and reforming stop and search'."" He added: ""There's many communities up and down the country who are divorced from politics and feel that the forces-that-be don't represent them and don't care about them. This would be a massive message in the right direction."" While filming in Brixton, south London, Newsnight spoke to a teenager who said he had been stopped and searched as an 11 year-old. ""Since then I've despised them [the police] more and more because for me they are like criminals in fancy dress,"" he said. ""They've got such a big mob mentality."" Another young man said he had been stopped and searched by the police ""over 100 times"" because he was ""in a black neighbourhood"" where the police ""think everyone is a drug dealer."" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed that random stop and search powers had created distrust between some communities and the police in London. He said over the last two years the Met had reduced the number of stop and searches by over a third, while doubling the number of arrests to one in five. ""We employ human beings, they make mistakes and when we make a mistake - particularly with someone who's innocent of any crime, and frankly never will be guilty of any crime - we leave a really bad imprint on that child, on that family, so it's important we get it right. ""But I think it's an important power, that used wisely, is really effective.""",1,240
"The concerns came amid Sportscotland plans to reduce sport funding in Scotland by 20. Scottish Athletics, which runs the initiative to encourage non-club runners to take exercise, said it was shocked by the decision. The Scottish government said PS50,000 had been provided last year to help JogScotland become more sustainable. The scheme has been in place since 2002 and has evolved into a network of over 300 clubs with about 40,000 members. Of those who joined a JogScotland programme, 68.6 were previously inactive, most were over 40 and 77 were female. Every Tuesday night, JogScotland's Leven group, known as ""Leven Las Vegas"" has met at the local swimming pool before heading out on a social jog, walk or run. Malcolm MacTavish, 61, who is one of the group's regulars, said five years ago he weighed 100kg and was on the maximum dosage of blood pressure tablets. He said: ""One day I just stopped and said I had to do something about it and I looked around for ways to improve my health and came across'Couch to 5K'. ""Within a year I had lost a third of my body weight and was off medication totally."" In the aftermath of the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, Scottish Athletics said the initiative was a key priority. The organisation's CEO Mark Munro said the decision to pull the funding was not theirs. ""We're absolutely devastated and shocked as well,"" he said. ""We received a PS100,000 from the government roughly for the last number of years and for a reason unknown to ourselves, the funding has been cut."" He said less than 20 of Scottish Athletics budget was spent on elite athletes with the majority being used to support clubs, coaching and development pathways. The Scottish government said it was ""making significant investment in sport and physical activity"" and that the funding for JogScotland was never direct. A spokesman said: ""In 201617 Sportscotland provided Scottish Athletics with PS65,000 to create a digital pilot system to demonstrate the impact which the JogScotland programme is having, and to use this to generate commercial income. ""An additional PS50,000 was provided by Sportscotland to further support the transition of the JogScotland programme to a more sustainable model. ""In terms of the budget allocations for 201718, Scottish Athletics will discuss with Sportscotland how they plan to carry forward their strategic plan and their priorities for the forthcoming year."" The initiative is now in discussions with mental health charity SAMh about the possibility of a funding partnership. JogScotland Fife group leader Ian Shield, said he did not mind where the funding came from as long as the ""important resource"" was not lost. ""The way I look at it, we get about 40 people here on a Tuesday night,"" he said. ""People see 40 people dressed up to go running. I see 40 people who in 20 years time won't be lying in an NHS bed trying to recover from diabetes or circulation problems, heart problems, obesity. ""That's what I see.""",1,241
"Jon Schueler, who died in New York in 1992 at the age of 75, created many of his pieces from a studio in Mallaig in the Highlands. He was inspired by views of the Sound of Sleat and also of Skye, which lies across the stretch of sea. An arts symposium and exhibition at the college runs from Friday to Sunday. Called An Linne: Echoes, Reflections and Transfigurations, the events mark the centenary of the artist's birth in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1916. The painter, who served as a navigator on US bombers flown out of England during World War Two, moved to Mallaig in 1957 and he continued to visit and work in the village in the north-west Highlands throughout his career. Many of his pieces were influenced by the changing weather on the west coast and the effect the conditions had on the sea. Magda Salvesen, curator of the Jon Schueler Estate, said: ""The Sound of Sleat became to Schueler a place of experience, memory and mood. ""The specificity of this body of water fed Schueler's paintings - their imagery enlarged through layers of memory. ""How appropriate and challenging that the symposium celebrating the artist's centenary should be held on Skye, an island seen through changing weather from his studio in Mallaig."" The celebration at SMO - Scotland's National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture, and which offers a Jon Schueler Residency scholarship - includes talks on Schueler's life and work and an exhibition of selected pieces from his time in Mallaig. Donnie Munro, director of development, fundraising and the arts at SMO, described the artist as having a ""profoundly deep experiential affinity with the Sound of Sleat."" He said this connection led Schueler to create some of his most celebrated works.",1,242
"She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. ""I never get to do stuff like this,"" marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot ""past Ventura and lenses plenty"" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year. ""I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches,"" she says. ""I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. ""I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them."" But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind may you stand proud and strong; while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival ""whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount."" It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with ""looking for love in all the wrong places."" ""I kind of got jolted into the real world again,"" she says. ""Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. ""And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening."" Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it ""never feels like work,"" she says. ""Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. ""So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music."" On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. ""It was really fun!"" she says of working with AAP Rocky and The Weeknd. ""I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record."" More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems. ""I was definitely nervous,"" says Del Rey of the recording session. ""She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. ""When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out! ""I said to her over the mic,'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like,'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' ""I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. ""That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me."" Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. ""That song started out really revealing,"" she says. ""I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything."" Once the initial version was ""out of my system,"" she says, the recording was ""deleted completely then started from scratch."" The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: ""I want to move out of the black, into the blue."" ""I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of,"" she says of the original. ""Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record."" She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an ""underground sect"" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, ""he hit me and it felt like a kiss."" ""I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more,"" she says now. ""Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully."" On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. ""I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords,"" she explains. ""I was leaning in to him and saying,'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like,'That is it, trust me'. ""I listened for 10 seconds and I was like,'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. ""But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me."" She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. ""I'm so glad,"" she says. ""Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?"" I tell her it was like being in church. ""Oh, stop!"" she beams, and bursts into laughter. That good mood isn't going anywhere soon.

"Councils are relying on agency workers to cover nearly 4,000 out of 5,500 otherwise empty posts. Social workers say they are under constant pressure because of media coverage and criticism of their role in high profile cases such as the death of Ayeeshia Jane Smith. Local authorities say social workers leave for better pay as agency staff. And the Department for Education (DFE) said it was investing PS100m to recruit graduates and professionals. There were 26,500 full time equivalent posts filled by children's social workers at the end of September 2015, 1,880 more than the year before. Yet a further 5,470 were vacant. The number of agency workers filling vacant posts was equivalent to more than double the total number of employed children's social workers in the North East. Official figures showed there were 4,400 new starters as children's social workers in English councils between September 2014 and September 2015. Over the same period, 4,200 people left. The picture varies from council to council. 26,500 Children's social workers 5,470 Vacant posts 3,850 agency staff in vacant posts 4,440 social workers started jobs between September 2014 and 2015 4,200 social workers left jobs over the same period The DFE said part of the increase ""can be explained by improved data quality"" with some councils now including management roles that were not in previous years' figures. The rise in vacancies ""is an unexpected increase"" and may be down to councils not having previously counted vacancies covered by agency workers. The figures show that Havering in east London saw the biggest percentage fall in the number of social workers, down from 86 to 50. It meant the borough went from one social worker for every 13 children in need to one for every 34. Tim Aldridge, head of children's services, said it had been happening to councils across England. ""This is for several reasons including the public sector pay freeze seeing only 1 increases since 2010, compared to the salaries on offer to agency workers in the range of PS30 an hour or more,"" he said. At Northamptonshire County Council, 50 of posts were being filled by agency workers. A spokesman said the figure had fallen since the statistics were compiled through a scheme to attract new social workers. ""We want to increase the number of permanent children's social workers but this will take time,"" he said. The official figures also showed more than a quarter of all children's social workers in England had less than two years of service. Just 9 have been in service at their local authority more than 20 years. Get the data here A social worker in the North East, the author of the Social Work Tutor blog, with 139,000 followers on Facebook, says staff are having to spend too much time on paperwork and not enough with families. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: ""It's a revolving door. Social workers reach their peak after about two or three years. People come in, they burn out and they leave. ""Every local authority is so scared of having another Baby P (Peter Connelly) or Ayeeshia Smith. The view is that unless there's paperwork to prove it, it didn't happen. And that leads to accountability being placed above the job of actually working with people. It puts social workers under huge pressure."" Writing about the Ayeeshia Jane Smith case on Facebook, in a post shared more than 55,000 times, he added: ""The media seeks to pin the blame for this harrowing tale on social workers. ""We are told that we should have known this would happen, that we should have done more to prevent this tragedy. We are told that we are to blame for this little girl's death and there are lessons to be learned. ""But these are lessons we have known for decades. We have too many cases, too little time and far fewer resources than we need."" A serious case review is being carried out by the Derbyshire safeguarding children's board into the death of 21-month-old Ayeeshia Jane Smith. She died from a fatal heart laceration, an injury usually found in crash victims, and had suffered other injuries including a bleed on the brain in the months before she was killed. Derbyshire's children's services were rated good by Ofsted in their last inspection in 2013. Maris Stratulis, England manager at the British Association of Social Workers, said: ""There is increasing pressure on local authority social workers to predict risk, which adds to the stress of the work. At the same time, more families are struggling because of austerity and there have been cuts to preventative services, all of which adds further to the pressure and workload of a social worker."" Claude Knights of the charity Kidscape said there had been ""avoidable child deaths"" because recommendations from serious case reviews were not being implemented. Calling for a government task force to address the challenges, she said: ""A great concern is that when the alarm bells are ringing loudly potentially life saving decisions are not made more swiftly."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Excellent social workers help transform lives, which is why we are committed to recruiting and retaining the very best into the profession. We need more high quality social workers who have the skills and confidence to make the decisions and judgements which are in the child's best interests. ""That's why we have invested PS100m in programmes to recruit the best and brightest graduates and professionals into the sector.""",1,244
"All four opposition parties at Holyrood want to repeal the football act. But the Scottish government says it will not do so without a ""viable alternative"" being put in place. Lord Bracadale has now been asked by the government to ensure all of the country's hate crime legislation is fit for the 21st century. His independent review will start on 30 January, and is expected to last up to 12 months - after which the judge will present his recommendations to the Scottish government. His remit is to consider whether existing laws are the the most effective way of dealing with criminal conduct motivated by hatred, malice, ill-will or prejudice. It will consider the various hate crime offences currently covered by a range of different laws, including: Announcing the review in the Scottish Parliament, Community Safety Minister Annabelle Ewing said Scotland was an ""open and inclusive nation,"" but was not immune from the threat of racism, intolerance and prejudice. She added: ""While we already have robust and comprehensive laws in place, we need to make sure that legislation is up-to-date and able to counter all forms of hate crime. ""This review will help ensure we have the right legislative protection in place to tackle hate crime wherever and whenever it happens. I look forward to Lord Bracadale presenting his findings."" Lord Bracadale has been asked examine whether the scope of existing laws should be adjusted to reflect further aspects of religiously motivated offending. He was also tasked with looking at whether new categories of hate crime should be created for characteristics such as age and gender, which are not currently covered. And he will be asked to examine whether the existing laws can be simplified, and whether any ""gaps, anomalies and inconsistencies"" can be addressed. Lord Bracadale said: ""Hate crime legislation has developed intermittently over many years and it is important to consider whether it currently provides appropriate, effective and consistent protection for Scottish communities."" The review was welcomed by opposition politicians at Holyrood, who handed the Scottish government a symbolic defeat over the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in November. Conservative MSP Douglas Ross accused the Scottish government of ""continuing to ignore the will of parliament"" by refusing to scrap the act, which opponents claim is poorly written, unnecessary and unfairly targets football fans. Labour's Claire Baker told Ms Ewing: ""We do not share her view that there is no viable alternative and I believe the review will recognise this."" Ms Ewing said the Scottish government recognised the concerns raised over the law but will not repeal it without a ""viable alternative,"" saying: ""Such a move would take away protection from some of our most vulnerable communities."" The majority SNP government passed the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in 2012 as part of attempts to crack down on sectarianism and other anti-social behaviour at football matches.",1,245
"Turner, who spent nine years as a player with Posh before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s, was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2006. His wife Lynne previously said doctors told her the illness was ""caused by heading too many balls."" Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend. He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969 and made more than 300 appearances. His playing career also included time in the US. Turner retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990. His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman. Mick Halsall, who captained Peterborough to victory in the play-off final in 1992, said Turner was a ""great, great leader."" ""He had a great ability to nurture,"" Halsall said. We were] a bunch of scallywags who achieved so much, and in my opinion wouldn't have achieved it under anyone else."" Bob Symns, Peterborough chief executive, said Turner was ""a legend who'll never be forgotten."" John Beck, who was brought to Cambridge as a player by Turner in 1986 and went on to take the club to the brink of the Premier League as manager, said Turner was a ""very lovable man."" ""I'd gone to meet the manager at Peterborough and I was going to sign, but then I got a phone call from Chris,"" he said.

The start of the second half was delayed by five minutes as Friend was replaced by Dean Treleaven, a qualified referee who was watching the match.

"The Latics are seven points from safety with six games remaining including tough trips to Brighton and Reading. David McGoldrick put Ipswich ahead midway through the first half, slotting in Myles Kenlock's pass, before Freddie Sears raced clear to double the lead. Wigan improved after the break, Bartosz Bialkowski saving brilliantly from Ryan Colclough and Alex Gilbey, but Sears pounced late on to make it 3-0. The win relieved some of the pressure on Town boss Mick McCarthy, following seven draws in their last eight matches, and they are now nine points clear of the relegation zone. A lack of goals has been one of the Tractor Boys' main issues this campaign, with only Wigan and Rotherham scoring fewer, but striker McGoldrick ended a 15-game drought to set the ball rolling. It was the Republic of Ireland international's first goal since netting the winner in the reverse fixture on 17 December. Sears has also been struggling to score this campaign, but the former West Ham forward showed superb composure to fire past Matt Gilks for his fourth goal of the season. His second had an air of fortune as Gilks saved his first effort, which then fell at his feet for an easy tap-in - but the game was already over at that point. With an average of 49 points keeping teams in the second tier since three points were introduced for a win in the early 1980s, the Latics, on 34 points, may need to win five of their last six matches to avoid an immediate return to League One. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: ""I am delighted about the result and the performance and also a little bit relieved about the fact we got three points and other results went for us. ""I thought David McGoldrick and Freddie Sears epitomised our performance, but I am also not going to just sit here crowing about everything. ""At the start of the second half, it seemed we were conspiring to give them a goal and our fabulous goalkeeper made sure it wasn't 2-1 - though I think we deserved the 3-0 win."" Wigan interim manager Graham Barrow: ""The scoreline was fair as we gave them all three goals - but for Matt Gilks in goal, it could have been much worse. ""I am not even going to pretend that was okay. It was suicidal stuff, real kamikaze football and I do personally feel let down. ""Things were said in the dressing room, but they will stay in the dressing room, but the club, supporters and staff don't deserve that kind of performance.

"Former Newmarket Town player Shaun Whiter lost both his legs when he was hit helping his friend Joey Abbs to change a tyre near the Suffolk town. Abbs suffered a serious leg injury. Cambridge United will host a Football Family Day on 9 October to raise funds. Messi's shirt and one from team-mate Arda Turan will be auctioned off. Wayne Rooney and John Terry have also donated signed shirts, as well as the first teams of Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and West Ham, and the England senior squad. Newmarket Town, Soham Town Rangers, Cambridge City and Fulbourn Institute - teams for whom the pair played - will take part in a mini-tournament at the League Two club's stadium as one of a number of activities on the day. ""I can't thank Lionel Messi and Arda Turan enough for donating their shirts and getting them to Cambridge,"" Whiter told BBC Look East. ""We're going to auction them off and see what we can get."" Jan Adamec, 40, from Haverhill, pleaded guilty to two charges of causing injury by dangerous driving and was jailed earlier this month for three years and four months. And Whiter, who has previously said he would like to compete at the 2020 Paralympics, spoke of the bond between him and Abbs following the incident. ""He's a great friend. I've asked him to be one of the ushers at my wedding next year. He made that call that night to the paramedics to save my life,"" he added. ""He saved my life and I can't repay him any more than with my friendship and support him through this time as well.""",1,250
"It said it had taken a PS235m charge after it agreed a deferred prosecution with the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority in March. However, Tesco said it exceeded its full-year operating profit target. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings, grew 1 in the year to 28 February. UK like-for-like sales were up 0.9, their first reported growth since 2009-10. However, Tesco shares closed down 5.7, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The stock has now declined more than 10 this year. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said the results showed ""another solid year of progress"" at the supermarket giant. ""The very pleasing thing is that on every dimension of customer service we've had positive feedback from customers of the service that we're giving, and that's allowed us to drive an improvement in both sales and indeed profitability,"" he told the BBC's Emma Simpson. Full year pre-tax profit, which includes one-off charges such as legal costs, fell from PS202m to PS145m. But Tesco's operating profit figure, which strips out exceptional items and reflects the performance of the business, was PS1.28bn, exceeding Tesco's PS1.2bn target. By 2020, Mr Lewis wants Tesco to make between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every PS1 spent by shoppers, up from 2.3p in 2016-17. The company is banking on rising sales, allowing it to cut PS1.5bn of costs. The supermarket also needs strong results to help it persuade shareholders to back its attempt to buy wholesaler Booker. Last month, one of its biggest shareholders said it had ""major concerns"" about the PS3.7bn bid, saying it was overpaying. Tesco said the deal would improve its recovery plans. The supermarket giant's pension deficit more than doubled from PS2.6bn to PS5.5bn after higher inflation, said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Kalaf. ""The supermarket is facing the prospect of a rise in pension contributions because its scheme valuation is rather inconveniently taking place now, when interest rates are low and inflation is rising, both of which will serve to magnify the deficit,"" he said. Kantar Retail analyst Ray Gaul said Tesco can ""successfully put the accounting scandals of the past behind them having settled legal affairs."" ""Now, Tesco will begin to fight all of its battles on the front foot,"" he said. Upcoming ""battles"" include regulatory battles over the proposed Booker deal. Suppliers raising prices to cope with increased costs will be another test, Mr Gaul said. The pound has substantially weakened since the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June, pushing up the cost of imports. The rate of grocery price inflation is expected to rise to 2.3, with higher rises on the horizon, he added. Dave Lewis told the BBC that Tesco ""want to do everything we can to stop prices rising.... but the fact is, they are, and there is some pressure in terms of pricing."" He said customers were starting to shift spending to ""fresh food"" and ""everyday essentials"" rather than ""luxuries."" Supermarkets have been contending with factors including rising costs, the devaluation of the pound and structural shifts in the industry. Mr Lewis said: ""It's no surprise that the industry has been under pressure, but it has been under pressure for the last three or four years as well. Actually I think that where we sit as Tesco now is stronger than we've been for quite some time.""",1,251

"Social media videos shot in the Plaza Major showed injured fans and officers in body armour wielding batons. BBC journalist Phil Mackie confirmed police used baton charges to clear parts of the square. Earlier, Spanish police said eight Leicester fans were arrested for ""causing a mess"" on Tuesday night. Footage posted online showed a group of officers being targeted with missiles and fans chanting ""Gibraltar is ours"" in the Plaza Major, where Leicester's fans were told they could congregate. A witness told BBC 5 live: ""There were a couple of people who probably antagonised the police, but then they took it out all these people here. ""There were people with children, they came in with batons and there was a 70-year-old man and the kids [in the way]."" Owynn Palmer-Atkin, reporting for BBC Radio Leicester, said: ""There was a couple of flares that went off - blue smoke, then a bang, and that is when you heard the tone of the chanting change. ""The noise of the crowd seem to quieten and then become more of a panic. ""There was another bang and that is when the riot vans started charging across the square. I find it incredible a police van would travel that fast in a crowded square."" BBC presenter Gary Lineker, a Leicester City fan and former Foxes player, tweeted: ""Just saw the footage of some Leicester fans behaving despicably in Madrid. The few idiots ruin it for the decent majority. Sickening.."" On Tuesday night, Phil Mackie said he witnessed what appeared to be an unprovoked attack on supporters. He reported seeing police charging a group of Leicester fans walking in the city centre before three were pushed to the ground, hit with batons and bundled into the back of vans. Police said six officers were also attacked in the overnight disturbances. The eight fans arrested remain in custody and will appear in court on Thursday.",1,253
"In front of a home crowd in Birmingham, 27-year-old Yafai won 118-108, 119-107 and 119-107 on the judges' scorecards. Yafai knocked down the 31-year-old Japanese in the second round, but was caught several times himself on the way to recording his 22nd unbeaten fight. ""I had to box my way through. My hands were in a bad way after two rounds but I did what I had to to win,"" he said. ""I'm a work in progress, I have to learn how to slow the pace down a bit."" Yafai landed a barrage of punches in the first round, and a slick combination rocked Muranaka in the second, causing him to touch down on to the canvas with a knee. But Muranaka recovered, walking through Yafai's punches and landing with left and right hooks of his own. The home fighter took back control in the later rounds and, despite being docked a point for a low blow, Yafai ran out a comfortable winner. Promoter Eddie Hearn is looking ahead to big things for his fighter after ""a great performance."" ""One more defence and he has to chase the big unification fights,"" Hearn said. Yafai's victory made it a double success for his family, with younger brother Gamal victorious on the undercard. The younger Yafai was impressive in a seventh-round stoppage of the previously undefeated Sean Davis - a fellow Birmingham super-bantamweight. The 25-year-old worked the head and body superbly, dropping his opponent six times on his way to claiming the WBC International super-bantamweight title.

"The 26-year-old scored 20 goals in 52 games for Bristol City, after signing from French club Angers in July 2015. The Ivory Coast international had also been the subject of interest from Derby County and Premier League side Hull. Villa had reached an agreement to sign Hull forward Abel Hernandez, but the move fell through over personal terms. Bristol City owner Steve Lansdown had previously said they would not sell Kodjia to any fellow Championship club, and that any deal would have to exceed PS10m. The deal represents the largest transfer fee City have ever received for a player, surpassing the PS3.5m the club sold Ade Akinbiyi to Wolves for in September 1999. Villa boss Roberto Di Matteo said he had signed a ""proven goalscorer"" in Kodjia, while City chief operating officer Mark Ashton said the club had retained a sell-on clause and decided to disclose the fee ""due to the high-profile nature and speculation surrounding the deal."" Ashton added: ""We've continually told Jonathan that we don't want him to go, but recently he's made it clear that he's aware of the interest of other clubs and that he wanted to leave."" Kodjia is a proven goal scorer at Championship level, a physical and competitive style of player with greater mobility than a Rudy Gestede or Libor Kozak. Whether he is quite the ""world-class striker"" that Villa chairman Dr Tony Xia promised via his prolific Twitter account is dubious, but he could well thrive on the sort of service Ross McCormack and Jack Grealish are capable of providing. The Villa squad was always going to need revolution rather than evolution after last season's psychologically damaging relegation - Kodjia is the latest component of a summer of change.",1,257
"The group, a mix of students and activists, were arrested while taking part in a protest two weeks ago against a new education bill. They face possible jail terms on charges including insulting civil servants and refusing to disperse. Video of the protests showing people being cornered by police and beaten sparked international condemnation. President Thein Sein of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has defended the action of officers, telling the BBC that in many Western countries a similar situation might have ended in gunfire and death. In addition to the 65 people in court in the town of Letpadan on Wednesday, another five have been charged in absentia. Eleven people who were released on bail will be charged at a later date. All could face jail terms of up to six years. The BBC's Jonah Fisher, at the court, says relatives and supporters gathered outside the building with flowers, water and food for the detainees. Riot police were deployed to keep back the crowds. Our correspondent says that while there have been reforms in Myanmar since the end of military rule, the case shows that its laws and legal system remain dated and repressive. The students began a protest march from Mandalay to Yangon (also known as Rangoon) in January, in opposition to a bill which centralises control over higher education. They were calling for more power to be devolved to universities and higher education institutions, the right to form student unions, and teaching in ethnic minority languages. The march was technically illegal as it did not have official approval. The two sides had been in negotiations, and the authorities had agreed to let the students continue to Yangon. But the students were angered by police opposition when they reached Letpadan, 140km (90 miles) north of Yangon, and clashes broke out as they attempted to break through police lines. Scores of students and some police officers were injured, while more than 100 people were arrested.

"The county has received PS1bn of aid over the past 15 years with more than PS400m in the pipeline until 2020 because of its relatively weak economy. Cornwall Council leader John Pollard said he wanted ""investment equal to that provided by the EU programme."" Cornwall voted Leave and the Isles of Scilly voted Remain. The breakdown of voting saw: Live reaction to the EU referendum result from the South West See all local results here Follow the latest news on the BBC's live EU referendum page PS400m of EU funding between 2000 and 2006 PS500m of EU funding between 2007 and 2013 PS416m of further funding coming between 2014 and 2020 Tim Jones, from the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership said: ""The French are major investors in our part of the world, EDF Energy, china clay, Brittany Ferries. ""The European partnership is crucial to the South West. I can't make any judgement here that's going to be beneficial, short or long-term, in a business context. ""The community may have spoken but the business community is still the wealth creating vehicle and we have got to find a way through this."" Cornwall businesswoman Melanie Evans said she was ""absolutely delighted"" at the result. ""The EU money has been spent unwisely in places on projects that have gone bankrupt and we now have the opportunity to take control of that funding,"" she said. ""We are in a deprived status and we have remained in deprived status even though that funding was coming in so it shows it hasn't worked."" The people of Cornwall have voted to leave the EU - proof perhaps that money can't buy love. While Britain as a whole has paid to be part of the EU, Cornwall is in the unusual position of being a net beneficiary. Despite the huge investment in projects like the Combined Universities in Penryn, the Eden Project and Cornwall Airport Newquay, along with Superfast broadband - many people simply do not think they have felt any benefit. And some say the fact that Cornwall still qualifies for this extra funding is an indication it hasn't sparked the growth intended. Remain campaigners have warned Cornwall has always fared badly from Westminster and are not confident of future support of the scale seen from the EU. But with five out of six Cornish MP's backing Leave during this campaign perhaps this vote here isn't surprising. Eric Nicholls, Chairman of Cornwall Manufacturers' Group, said: ""Whether Cornwall will continue to receive its EU funding is far from certain, as are the pledges from the Remain side that this would be met from central government."" Sarah Newton, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, who voted Remain, said she wanted to ""make sure the money gets into Cornwall so we can carry on making progress in getting well-paid jobs."" Cllr Tim Dwelly, leader of the Labour Group at Cornwall Council, said: ""This is a disaster for Cornwall. Years of special EU funding for Cornwall are going to end. ""That funding has given us fibre broadband, a university, superb sixth form colleges, dual carriageways, airport investment, rail improvement, support for farmers and all kinds of business.""

William Arnold tweeted: ""It's Ok though we can carry on being serfs in a theme park for second home owners and their children.""

"Intense negotiations are under way between political parties amid public anger at a one-off levy of up to 10 being imposed on savers. President Nicos Anastasiades said refusing the bailout would have led to the collapse of the country's banks. The speaker of the European Parliament has called for the levy to be revised to protect small-scale bank customers. The 10bn-euro (13bn; PS8.6bn) deal agreed by the EU and IMF in Brussels marks a radical departure from previous international aid packages. Under its terms, people in Cyprus with less than 100,000 euros in their accounts would have to pay a one-time tax of 6.75. Those with sums over that threshold would pay 9.9 in tax. Depositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks. It is believed that eurozone leaders, particularly in Germany, insisted on the levy because of the large amount of Russian capital kept in Cypriot banks, amid fears of money-laundering. QA: Cyprus bailout UK to help troops President Anastasiades, who was elected only last month, is due to address the country shortly (from 18:00 GMT). He said in a statement earlier that Cyprus had had to choose between the ""catastrophic scenario of disorderly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled management of the crisis."" The president has been meeting with members of the parliament's finance committee, his office said. On Saturday the head of the committee, Nicholas Papadopoulos, expressed shock at the deal, saying it was ""much worse than expected."" The president's Democratic Rally party - which has 20 seats in the 56-member assembly - needs support from other factions to ratify the bailout. A spokesman for one of its coalition partners, the Democratic Party, told BBC News they wanted assurances that the deal would resolve the problems facing Cyprus before voting in favour. Opposition leader George Lillikas, an independent, said the president had ""betrayed the people's vote."" The speaker of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, argued in a newspaper interview that there should be an exemption from the levy for savers, for example, who had less than 25,000 euros in their accounts. By Gavin HewittEurope editor ""The solution must be socially acceptable,"" Mr Schulz, who belongs to Germany's opposition Social Democrats, told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, defended the levy. ""With this deal, the responsible people are partly included in those countries and not only the taxpayers in other countries,"" she said at a party meeting in her home constituency. ""And I think it's right that we went down that road and I think it's a good step which will certainly make it easier for us to approve the help for Cyprus."" As with past eurozone bailouts, the deal must be approved by the lower house of parliament in Germany, the EU's biggest economy. If the levy goes ahead, it will affect many non-Cypriots with bank accounts, including UK expatriates. However, depositors in the overseas arms of Cypriot banks will not be hit. Bank of Cyprus UK and Laiki Bank UK both confirmed on their websites that there would be no impact. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would compensate any government employees and military personnel whose bank accounts were affected. The levy itself will not take effect until Tuesday, following a public holiday, but action is being taken to control electronic money transfers over the weekend.",1,262
"Media playback is not supported on this device Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee. Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot. Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on. After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign. It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start. Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners. Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table. And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar. Dundee however restored their two-goal advantage as once again the visitors defence was breached. Hemmings had a shot on goal that was glanced into the top corner by Loy giving Gary Woods no chance in the County goal. The first-half action though was far from over. Schalk latched onto a long through-ball and although Dens keeper Mitchell got his hand to the shot there was enough The second half failed to live up to the opening period but there were still plenty of chances created at both ends. Gardyne blasted high over the crossbar from 12 yards out while Ian McShane saved on the line from Dundee top scorer Hemmings as the home side looked for goal number four. County survived a scare when Hemmings managed to get a touch on the end of a Stewart free-kick but the ball trickled only a few inches the wrong side of the post. The home side secured all three points with four minutes left when Wighton hammered the ball home after Stewart's shot was blocked. Stewart completed the scoring when he once again fired home with a cultured left-foot shot that beat Woods. Hartley's side are now in pole position to secure a place in the top six for the season run-in.",1,263

Joyrider Nawnee Mackin, 35, was jailed for nine years in November for causing death by dangerous driving. Car owner Craig Chevelleau, 33, was jailed for 23 months after being convicted of perverting the course of justice at Manchester Crown Court. Chevelleau, who was sentenced on Wednesday, was described as Mackin's ""criminal associate"" by police. He claimed the vehicle was stolen by a stranger while he was using a phone box. Chevelleau said he saw his car being driven off by an unknown person but thought it was a prank by a friend, so did not report it to police until three hours later. The vehicle was later found abandoned by police. Sgt Lee Westhead said his ""web of lies"" had helped Samuel's killer escape justice for 12 years. Ambulance staff attempted to revive Samuel at the scene before he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He would have celebrated his 18th birthday in March.",1,265
"Britain's three remaining sides in the competition have reached this stage for the second successive season, with champions Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona also still in. The draw takes place at 11:00 GMT in Nyon, Switzerland. Liverpool, who failed to qualify, join Celtic, Everton and Tottenham in the following Europa League last-32 draw. Chelsea will be in pot one after winning their group, while Manchester City and Arsenal join the group runners-up in pot two. No teams that progressed from the same group or are from the same country can be drawn against each other, so among the sides Jose Mourinho's side could meet are Serie A champions Juventus and French champions Paris St-Germain. Manchester City, who won 2-0 at Roma on Wednesday to qualify, and Arsenal's list of potential opponents include La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, and Barcelona. The Gunners could also be drawn against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich, who topped Manchester City's group. Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic could face difficult ties in the last 32 of the Europa League after not being seeded for the draw. Tottenham and Celtic were second in their Europa League groups while Liverpool dropped down from the Champions League after finishing third in their group. That leaves Everton as the only seeded British team in the draw for the last 32, joining the likes of Inter Milan, Napoli and Zenit St Petersburg. The Toffees could potentially be drawn against Celtic in an England v Scotland tie. The draws will be covered live by the BBC Sport website. Europa League last 32 Seeded teams: Borussia Monchengladbach (GER), Club Brugge (BEL), Besiktas (TUR), Salzburg (AUT), Dinamo Moscow (RUS), Inter Milan (ITA), Feyenoord (NED), Everton (ENG), Napoli (ITA), Dynamo Kiev (UKR), Fiorentina (ITA), Legia Warsaw (POL), Olympiakos (GRE), Sporting Lisbon (POR), Athletic Bilbao (ESP), Zenit St Petersburg (RUS).

"There were 69 claims against peacekeepers in 2015, up from 52 in 2014 was 66 in 2013. Almost a third of the 2015 claims were made in the Central African Republic. For the first time, the report has also set out all the countries whose soldiers are reportedly involved under a new ""name-and-shame"" policy. Overall, 10 peacekeeping missions were subject to allegations in 2015. The allegations involve military personnel, international police, other staff and volunteers. According to the UN's latest figures, there are 124,746 personnel serving in 16 peacekeeping missions worldwide. It has been criticised for failing to act quickly on sexual abuse allegations made against peacekeepers. Last December an independent panel calling the UN response to allegations in the Central African Republic (CAR) ""seriously flawed"" and a ""gross institutional failure."" It accused senior UN officials of abusing their authority by failing to take action over allegations of abuse by soldiers from France, Equatorial Guinea and Chad. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's report called for an international convention on ""crimes committed in peacekeeping operations."" He also urged countries to change their laws so that they apply to sex crimes committed by citizens serving in UN peace operations. Mr Ban also called for ""on-site court martial proceedings"" for some crimes and a DNA database of all peacekeepers. UN peacekeepers operate under the legal jurisdiction of their home countries, making prosecution more difficult. In February, the UN said it would send home more than 100 peacekeepers from CAR following sexual abuse allegations. A 10,000-strong UN force took over a peacekeeping mission in the country in September 2014. After CAR, the second highest number of allegations was at the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo, with 16 cases, followed by Haiti with nine.",1,270

Mourinho was sacked on Thursday with champions Chelsea 16th in the Premier League table, one point above the relegation zone.

Coaches Steve Holland and Eddie Newton were in charge of the team for the game against the Black Cats. ""It's a fantastic appointment. I'm very happy about it. This club needs an experienced manager at the helm and Guus Hiddink is clearly that,"" said Holland. Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo said a ""palpable discord between manager and players"" had contributed to Mourinho's dismissal, the second time he has been sacked by the club. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola, who is set to reveal on Saturday if he will stay at the German club beyond the end of the season, is among the possible permanent replacements. Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone and out-of-work Carlo Ancelotti, who managed Chelsea for two seasons from June 2009, have also been suggested as potential candidates for the full-time role.

"The hosts needed only 66 minutes and 82 deliveries to take the remaining seven England wickets in Centurion. Kagiso Rabada, 20, became the youngest South Africa bowler to take 10 wickets in a match, and finished with 6-32 to add to his first-innings 7-112. Morne Morkel claimed 3-36, with James Taylor's 24 the highest score for England, who won the series 2-1. England, beaten 2-0 by Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates earlier this winter, next play Test cricket against Sri Lanka at Headingley on 19 May. Having reduced England to 52-3 on Monday, South Africa hurried through the rest of the order thanks to some splendid bowling on a wearing surface. In all, England lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs in 10.5 overs as any hopes of batting out the day vanished amid a flurry of reckless strokes. Here's how the collapse unfolded: Fittingly, the lithe paceman, in only his sixth Test match, took the final three wickets as England were skittled out before a drinks break was required. That gave Rabada match figures of 13-144, the best by a South Africa bowler on home soil and the second-best in their history. The man of the match, who was also the leading wicket-taker in the series, said: ""It was a bit up and down so the key was the hit the deck and bowl the ball in a good area and I believed you'd get your rewards."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special: ""England have batted on a pitch with a bit of spice and they have shown no heart. ""It's almost like the white towel has been thrown in. It was a really feeble way to finish the tour."" Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott: ""Get your head down and save the match.

That's not good enough."" Media playback is not supported on this device England captain Alastair Cook: ""We always try and play positively but on certain wickets you have to play a different way.

"Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would ""address the consequences"" of that. But he said the emergency brake would only apply in ""exceptional cases."" Eurosceptics say it is ineffectual and could make the situation worse. Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a ""handbrake turn"" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive ""graduated"" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally. Defending the proposals and the rest of the draft deal in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the entire package - which must be approved by the EU as a whole, was ""fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states."" On welfare, he said: ""We propose to create a safeguard mechanism tailor-made to the concerns of the UK, that would allow it to restrict the excess of EU workers newly entering its Labour market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years. ""The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time - that is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary to make it compatible with the (EU) treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should."" Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK. Mr Juncker said ""as a result"" of that decision ""over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens."" He added. ""In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision."" But UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015. ""We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn."" Mr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between ""vested self-interests and people power."" Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China. ""I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest,"" he claimed. ""We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States. ""It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe.""",1,277
"Wasps goalkeeper Neil Parry had already denied Dobbie three times before the striker curled in a drive off a post. Parry saved again from Dobbie after the break, but the 33-year-old would not be denied his fifth goal in three Challenge Cup outings and 12th goal of the season for the Championship side. His close-range header killed off the lively League One visitors' hopes. And it ended a run of eight games without a victory for the Dumfries side - a sequence that had ended with Gavin Skelton standing down as manager earlier this week. The side under caretaker Jim Thomson, who had been football development manager, for the first time became the second into the last four. Dundee United had earlier beaten Dunfermline Athletic 1-0 at East End Park. League One leaders Livingston host Welsh champions The New Saints, while Ayr United visit Championship rivals St Mirren, in two Sunday quarter-finals. A Grant Anderson header had grazed the Alloa crossbar before Dobbie made the breakthrough at Palmerston Park. The Wasps had their moments, with Jamie Longworth being denied by goalkeeper Lee Robinson and Greig Spence going close with an overhead kick with Jim Goodwin's part-time side only one goal behind and looking the more likely to score. However, after Parry prevented Derek Lyle extending the lead, Dobbie provided the finish from Dean Brotherston's cross 14 minutes from time. Queen of the South caretaker manager Jim Thomson: ""It was a shock to myself. On the Monday, Gavin just decides to resign. I think it was a combination of things. ""It has been a terrible run and hopefully that brings a bit of confidence to the squad. ""It has been a hard week for everybody, but the way the boys trained during the week, the tempo they took into the game. ""I thought in the first half we were excellent. Some of their play was brilliant. ""It is a break from the league for the boys and it's a national cup semi-final so you always want to progress."" Alloa Athletic manager Jim Goodwin: ""We came here to be positive and to take the game to Queen of the South. I thought we done that for large spells of the game. ""They're very lucky to have Stephen Dobie, who's a top player. ""He's the type of player who could easily be playing in the Premiership. ""I'm proud of the players.

"Correspondents said the atmosphere at schools was subdued and many pupils had not returned. They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with only four days' notice and many were not prepared. More than 8,400 people have died in West Africa in the world's worst outbreak of the Ebola virus. The reopening of schools in Guinea comes four days after the UN said the number of confirmed Ebola cases in the country had fallen to its lowest weekly total since August. At one school in the Guinean capital, Conakry, only about 220 of the approximately 2,000 pupils were reported to have returned. Of the 36 teachers, more than half were back at work. Many schools have introduced health precautions, including hand-washing and temperature checks. Ebola has had a severe impact not only on public health but also on the Guinean economy. Unemployment and underemployment have risen, leaving many parents with difficulties meeting school-related expenses at the beginning of a new academic year. Schools remain closed in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the two other countries hit hard by the Ebola outbreak.

"The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday's report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. It said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - ""limited and inconsistent."" While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont's Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified ""a significant gap"" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has ""implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe."" ""Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. ""The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people."" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. ""This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,"" Mr Clarke added. Last year, a separate review into the issue concluded that sexual exploitation was a growing threat to young people in Northern Ireland. That report also said that some abusers were thought to have links to paramilitary groups.",1,283

"Confessions had been forced from the Muslim men after they were beaten up in custody, a rights activist said. They were among a group of people arrested late last year. Homosexual acts are illegal in the West African state under both Islamic and secular law - the latter was tightened earlier this year. Same-sex marriages, gay groups and shows of same-sex public affection are now banned throughout Nigeria. Another Muslim man also received 20 lashes in January after the Islamic court in Bauchi convicted him of homosexual offences. Most states in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria have adopted Islamic law, known as Sharia, since the end of military rule in 1999. The BBC's Ishaq Khalid in Bauchi says details about the latest case are sketchy, but court officials have confirmed the whippings. It seems the court wanted to avoid publicity after an angry crowd disrupted proceedings last month, demanding the death sentence for the four, our reporter says. The judge did not impose the death penalty because the homosexual offences had taken place a long time ago, and the men had repented, he says. Where is it illegal to be gay? The men, aged between 20 and 22, were also ordered to pay a fine of 120 (PS70) each, Dorothy Aken'Ova, a rights activist with the Nigeria-based International Centre for Reproductive Health and Sexual Rights, told the Associated Press news agency. Rights groups were trying to raise the money - otherwise, they will remain in prison, she said. The men should not have been convicted because they were beaten up and their confessions forced, she said. Their families, mainly subsistence farmers, turned down an offer of legal representation because they preferred to negotiate with the judge and get the case behind them, Ms Aken'Ova said. Nigeria is a deeply conservative country, where most people - Christian and Muslim - are opposed to homosexuality.",1,285

"It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout. Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the home side when he failed to score from the penalty spot. St Mirren now lead Group G by three points. It might have been picture postcard weather for the first half in Paisley, but there wasn't much to write home about. St Mirren were too predictable with long balls floated forward for John Sutton and David Clarkson up front, although Mallan's dead ball delivery was, as always, a threat. Ayr started well enough and Paul Cairney had a real early chance, but after that Saints looked comfortable at the back. St Mirren's best chance of the half fell for Calum Gallacher who got on to the end of a lovely ball from Clarkson. It was screaming for the first-time volley, but he chose the wrong option in taking a touch and the opportunity melted in the evening sun. Things, we hoped, could only get better in the second half. They did. A bit. Lewis Morgan was highly impressive down the left side for the home team, embracing the concept of dazzling wing play and hitting the by-line before delivering the cross. But no-one could cash in. He won his team a penalty with another dazzling run. The usually deadly Mallan took the spot kick, but United goalkeeper Greg Fleming produced a wonderful save to his right hand side to urge the game toward further penalties after 90 minutes. But then central defender Baird chipped in with his last-minute effort, bundling the ball over the line after a scramble in the box. Enough to set Saints proudly at the top of their section. St Mirren manager Alex Rae: ""We struggled to get any intensity in the first half. I'm conscious of the fact it was really warm out there tonight. ""A lot of the boys are just not up to speed. This competition has come really early. ""Lewis Morgan tonight was sensational, driving at people. The boy is making a really big impact. ""I spoke to Stewart (Gilmour, the chairman) before the game, there may be funds for a loan deal, but we'll try and squeeze a few quid out of him."" Ayr United manager Ian McCall: ""I thought it was a really poor game of football. We're a mile short in terms of bodies and fitness but a draw would have been fair. To lose one so late is hard to take. ""But, we've got two games left and if we win them two you never know. ""We need strikers. We need a wide player. We need a centre back.

"The price of West Texas crude sank to 37.65 (PS24.99) a barrel, a drop of 5.8, while Brent Crude fell 5.3 to 40.73 a barrel. The slumping price comes as OPEC - a group of the largest oil producing nations- refused to cut oil production. OPEC- whose production covers about 30 of the world's oil demand - met in Vienna last week to discuss production. The group has faced growing competition from new supplies, including in the US where techniques like fracking are used to tap previously hard-to-reach oil reserves. ""The decision by OPEC members to keep oil production output at record high levels has seen oil prices plummet again,"" said Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer of Sun Global Investments. The group had traditionally kept a tight rein on oil production to regulate price, but announced last Friday it will continue to pump out approximately 31.5 million barrels of oil a day, going past the group's former 30 million barrel target. In 2014 Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a decision to keep output high to defend its market share.",1,288

The flood risk management report says: ""The narrowness of the dunes at Barkby Beach is a cause for serious concern.

"They said this will amount to double the number of apprentices created each year - currently about 28,000. All parties are promising to create more apprentices or equivalent schemes to get unemployment down. Labour highlighted its pledge to create 100,000 additional apprentices. The Lib Dems said they would fund their promise by moving cash from Jobs Growth Wales, the Labour Welsh Government's existing job-creation scheme. Eluned Parrott, the Liberal Democrats' candidate for Cardiff Central, said: ""Providing high-quality skills training is vital to boosting our economy and helping people to build careers and get on in life. ""Labour's own evaluation report said that Jobs Growth Wales locked people into low wages and that 73 would've found work without it. ""We all know this scheme is a failure, but Labour refuses to face the facts. ""The Welsh Liberal Democrats would instead invest in apprenticeships and training, which will actually give young people professional skills and help them get on in life."" On Labour's policy, Deputy Skills Minister Julie James said Wales already had ""one of the best records in Europe"" on apprenticeships. ""This pledge is the next step to ensuring that we have the skills base that projects like Wylfa Newydd and the South Wales Metro, will demand,"" she said. ""That is why so many voices within industry are so enthusiastic about this pledge."" Plaid Cymru has promised to created 50,000 new apprentices, while the Welsh Conservatives say they will lift the current 16-24 age restrictions on the Jobs Growth Wales scheme. It helps firms employ 16-24-year-olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. UKIP say they back industry-supported apprenticeships, along with more vocational options in post-14 education.",1,291
"Obituary: Francisco Blake Mora The helicopter was flying to Cuernavaca in neighbouring Morelos state for a prosecutors' meeting when it went down. All eight people on board were killed. President Felipe Calderon said weather conditions were probably to blame. Mr Blake Mora, 45, was appointed to the post last year and was a key figure in the war against drug cartels. The helicopter had initially been reported missing. Some Mexican media reports said there was heavy cloud at the time. ""Unfortunately the interior secretary, his [assistants] and the helicopter crew were found dead,"" government spokeswoman Alejandra Sota said. Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro and the interior ministry's chief press officer Jose Alfredo Garcia Medina were also killed in the crash along with other government officials and the air force crew, Ms Sota said. She said a search for the helicopter began when it was discovered it had strayed from its planned course. Mexican television showed wreckage from the helicopter strewn across a hillside. Ms Sota said the craft went down in the Xochimilco area, just south of Mexico City. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Mexico Francisco Blake Mora was one of the president's right-hand men. Not only because he was in charge of domestic affairs, but also because he became one of the most strident voices of Mr Calderon's strategy against the drug cartels. In recent months, he helped co-ordinate the army, navy and federal police in the fight against drug trafficking in violence-torn cities like Veracruz or Acapulco. But his death could be a severe blow to Mr Calderon at a personal level too. Three years ago, one of the president's best friends, then Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City. That accident was one of the saddest moments for Mr Calderon since he took power in 2006, he said. Mr Camilo Mourino was remembered by members of the cabinet, including Mr Blake Mora, this week. His last message on his Twitter account (FBlakeM) was actually dedicated to Mr Mourino. ""The cloudy conditions at the time certainly make you think about the probability of an accident,"" President Calderon said in a televised address. He said a thorough investigation of the accident was being launched and cancelled a trip to Hawaii for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum. US President Barack Obama called Mr Calderon to offer his condolences, a US government spokesman said. Mr Obama ""reinforced his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico in this difficult time,"" said US National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes. The interior secretary is Mexico's senior cabinet position and the top official after the president, with responsibility for domestic affairs and security. Mr Blake was Mr Calderon's fourth interior secretary. One of his predecessors, Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City three years ago. Mr Blake began his political career in the north-western border city of Tijuana in the mid-1990s, later serving as interior secretary for Baja California state. He also served as a federal congressman from Mr Calderon's National Action Party. He earned a reputation as being a hardliner in Mexico's struggle with drug cartels. Mr Blake Mora frequently travelled to cities badly affected by the cartels, such as Veracruz and Ciudad Juarez, to help co-ordinate the government's response. More than 40,000 people are reported to have died from drug-related violence since President Calderon sent in the army to help combat the cartels in 2006.",1,292

We're determined to change this,"" said Barnett. ""With a strong captain and players technically sound and tactically clued up, we will be in a great position for next season.""

"The latest threats bring the number of incidents to 69 in 27 states in the past month, according to the JCC Association of North America. No bombs were found at any of the centres targeted with telephone calls. Last week, 27 Jewish community centres in 17 US states reported receiving hoax bomb threats. All of the threats made on Monday, along with previous incidents in January, turned out to be false and Jewish centres have since reopened with normal services resumed. Responding to the latest incidents, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that US President Donald Trump had made it ""abundantly clear"" that such actions were ""unacceptable."" ""Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom,"" the statement, which was shared on Twitter by NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander, said. Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka - who has converted to Judaism and whose husband is Jewish - also condemned the threats. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that action must be taken to prevent further incidents. In a post on Twitter, Mrs Clinton wrote: ""JCC threats, cemetery desecration and online attacks are so troubling and they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting wPOTUS."" The threats were made to the Jewish community centres through calls that were both pre-recorded and live, with suspects using voice-disguising technology, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

"It says increases will be needed if current trends in teacher recruitment and retention continue. Nevertheless, the STRB has recommended a pay rise of just 1 for teachers in England and Wales from this September. The rise applies to all leadership and teacher pay ranges and to allowances. Teachers' unions expressed disappointment at the 1 rise, saying it would do nothing to ease recruitment and retention issues. The STRB report said: ""For September 2016 we [...] recommend a 1 uplift to the minima and maxima of all classroom teacher pay ranges and leadership pay ranges in the national pay framework, and to classroom teacher allowances."" But it went on to warn of a need for higher teacher salaries in the future. ""However, if current recruitment and retention trends continue, we expect an uplift to the pay framework significantly higher than 1 will be required in the course of this Parliament, to ensure an adequate supply of good teachers for schools in England and Wales,"" it said. ""Accordingly, we recommend the department and our consultees take steps to help schools prepare for such an eventuality. ""Given the budgetary context, this will require school leaders and governing bodies to be confident in both managing their workforce and in setting pay policies which enable differentiated performance-based awards to individuals, such that teachers and leaders can be appropriately rewarded within the available budget."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""The STRB is clear this is subject to the recruitment and retention evidence that the government is able to produce in relation to a future remit. ""At a national level we are retaining and recruiting the teachers we need with 15,000 more teachers in our classrooms than in 2010, and the number joining the profession outnumbering those who retire or leave. ""We recognised the recruitment challenges provided by a growing economy and regional demands and are investing over PS1.3bn up to 2020 to attract new teachers into the profession."" But teachers' unions expressed dismay at the recommended 1 increase and accused the government of limiting teachers' pay. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, accused a ""hostile government"" of ""unnecessary and unjust pay restraint."" ""Had the review body not been constrained by the arbitrary pay cap imposed by the government, there is no doubt that it would have been recommending a pay uplift higher than 1 for teachers,"" said Ms Keates. Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The publication of this report and the Secretary of State's response are extremely late, having been delayed by government'purdah' periods for the London mayoral election and the EU referendum. ""This has left schools and teachers uncertain for far too long about the critical issue of pay awards. ""Even more disappointing, however, is that these pay awards are once again limited to an uplift of 1 when we are in the midst of a teacher recruitment crisis. ""Furthermore, schools are expected to fund these awards without any additional funding from the government at a time when budgets are under severe strain because of real-terms reductions."" Kevin Courtney, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers said: ""The STRB, unlike the government, has recognised the mounting crisis in recruitment and retention. ""The NUT is hugely disappointed that the STRB decided to accept the 1 pay limit this year but strongly supports the STRB's view that the government must urgently find more money for schools to allow them to employ more and better-paid teachers."" Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: ""ATL welcomes the STRB's report which couldn't be clearer: there are increasing challenges in teacher recruitment and retention, and the Chancellor's imposed public sector pay limit of 1 is contributing to this. ""The next Prime Minister, their Chancellor and Secretary of State for Education must take heed of the review body's call for a future uplift'significantly higher' than 1 to address teacher recruitment and retention, improve teachers' working lives, and save the next generation's education.""

""By allowing us to set up our headquarter in Accra, President [John ] Mahama demonstrated extraordinary leadership and solidarity,"" Mr Graaff said in a statement.

"However, the report concluded there had been ""no overarching state conspiracy."" Sir Desmond de Silva's review confirmed that agents of the state were involved in the 1989 killing and that it should have been prevented. Mr Finucane's widow, Geraldine, has dismissed the report as a ""sham"" and a ""whitewash."" Mr Finucane was shot dead by loyalists in front of his wife and children at his north Belfast home. The review, published on Wednesday, found RUC officers proposed Mr Finucane, 39, be killed, said they passed information to his killers and failed to stop the attack and then obstructed the murder investigation. It also found that an Army intelligence unit, the FRU, ""bears a degree"" of responsibility because one of their agents, Brian Nelson, was involved in selecting targets. The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Matt Baggott, said the police fully accepted the findings of the report. He offered a ""complete, absolute and unconditional"" apology to the Finucane family, saying they had been ""abjectly failed."" He said that in the coming days the PSNI would discuss the report with the Police Ombudsman and the Public Prosecution Service. Pat Finucane review reaction ""Pat Finucane's murder should never have happened and it is a catalogue of failing which now needs to be assessed to see whether there are people who can be held accountable,"" he said. Mrs Finucane said the government had ""engineered a suppression of the truth"" behind her husband's murder. His family have led a high-profile campaign for a full public inquiry into the murder but Mr Cameron has ruled that out. Mrs Finucane said: ""At every turn, it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state, its cabinet and ministers, to the Army, the intelligence services, to itself. ""At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed, and defunct agencies found wanting. Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused. ""The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others."" The Finucanes did not co-operate with the review and the solicitor's widow said the de Silva report did not tell her much more than she previously knew about the case. Her son, Michael, claimed the government had refused their demand for a full inquiry because it did not want people to be questioned in public. There were extensive ""leaks"" of security force information to the UDA and other loyalist paramilitary groups. There was a failure by the authorities to act on threat intelligence. Employees of the State and State agents played ""key roles"" in the murder. There was a failure to investigate and arrest key members of the West Belfast UDA over a long period of time. There was a wider ""relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice"" after the murder had taken place. Sir Desmond found that ""senior Army officers deliberately lied to criminal investigators"" and that RUC Special Branch ""were responsible for seriously obstructing the investigation."" The report concluded that Nelson did not provide his handlers with details of the plot against Mr Finucane. It found that MI5 received intelligence two months before the killing that Mr Finucane was under threat but that no steps were taken to protect him. It also found that MI5 helped spread propaganda against Mr Finucane in the years before he was killed. Sir Desmond found that ""in 1985 the security service assessed that 85 of the UDA's'intelligence' originated from sources within the security forces."" And he was ""satisfied that this proportion would have remained largely unchanged"" by the time of Mr Finucane's murder."" Sir Desmond de Silva QC carried out the review at the government's request. The Finucanes want a public inquiry as they feared the full truth would not emerge. In his report Sir Desmond said: ""A series of positive actions by employees of the state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice. ""My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucane's case has left me in no doubt that agents of the state were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder. ""However, despite the different strands of involvement by elements of the state, I am satisfied that they were not linked to an over-arching state conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane."" Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was strongly critical of the RUC and Army for their conduct in relation to the killing. He said Sir Desmond concluded that there was ""no political conspiracy"" over the murder but that ""ministers were misled."" Mr Cameron added that the report found ""no evidence whatsoever that any government minister had fore-knowledge of Mr Finucane's murder."" He said that on behalf of the government and the whole country he wanted to say to the Finucane family that he was ""deeply sorry."" Last year, Mr Cameron acknowledged there was state collusion in Mr Finucane's murder and apologised to his family. In the report, Sir Desmond found that an account one of the murderers, Ken Barrett, gave to the BBC Panorama programme about receiving intelligence from the RUC was ""essentially accurate."" However, he added that some specific allegations made by Barrett against individual officers were not reliable. Former Ulster Unionist MP Lord Maginnis of Drumglass said the apology was ""ridiculous."" ""The reality is that the Finucane family were an IRA family and I can illustrate that by saying that, when I gave that allegation publicly and was being sued for libel, the family retracted and paid my legal expenses,"" he told the House of Lords. ""So let's not fool ourselves about the godfather Finucane, who was killed.""",1,307
"Mr Trump broke a long-held tradition by not releasing his paperwork during his presidential campaign. His critics want to know who he has been dealing with and if there are any conflicts of interest. At least 21 people were arrested in Berkeley, California, in clashes between Trump opponents and supporters. There is no law requiring presidents to release their tax returns, but Mr Trump has found himself under public pressure and some information from a 2005 tax return was leaked to the media last month. The protests were timed to coincide with the traditional mid-April deadline for Americans to file their tax returns. ""I think it is critical we know about his investments, his donations and any entanglements he has,"" said one protester, Chuck Wash, at a march in Washington DC. The idea for the themed march came from law professor Jennifer Taub, who was angered when presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said President Trump would not be releasing his tax returns because ""people don't care."" In January, Ms Taub tweeted of the need for a nationwide protest to show the president that many people do care. The idea quickly caught on. ""I wanted to express myself and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be standing here today, seeing this idea that I tweeted out in January come to life,"" she told the BBC at the Washington DC march. Ms Taub said the march had broader aims than just wanting to see the president's paperwork. ""This is also about having a tax system that is fair,"" she said. ""Both in terms of making sure everyone pays their fair share and also in taking public resources - our taxes - and spending them on things that make everyone flourish."" She said less should be spent on wars, and more should go to public service television and the Meals on Wheels programme, which Mr Trump has made funding cuts to in the first months of his presidency. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, was also at the march in Washington DC. She said the Trump administration has a ""huge"" transparency problem. ""He [Trump] talked about draining the swamp and making everything transparent. He lied again,"" said Ms Waters. She also criticised Friday's announcement that President Donald Trump will not release the logs of those who visit the White House. The White House cited ""grave national security risks and privacy concerns"" as the reason for its decision, reversing former President Barack Obama's voluntary disclosure policy. Participants used the hashtag showusyourtaxes to share their images on social media. President Trump's supporters have also gone online to express their support for the president. One Twitter user accused protesters of ""flogging a dead horse"" and many said they had no interest in seeing the returns. Separately, more than a dozen people were arrested in Berkeley, California, after supporters of Mr Trump clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators at a free speech rally, police said. Several people were injured when fighting broke out at a park in the city as opponents and supporters of the US president met on the streets during Saturday's protests, according to CNN. Footage shared on social media showed crowds of people throwing items at one another and demonstrators being attacked with what appeared to be chemical sprays and makeshift weapons. The incident occurred after hundreds of anti-Trump protesters staged a counter-rally alongside an event billed as a ""Patriots Day free speech rally and picnic,"" organised by the president's supporters.",1,308
"An inquiry for ""attempted terrorist murder"" has been launched into Saturday's attack in Charleroi. The man reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" God is greatest during the assault outside a police station. He died after being shot by officers. On Sunday the so-called Islamic State group called him one of its ""soldiers."" The statement was similar to those released after recent attacks in France and Germany. Following standard practice, prosecutors did not name the attacker but gave his initials as KB. He had been living in Belgium since 2012 and had minor offences to his name. Belgium has been on alert since bomb attacks on the city's airport and subway system in March killed 32 people. Charleroi was used as a base by some of the jihadists involved in that attack, and in the attack on Paris in November 2015. Prime Minister Charles Michel, who broke off his holiday after the attack, has urged people to remain ""constantly vigilant"" but ""keep a cool head."" Saturday's attack unfolded at just before 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT). A police spokesman said the attacker pulled the machete out of a sports bag as he approached a guard post outside the police HQ. According to a local news agency, one of the policewomen was treated for serious facial wounds, while the other suffered only minor injuries. The assailant was shot and killed by another officer, who was nearby.",1,309

"Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. ""Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,"" Mr Haldane said. ""This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago."" Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US. Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year. Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as ""writhing in both agony and ecstasy."" He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said. However, he said the ""reasons to be fearful"" included productivity and wages, which had not risen. ""If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,"" said Mr Haldane. Sterling dropped 0.5 against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile. Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was ""more unstable than it has been for some time."" Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were ""a lot of global risks out there at the moment"" affecting the international economy. ""Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,"" Mr Osborne said. He added: ""I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border. ""The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won."" He said it was important to ""make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters."" Earlier this month, Mr Osborne warned that the eurozone slowdown will impact UK economy.",1,311
"Critics say the new contract involves pay cuts of up to 30, with ""normal hours"" extended to include 7am to 10pm on every day except Sunday. The British Medical Association said the ballot reflected doctors' anger. But the government described the current contracts as ""outdated"" and ""unfair."" The BMA said the sticking point was over NHS employers' refusal to budge on classifying Saturday shifts in the same way as weekday ones. Junior doctors get extra payments for work outside ""normal hours"" - which are currently classified as 7am to 7pm, Monday to Friday. Chair of the BMA's UK junior doctors committee, Dr Johann Malawana, said it wanted a contract that protected patient safety and was ""fair to both junior doctors and the health service as a whole."" ""We can only do this if the government is prepared to work collaboratively in a genuine negotiation. Unfortunately, they have chosen to ride roughshod over the concerns of doctors with their threat of imposition."" A Department of Health spokesman said ""We really value the work and commitment of junior doctors, but their current contract is outdated and unfair - the best way of changing that is negotiation."" Danny Mortimer, Chief Executive, NHS Employers said: ""Imposing a contract is not the preferred solution of any party - the door is still open for the BMA to come back to the negotiating table and we urge them to do so."" Analysis: Hugh Pym, BBC health editor In 2012, the Department of Health called for changes to a junior doctors' contract which dated back to the late 1990s. The BMA agreed to discuss terms and conditions for their members. After two years of talks, negotiations broke down. In August this year, the BMA refused to go back to the negotiating table, accusing the government of a ""heavy-handed"" approach, and ministers then said a new contract would be imposed. The Scottish and Welsh administrations, however, have said they will continue with current arrangements. The case for contract reform surrounds apparent inconsistencies in what is described to be a highly complex system which can result in varied working hours in different trusts. A more transparent system and with payment linked to responsibilities is what the employers claim to be seeking. This would involve higher basic rates of pay than now, which would mean higher pension entitlements. While NHS employers acknowledge some doctors would lose out, they argue that some would gain. Correction 9 October 2015: This report has been amended to clarify that rather than overtime rates being scrapped, doctors' ""normal hours"" are being extended.",1,312
"It could be over in hours - or it could take weeks. That's how unknowable an acute counter-terrorism investigation can be for MI5 and the police. While there is a sense that there has been significant headway in the last 24 hours, we should be careful about reading too much, too soon, into how long it will take Greater Manchester Police and their colleagues to be sure they have dealt with every single possible lead after Monday's events. In recent years, we've got a greater understanding of how the more secretive end of these massive operations play out. At any one time, MI5 is handling in the region of 500 active investigations involving 3,000 ""SOIs"" - ""subjects of interest"" in security world jargon. What kind of resources does MI5 have to throw at those targets? There are around 4,000 people at MI5. Quite obviously, they are not all trained in hiding in the bushes, so it would be fanciful in the extreme to think they are watching all 3,000 SOIs at the same time. What we know about Manchester suspect Manchester attack: The victims And that means they must constantly prioritise and reprioritise. It is a pretty ruthless, and if they make the wrong call, potentially painful process. The 7 July 2005 attack on London was earth-shattering for the security service. During the eventual inquests, it emerged that between MI5 and West Yorkshire Police there had been six potential intelligence strands in which the ringleader had come on to the radar. The service pledged to massively improve its systems. There was a huge reorganisation of itself and counter-terrorism policing to create powerful regional hubs that share intelligence like never before. Since 2013, 18 plots have been thwarted, Whitehall officials say. That's a better strike rate than some of our continental neighbours. But as the workload mounts, as it has done thanks to Syria, so do the chances that something will be missed. Every piece of intelligence that comes into the system - be it from a communications intercept, a public tip-off or another source - must be tested for links to ongoing investigations. And since 2014, we have known how the security service prioritises those investigations thanks to an immensely detailed document published by the Intelligence and Security Committee. Manchester is ""Priority 1"" in the MI5 jargon because there is ""credible and actionable"" intelligence of attack planning. Further down the ladder come: Those planning to fight overseas Fundraisers, suspects training in the UK, and people involved in false documents People of concern who need to be further checked out People who were previously a threat with a risk of ""re-engagement"" If security chiefs think there may be a bomb-maker on the loose - as is the case at the moment - they will be throwing everything at it. Analysts, surveillance units and specialist teams - who deploy the bugs or secretly search property - are reassigned to which investigation needs them most. The benefits of such a robotic and systematic way of working are plain to see. But along the way, a proportion of the investigations - and therefore the time of teams - will lead nowhere other than to confirm the intelligence was worthless. Take this scenario: Someone calls in to say that Person X is saying scary things and buying hair bleach - a chemical that can be used to make a bomb. A week later, and after an awful lot of effort, it turns out that Person X is opening a beauty salon and it was a malicious call from an embittered former partner. These are the day-to-day challenges of grading intelligence. Since the Manchester operation began on Monday it has sucked in more and more national counter-terrorism resources. It's taken on an international dimension because of the increasingly important link to Libya. Each property search or seizure of a phone opens even more avenues of investigation for the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and colleagues. Some of those avenues will become, in time, entirely separate investigations. And each of these leads will need to be worked to a conclusion, one way or another. And that brings us round to the big question yet to be fully answered in the Manchester investigation: was there a missed opportunity to apprehend Salman Abedi? We know that the killer had been known in some shape or form to the authorities. Muslim community sources have told the BBC that they called the anti-terrorism hotline about his mindset. And we know from official sources that Abedi had been one of a larger pool of ""former"" SOIs whose risk remained subject to review by MI5 and its partners. Wherever he had started in the prioritisation system, he ended up right at the bottom of the list - someone they might need to review in the future if there was ""credible"" and ""actionable"" intelligence that he was re-engaging in terrorist-related activity. But we don't know why he was downgraded - what investigators turned up and how, in the prioritisation system, he was deemed to be of insufficient interest. Were those calls to the anti-terrorist hotline lacking the detail of credible and actionable intelligence? Did they come before or after he was put to one side? Or was it just partial information? Too little to trigger a new probe when there were too many more pressing demands for attention? The answer to that question is key.",1,313
"North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said a so-called ""fix room"" could reduce drug deaths and the spread of infection. He said the proposed plan came in response to Rhosddu residents' concerns over dumped hypodermic needles. Mr Jones' comments come after a similar facility was recently announced for Glasgow. The Glasgow centre, which will be the first of its kind in the UK, will aim to address the problems caused by users who inject on the city's streets. Similar schemes already operate in 10 other countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Holland and Switzerland. Mr Jones said: ""At the moment, all you're getting is the authorities treating the symptoms of substance abuse and drug addiction rather than the underlying causes. ""Drug addiction should be treated as a public health issue rather than as a criminal matter."" If given the go-ahead, he said the rooms could also offer ""wrap around"" services such as health care, counselling, housing and welfare advice. He said he also wanted to see a heroin-assisted treatment centre, which would see ""chaotic"" addicts prescribed medicinal heroin to help them beat their addiction. He added this would also help tackle low-level street drug dealing. Mr Jones said he was in discussion with members of Wrexham council about how such a project could work. He added: ""This approach would be better for those suffering from the blight of addiction, society in general and the residents of Rhosddu in particular. ""The people who make a good living out of drugs are the organised criminals. They are the people we need to be going after with all our might.""",1,314
"Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday. Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways. Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography. The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being ""loving and normal young man."" Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his ""own strange pleasure,"" they were serious matters as ""children were abused for these images to be made."" He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that ""society would not tolerate such behaviour."" Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating. During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images ""for perhaps the last nine years."" Defence lawyer Taylor Campbell said that Lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.",1,315
"Ward, the world number 111, recovered from two sets down to win 6-7 (5-7) 5-7 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 15-13 in Glasgow. The Englishman needed six match points before finally seeing off the world number 20 after almost five hours. Andy Murray, playing his first match in Scotland for four years, had earlier beaten Donald Young 6-1 6-1 4-6 6-2. Media playback is not supported on this device The best-of-five tie continues with Saturday's doubles, before the reverse singles on Sunday. ""It's really tough for the USA now at two matches down,"" said GB captain Leon Smith. ""But they have Jim Courier as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight."" There is now every prospect of Britain repeating last year's win over the US at the same stage, after Ward again produced an upset in the second singles match. Last year it was Sam Querrey in four sets - this time the Londoner came through a 111-minute final set to see off Isner and claim the win of his life. And if Murray had been expected to dominate proceedings on his return home, the opening day ended with Ward acclaimed by the 7,700 spectators at the Emirates Arena. ""This is by far the best atmosphere I've ever been involved in and thank you very much to all the crowd,"" said Ward. ""It was difficult. I had a lot of chances in the last set. It was an unbelievable match."" A downcast Isner admitted: ""It's brutal. I'm barely going to sleep tonight, it's awful. ""I'm healthy. Mentally I'm certainly a bit shaken right now but I've got to be a professional and bring my best on Sunday. I don't feel too chipper right now but I'll let it rip on Sunday if that match is live."" Isner looked in control after taking the opening tie-break and breaking serve for the first time in the match on his way to a two-set lead. Ward has been in the best form of his career over the last 12 months, however, and backed up by a gruelling off-season training block with Murray, he dug in and worked his way back into the contest. Two terrific passes helped him finally break the Isner serve in the third set and the Briton levelled in a tie-break as the momentum swung steadily in his favour. Ward dominated the decider, earning a break point and then five match points, only for the 6ft 10in Isner to keep him at bay with his huge serve. With no tie-break in the deciding set, the games ticked by, prompting memories of Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. Ward had his own moment of danger at 11-11 but saved two break points, the second in a long and desperately tense rally, but for the most part he looked the more likely winner. Media playback is not supported on this device It took until the 28th game of a gripping final set but there was no escape when Isner slipped 0-40 down, and he netted a volley to spark wild celebrations among the British squad. Ward shared a long hug with Murray, who had been dispensing advice via Smith from the sidelines throughout. The Scot had earlier seen off Young with a fine display in front of his home crowd, who gave him a rousing reception. ""It was very nice,"" said the Scot. ""I used the energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match. I would say I played extremely well. ""I'm going to praise myself today - I hit one unforced error in two sets.""",1,316
"The Labour authority voted in favour of changing 2,700 contracts from 52 weeks to term time-only. The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing PS200 - PS400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge."" The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce."" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.",1,317
"Leeds, 15th in the Championship table, looked vulnerable at the start of the season, particularly at set-pieces. But central defender Bartley has formed an impressive partnership with Pontus Jansson in recent weeks. Bartley, on loan from Swansea, told BBC Radio Leeds: ""You'd have to give the credit to Pep. He had a look and then changed our set-up slightly."" The Yorkshire side were beaten in their opening two league matches of the season, losing 3-0 at QPR and then 2-1 at home to Birmingham. But on-loan Torino defender Jansson, 25, has played a key role in their improvement. Leeds have kept clean sheets in their last two games and conceded just two goals in their last four matches - and just one in their last four away games. Bartley, also 25, explained: ""We have Pontus as a spare man who isn't picking up anyone and whose job it is to go and attack the ball, which he has done very well. ""It's made us look a lot more solid. We're going out there now thinking we're going to win, not just hoping.""",1,318

"Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem."" ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible."" ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits."" A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland.

American sales of the Cork-distilled whiskey were up more than 10. In its update for investors, the drinks company reported total sales rose 3 in the first three months of 2017, and the detail gave some pointers to the market for whisky and other drinks around the world. Pernod Ricard reported the Chinese market ""remains challenging for Scotch,"" while there were more positive sales figures for Martell brandy. Imported spirits have been held back in China by official disapproval of conspicuous business hospitality and gifts. Bar and restaurant sales were reported to remain in decline. The company said Korean sales continue a ""strong decline"" across its brands. It also reported on the disruptive effect in India of the government removing large amounts of the nation's paper money from circulation, and a new law that will forbid the sale of alcohol close to highways. In Latin America, which has been a strong growth area for Scotch exports, Brazilian sales were weaker due to prolonged recession. But sales across the Pernod Ricard brands were strongly up in other countries, led by Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Cuba. The UK market was described as resilient and ""dynamic,"" because its products were being imported ahead of price increases in March, linked to the weakening of sterling. Among the stronger performers were Absolut vodka and Jameson's. With its full year results for 2015-16, Pernod Ricard reported Jameson's global sales were up 12 by volume and 16 by value.

Live updates on this story and others in South Yorkshire What was the'Battle of Orgreave'? What happened at Hillsborough? Lord Richard Keen, Lords spokesperson for the Home Office, said a barrister had been commissioned to go through 10,000 police documents ""in the context of the investigation at Orgreave."" In response to a question from Lord Richard Balfe, he said: ""The IPCC has told the Home Office officials that if it announces any action to set up an inquiry or other investigation relating to Orgreave it would have an impact on the Hillsborough investigation. ""For that reason, the decision will only be taken after that part has been concluded."" He added work was still on-going to ""assess whether material related to the policing of Orgreave is relevant to the Hillsborough criminal investigations."" Barbara Jackson, from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said: ""We respect all that the Hillsborough campaigners have had to go through, but we would like our issue dealt with as quickly as possible, as soon as their verdict is in the public domain.""",1,323
"Trapped by disadvantage are more than 730,000 youngsters, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). It laments a ""national shame,"" and its research suggests about 13 of the population - or three million people - are living below the breadline. Indigenous children suffer more than their non-Aboriginal counterparts. Single-parent families also endure great hardship. Raising her two young children on her own, Jessica Russell, 25, relies on weekly welfare payments of A545 (PS338), much of which is swallowed up by renting a modest house in the Sydney suburbs. ""It is a really big struggle. I'm the biggest stress-head possible because I worry for my children,"" she tells BBC News. ""I don't want them to fall behind and not get what they deserve or need in life. ""I break down most nights because I can't give them everything that they need or want. I put myself last."" Ms Russell lives well below the official poverty line, which is defined as half of Australia's median income (about A80,000). At times, she says the pressure is overwhelming. ""It comes crashing down,"" she says as Ryan, three, roars past with a toy chainsaw, pursued by his brother, Andrew, one. ""They'll go to bed, I'll sit down and I will just be like,'What have I done wrong? What have I done wrong to struggle so much? It is almost 30 years since the then Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, said: ""No child will be living in poverty by 1990."" His bold promise would not be kept, but it did lead to significant progress in tackling inequality in the 1980s and 1990s, yet still the problem persists. In the Ashfield district of Sydney, it is late morning and a crowd waits quietly outside the heavy wooden doors of the Loaves and Fishes Restaurant, a restored hall in the grounds of the 19th Century Uniting church. Run by the Exodus Foundation, it serves 500,000 free meals to the needy each year. The charity was co-founded 30 years ago by the Reverend Bill Crews, the son of middle-class British migrants. ""We're forever struggling to keep up,"" he says. ""We'll come across a family who have been living on pancakes for a week because there hasn't been enough money. ""This is a country that could lead the world in a good way to live. ""It has got the will in its people to be egalitarian and show the way. ""One hundred years ago, Australia showed the way. ""It is very sad to me to go to countries overseas where you expect to see poverty, and then come back here and see the same poverty here."" The ACOSS report indicates one in six children in Australia is living in poverty, a 2 increase during the past decade, when the nation's coffers brimmed from a multi-billion dollar bonanza forged on exports of iron ore and other prized resources. Charities blame the soaring cost of living and a lack of affordable housing for stubbornly high levels of poverty. They fear the government will start curbing welfare payments. ""People see Australia as the place where you can come and get your own house, bring up your family and you won't have any problems, but we are seeing an increasing population of those people that are finding it tough,"" says Ben Carblis, from Mission Australia, a non-denominational Christian community service organisation. ""It is hard to believe."" This grim assessment of life for millions of hard-pressed Australians is not, however, universally accepted. David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democratic senator in Canberra, has questioned how levels of disadvantage are calculated and believes the scale of the problem has been overblown. ""Poverty does exist in Australia, if you are talking about not having enough food, nowhere to live and no clothes to wear, but it is nowhere near 13 - nowhere near that,"" he tells BBC News. ""The people who work for those charities have their careers tied up in the continuation of that charitable work. ""If they were too successful and poverty was eliminated, they wouldn't have jobs anymore. ""They have a very long history in Australia of talking up poverty."" The federal government has said the best way to tackle poverty is to create more jobs. Ms Russell wants to train to be a midwife when her boys are older, but for now can see no end in sight to the daily grind of life below the breadline. ""I have two gorgeous, gorgeous children, and I still feel like there is something more that I can do, but I can't pinpoint what it is, and it breaks me because I don't know how to fix it,"" she says.",1,324
"The former world champion will target the time trial and may also support Lizzie Armitstead in the road race. Pooley, 33, retired from cycling after winning two silver medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon and other endurance events. ""This is a truly rare opportunity that I can't resist,"" she said. Pooley won silver in the time trial at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before finishing sixth in the event at London 2012, where she also helped Armitstead win a silver medal in the road race. The 29.8km time trial course in Rio features the 1.2km, 7 average gradient Grumari climb and the ""impressively hilly nature"" of the terrain persuaded Pooley, renowned for her climbing abilities, to come out of retirement and target a gold medal. ""I've decided it's worth a serious attempt at targeting that event,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday. ""If I can prove to both myself and the GB team selectors that I have the capacity to win the time trial in Rio, I'll compete for selection for the Olympic team - I'm happy knowing I won't get selected unless I really do have the potential to win. ""I have no desire to go to the Rio Games, and sacrifice some of the most exciting triathlon races of the season, just for the experience of another Olympics - I'm committed to aiming for gold."" After turning to multi-sport events in August 2014, Pooley won the world long-distance duathlon title at the first attempt a month later, breaking the course record by 16 minutes. She successfully defended her crown in September and is aiming to make it three consecutive wins next year, adding that long-distance triathlon and duathlon remain her ""main focus"" in 2016. Yet after studying the Rio courses, British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton says he approached Pooley about a return, believing she could also improve world champion Armistead's chances of winning gold in the road race. ""I'm really pleased that Emma saw the value in the opportunity and is back with us,"" he added. ""Having her talent and experience in the team enhances our medal prospects in the time trial and Lizzie Armitstead's opportunity to win the road race. ""The road race field is likely to fall away from behind, but as a pure mountain climber, I don't see Emma falling away. It would be great to see her in the road race supporting Lizzie."" Meanwhile, former Tour de France champion Sir Bradley Wiggins says he wants to keep riding beyond this season, having previously claimed he would retire at the end of 2016. The four-time Olympic gold medallist, 35, is set to compete in the team pursuit on the track at Rio and could continue racing into 2017. ""I will see how I feel this time next year,"" he said. ""There might be other opportunities. If I haven't got a job by this time next year I will keep racing.""",1,325

"The Waking the Dragon tower was granted permission by Wrexham council back in February 2011. Businessman Simon Wingett is trying to raise PS2.5m to build the bronze sculpture, cultural centre and gardens at Chirk Park. Councillors are expected to grant the extension at a meeting on Tuesday. The 23.5m (77ft) -high dragon with wings spanning 57m (187ft) would stand on top of a 41.5m (147ft) tower at the former colliery site. Mr Wingett has said the sculpture will rival other well-known landmarks such as the Angel of the North, but time is running out on planning permission for the project granted back in 2011. He hopes to raise PS1m for the visitor attraction from the public, with the rest of the cash raised through loans from Finance Wales and grants from the Welsh Government. In a report to the council's planning committee, officers say the development would be a ""significant tourism draw to the area."" Councillors are recommended to approve the extension allowing Mr Wingett five more years to commence building at the site.",1,327
"The Labour leader told the New Statesman his party opposed government plans to lower the overall household cap, introduced in the last Parliament. And his spokesman confirmed he was ""very much in favour"" of getting rid of it altogether. The Conservatives said Labour wanted a return to ""unlimited welfare handouts."" The BBC's Carole Walker said Mr Corbyn was asserting his authority on what was a ""very difficult issue"" for the party. After Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference last week he wanted to ""remove the whole idea of the benefit cap,"" Owen Smith, his shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was ""very clear"" Labour was only opposing plans to reduce the limit of working-age benefits to PS20,000, and to PS23,000 in London. In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Smith acknowledged the principle of a welfare cap had wide public support and it would be ""foolhardy"" for Labour to set themselves ""unthinkingly"" against public opinion. But Mr Corbyn told the New Statesman the cap was responsible for ""social cleansing"" in his Islington North constituency, with people forced to leave their homes because they could not afford their rent. ""It's devastating for children, devastating for the family and very bad for the community as a whole,"" he added. His spokesman said Mr Corbyn had ""laid out his position"" and the policy would now go through a ""collective decision-making process."" Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Smith said the party leader had ""clearly signalled that he wants Labour to review and refresh our thinking on social security, especially in respect of the benefit cap, and that's a challenge I know the entire party will rise to in the months ahead."" Before Mr Corbyn was elected leader, the party was split over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, which will reduce the cap to PS20,000 outside of London, and PS23,000 in London. In July, 48 Labour MPs rebelled against the decision by the then interim leader Harriet Harman to abstain and instead voted against the bill. The Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said ""chaos and confusion"" surrounded Labour's position. ""Conservatives believe that nobody should be able to claim more in welfare than the average family earns by going out to work,"" he said. ""By pledging to reverse this position, it's clear that today's Labour Party are simply not on the side of working people. They are still the same old welfare party - wanting to borrow more to spend more on benefits."" In his interview, Mr Corbyn also said scrapping the Trident nuclear weapons system would become Labour Party policy if its conference votes for the change next week. Conferences votes are not technically binding on the party leadership. But asked whether scrapping Trident would become party policy if conference votes for it, Mr Corbyn said: ""Well, it would be, of course, because it would have been passed at conference.""",1,328
"Funding given to the charity, which collapsed in August, included at least PS28m from the Department for Education, the National Audit Office said. It received the money despite warnings about its financial management. But founder Camila Batmanghelidjh said an ""extremely distorted picture"" of the charity was being painted. She said former staff and mentors at Kids Company were now ""too scared"" to defend it because of a ""media frenzy and biased reporting."" She added: ""The state gave Kids Company money to do the job it couldn't do. It wasn't doing the charity a favour."" Evidence would have demonstrated Kids Company's ""exceptional clinical and financial value as well as its rigorous accountability,"" had it not been ""lost"" by the Department for Education, Ms Batmanghelidjh said. But a Department for Education spokesman said: ""We do not recognise Camila's version of events."" Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought it had been right to give Kids Company the chance to keep going, and that was why it had access to public money. The NAO found that Kids Company received public funding for at least 15 years, with at least PS42m provided in government grants, including PS28m from the Department for Education and its predecessors. It also received about PS2m from councils and PS2m from the National Lottery. The key findings of the report were: The NAO, an independent body which audits government departments, found that despite ""repeatedly expressed concerns"" from officials, the government ""continued to respond to the charity's requests for funding."" Its report said civil servants had noted that other organisations ""appeared to offer better value for money"" than Kids Company. It found ""a consistent pattern of behaviour"" of the charity writing to ministers to express fears of redundancies and the impact of service closures, while raising the same concerns in the media. This meant that from 2013 it did not have to compete for grants, the NAO found. Ashley McDougall, from the NAO, said it was not clear why government had continued to fund Kids Company ""year after year"" when concerns were known. 2002: Officials criticised Kids Company's record of financial management and said other similar organisations were more effective. 2003: Kids Company had not complied with conditions attached to a previous emergency grant, debts at the charity were mounting, and its long-term financial viability needed to be evaluated, officials said. 2008: Officials raised concerns Kids Company's dependency on government funding was being prolonged and the government could be accused of favouritism. 2013: Kids Company grants were significantly higher than those to similar charities, yet it had limited reserves and consistent cash flow difficulties, officials said. March 2015: Cash flow problems were persisting and officials were concerned that the charity would continue to rely on public funding. June 2015: Officials cast doubt on the financial figures produced by Kids Company, and said they had limited confidence in the charity's willingness or ability to change. They advised ministers not to provide emergency funds - but were overruled. What went wrong at Kids Company? BBC's Chris Cook: How ministers were'bullied' Do Kids Company's sums add up? Former children's minister Tim Loughton said he warned the Department for Education against giving a ""very sizeable"" grant to Kids Company in 2012. But he said he was ""overruled"" by Downing Street after Ms Batmanghelidjh wrote a ""Dear David letter"" to Number 10. Asked if he had he personally approved a loan for the charity, Mr Cameron said: ""I'll have to look and see precisely the actual letter you're referring to, but my role in this has always been to try and help keep that organisation going because it was doing very good and important work."" He said the government - and the last Labour government - had been ""confronted by difficult situations where this organisation doing this good work was finding it difficult to be financially viable."" Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, which will question officials on Monday, said it was ""unbelievable"" so much was given to the charity with ""little focus"" on its achievements. Speaking in the Commons, Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ""There is compelling evidence now that three prime ministers were unwittingly but directly involved in an enterprise that cost the tax payers many millions of pounds."" Kids Company was founded in 1996 in south London. It provided support to inner-city children and ran youth centres in London, Bristol and Liverpool.",1,329
"The interior of the Saab 340 that flies to and from Orkney was stripped out and renewed and the exterior repainted at a cost of almost PS270,000. Loganair, a franchise partner of Flybe, will spend PS3.5m having the same work done to the rest of its fleet. The first stage in the three-year project follows criticism about the reliability of Loganair services. The airline's business includes operating lifeline routes to and from the Scottish islands, including Lewis in the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. Last year, members of the public and MSPs raised concerns about the reliability of some of these services. In January this year, the company announced that it was investing PS15m in a programme of improvements and upgrades. As well as being given a revamp, each plane is to undergo a specialist check every 36 months. Loganair said this ""intensive process"" would involve stripping back the aircraft to the basic airframe structure for an examination using X-ray machines. Both engines and the flight control surfaces would also be removed to give access to the aircraft's structure and internal systems. Loganair chairman David Harrison said he was ""extremely pleased"" the first plane had been refurbished He said: ""Our engineers and support teams put an incredible amount of time and effort into the project, and I'm certain our customers will appreciate their endeavour and enjoy the comfort benefits the renewal project brings to the Saab 340 fleet. ""This Saab 340 renewal programme again underlines the commitment made by Loganair at the beginning of the year to embark on a significant investment programme to enhance the fleet and ultimately improve customer experience.""",1,330
"Footage secretly filmed by France 2 TV shows Francoise Olcay selling dinghies and life jackets to migrants hoping to reach the Greek islands. The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores by sea in the first seven months of 2015. Ms Olcay said the items would be bought elsewhere if she did not sell them. Admitting that she was taking part in the trade, she alleged that local Turkish authorities were also involved. She said others would have taken her place if she stopped selling supplies to the migrants. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that while honorary consuls are not members of the diplomatic corps, the news will be a big embarrassment to the French foreign ministry. The reporter on France 2 TV who uncovered the news had been investigating where migrants in Bodrum were purchasing their supplies. His inquiries brought him to a large store, with a French flag flying outside and a sign at the entrance saying ""French honorary consul."" Ms Olcay confirmed she was the consul, and that she sold boats to the migrants despite knowing it could lead to disaster. She told the reporter that it was wrong but everyone was doing it. Thousands of refugees have used Bodrum as a gateway to fulfil their dream of reaching Europe. However, correspondents say the number of nightly departures appears to have slightly decreased after Turkish police stepped up patrols in the wake of the death of Alan Kurdi. The body of the three-year-old was washed up at Bodrum last week, after he drowned along with his mother, four-year-old brother and nine other Syrians as they attempted to sail to the Greek island of Kos. Images of the boy's body sparked international outrage and highlighted the dangers faced by migrants who make the crossing.

"The PS230m development consists of 11 wind turbines. Mr Trump claims they would spoil the sea views for golfers on his course at Menie. He responded: ""We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated."" Mr Trump said: ""We will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself. ""This was a purely political decision. ""We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed."" He had previously threatened not to build a hotel at the resort if it went ahead. Ministers said they were committed to a ""successful and sustainable"" offshore wind sector. The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project is a joint venture by utility company Vattenfall, engineering firm Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg). The project is aimed at providing enough energy for more than 49,000 homes. The Scottish government said the centre would allow offshore wind developers and supply chain companies to test ""cutting edge"" wind technology before its commercial deployment. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: ""Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland; an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets. ""The proposed European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will give the industry the ability to test and demonstrate new technologies in order to accelerate its growth. ""It secures Aberdeen's place as the energy capital of Europe."" He added: ""The EOWDC is the first offshore wind farm to pass through the new approvals process for offshore wind development and as such is a test case for the industry. The diligence and expertise of officials in Marine Scotland, among the statutory consultees and other interests should give confidence to the offshore wind industry and its supply chain that planning matters should not be a barrier to investment in Scotland."" EOWDC project spokesman Iain Todd said: ""The Scottish government's most welcome approval for the EOWDC is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK's offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector. ""The project partners will assess the consent and associated conditions as part of the planning and programming for the next phase of the scheme."" Alex Salmond, the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: ""I welcome this decision. ""The north east of Scotland is a world energy capital and in order to continue to prosper we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research - marine renewables, as well as oil and gas."" Dr Sam Gardner, senior climate change policy officer at WWF Scotland, said: ""Giving the go-ahead to this offshore wind test centre is the right decision, demonstrating that no amount of bluster from US billionaires such as Donald Trump will hold Scotland back from becoming a cleaner, greener, job-creating nation."" Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""The north east is already established as a global hub for the oil and gas industry. ""The development of the EOWDC will enable the region to extend its reach with regard to offshore wind, further enhancing our renewable energy expertise and drawing upon our strong engineering and technology skills base. ""This is an important development for the region.""",1,332

"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school. Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was ""obviously not well."" Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him. ""Camera shy"" was the comment by his entry. Unlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police. Adam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child. He went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education. His aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was ""definitely the challenge to the family in that house."" ""Every family has one. I have one. They have one. ... But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,"" she said. Intelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him. Richard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had ""some disabilities."" He was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to ""take flight,"" Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem. ""You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with."" Mr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment. ""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,"" he said. An inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts. They stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however. Olivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was ""very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody."" ""Now looking back, it's kind of like'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,"" she said. A former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys. ""You know the trouble kids, and you figure,'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,"" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper. Marsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it. The parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried. His mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home. Friends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was ""a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted.... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out."" Contrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car. Adam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010. In a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. ""We, too, are asking why. Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.""",1,334
"The court in Novorossiysk gave two of the dancers 10 days in jail each, a third 15 days and two others received fines on charges of petty hooliganism.

"Kirsty Williams told them they have a ""responsibility as stewards of community, city and country,"" at a speech in Cardiff. The referendum showed ""notions of togetherness"" were ""perhaps weaker than we imagined,"" she warned academics. The Conservatives said she had offered some ""nuggets of wisdom"" but was ""exaggerating a sense of crisis."" Universities and the Ms Williams campaigned for the UK to remain an EU member before the vote in June. However, Brexit was backed by 52.5 of voters in Wales, with 47.5 supporting Remain. On Monday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Wales must get away from the abuse and bitterness of the referendum campaign. Speaking at Cardiff University on Thursday, Ms Williams claimed there was an ""urgency"" for universities to ""recapture a civic mission"" after the Leave vote. She suggested the existence of much of what is taken for granted in modern life might not be as secure as many people believe. ""The victories that help bend the arc of history towards progress - feminism, opening up access to education, civility in our discourse and towards others, civil rights, even devolution - may be far more fragile than we imagined,"" Ms Williams said. ""The vote showed that when people and communities think advancements are for the benefit of others - rather than for them, their families or society at large - they will think they have nothing to lose by standing against these."" Urging colleges to do more to reach out to people across Wales, Ms Williams said the referendum exposed the ""distance between campus and community."" She warned: ""At a UK-level, the pro-EU campaign of universities was too easily dismissed as one of self-interest, almost exclusively focused on income. ""This is not to exempt politicians and government from criticism, far from it. But it is certainly incumbent on universities to reflect on the distance between campus and community exposed by the referendum."" Ms Williams has also announced she is establishing a Welsh Higher Education Brexit Working Group, to advise on the ""impact and possibilities"" arising from the UK's departure from the European Union. Six years ago the then Education Minister Leighton Andrews said university governance was ""the last resting place of the crachach"" - elitist and detached from mainstream Welsh society. In her first big address to university bosses, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams's tone was distinctly less confrontational. But her more nuanced message still displayed a view in government that institutions getting millions in public money should do more for their communities and the nation. ""They can't hide behind the walls of their very fine buildings - they have to be a part of the communities in which they are placed and the country as a whole - they recognise that,"" she told me afterwards. The EU referendum - in which the universities argued strongly to stay in - is one example of the divide between campus and community, she says. The universities' response is to say they are committed to bridging the gap and will build on what they already do in their communities. And both government and universities will hope the Diamond Review on higher education finance, due to report later this month, will go some way to resolving the tensions between them over funding. Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar accused the minister of ""exaggerating a sense of crisis and division."" ""There are some nuggets of wisdom in this speech, and few would argue that the gap between campus and community has widened over the course of a generation,"" he said. ""However, the suggestion that Wales' decision to leave the EU has somehow placed education, civil rights or feminism under threat is absolute nonsense."" Cardiff University vice chancellor Prof Colin Riordan, who chairs Universities Wales, said: ""Being part of and contributing to community has always been at the heart of what we do as universities."" He added: ""We are proud of our successes, but we can do more to embrace and appreciate the cultural and social diversity of the communities within which we sit.""",1,338
"Nia Griffith said her party offers ""investment in Wales, versus cuts from Westminster"" by the Tories. She urged people to ""imagine the price"" if there was a Conservative government in Wales as well. ""Labour changes peoples' lives when we are in government,"" Ms Griffith added. She reinforced the message of First Minister Carwyn Jones, who told delegates on Saturday that the assembly election in May would be a straight fight between Labour and the Conservatives. ""Together we are fighting for Wales in Westminster and taking on the Tories' appalling treatment of our nation,"" Ms Griffith said. ""We need to tell families up and down the country about what our Welsh Labour government is delivering. ""Investment in Wales, versus cuts from Westminster - jobs for our young people, not leaving a generation behind. ""That's the difference that a Labour government makes. Labour policies promised then delivered because we are in government. ""So don't listen to those who say we should be happy just shouting from the sidelines, that principled opposition is better than political power. ""If we take that attitude we may as well shut up shop."" Ms Griffith pointed to Labour's establishment of the NHS, introduction of the minimum wage, and delivering devolution with the creation of the National Assembly. Meanwhile Mr Jones has said income tax rates in Wales would stay the same as those in England under a Labour Welsh government. He told the Sunday Supplement programme on BBC Radio Wales he would not use new powers to increase income taxes if Labour won the assembly election. ""People have a real squeeze on their personal finances and the last thing I want to do is add to that pressure,"" he said, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has proposed an increase of 1p in the pound for taxpayers in Scotland.",1,339
"Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease. But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), they will have to rely on visual checks alone. The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread. Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK. Ron Spellman, a British meat inspector with 30 years' experience, says the new regulations, which took effect from 1 June, risk diseased parts of animals going undetected. Listen to Allan Urry's report on File on Four on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 17 June, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer Mr Spellman, who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection (EWFC), which represents meat inspectors across the EU, said: ""Last year we know that there were at least 37,000 pigs' heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head. They won't be cut now. ""There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes."" Meat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods. The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA. The FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern. He said: ""The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control. ""We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly."" But the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses. Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes. Kevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork. He sees the new hands-off approach as ""a backward step"" and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way, which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do. But he says: ""Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product? We'll end up with a two-tier system."" Shadow food and farming minister Huw Irranca-Davies has called for an urgent meeting with the FSA. He says he is not convinced by the science he has seen on the matter and is worried the new rules could damage Britain's exports, which rely on a reputation for high welfare and meat hygiene standards. Mr Irranca-Davies said: ""We want to see absolute categoric assurances that this is not jeopardising consumer protection and we're not reassured yet because despite the work that the FSA has been doing over a few years now to look at this issue, what they have presented to us is not a compelling case for a change in the way that this works."" A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman said: ""The changes to the meat inspections will mean less cutting and handling of carcasses and offal, reducing the potential risk of harmful bacteria spreading onto the meat. ""Pigs will continue to be inspected for lesions by a vet and again after slaughter by a meat inspector. ""All pigs for export will be inspected using the methods agreed with the markets we export to.""",1,340
"The pages from a 13th Century text of the holy book of Islam were purchased by the council in 1951. Conservator Richard Hawkes said: ""This is the earliest example of paper that I have worked on."" Leeds City Council said the paper's age and origin were confirmed by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2014. The pages mainly show surahs (or chapters) 29 and 30, said the council. Councillor Brian Selby said: ""The painstaking work of the museum team has ensured the pages can be displayed in a way which fully captures their significance as well as how ornate and beautiful they are.""

"Members of the Clwyd North Division are against the changes at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan. These could see clinical staff transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd and Wrexham Maelor hospitals from 6 April. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was ""disappointed"" by the vote. Doctors, who held the vote after discussing the plans at a meeting on Monday, said the recent decision to withdraw consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services at the hospital for 18 months has left them feeling demeaned. Dr Richard Lewis, secretary of the Welsh British Medical Association, said that following a number of high-profile resignations at the board two years ago after a damning report on management failings, communications between the board and the wards remained poor. ""The situation in terms of the board's ability to communicate with its frontline staff are as bad if not worse than ever,"" he told BBC Wales. ""That gap seems not be closing; in fact on this particular issue it seems to be widening, which is a real worry."" Health board executive medical director Prof Matthew Makin said: ""We fully acknowledge the strength of feeling regarding the board's decision from our clinicians but maintain that our primary motivation for making this pre-emptive urgent interim change is to protect the safety of mothers and babies."" Meanwhile, AMs in the Welsh assembly agreed a motion on Wednesday calling on the health board to ""ensure the continuity of consultant-led maternity and other women's clinical services at each of the three district general hospitals in north Wales."" Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar, AM for Clwyd West, said: ""I welcome the fact that not a single Assembly Member voted against our motion to protect maternity services from the threat of downgrading.""",1,342
"The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days. Plans for Green Park Station were put on hold two years ago, but the council now wants work on it to start within three years. Reading Borough Council is set to re-submit planning proposals for the stop next year. The stop, by junction 11 of the M4 on the Reading to Basingstoke line, is expected to cost up to??8m to build. The plans were pulled two years ago when a key developer dropped out. Simon Beasley, network manager at the council, said: ""I think it will make a real difference, a positive difference. ""Clearly we don't know how it will be serviced by trains but if there's anybody who can divert from the roads to the railways, then of course that's going to be positive.""",1,343
"Sales volumes increased by 1.7 in November from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared with the same month last year, sales were up by 5. However, Keith Richardson from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking said it was ""too early"" to say whether Black Friday was really a success for retailers. ""Retailers were better prepared this year and adapted the US-style Black Friday to better reflect British culture. Some chose not to take part while many others spread the discounts over several days to better protect margins and ease the burden on their websites and IT platforms."" The ONS said the amount spent by shoppers was up 1.4 in November compared with the month before, and was also up 1.4 from the same point a year earlier. The value of online sales increased by 4.9 in November from October, and were 12.7 higher compared with last year. ""Retailers may see some pay-back after the Black Friday promotions led shoppers to pull-forward spending that would otherwise have taken place in December, but the underlying sales trend looks set to remain strong as we head into 2016,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He added that spending was not just being driven by discounts. ""Households are benefitting from improved job security, low inflation and falling energy prices, the latter helping free-up more income to boost retail sales.""",1,344

"A health tribunal has found Peter Sutcliffe no longer needs any treatment for any mental disorder. In 1981 he was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders and given 20 life sentences. Moving Sutcliffe would need to be approved by the Ministry of Justice. The BBC understands that transferring Sutcliffe to a prison could save up to PS250,000 a year. Between 1975 and 1980 Sutcliffe preyed on women across Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. He mutilated them and beat them to death. Sutcliffe was initially sent to Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight but after three years he was moved to Broadmoor in Berkshire, where he has remained since being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. A former lorry driver from Bradford who now calls himself Peter Coonan, he was caught when police found him with a prostitute in his car. They became suspicious and found he had a fake number plate and weapons including a screwdriver and hammer in the boot. Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a diagnosis doctors use if someone is experiencing a cluster of psychological symptoms. These include ""psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or seeing things that don't exist (hallucinations) and having unusual beliefs that are not based on reality (delusions). There are different subtypes of schizophrenia - paranoid schizophrenia is one example and this is when the person experiences false beliefs of being persecuted or plotted against. Schizophrenia is a fairly common mental health condition, affecting about one in every 100 people. Dr Stephen Shaw, a retired criminal psychiatrist from Leeds who interviewed Sutcliffe after his arrest, said he was not surprised by the tribunal ruling. ""I saw him in Armley [prison in Leeds] when he was on remand,"" he said. ""He was no more a schizophrenic than I was. I thought this guy was not mentally ill."" Speaking last year when it was suggested Sutcliffe may be moved, Brian Dow, director of external affairs at the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: ""There's no cure [for schizophrenia] as such. ""There's no medication that will make it go away, but people will often be able to manage their symptoms to a point where they can lead a very normal life. ""Presumably.... he is sufficiently well that he no longer needs to be treated in a clinical setting. ""That's very possible as the treatments he may have had may have got him to a point where they deem him to be able to be incarcerated in a prison rather than a high-security ward."" A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Peter Coonan will remain locked up and will never be released for his evil crimes. ""Decisions over whether prisoners are to be sent back to prison from secure hospitals are based on clinical assessments made by independent medical staff. ""The High Court ordered in 2010 that Peter Coonan should never be released. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal. ""Our thoughts are with Coonan's victims and their families.""

"In a letter to all party leaders, the Equality and Human Rights Commission expresses concern about hate attacks that have taken place since the UK voted to leave the EU in June. It calls for ""accurate information and respectful debate"" from politicians. The Home Office said extra money had been allocated to tackle hate crime. The commission's letter, which is co-signed by its chairman David Isaac and chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath, said politicians had spoken about ""the need to heal the country and bring people together"" following the UK's EU referendum. But instead, it said: ""There is growing concern that the divisions on a range of big questions are widening and exacerbating tensions in our society."" It pointed to the killing of Arkadiusz Jozwick, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks on the streets, and reports of hijabs being pulled off, all of which it described as ""stains on our society."" The letter comes after Thomas Mair was jailed for life on Wednesday for the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox during the referendum campaign. Prosecutors said the attack was ""nothing less than acts of terrorism"" and the judge said it was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism. The commission, an independent statutory body which advises on equality and human rights law, said: ""We are concerned that attacks on supporters of both sides of the Brexit debate have polarised many parts of the country. ""There are those who used, and continue to use, public concern about immigration policy and the economy to legitimise hate. ""The vast majority of people who voted to leave the European Union did so because they believe it is best for Britain and not because they are intolerant of others."" It describes the Brexit vote as a ""defining moment"" for the country, saying that while the focus has been on the economic and trading implications there should also be a ""discussion on what values we hold as a country."" The letter also criticises the government's aborted plan to demand companies set out the proportion of foreigners they employ, which was announced by Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Conservative Party conference in October. It said ""politicians of all sides should be aware of the effect on national mood of their words and policies, even when they are not enacted."" The letter also mentioned the discussion around child migrants, ""where dialogue escalated to irrational levels."" And it said there had been an ""ambivalent reception"" to claims of anti-Semitism in politics, an issue that BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said had dogged the Labour Party in particular. The commission said it welcomed the government's hate crime plans, but said more concerted action was needed. It suggested there should be a review of the sentences for hate crimes in England and Wales. Home Office figures released in October showed racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41 in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU. The Home Office said there was ""absolutely no excuse"" for such offences and extra money had been allocated to tackle the issue.",1,347
"The 60-year-old man was scuba diving at Agincourt Reef in Far North Queensland when he was seen to be in trouble, tour operator Quicksilver said. The tourist, a certified diver, was helped to the surface but could not be revived. It comes after two French tourists died while snorkelling on the reef at Michaelmas Cay on Wednesday. They are both believed to have suffered cardiac arrests. Paramedics were alerted to the latest tragedy just after 12.30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Friday. ""CPR was performed on a male patient in his sixties by a nurse on board a vessel and subsequently by a doctor,"" a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said. The Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO) said the alarm was raised when the diver was spotted without a regulator in his mouth 15m (49ft) below sea level on the ocean floor. ""We're not sure as to what has happened at this stage,"" a Quicksilver spokeswoman said. The man was travelling with his wife. It was his second dive of the day from a boat called Silver Sonic. AMPTO executive director Col McKenzie said the boat was carrying oxygen and defibrillation equipment and had operated for 11 years without serious incident.

"His lecture, to be broadcast later this year, is part of a raft of new BBC Radio 4 programmes unveiled on Monday. They include Glenda Jackson's return to acting, in a drama based on a cycle of 20 novels by French writer Emile Zola, and a Late Night Woman's Hour. Also announced is that Miles Jupp is to take over as the new host of BBC Radio 4's comedy show The News Quiz. Prof Hawking said he hoped his lecture would ""encourage people to imagine and explore the possibilities of science - both the known, and the as yet unknown."" He will also answer some questions sent in by listeners ahead of the recording. ""I will describe the remarkable properties of black holes, including the fact that very small black holes aren't black at all, but glow like hot bodies,"" he said. ""We should never stop trying to tell these extraordinary stories from science, and I hope my Reith Lecture will enthuse a new generation to develop ideas that will have an impact on our understanding of the world and never to be overwhelmed by the task of discovery."" The BBC Reith Lectures began in 1948, with a talk by philosopher Bertrand Russell. Last year, surgeon Atul Gawande examined the future of medicine. Past lecturers include artist Grayson Perry, politician Aung San Suu Kyi and conductor Daniel Barenboim.

"Prison inspectors discovered the average period of stay at the facility near Gatwick Airport had risen from 28 to 48 days. Twenty-three people were held for more than a year. The Home Office said it did not want to detain people for longer than necessary but some had prolonged the process. Brook House holds almost 400 adult male asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national offenders. Despite a push by the Home Office last year to reduce the number of people being detained, inspectors could not identify why periods of detention had lengthened. The report added that some detainees at the G4S-run centre had been held for excessive periods due to ""unreasonable delays in immigration decision making."" Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said the lack of analysis made it ""hard to see how detention periods could be systematically reduced and the inevitably negative outcomes for detainees mitigated."" A 2016 Home Office review said fewer people should be detained in immigration centres, while pointing out that each place cost PS34,000 a year. In response to the report a spokesman said: ""Detention is an important tool that helps us remove those with no right to be in the country and it is vital that this is carried out with dignity and respect."" But he said some of those being held had attempted to frustrate the removal process by failing to provide accurate and timely information about their identity. He said of the people leaving detention in 2016, 64 left within 29 days and 93 in less than four months. The centre was assessed as ""reasonably good"" on safety, respect, activities, and preparation for removal or release, but inspectors were concerned that the residential units ""very closely resembled"" a prison. Director of the removal centre, Ben Saunders, said inspectors had ""rightly"" identified the purpose-built design was stark in some places, and G4S would work with the Home Office, which owns the buildings, to soften the environment. Brook House opened in 2009 but a year later was branded ""fundamentally unsafe."" A further report in 2012 found there were still ""significant concerns,"" but in 2013 inspectors saw sustained improvement.",1,350
"A defence official said in a statement on Wednesday that its nuclear programme had ""long been in the full-fledged stage of miniaturisation."" However, analysts say while there is evidence the programme is advancing, it is difficult to assess its true extent. The claim comes hours after North Korea cancelled a planned visit by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Mr Ban was due to visit an industrial complex in the Kaesong economic zone run jointly by the North and South and would have been the first UN chief to visit North Korea in more than 20 years. Speaking at a forum in Seoul, he said the move was ""deeply regrettable"" and that no explanation was given. North Korea previously claimed it had miniaturised a device for the nuclear test it conducted in 2013 but experts have continued to debate how far along that process it is. Dr John Swenson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at the Chatham House think-tank, said that while there was ""growing evidence of the North's increasing technical sophistication,"" caution was necessary in interpreting North Korea's latest statement. Some have interpreted the latest moves, together with some recent high-profile executions, as attempts by leader Kim Jong-un to assert his authority. The latest announcement on nuclear advances follows the publication earlier this month of pictures apparently showing a missile being launched from a submarine. Some experts have said the images may have been doctored. Responding to the latest claims, the South Korean defence ministry urged the North to stop developing nuclear weapons. An anonymous South Korean military official said it was believed to be true that Pyongyang had made significant progress in miniaturising its nuclear weapons. ""But South Korea and the US share the assessment that it is not at a stage where it has completed the related technology,"" the official told the Yonhap news agency.",1,351

"Gregg McNally put Leigh in front early on before Atelea Vea crossed over soon after to extend their advantage. The hosts went in at the break with an 18-0 lead after Samisoni Langi touched down just before half-time. Josh Drinkwater scored a drop-goal in the second half before McNally raced the length of the field to score again. Leigh's victory means Widnes Vikings finish bottom of the Super League at the end of the regular season. A win for Salford would have ensured third place, which would have been their highest league placing for 40 years. Instead they slipped to a fifth defeat in their final six games before the Super 8sQualifiers split and dropped a place to fourth by virtue of Hull FC beating Huddersfield on Friday. Leigh coach Neil Jukes said: ""We ticked nearly every box tonight. It was a derby and we didn't want to finish bottom on our first season back in Super League. ""It was important for us to get some confidence and build momentum as we go into the next competition (Super 8 qualifiers). I was really pleased. ""Our game management was good as was our defensive effort plus we kicked the ball at the right time.

It has given us something to build on."" Salford coach Ian Watson: ""People will lose their shirt on that performance today. It was disappointing. The first half we were way below the standards we have set ourselves physically. ""Leigh were dominant - their pack was on the front foot and their half-backs were able to control the game on the back of that."" ""Our performances have dipped and there's been a drop in intensity since we secured a top-eight finish.

"The 46-year-old succeeds Ronnie Moore, who parted company with the club by mutual consent earlier on Wednesday. This is a first managerial role for Hignett, who had a spell as Hartlepool assistant manager under Colin Cooper in 2013-14. Hartlepool are one place above the relegation zone having lost three of their past four league matches. Hignett, whose 19-year playing career began at Crewe and ended at Hartlepool, will take charge of the team for the first time when Pools host Yeovil on Saturday. ""We immediately identified Craig as our number one target and we believe he has all the right qualities to help instil confidence back in to the players and help us move up the table,"" said chairman Gary Coxall. ""He has a wealth of experience in football and has been looking for an opportunity to move in to management so we're delighted to give him that chance here at Victoria Park."" Sam Collins, who worked alongside Moore, will remain at the club but in a new role focusing on the club's under-21 players.",1,356
"Moat Brae in Dumfries has been a private house, a nursing home and harboured hopes of being turned into a themed hotel. It has gone to the brink of demolition and back but now its future finally looks secure. The mansion, designed by architect Walter Newall for a local solicitor, will now become a national centre for children's literature after raising PS5.3m in capital funding. It has been a dramatic journey very much in the spirit of author JM Barrie who studied at Dumfries Academy and played in Moat Brae's gardens as a child. Born in Kirriemuir in Angus, he moved south in 1873 at the age of 13. In his memoirs published in 1904, he wrote of Peter Pan: ""Our escapades in a certain Dumfries garden which was an enchanted land to me was certainly the genesis of this work."" That was during Moat Brae's first life as a private home but, for many Doonhamers, it is best remembered in another role. Until the 1990s it was run as a private hospitalnursing home. However, when that operation was closed, the building at the back of Dumfries Academy faced an uncertain future. It sat empty for some time before eventually being sold at auction to a private buyer in late 2000. There were hopes that its fortunes could be transformed but talk of a grand hotel never came to fruition. Instead, the property remained empty and became a target for vandals as its sorry decline continued. In January 2003, furniture inside the building was set on fire, a number of windows and fittings smashed and plasterboard ripped from walls. It was estimated that it would cause PS200,000 to repair, prompting fresh calls for action to help safeguard its future. Yet there would be five more years of deterioration before the building was put up for sale once more. It was secured by the Loreburn Housing Association (LHA) in May 2008. They wanted to create a residential development as well as a visitor centre but not everyone approved of the proposed project. In August 2009, the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust (PPMBT) served an interim interdict on LHA to stop their overhaul works which would have seen the facade retained but much of the rest of the building demolished. It came just days before the bulldozers were set to move in. Later that year the housing association agreed to sell the building to the trust for PS1. Convener Iain Agnew said it now felt the PPMBT was ""best placed"" to lead the restoration project. But that was just the start of another difficult voyage - raising the funds needed to convert the building into a centre for storytelling and children's literature. That goal sometimes seemed as distant and imaginary as Neverland but slowly but surely it gathered momentum. The drive and determination of the PPMBT - and generosity of numerous groups and individuals - has put the resources in place to create what they hope can be a major visitor attraction. It should provide a happy conclusion to the Moat Brae tale which JM Barrie himself would have been proud to have penned.",1,357
"New figures show the total number of teachers across Scotland has risen, but 12 council areas saw numbers fall. Mr Swinney said the stats were ""good news"" in light of recruitment ""challenges"" in some areas. Opposition parties said numbers were still down over the long term. And they said parents ""have a right to be very angry"" about the attainment gap between pupils from better and worse-off backgrounds. The latest figures showed teacher numbers were up for the first time in several years, with 51,000 employed in state schools in 2016. But in 12 local authorities the numbers fell, with the largest percentage drop in Moray, which has highlighted recruitment problems in the past. The figures were among a fresh batch of important statistics being published on the state of the Scottish education system. The ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained across Scotland but the average size of a class crept up slightly to 23.5 students. Nationally, the number of teachers fell between 2010 and 2014 then stabilised. The number of teachers fell in 12 council areas, including in Highland and Dumfries and Galloway, although in both these regions the ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained at the same level. In 12 council areas the ratio of pupils to teachers got worse in 2016, including in Edinburgh and Fife where teacher numbers had risen. These were: The government expects the ratio of pupils to teachers to be maintained, although BBC Scotland understands the councils will not face any financial sanctions. Many councils have told BBC Scotland that they are finding it hard to fill some vacancies. Recently the Scottish government unveiled a number of initiatives to try to encourage more people into teaching, and some local authorities have also launched their own initiatives. The latest statistics also showed: Separate figures, published on Tuesday, looked at the number of children considered by teachers to be performing at the required level for their age in Curriculum for Excellence. The data showed that between 65 and 85 of pupils in primary schools achieved the relevant level in aspects of literacy and numeracy. However, the proportion of pupils achieving the relevant level for their stage decreased throughout the primary stages. Updating MSPs on the figures, Mr Swinney said: ""I very much welcome the rise in teacher numbers compared to last year, the fact that class sizes are broadly stable and that the pupil-teacher ratio has been maintained. ""This is all good news, particularly when you consider the teacher recruitment challenges being faced in some areas. ""The data shows that significant improvements are required in some local authorities, and real challenges exist in delivering the progress in literacy and numeracy we seek. ""There is much to be proud of in Scottish education; we need to remain focused on and committed to Curriculum for Excellence and we need to continue to implement the reforms we are putting in place."" Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, welcomed the rise in teacher numbers but said some ""significant challenges"" continued to face schools. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""The number of teachers employed across Scotland has held steady, and actually shows a small increase overall, indicating the local authorities have adhered to a commitment brokered between the EIS and local and national government to maintain teacher numbers over the year. ""This is very welcome, and is helping to improve employment prospects for qualified teachers and ensure that young people have consistent levels of provision in schools across Scotland. ""The EIS would certainly expect the Scottish government to continue its commitment to maintaining teacher numbers, and we hope to hear confirmation soon from the finance minister in his forthcoming financial statement."" He added: ""Given the welcome Scottish government commitment to tackling the attainment gap, the trend of rising class sizes is an issue that must be tackled through greater investment in a greater number of qualified teachers."" The Scottish Conservatives said teacher numbers were still thousands below the levels they were at in 2007. The party's education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: ""With teacher numbers having plummeted from the levels they were at a decade ago, it once again calls into question whether the CfE can be delivered properly. ""There are a number of legitimate concerns about the curriculum, and these statistics are further evidence that we need to have proper independent scrutiny of how it is being implemented."" Ms Smith also told Mr Swinney that parents ""have a right to be very angry"" about the gulf in achievement between pupils from differing financial circumstances. The Scottish Greens' education spokesman Ross Greer questioned the government's decision to publish statistics on how well schools pupils were doing in certain areas of the Curriculum for Excellence. He said: ""Today's figures demonstrate the utterly bizarre education priorities the Scottish government has. We see class sizes continue to creep up, making them the highest they've been since the SNP formed the government and nine years after they promised to reduce them to 18. ""More teachers and smaller classes are vital if we're to improve the quality of education."" Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale accused the SNP of ""slashing"" spending on Scotland's school pupils by more than 8. She highlighted analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) which she said showed that real-terms spend on education fell from PS6,692-per-pupil in 201011 to PS6,152 in 2014-15. She said: ""Nicola Sturgeon promised to make education her top priority, but Scotland has plunged down the international league tables on her watch. ""Year-on-year cuts to school budgets, teacher numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland's children."" Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott MSP said: ""Today's figures show that after a decade in power, the SNP has failed to deliver on its commitment of smaller class sizes for our youngest pupils."" The latest figures a week after it emerged that Scotland's schools had recorded their worst-ever performance in an international survey of pupils. The country's scores for maths, reading and science all declined in the latest set of Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) figures. It was the first time since the tests began in 2000 that Scotland's performance in all three subject areas was classed as ""average,"" with none ""above average,"" among the 72 countries that took part. The Curriculum for Excellence has been introduced in Scottish schools in recent years, with the country's qualifications system also overhauled. However, teaching unions have complained about ""excessive and unsustainable"" workloads as a result of some of the changes.",1,358
"While 7 of people underpay and could be fined, 13 are paying too much. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The ORR employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. ""Despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,"" said John Larkinson, ORR director of railway markets and economics. ""We are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,"" he added. Rail operators C2C and Scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were ""baffling"" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in May, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. ""To quickly benefit passengers, the Rail Delivery Group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,"" said Mr Larkinson. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, told the BBC that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as ""queue-busters"" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but ""expectations [of passengers] had evolved."" He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The RDG also added: ""Complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. ""Simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,"" they added. by Ben Morris, business reporter In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.",1,359
"Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012 at their London Street property. Sibery pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. The court heard that when Mrs Sibery decided to confront her husband because of his erratic behaviour, the GP admitted he had been using the narcotic for two months. She told him if he did not quit his addiction, she would end his marriage to him. But despite the ultimatum, Sibery managed to persuade his wife into taking what was supposed to be his final fix. The court heard how Sibery wanted his wife to experience the feeling he got when he took the heroin. However, Mrs Sibery collapsed and started having difficulties breathing. The court also heard that Sibery, who was on bail for the offence, was now in the care of a consultant psychiatrist who was helping him to tackle his problems, and that he and his wife were still together. Sheriff Jarvie told Sibery that she would pass sentence on him at a hearing next month.",1,360

"Footage emerged online of people appearing to sing the anti-Irish ""Famine Song"" at the weekend, while a band played along. The council said the right of the Orange Order to march was not ""absolute."" And it warned future parades could face greater restrictions or prohibition. Police are investigating the footage of the song, which is sung to the tune of the Beach Boys' Sloop John B has previously been ruled to be racist by a Scottish court. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: ""The European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. ""However, these rights are not absolute. They must be balanced by the responsibility to ensure the rights of others are not infringed."" He added that the council would have a full debrief with police and the parade organisers, and would take into account any issues of public disorder, anti-social behaviour or damage to property resulting from the procession. And the spokesman said the council would also ""take into consideration any evidenced issues and, if a future procession notification is received from the organiser, the likelihood of any restriction or prohibition may be greater."" The main County Grand Orange Order parade from George Square to Glasgow Green on Saturday saw 4,500 people in 63 bands take part and another 4,000 people spectating. It was in celebration of Prince William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Eight arrests were made for minor disorder and alcohol-related offences. Robert McLean, executive officer for the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said: ""At the end of the day, members of the public will sing songs to tunes. ""I have been quite clear - if police investigate we will assist with their inquiries. We look forward to the debrief and looking at any incidents that occurred."" But David Scott, campaign director for anti-sectarian group Nil by Mouth, said: ""If the Orange Order are a religious and cultural organisation, what would be the relevance of a Beach Boys song? ""We know that tune also has another certain set of lyrics. The organisers should be speaking to band members and saying what is acceptable.""

"It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia - who doesn't have a rose-tinted view of the teams they watched as a child? - plus the fact that fleeting glimpses of star players have been replaced by wall-to-wall television coverage, and it is quite a challenge to consider the merits of teams across eras. Here, with the help of SAM, the super computer built by Salford University professors Ian McHale, Rose Baker and others, BBC Sport assessed every side to have played an international match and analysed every international result. Taking into account a range of factors - including goals scored, goals conceded, the strength of the opposition faced and whether or not results were achieved in major tournaments - we have come up with the top 10 teams of all time. There are no English or Italian teams. As for the winners? You might well be surprised. Line-up: Sepp Maier, Berti Vogts, Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Paul Breitner, Rainer Bonhof, Uli Hoeness, Wolfgang Overath, Jurgen Grabowski, Gerd Muller, Bernd Holzenbein. West Germany had come close to winning the World Cup twice in the preceding decade, losing 4-2 to England at Wembley in 1966 and 4-3 to Italy in a spectacular semi-final in Mexico four years later - so the stage was set for it to be third time lucky for veteran coach Helmut Schoen and his team as the host country in 1974. Media playback is not supported on this device They were guided on the pitch by an all-time great in the shape of Franz Beckenbauer. They had world-class defender Berti Vogts in their ranks. Wolfgang Overath was the midfield strategist and in attack they had the marksman supreme in Gerd Muller, scorer of 14 goals in 13 World Cup matches. Their meeting with the Netherlands in the final got off to the worst possible start when they conceded a first-minute penalty, but through sheer determination, and no little quality, they fought their way back to win through Paul Breitner's penalty and, inevitably, a winner from Muller. This West Germany side will not be remembered with the same fondness as some of the teams on this list but, like so many of their compatriots down the years, they got the job done. Line-up: Fabien Barthez, Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu, Patrick Vieira, Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Christophe Dugarry. Just look at that line-up! Built around star midfielder and three-time world player of the year Zinedine Zidane, this was the team that began the Euro 2000 final, a side so strong that two of Europe's finest players at the time, Robert Pires and David Trezeguet, could not get in the first XI. It was a group consisting largely of the players who won France's first World Cup in 1998, but with a few tweaks. Media playback is not supported on this device One, in particular, took the French to the next level. Out went striker Stephane Guivarc'h, scorer of just one goal in 14 internationals, and in came 22-year-old Thierry Henry, a forward who would go on to score 51 goals in an international career spanning 13 years. With Laurent Blanc in for Frank Leboeuf in defence, Patrick Vieira replacing Emmanuel Petit in midfield and attacker Christophe Dugarry taking Christian Karambeu's place, France became the first team in 26 years to win a World Cup and European Championship back-to-back - West Germany won the Euros in 1972 and followed that by claiming the 1974 World Cup. Line-up: Sergio Romero, Walter Samuel, Gabriel Heinze, Martin Demichelis, Nicolas Otamendi, Javier Mascherano, Maxi Rodriguez, Angel Di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Lionel Messi. Think Argentina and the mind instantly conjures images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Two iconic players, global superstars, both of whom led their sides to World Cup finals - Maradona winning one in 1986 and losing one in 1990, Messi losing out in 2014. But none of those three teams make it in to our top 10, and there is space for only one of Argentina's two most famous players. For all Maradona's individual brilliance, the 2010 side featuring Messi - as well as Carlos Tevez, Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain - are considered the best Argentina has produced. Bear in mind the fact Sergio Aguero was predominantly only a substitute and you get a sense of their attacking strength. ""To any football fan, it is odd that the results show that the 2010 team would beat the 1986 team,"" says Professor McHale. ""But there are some things that data and statistics can't pick up on - the human spirit, mental fortitude, attitude when things aren't going for you. There is only so much it can tell. ""The 1986 team lost 11 times in the three-year sample period, in part because they often played weakened teams in friendlies for a variety of reasons. That helps to explain why a team as brilliant as Maradona's 1986 side do not make the list."" While Argentina 2010 are perhaps the surprise entry on this list, their results in the period suggest they deserve their place. Less than two months after Spain won the World Cup, the world champions were thrashed 4-1 in Buenos Aires, a result Argentina followed up two months later with a 1-0 win over Brazil. Line-up: Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Brito, Piazza, Clodoaldo, Gerson, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao, Pele. For many, the greatest team of all time. But not when judged by cold, hard stats. Pele led the way for Brazil during this period, but the names of his colleagues roll off the tongue as a list of the game's greats: captain Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Tostao, Jairzinho, Rivelino. Media playback is not supported on this device In 1970 alone, they played 14, won 12 and lost only once, scoring four or more goals five times. Therein lies part of the explanation as to why they do not feature further up the list - their opponents were often relatively weak, meaning victories earned them less credit in our ranking system. This team, though, were the stuff of fantasy, regrouping after a below-par performance in England four years earlier when Pele was kicked out of the tournament. Mexico 1970 was the great man's World Cup finale after his first win in Sweden in 1958 and he bade farewell in style. England pushed them closest in a classic group game in Guadalajara settled by Jairzinho's goal, and this was a team so good they were even able to carry a goalkeeping liability in Felix with no ill effects. The final against Italy in Mexico's Aztec Stadium was their showpiece. Goals from Pele, Gerson, Jairzinho and the brilliant flourish of passing to set up Carlos Alberto for the most famous goal in the 4-1 win was the crowning glory for an utterly brilliant side. Line-up: Jan Jongbloed, Ruud Krol, Wim Rijsbergen, Wim Suurbier, Wim Jansen, Arie Haan, Wim van Hanegem, Johan Neeskens, Johan Cruyff, Rob Rensenbrink, Johnny Rep. One of the greatest teams never to win the World Cup. The Dutch were masterly throughout the 1974 tournament, demonstrating a tactical and technical ability far above every other team, guided on the pitch by the brilliant Johan Cruyff and off it by the master of ""Total Football,"" the visionary coach Rinus Michels. Cruyff led a team full of talent in defender Ruud Krol, midfielders Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens as well as forwards Johnny Rep and Rob Rensenbrink. In the goalless draw against Sweden, the ""Cruyff turn"" was invented, as the great man bamboozled Jan Olsson with a piece of football ballet that will forever bear his name. The Netherlands then gave masterclasses against Argentina, who they beat 4-0, and the fading reigning champions Brazil, where they won 2-0. The victory was far more convincing than the scoreline suggests. There was a touch of arrogance about this side and it cost them in the final against West Germany in Munich. Instead of capitalising on Neeskens' first-minute penalty they wanted to humiliate their opponents - allowing the ruthless hosts to recover and claim the World Cup with a 2-1 win. Line-up: Manuel Neuer, Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Muller This was the team that laid the foundations for the World Cup win that was to follow in 2014. A side which mixed the experience of Miroslav Klose (who would go on to become the all-time World Cup top scorer with 16 goals) and Bastian Schweinsteiger with a younger generation that included Manuel Neuer, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, their quarter-final win against Greece at Euro 2012 was their 15th consecutive competitive victory. The defeat by Italy in the semi-finals of that tournament would prove to be little more than a blip, as Joachim Low's side embarked on a new run of 18 competitive matches unbeaten, a sequence which included a remarkable 7-1 thrashing of hosts Brazil and ended with a World Cup final victory against Argentina. Line-up: Julio Cesar, Dani Alves, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, David Luiz, Bernard, Paulinho, Oscar, Hulk, Neymar, Fred A year away from hosting their own World Cup, Brazil could hardly have been better positioned to succeed on home soil. An 11-game unbeaten run in 2013 culminated in five straight wins at the Confederations Cup, a tournament which doubled as a dry run for the main event the following summer. Not only did Brazil win that competition but they did so in style, beating France 3-0 and Italy 4-2 before hammering world and European champions Spain 3-0 in the final. They were the world's in-form team and, with Neymar as their talisman, continued their impressive record in to World Cup year, recording 10 wins in a row and 13 out of 14 in total. Yet for all that promise, this will be a team forever associated with one of the great humiliations in modern sport. A game away from a final at the Maracana in Rio, Brazil were 5-0 down to Germany in the semi-final inside 29 minutes and were eventually demolished 7-1. It was a one-off - Brazil went on to win 11 straight matches after the World Cup, including victories against Argentina and France - but that defeat by Germany is a result that will always define them. Line-up: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Joan Capdevila, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, David Villa, Fernando Torres The inventors of tiki-taka, Spain imposed their own brand of football on the world from 2008 onwards, helped in no small part by the success of a Pep Guardiola-inspired Barcelona, whose players formed the core of the national team. With Andres Iniesta and Xavi the heartbeat of the side, Spain became the first team to win back-to-back European Championship titles (in 2008 and 2012), while they ended their wait for World Cup success when they became the first European nation to win the competition outside of their own continent by lifting the trophy in South Africa in 2010. It was a period of unprecedented dominance. Under Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, Spain set a new world record of 15 consecutive wins and went unbeaten for 35 matches. The team of 2010 boasts an 84 win percentage and the majority of the players above were involved in all three tournament successes, but that is not quite enough to make the top two. Line-up: Claudio Taffarel, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Aldair, Marcio Santos, Dunga, Juninho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Bebeto, Romario Brazil went unbeaten from November 1993 to January 1996, a period stretching 28 games, taking in a World Cup win and including victories against Argentina (twice), Netherlands and England, among many others. Their scintillating form continued, as they lost just once in 20 matches in the 1996-97 season, a campaign which culminated in a Copa America triumph. Those runs are hardly surprising when you look at the players at manager Mario Zagallo's disposal - he had three of Brazil's six all-time leading goalscorers to choose from. Ronaldo, scorer of 15 World Cup goals, was just three years in to his international career in 1997, working his way into a team which could boast two of the leading scorers at the 1994 World Cup - Romario (five) and Bebeto (three). Not a bad array of attacking power. This side was made up of a group of players who won that World Cup and were beaten finalists in 1998 - a rare example of a team maintaining its strength over a four-year cycle and reaching consecutive finals. Line-up: Gyula Grosics, Jeno Buzanszky, Mihaly Lantos, Borzsei Janos, Jozsef Zakarias, Jozsef Bozsik, Zoltan Czibor, Ferenc Szusza, Ferenc Puskas, Nandor Hidegkuti, Sandor Kocsis Hungary, the best team of all time? Bear with us... The Mighty Magyars dominated world football in the early 1950s, inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a run of more than four years without defeat, and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England, a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or Irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that, in that summer's World Cup, they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even seen at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern, with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary had gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game, hampering the Hungarians' attempts to cement their place as the world's greatest side. For Hungary, their team of the time was perhaps the ultimate example of a ""golden generation."" As the graph below shows, it has pretty much been downhill ever since. Here's how the top three nations look when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10, but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best? Despite the 1966 squad winning the World Cup, it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament's leading scorer, who knows how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened?

"Forest Green, promoted from the National League, will host MK Dons in their first appearance in the competition, while FA Cup giant-killers Lincoln will be away to Rotherham. The 35 ties will be played in the week commencing Monday, 7 August.

There was confusion after the draw, which was streamed live from Bangkok, where the competition's new sponsors, energy drink company Carabao, are based. A list of fixtures displayed on the stream showed Charlton drawn against two clubs, while AFC Wimbledon were also wrongly recorded as being at home to Swindon - the Dons were drawn at home to Brentford, and Swindon will be away to Norwich. And Forest Green were listed as being away to Wolves, who were in fact drawn at home to Yeovil. The live stream was also hampered by sound problems, with listeners on some clubs' websites unable to hear the draw. The EFL have since released a statement apologising for ""a number of third party technical issues that affected coverage of [Friday's] Carabao Cup round one draw in Bangkok."" It continued: ""There were inaccuracies - as a result of human error - in the live graphics output that resulted in confusion and incorrect ties being displayed on screen. ""In addition, some users did experience difficulties in accessing the stream on certain external platforms. Both issues are currently under investigation. ""The EFL can confirm that the draw was not compromised in any way and all clubs have received confirmation of their round one ties."" There are 12 former League Cup winners in the first round, with five-time champions Aston Villa the most successful side entering at this stage, ahead of four-time winners Nottingham Forest. Villa have been handed an away tie at Colchester, while Forest host League One side Shrewsbury. Newport County were drawn at home to Southend United, but the match will take place at Southend's Roots Hall stadium so the Welsh club can finish work on their pitch. The final of this season's competition will take place at Wembley on Sunday, 25 February 2018.

"The men, identifying themselves Andreas Richter and Piotr Koper, appeared on the country's TVP public television. In a statement they said they had ""irrefutable evidence"" the train existed, but failed to provide proof. Officials have cast doubt on the claims in recent days. The military was said to be inspecting the alleged site on Friday. Last week deputy Culture Minister Piotr Zuchowski said he was ""99 convinced"" that a World War Two German military train was buried near the south-western city of Walbrzych. Local legend says a Nazi train filled with gold, gems and guns went missing near the city in 1945. Speaking to TVP on Friday (in Polish), German national Mr Richter and Mr Koper, from Poland, said they had ""legally informed state authorities about the find and have precisely indicated the location in the presence of Walbrzych authorities and the police."" Their knowledge was based on information from witnesses and on their own research, carried out with their own equipment, Mr Koper said in his statement. He insisted they were not responsible for the ""media uproar"" around the case, saying confidential information provided to the authorities had been leaked. The pair want a 10 finders' fee and have reportedly vowed to spend part of the sum setting up a museum at the undisclosed site. Meanwhile, TVP said on Friday that the train was not in a tunnel, as previously thought, but instead buried in the ground. The train was rumoured to have been carrying gold from what is now the Polish city of Wroclaw as the Soviet army closed in at the end of World War Two. Local folklore said it went missing near Ksiaz castle, 3km (two miles) from Walbrzych. In a statement earlier last week, Mr Zuchowski warned the public to stop searching for the train until official procedures to secure the find were completed. He said there could be ""hazardous substances"" and there was a ""huge probability that the train is booby-trapped.""",1,365
"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny. Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?"" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory. Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory ""It's like playing Russian roulette,"" Lorna says. ""Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful. ""My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty."" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people. There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet the needs of people who use them. Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: ""There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met."" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away. ""Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,"" she says. ""You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered. ""It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all."" But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends. She said: ""Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing"" Alison even tweeted from the party: ""Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a'pop up' changingplace so ALL can go!"" Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their ""girls' days out"" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby. She said: ""Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan. Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, ""There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri"" Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement. Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem. ""By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,"" she says. ""As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this."" For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans. At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m). Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations. Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too. Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: ""There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt. ""But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience. ""They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible. ""You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.""",1,366
"Guitarist and co-songwriter Johnny Marr has released an extract from his upcoming memoir Set The Boy Free in the Guardian and said he met with former band mate Morrissey in 2008. The pair discussed the possibility, which Marr said would ""make a hell of a lot of people very happy."" But ""the distrust remained"" between the two and the idea never came to pass. Marr was back in touch with Morrissey in a ""rare period of communication"" when he was remastering The Smiths' back catalogue and they arranged to meet in a pub in south Manchester. ""I was happy to see him,"" he wrote. ""It was 10 years or more since we'd last met. We caught up with personal news and family and reminisced a bit."" But then the conversation turned to ""deeper things"" and, eventually, what Marr called ""that subject."" He wrote: ""There had been rumours for years that the Smiths were about to re-form, and they were always untrue. I had never pursued any offer. ""Suddenly we were talking about the possibility of the band re-forming, and in that moment it seemed that with the right intention it could actually be done and might even be great."" After parting company with a hug, Marr returned to his band at the time, The Cribs, and talked to them about him possibly playing some shows with The Smiths, which he hoped ""might even be better than before."" But by the time he returned from Mexico with the Cribs, Marr said, the communication had ended. ""Things went back to how they were and how I expect they always will be,"" he said. ""An air of disaffection and distrust remained between us. It was a shame.""",1,367
"Gwen Thomson, 51, from Torry, died after the accident on Market Street on Wednesday morning. Insp Jon Barron said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Gwen's family, friends and work colleagues at this very sad time."" The 60-year-old male lorry driver was uninjured. Police Scotland thanked those who helped at the scene. Insp Barron added: ""We have spoken to a number of witnesses to the incident already. However, I would urge anyone who hasn't yet been in contact with us to do so in order to help piece together exactly what happened.""",1,368

Fleetwood's compatriots Richard Bland, James Morrison and Matthew Southgate matched Fleetwood and Stenson's score.

"Burnley Empire Theatre defaulted to the care of the Duchy of Lancaster as an ""owner of last resort"" after the ownership could not be established. Last used as a bingo hall in 1995, the Cow Lane venue was recently named the fifth most at risk theatre in the UK. Campaigners who want to restore the building to its former glory said the decision was a blow to their plans. Sophie Gibson from the Burnley Empire Theatre Trust (BETT), said: ""This news came as something of a surprise and a disappointment. ""The viability study, which the council contributed to as well, is currently taking place and the results are due very shortly. ""If, as we hope, the verdict is a positive one we can then move on to stage two, the architectural planning phase for the project, when we also begin applying for funding. ""All of this could have been for nothing if it is auctioned off before we are able to get that far."" The Duchy of Lancaster, said it had been left with ""no alternative"" but to put it to bidders after offering it free of charge to both Burnley Council and the Theatre Trust - an offer that ""remains open."" A spokesman added: ""The Duchy remains hopeful that the building will remain in local ownership."" BETT said it could not yet afford the legal costs that would be incurred to take on the building. The four-storey building, designed by G. B. Rawcliffe, opened in 1894 as a music hall, before being converted to a cinema in 1938. It is to be auctioned in Manchester on 16 October.",1,370
"Sexton suffered a suspected groin injury, before O'Connell was carried off at the end of the first half. Leading 9-6 at half-time, Rob Kearney's try increased Ireland's lead before O'Mahony had to be taken off. Conor Murray added a further late try as the gutsy Irish set up a quarter-final with Argentina next Sunday. Relive the action from the game on BBC Radio 5 live Topping Pool D means Joe Schmidt's side avoid a last-eight encounter with the world champions but the injuries to three such influential members of the Irish team will be a massive concern for the rest of the campaign. There will also be fears that the outstanding Sean O'Brien could be facing a citing after he appeared to punch France lock Pascal Pape in the opening minute of the contest. With O'Connell retiring from international duty after this tournament, there will be fears that his Ireland career could be over after 108 caps. The French, blunt as an attacking force for the most part, must regroup to face the All Blacks in their quarter-final at the Millennium Stadium next Saturday evening. Ireland showed remarkable resolve to stand up to a hugely physical France side. The French, as promised, targeted ex-Racing Metro player Sexton and the Ireland fly-half was forced off in the 25th minute after a heavy tackle by Louis Picamoles, although it looked as though the Irish playmaker injured his groin kicking the ball seconds earlier. O'Connell's international career may have come to an end after he fell awkwardly as he was cleared out at a ruck in first-half injury-time, while O'Mahony was forced off 14 minutes into the second half with another leg injury. However, that came five minutes after a break by the magnificent Robbie Henshaw helped set up Kearney's crucial try. Sexton's replacement Ian Madigan produced a tremendous display after his introduction as he conclusively won his battle with France fly-half Frederic Michalak. The Irish also managed to out-scrum the French, while the performances of second-half replacements Iain Henderson and Chris Henry demonstrated the depth in Joe Schmidt's squad. However, that depth may be tested to its limits next weekend against the Pumas. A huge early tackle from Jamie Heaslip on France full-back Scott Spedding set the tone for a bone-crunching contest. Media playback is not supported on this device Michalak and Spedding missed early chances to put France ahead but Sexton did nudge the Irish ahead from 45 metres after their first move into opposition territory. Two long-range Spedding penalties - either side of another Sexton three points - levelled the contest before the tearful Ireland fly-half was forced off. The composed Madigan's first action was to restore Ireland's lead in the 28th minute but the Irish suffered second devastating injury blow in first-half injury-time after Pascal Pape clattered into O'Connell at a ruck. Late in the half, Ireland centre Keith Earls had wasted a glorious try-scoring after to take a routine pass following a searing Tommy Bowe break. But the determined Irish were not to be denied after the break. Not for the first time in the contest, Henshaw charged past France's ineffective battering ram centre Mathieu Bastareaud to put Ireland on the offensive and the resultant scrum was finished off by full-back Kearney finish. After O'Mahony's departure, a penalty from France replacement Morgan Parra cut the Irish lead to 14-9 but the excellent Murray's 72nd-minute try sealed Ireland's remarkable victory after Rory Best's initial drive for the line. There were many man of the match contenders in the Ireland team but the Tullow Tank produced a titanic display in the most bruising of contests. The Ireland flanker made 19 carries in the contest and made as many metres in the game as impressive wing Tommy Bowe. Given his injury woes, Joe Schmidt will be praying that O'Brien avoids a citing for his early indiscretion. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt: ""It felt like a dog fight at times, a real slugfest between the two packs and then it would blow wide open with both sets of backs playing some really expansive rugby with the ball going end to end. ""Over the last couple of years, it's been a one-score game between the two sides. We knew it was going to go right to the wire. You have to be patient, calm and focused and take your opportunity when it comes and the boys did that. ""There are a lot of sore bodies in that changing room. The lads were just physically and emotionally drained at the end of it and from this point on that is what you've got to give when you get the chance to wear that jersey."" France will play New Zealand in the quarter-finals at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, on Saturday 17 October, with a 20:00 BST kick-off.

"Speaking to the BBC, Thomas Thabane said he would return from South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho, ""as soon as I know I am not going to get killed."" Reports say the capital, Maseru, is now calm after soldiers seized buildings. The army denied staging a coup. Lesotho has seen a series of military coups since independence in 1966. Mr Thabane has headed a unity government since elections in May 2012, but suspended parliament sessions in June amid feuding in his coalition. He denied accusations that his actions had undermined his government. Mr Thabane said the army had rendered the government ""dysfunctional,"" an action that amounted to a coup. ""I have been removed from control not by the people but by the armed forces, and that is illegal,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. ""I came into South Africa this morning and I will return as soon as my life is not in danger. I will not go back to Lesotho to get killed."" South Africa's government described the situation as ""worrying,"" with spokesman Clayson Monyela saying the country would not tolerate ""unconstitutional change of government."" At the scene: Basildon Peta, Maseru, Lesotho This whole thing started around 03:00. There were gunshots since early morning. The city is currently calm. People are playing it safe within their homes, but there is basically a media blackout. To all intents and purposes it is a military coup with the aim of ousting the prime minister. There can be no other reason of soldiers behaving the way they have been behaving other than to seize power. So far we have no reports of killings. It would be correct to call it a bloodless coup attempt. But I am not going to stick around. The chances are the situation may deteriorate. One does not know what is going to happen. Basildon Peta is the publisher of the Lesotho Times The army is understood to have acted after the prime minister attempted to remove its chief, Lt Gen Kennedy Tlai Kamoli. The army said the general was still in charge, saying the military ""supports the democratically elected government of the day,"" Reuters news agency reported. A spokesman, Maj Ntlele Ntoi, denied staging a coup, saying: ""There is nothing like that, the situation has returned to normalcy.... the military has returned to their barracks."" Earlier, troops were seen on the streets of Maseru and there were reports of gunfire. Radio stations were taken off air and phone lines were cut, although later reports suggested they were working again.

"It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who developed the compound engine which transformed shipbuilding by allowing vessels to use fuel more efficiently and travel further. Under William Pearce from 1888, the company flourished, building luxurious ocean liners, steamers and naval ships for the world. At its peak before World War 1, the Fairfield shipyard was part of a local industry which directly employed 70,000 workers in 19 yards. The largest crane in the world, with a maximum lift capacity of 250 tons, was built at the Govan yard in 1911 and in the following year Fairfield had 12 ships under construction at the same time. The inter-war years saw a gradual decline but Clydeside's largest shipyard still built many famous ships and during wartime it was a major builder for the Royal Navy. But after World War 2, the decline set in swiftly and despite a major modernisation programme in the 1950s the yards of the Clyde were unable to compete with new shipbuilding superpowers such as Japan. By 1967 the receivers were called in and it looked as if the end had come for Fairfield and for shipbuilding in Govan. Sean Connery, at the height of his James Bond fame, made a documentary about problems besetting the yard, entitled The Bowler and the Bunnet. Among the footage of a community on the edge of oblivion was Connery riding a bicycle around empty shipyard fabrication sheds. The UK government's response to the crisis was to create the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1968, which had about 8,500 workers in five yards - Fairfield's and Stephens on the south bank, Connel's and Yarrow's on the north bank, and John Brown's at Clydebank. In 1971 UCS went into receivership and was refused a government loan. This led to one of the most famous episodes in industrial history - the work-in. The unions, led by Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie, occupied the yard and made a demand of the then Conservative prime minister Edward Heath for the ""right to work."" In February 1972, the government agreed to retain two yards, Yarrow at Scotstoun and Fairfield's at Govan. Fairfield's was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977. The government of Margaret Thatcher broke up British Shipbuilders and denationalised it in 1988, when the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kvaerner group. Kvaerner took the yard through another modernisation programme to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers. But in the late 1990s, the market became depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts. The yard passed to BAE Systems in 1999 and has found work over the past decade making destroyers and aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. BAE is a key partner in the construction of the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers being built at the Portsmouth yard and in Scotland. However, after their construction is complete, there is only expected to be the need for one centre for naval shipbuilding in the UK to build the next generation of Type 26 frigates. The Clyde aircraft carrier work is due to finish in 2015. It is still not clear where Type 26 frigates will be built. There are no other orders on books. Could the sun be setting on a long tradition of Govan shipbuilding?",1,373

His family described him as a kind, loving and selfless person who ""touched the lives of all he met."" They thanked the emergency services and the people at the roadside who tried to save Jack. In statement, they said: ""As a family we are beyond heartbroken to have tragically lost our treasured and much loved son, brother, uncle and friend to so many.""

Officers want to speak to the occupants of a silver or grey coloured pick up vehicle that overtook a white mini bus between Plas y Brenin and Penygwryd before the incident at about 07:00 BST.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Asked if Saturday's opponents have scrummaged illegally during the tournament, England head coach Eddie Jones said: ""100. Terribly illegally."" Jones says his side have a stronger scrum, adding if the laws are enforced England ""will get an advantage."" Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. ""He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger,"" said McBryde. Wales, who are one point behind Six Nations leaders England with two games remaining, felt harshly done by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup. And McBryde said loose-head Marler had been ""found out"" when England lost to Australia in their next World Cup game. ""There was a big focus on the loose-heads' angles, particularly with [Wales prop] Gethin Jenkins being highlighted,"" said McBryde. ""So we were very disappointed in that England game to fall on the wrong side of decisions and we felt the problem lay elsewhere."" However, Jones says he is ""quite upset"" by Wales' approach to the set-piece. ""They play the laws very well,"" the Australian told BBC Radio 5 live. ""They pre-engage all the time, which is against the laws of the game. ""And then they get penalised one or two times at the start of the game, but the referee gets sick of penalising it. ""Because if the referee keeps penalising it, you know what happens? The referee gets criticised. ""We really want to have a scrum contest on Saturday - it's an important part of the game - so we are really hopeful the referee enforces the law in that area."" Jones added: ""If you are the referee and you keep penalising Wales for pre-engaging, then all the smart guys in the commentators' box say'this referee is ruining the game'. ""But they are not ruining the game, it's the team that is scrummaging illegally which is ruining the game. ""So we want the referee to be really hard, and if he has to ruin the game, he has to ruin the game.""",1,375
"On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of 282m (PS195m) up from 154m last year. The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it was increasing production sent its shares up 4 in after-hours trading. Tesla had been struggling to ramp up production of its cars including its newest Model X SUV. Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016. The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year. Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product. Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in 14bn in future sales. To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production. ""Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal,"" chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors. Tesla said its capital expenditure - money spent to grow the company - would probably increase by 50. Some investors have been concerned about Tesla's cash flow. The company has been spending money to increase its manufacturing facilities. Though it has seen orders rise, the carmaker has yet to make a profit. Since the start of the year Tesla has faced some production hurdles. A shortage of parts for its Model X stalled production in January and February. On Wednesday, Tesla announced two of its manufacturing heads were stepping down from their roles. Greg Reichow, vice president of production will take a leave of absence as soon as a successor can be found. Josh Ensign, vice-president of manufacturing, is also leaving the company.",1,376
"Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he would build on the support he received at rallies to reconnect the party to voters. He rejected criticism from those who say he is mistaking the enthusiasm of his backers for wider electoral appeal. Ex-leader Neil Kinnock said Labour appeared unelectable under Mr Corbyn and faced its ""greatest crisis."" Labour will announce whether Mr Corbyn or Owen Smith have won the leadership contest on 24 September. Ahead of the vote, Mr Smith accused Mr Corbyn of seeking to ""deepen divisions"" between the party's membership - seen as overwhelmingly in favour of the leader - and its MPs - who are largely opposed to him. But asked if he would quit as leader if he thought he could not take the party to power, Mr Corbyn told Today he was ""determined"" to lead it into the next general election and said it could win. Referring to the ""diverse"" crowds of tens of thousands of people who have attended his leadership rallies in recent weeks, Mr Corbyn said they showed ""there is an interest in politics.... that then becomes surely a very strong campaigning base for the Labour movement."" He added: ""I think you'll see it begin to play out, particularly in the local elections next year and after that."" In June, 20 members of the shadow cabinet resigned, and one was sacked, over differences with Mr Corbyn. Five told the BBC on Sunday they would return if asked by Mr Corbyn should he be re-elected, while nine others said they would stand if shadow cabinet elections were revived. Mr Corbyn told Today he would ""reach out to"" Labour MPs who have opposed his leadership ""as I've reached out to them in the past."" He said: ""I have made it my business to talk to quite a lot of Labour MPs and will continue to do so and I hope they will understand that we've been elected as Labour MPs... ""It doesn't mean everybody agrees on everything all the time - that I understand - but the general direction of opposition to austerity, opposing the Tories on grammar schools, those are actually the kind of things that unite the party."" On Tuesday, Labour's national executive committee meets and will consider a plan put forward by deputy leader Tom Watson to allow the parliamentary party - its MPs and peers currently serving in Westminster - to elect the shadow cabinet, as part of efforts to reunite the party as a whole. At the moment they are appointed by the leader. Newspaper reports suggested that, under the new plan, a third of Labour's top team could be elected by the parliamentary party, another third by the party membership, and the final third chosen by the leader. Mr Corbyn has not given his support to the proposal but has indicated he would back members having a say.",1,377
"Campaigners have asked the university to reconsider the move, highlighting its ""strong record"" in educating people from disadvantaged groups. But the university says it needs to reduce costs in line with its student numbers. University and College Union (UCU) members will meet later to discuss what form the action should take. Two-thirds (67) of UCU members voted for strike action. Members of its sister union UNISON are voting in a separate ballot, closing on 22 May. Both academic and professional support workers' posts will be closed under the university's proposals. Staff and students will also lobby the university's board of governors at their general meeting on Tuesday. Campaigners argue that the university has a track record in ""providing educational opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged groups in society."" They say in the academic year starting September 2012, nearly half the students at London Met were from minority ethnic groups, compared with 16 of university students nationally. In addition, about half were from the poorest groups in society. UCU's regional official Barry Jones said: ""Nobody wants to be on strike and we remain open to sitting down to explore a better way forward than these job losses.

"Four police were wounded as they tried to arrest a man in the Bavarian town of Georgensgmuend, south of Nuremberg. The suspect, described as a member of the extremist Reichsbuerger movement, opened fire on the officers before he was eventually detained. Officials said a permit had been revoked for the 31 guns he owned. Local authorities had called in the police after the man repeatedly refused to co-operate with them. When a special forces team moved in early on Wednesday he began shooting through his door, officials said. Police confirmed the officer's death on Thursday, having announced it prematurely late on Wednesday. Another policeman is being treated for serious gunshot wounds. Two others were lightly wounded. The gunman was lightly injured in the exchange. The Reichsbuerger Reich Citizens group does not recognise the authority of the post-war German federal republic, seeing it merely as some sort of private company. It believes in the continued existence of a German empire, or Reich, dating back to 1937 or even earlier. Its roots are said to go back some three decades. Bavarian officials said the group's ideology was ""nationalist and anti-Semitic..... clearly extreme right."" Their circle had grown in recently years, they said, and included ""whingers, nutcases, conspiracy theorists, but also the far-right."" The diversity of beliefs and views within the group militates against a simple hierarchical structure or clear leadership. But the group should not be dismissed simply as an ""association of crackpots,"" said Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. Some of its members were obviously capable of brutal violence, particularly targeting representatives of the German state, he warned. Others use their rejection in the authority of the German state as grounds to refuse to pay taxes or creditors.",1,381
"The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check whether landing gear had deployed and the failure of the cabin PA system. The initial fault was caused by a loose connection the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded. Because of the landing gear problems, the pilot - flying from Ibiza last September - was forced to fly over the airport at 1,000 ft (300m) so ground crew could check if it had come down, the report said. But it was too dark to tell and the co-pilot had to look out of windows in the main cabin, before the pilot was cleared to land. As the plane taxied on the runway, passengers reportedly panicked when the smoke began to seep into the cabin. Because the PA system was not working, cabin crew tried to use a loud hailer to tell passengers but the volume button had fallen off. The escape chute then failed to deploy effectively, forcing some of the passengers to run out on to the wing before leaping onto the ground. One member of cabin crew only realised the plane was being evacuated when she saw passengers on the wing. According to the report, a problem was first spotted when the pilots realised the address system was not working. Several other failures were noticed including an equipment cooling fan, a radio, weather radar, the autobrake, power to the standby altitude indicator and compass. It was realised there was a problem with a battery connection, known as a busbar, forcing the pilots to request a quick landing at the airport. After a successful landing, passengers and crew could smell smoke but the commander could not announce a full evacuation. Since the incident, Jet2 has included a procedure within its manual which will better-prepare pilots in the event of a repeat and also reduce the chance it will result in an evacuation, the report said. The AAIB concluded all the problems - bar the escape chute - stemmed from the loose connection possibly caused by the over-tightened nut. It also noted smoke started to seep into the cabin because a fan stopped working creating a build up of dust and oil in the air conditioning. It was suggested the problem with the escape chute could be because a crew member was more used to opening a door on the opposite side of the plane.",1,382
"Galvani Bioelectronics hopes to bring a new treatment based on the technique before regulators within seven years. GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences, are behind it. Animal experiments have attached tiny silicone cuffs, containing electrodes, around a nerve and then used a power supply to control the nerve's messages. One set of tests suggested the approach could help treat type-2 diabetes, in which the body ignores the hormone insulin. They focused on a cluster of chemical sensors near the main artery in the neck that check levels of sugar and the hormone insulin. The sensors send their findings back to the brain, via a nerve, so the organ can coordinate the body's response to sugar in the bloodstream. GSK vice-president of bioelectronics Kris Famm told the BBC News website: ""The neural signatures in the nerve increase in type 2-diabetes. ""By blocking those neural signals in diabetic rats, you see the sensitivity of the body to insulin is restored."" And early work suggested it could work in other diseases too. ""It isn't just a one-trick-pony, it is something that if we get it right could have a new class of therapies on our hands,"" Mr Famm said. But he said the field was only ""scratching the surface"" when it came to understanding which nerve signals have what effect in the body. Both the volume and rhythm of the nerve signals could be having an effect rather than it being a simple case of turning the nerve on or off. And even if the approach works theoretically, a huge amount of effort will be needed to make the technology practical. The kits to hack the nerves will need to be miniaturised, customisable to different patients' nerves, durable enough to survive in the body long-term and have sufficient battery power. Dr Famm added: ""In 10 to 20 years I think there will be a set of these miniaturised precision therapies that will be available for you and me when we go to a doctor."" Verily chief technology officer Brian Otis said: ""Bioelectronic medicine is a new area of therapeutic exploration, and we know that success will require the confluence of deep disease biology expertise and new highly miniaturised technologies. ""This partnership provides an opportunity to further Verily's mission by deploying our focused expertise in low power, miniaturised therapeutics and our data analytics engine to potentially address many disease areas with greater precision with the goal of improving outcomes.""

"Oliseh, 42, who stood down as Super Eagles coach in February 2016, previously played for Dutch giants Ajax from 1997 to 1999. Since arriving at Fortuna Sittard two months ago, the former Nigeria coach has steered the club away from the relegation zone with only one defeat in nine games. it's a good challenge because there is no better way to show that you're good at this job than to pick a team that is really struggling with really unknown players ""That is great for us. And the boys keep improving. We're picking up points home and away. So I'm very pleased with the results"" Oliseh told BBC Sport. Oliseh, who also played for Juventus and Borussia Dortmund during his club career, earned 63 caps for Nigeria. He says his biggest challenge at Fortuna Sittard has been working on the team's confidence. ""It was the psychological aspect. Trying to get the players to get a winning mentality. Trying to change the psychology and make them believe in their qualities and try to get the best out of them. That was the most difficult challenge"" said Oliseh. The Nigerian's last coaching position had been with his country. He says Fortuna Sittard posed a completely different task. ""Here, it's like I had to start from zero. We practically started everything again. How we defend, how we ball-position, how we counter-transition, how we attack. All this I had to do it from zero. And the weather didn't help me. We didn't have the facilities, like sometimes we had snow. But when I see the commitment the players have put into it, it's good."" Oliseh had also previously coached Belgian lower tier side Vervietois, and he says the Fortuna job was one he could not refuse. ""It's very close to my home. So I can come home and see my kids and my wife every day. ""And it's a good challenge because there is no better way to show that you're good at this job than to pick a team that is really struggling with really unknown players. ""And it was a big risk but I felt that if I could bring them results then it becomes clear that you know your job. And so far I'm very grateful to God that it's working out that way"" explained Oliseh, who helped Nigeria win the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations and Olympic gold in 1996. Oliseh says working abroad is important for all footballers and urged Nigerian stars to embrace opportunities in China. He also says the Dutch league is perfect for Nigerian players to learn their craft. ""I think it's a league that suits us because Nigerian players are more technical and explosive. And this is a league where a lot of expression is allowed. There's room to play, there's room to attack. And a lot is done here based on tactics."" Nigerian striker Taiwo Awoniyi currently plays for Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, and Oliseh says it was good to catch up with the 19-year-old recently. ""He's one of the players I like very much. He's a very good player. I've met him and I've seen him play. Running into him was really nice. I'm a Nigerian first. And I have my country in my heart. So when I see a kid from Nigeria, it's warm."" Oliseh has been monitoring Nigeria's chances on the global stage and is optimistic about their chances of qualifying for the World Cup in Russia in 2018. After leaving his post as coach of the Super Eagles, Oliseh worked at Fifa on their new technical committee. He says the door remains open for him to continue his work with football's world body. ""I tried to arrange with them that if I'm not working here and there's an event and Fifa needs my services, that I can be available. But at the same time, I love coaching. I love working with young players. I like seeing them grow and getting results, so it's good.""",1,384

"The economic research institute questioned 320 businesses following the vote on leaving the EU. The survey found more than 60 of Scottish firms believe Brexit would have a ""negative impact"" on them. However, the institute said there was little evidence of companies cancelling investment or recruitment outright. The Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent research body based at the University of Strathclyde, carried out the survey between 5 July and 12 July, in the aftermath of the EU referendum. Just over 60 of Scottish firms surveyed said they believed Brexit will have a negative impact on their business, while only 19 said it would have a positive impact. One third said the impact would be ""very negative."" About 40 believe that leaving the EU could lead to a decrease in their investment and expansion plans, and 34 said that they could cut back on recruitment. More than 70 of firms surveyed as part of the research had done no preparation for the UK exiting the EU. Two-thirds of businesses said resolution of the uncertainty in the economy was a key issue in the negotiation of the UK's exit from the European Union, while 49 of firms cited access to the single market as a key issue. However, the survey found little evidence of companies actually cancelling investment or recruitment plans. A quarter of firms said they had made a decision to change their investment and recruitment plans, though the vast majority - 95 - said that decisions had been postponed rather than cancelled entirely. Prof Graeme Roy, director of the institute, said: ""This is the first hard survey evidence post-referendum of what businesses in Scotland are thinking and how they are responding to the unexpected EU referendum result. ""A clear majority believe that the impact - certainly in the short to medium term - will be negative. The survey offers some evidence that investment and recruitment plans may be being put on hold. ""Resolving the current political and economic uncertainty must now be the key priority. The longer the period of uncertainty continues, the more damaging the impact will be on the economy.""",1,386

"The England skipper hit a run-a-ball 92 at Headingley, with James Taylor and Ben Stokes both scoring 41. David Willey had earlier reduced Australia to 30-3 with the new ball before they recovered to post 299-7. Glenn Maxwell, who was dropped on 6 and 35, top-scored with 85 off 64 balls. The Australia all-rounder also took two stunning catches but his efforts were not enough to prevent England overhauling a score of 300 or more for only the fourth time in their one-day international history. Their previous best ODI run-chase against Australia was 270-4 at Lord's in 1997. It was England's second successive victory, after they also won at Old Trafford on Tuesday, and means the hosts can still send Australia home defeated across all formats after they won the Ashes 3-2 and the solitary Twenty20 international by five runs. Morgan anchored England's run-chase perfectly with his eighth score of 50 or more in his last nine innings. Jason Roy and Taylor had shared a first-wicket partnership of 72 off 53 balls but England's progress stalled when both were dismissed in quick succession. Morgan, however, slowly rebuilt the innings as he took 40 balls to score his first 20 runs before slowly accelerating. He hit John Hastings for a straight six which landed on the roof of the adjacent rugby stadium as he thumped eight fours and two maximums before being caught at backward point by Maxwell's stunning one-handed catch. Although Morgan appeared disappointed not to have finished the job, his brilliant innings took England to 238-5 with more than 10 overs remaining. Some big hitting from Liam Plunkett and Willey, plus a steady hand from Moeen Ali, saw England home with 10 balls to spare. Morgan is the highest scorer in the series but only just ahead of Taylor, who followed up his century at Old Trafford with a counter-attacking 41 off 42 balls. He hit eight boundaries in his innings - compared to just five in his career-best 101 in Manchester earlier this week - and displayed a different side to his game before chasing a ball down the leg side and being acrobatically caught by Matthew Wade. Taking on the fast bowlers, he was particularly strong through the off side as he cut and drove impressively to seize the early initiative back from Australia following the early loss of Alex Hales for a two-ball duck. Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Taylor has now done enough to justify selection on the tour of the UAE to play Pakistan next month. ""I think they've got to take him,"" said Vaughan. ""Taylor plays spin differently to many England players, using his feet well. ""He hasn't faced brilliant spin in this series, but he's played it in a good fashion, and he's looked good against the quick bowlers. He's read situations well, and that's what he'd have to do at five in Test cricket."" Willey, who will play for Yorkshire next season after deciding to leave Northants this summer, was superb with the new ball in the absence of the injured Chris Woakes and the rested Steven Finn. The left-armer started by swinging the white ball into the right-handers' pads - dismissing Joe Burns (played on) and Steve Smith (lbw) cheaply - before occasionally running it across the batsmen. That created doubt in the minds of Australia's batsmen and Aaron Finch was the next to go when he edged behind to Jonny Bairstow. Willey and Moeen were the pick of the England bowlers, with Australia failing to score a run off 50 of the latter's deliveries. However, the hosts' familiar problems at the back end of an innings resurfaced, with Australia smashing 77 off the last six overs. Both Willey and his fellow opening bowler Mark Wood bowled too full, allowing Wade and Hastings to get under the ball and plunder enough boundaries to take Australia from 215-7 in the 42nd over to 299-7 when their innings closed. It was not just Willey who impressed at Headingley, with another honorary Yorkshireman dazzling the crowd with some fantastic cricket. Maxwell, who is nicknamed The Big Show and has played for Yorkshire as an overseas player this summer, displayed some fantastic reverse-sweeps with the bat as well as also launching Adil Rashid for two huge sixes. However, he saved his show-stopping best for the end of England's run chase when he produced an incredible boundary catch to end Plunkett's entertaining late cameo. He caught the ball with both feet off the ground but, aware he was going to step over the rope, flicked the ball up with his right hand and then caught it in his left as he re-entered the playing area in front of the Western Terrace. His athletic best could not deny England though, and it is Morgan's side who have the momentum heading back to Old Trafford on Sunday.",1,388
"Charlene Walker, 36, suffered a single stab wound at the Darlington home of Julie Gowling in December. The 44-year-old tried to cover up the killing and dispose of the weapon, a kitchen knife, by burying it in a garden, Teesside Crown Court heard. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told the mother-of-four she must serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The court heard Gowling, who had denied murder, got into a heated argument with Ms Walker - a known drug user - over the missing cash on 6 December. It ended when Gowling lost her temper and stabbed Ms Walker in the chest. She then fled the house and tried to dispose of the knife. The court was told Ms Walker died as a result of massive blood loss. After the hearing, Det Supt Dave Ashton, of Durham Police, said: ""Our condolences go to the family of Charlie Walker who, since her death have shown nothing but dignity and courage.

Do Europeans still feel welcome? Bristol resident challenges racism with roses Mr Cameron said ""we have a fundamental responsibility to bring our country together"" after the vote. ""And we will not stand for hate crime or these kinds of attacks. They must be stamped out,"" he said. He said there would be ""no immediate change"" in the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, or UK citizens living in EU countries. Since the vote, there have been reports of racism on social media, and a number of groups have reported a rise in incidents of racism and hate crime. True Vision, a police-funded online reporting facility for hate crime, said it had received 85 reports between Thursday 23 and Sunday 26 June compared with 54 reports during the same period last month. In London, the Metropolitan Police are investigating graffiti at a Polish community building in Hammersmith which they are treating as a hate crime ""because of the racially-aggravated nature of the criminal damage."" Cambridgeshire Police are also investigating reports that laminated cards reading ""Leave the EU - no more Polish vermin"" were delivered to members of the Polish community in Huntingdon on Saturday. Poland's ambassador to the UK Witold Sobkow said he was ""shocked and deeply concerned by the recent incidents of xenophobic abuse directed against the Polish community and other UK residents of migrant heritage."" The full picture regarding hate crime after a Brexit vote could take months to emerge. And the national trend in recent years has been quite complicated. Police-recorded hate crimes have been rising - but that could be more victims coming forward because they have confidence police will take them seriously. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, an internationally-recognised rolling study of the bigger picture, suggests racism is slowly being pushed to the margins. But there's no doubt that genuine moments of extreme national or global tension - such as major terrorist incidents or the conflict in the Middle East - are followed by spikes. Extremists appear to take the opportunity to act because they think they can get away with it. So the question is this: are the latest statistics a blip or a sign of a more worrying long-term trend? Iman Etta, of Tell Mama UK, which collates reports of anti-Muslim abuse, said: ""We've seen a spike in anti-Muslim hatred incidents and racist incidents reported in to us that are related to the result of the referendum, where perpetrators have been using words like'we voted you out','you should be kicked out', and'we no longer want you here'."" Muslim Remain campaigner Shazia Awan, a former Conservative parliamentary candidate, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire she had received several abusive tweets and emails. One email read: ""You are not now, nor will you ever be, Welsh. Being born in Wales has nothing to do with being Welsh. ""I cannot wait to send you and the anti-white garbage that you stand for back to the Third World dumps that you came from."" The Muslim Council of Britain said it had compiled more than 100 incidents of reported hate crimes since the result. Dr Shuja Shafi, the body's secretary general, said: ""Now we are witnessing the shocking extent of this with reports around the country of hate speech and minorities being targeted. ""Our country is experiencing a political crisis which, I fear threatens the social peace."" He said he would be writing to the home secretary to ask what measures were being taken to step up security and policing in areas where such incidences have been reported. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he had asked the capital's Metropolitan Police to be on heightened alert for any rise in hate crime. ""I take seriously my responsibility to defend London's fantastic mix of diversity and tolerance,"" he said. ""So it's really important we stand guard against any rise in hate crimes or abuse by those who might use last week's referendum as cover to seek to divide us."" He added it was important not to demonise the 1.5 million people in London who voted for Brexit, and they should not be accused ""of being xenophobic or racist."" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said officers would ""investigate vigorously any reports of crime motivated by hatred."" Karen Bradley, the minister for preventing abuse, exploitation and crime, said ""nobody in this country should live in fear because of who they are."" ""The government is working closely with communities to increase reporting and increase confidence that their concerns about hate crime will be taken seriously by the police and courts,"" she said. No official statistics for reported incidents or racism or hate crime across the UK have yet been published. They are compiled by individual police forces. The MP for Birmingham Yardley, Jess Phillips, has tweeted that she will ask a Parliamentary question on the issue. However, numerous people have posted accounts of personal experiences on Twitter alongside the hashtag PostRefRacism.

This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. ""A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,"" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom ""knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial."" Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his ""evil"" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: ""It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body."" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: ""This is not one of them."" ""If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,"" he said. US officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land. According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine. However, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture: ""US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine. ""To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.""",1,395
"It is being performed at Curve theatre in Leicester, the city where Townsend lived and where the book is set. The writer worked on the musical before her death last April and her family have given their blessing to the production going ahead. There will be more than 30 performances over the next four weeks. The author's family were at Curve for the opening night. Her husband, Colin Broadway, said his wife had been ""thrilled"" to be working on the musical during 2012-14. The role of Adrian is being shared by Lewis Andrews, Sebastian Croft, Joel Fossard-Jones and Toby Murray. The roles of Pandora, Nigel and Barry are each being shared by three actors. This has meant everything has needed rehearsing four times.

"Systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had been affected for more than a week. Staff had been forced to carry out some tasks on paper. However, the hospital's chief executive Allen Stefanek, said that the incident had not affected the delivery or quality of patient care. Ransomware is a form of malware which infects a victim's computer, locking it, and demanding that a ransom - often in bitcoins - be paid in order to restore access. Previously, local news sources had reported that the hackers were demanding a ransom payment of 3.4m - but Mr Stefanek denied this. ""The amount of ransom requested was 40 bitcoins, equivalent to approximately 17,000,"" he wrote. ""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key."" All systems currently in use had been cleared of malware and thoroughly tested, he added. Ransomware attacks are increasingly common. Last year, security firm Kaspersky acknowledged what it said was a ""bitter fact"" - ""unless precautions are taken, victims may not be able to recover their data in any other way than by paying the demanded ransom."" However, when the English county council for Lincolnshire was faced with a PS350 ransomware demand last month, it refused to pay. The council has since told the BBC that all systems have been restored without having to pay off the hackers.",1,397
"The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. ""I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football,"" Rae told BBC Scotland. ""I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. ""Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things."" Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. ""The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline,"" added Rae. ""The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell]."" ""He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged."" The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. ""The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in,"" he said. ""The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure."" The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace. As a youngster Clark was an exciting talent with the club he loved, Newcastle United. He represented England at schoolboy and at under-21 level. He enjoyed a very successful career - twice finishing as a Premier League runner-up with the Magpies and also played in the top flight with Fulham. Lee McCulloch and Peter Leven are staying on as Killie coaches and Rae thinks Clark will rely heavily on his new Scottish lieutenants. ""These boys know the personnel and also the division,"" explained Rae. ""The one thing about Lee is he is a motivator. He gets his teams at it. I have played against his Huddersfield - excellent back in the day. He will bring a lot to the table.""",1,398
"The Wikileaks co-founder sought asylum at London's Ecuadorean embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. UK officials said the bill for policing the embassy, which stands at PS12m (18.8m; EUR16.8m), was ""unacceptable."" Earlier, Swedish prosecutors dropped two sex assault claims against Mr Assange, who had denied the claims. Mr Assange still faces the more serious accusation of rape, which he also denies. The British Ambassador in Quito, Ecuador's capital, is to make the formal protest to the Ecuadorean government on Thursday. ""Ecuador must recognise that its decision to harbour Mr Assange more than three years ago has prevented the proper course of justice.... It is completely unacceptable that the British taxpayer has had to foot the bill for this abuse of diplomatic relations,"" said Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire. Mr Swire said the UK ""continues to have a legal obligation"" to extradite Mr Assange over the rape allegation. ""I have instructed our ambassador in Quito to reiterate to Ecuador that the continuing failure.... to bring this situation to an end, is being seen as a growing stain on the country's reputation,"" he added. Full timeline Julian Assange profile Mr Assange sought asylum three years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden, fearing he would then be sent to the US and put on trial for releasing secret American documents. The UK has paid for policing around the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, for the past three years. The formal protest comes after Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation into an allegation of sexual molestation and an accusation of unlawful coercion against Mr Assange because they ran out of time to question him. An additional alleged incident of sexual molestation will be ""time barred"" - that is, time will run out to question Mr Assange - on 18 August. The Swedish statement also said an allegation of rape was due to expire on 17 August 2020, but that investigation would continue. The alleged events took place in August 2010. Mr Assange said he was ""extremely disappointed,"" adding the Swedish prosecutor had avoided hearing his side of the story. Under Swedish law, charges cannot be laid without interviewing the suspect. ""There was no need for any of this. I am an innocent man. I haven't even been charged,"" said Mr Assange. ""From the beginning I offered simple solutions. Come to the embassy to take my statement or promise not to send me to the United States. This Swedish official refused both. She even refused a written statement."" However, Sweden's director of public prosecution said a request to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy had been submitted but permission was yet to be granted. Marianne Nye said she still hoped to arrange an interview as there were ""ongoing negotiations"" between Sweden and Ecuador. One of Mr Assange's lawyers, Helena Kennedy, said: ""Julian Assange has spent more time incarcerated in the small rooms of the embassy, with no access to fresh air or exercise and contrary to international law, than he could ever spend in a Swedish prison on these allegations."" Mr Assange's mother Christine said: ""I have privately shed many tears for many years - the terrible injustice of it all.""

"It has emerged that an original crash barrier was removed, even though the Roads Service could not find out why it had been put there in the first place. It had been in place following a fatal crash in 1977. It was removed three weeks before Enda Dolan died after he was hit by a van on the Malone Road last October. According to documents received through a Freedom of Information request made by the BBC, officials from the DRD Roads Service - now called Transport NI - ordered the barrier to be removed, even though they were unable to find out why it had been originally put there. The documents show communication between officials discussing the barrier. One asked: ""Have you been able to find out why this barrier is at this location? I would like some more background before we remove it."" Another official replied: ""We have not been able to find anyone who knows the history of why it was installed."" The barrier was later removed and not replaced. According to a newspaper report from 1977, the barrier was erected at the bend following the death of two girl students in a car accident. The headline on the story from then reads: ""Barrier plan where two girls died."" Jim Beggs, who lives in the area, said the DRD would have found out the history of the crash site if they had asked him. He said: ""There are people living in this street for 40 years. The people in this street know about the horrible accident that took place in 1977, a result of which the barrier was put in place. They did not ask me."" Since Enda Dolan's death, his family, students at Queen's University, where the 18-year-old was studying, and politicians have all called for the barrier to be reinstated, fearing another tragic accident. The DRD has said arrangements are now being made to install new safety measures at the spot where the County Tyrone teenager was knocked down. However, the barrier will not be replaced like-for-like. The kerb will be raised to deflect any traffic away from the pavement and a new waist-high fence will also be built. A DRD spokesperson said: ""Arrangements are now being made to put in safety measures at this location. This will take the form of a high containment kerb and vision panel guardrail. This work will be completed as quickly as possible. ""Detailed costs of the proposed works are currently being worked up in conjunction with the detailed design."" UKIP MLA David McNarry, who sits on the DRD committee at Stormont, said it will be looking for answers. He said: ""If the barrier was put there in the first place, it had to be there for a reason.""

""I would like nothing more than to be working on television and in film in this country,"" said the 31-year-old. Jumbo compared her experience with US drama The Good Fight and its predecessor The Good Wife with her role in ITV drama Vera.

"Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup. Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation. We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco ""We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco,"" said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa. ""We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."" Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began. The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead. Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from 1m (PS675,000) to 50,000 (PS34,000). Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare. The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. ""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport. Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption. ""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi. ""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."" ""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected. ""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."" Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. ""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi. ""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F. Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.",1,413

"Mr Poots made the comments on the BBC's Nolan Live on Wednesday night. Speaking to Sinn Fein's Alex Maskey, Mr Poots said: ""We'll do business with you because it's in the interests of Northern Ireland. ""We have peace in Northern Ireland, so we'll hold our noses and do business with you."" He added: ""I do not like doing business with Sinn Fein. I hold my nose about what has gone on in the past, about the activities of the IRA over 25 years, of the murders that took place and there's a stench that still rises from that in many homes across Northern Ireland."" Mr Maskey said the comments had shown Mr Poots in his ""true colours"" However, speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, Mr Poots said ""many people across Northern Ireland find it appalling that Sinn Fein are in government."" ""They have an association with the IRA, who committed over 2,000 murders in Northern Ireland, and that's something that's very hard for all of us to accept, but we do it because we want to ensure there aren't thousands more people lose their lives as the result of Troubles in Northern Ireland in the years to come,"" he said. ""Whenever I look across the benches at Stormont, I see people who have been charged and convicted and served lengthy prison sentences for the most heinous of crimes, and that is not the case for republicans. ""I work with those people because they have got a mandate, but that doesn't mean I have to like it."" Speaking on the Nolan Show, the DUP's Simon Hamilton said he ""understood entirely"" what Mr Poots had meant. ""I think my generation maybe didn't suffer as much as others did during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, but that doesn't mean that I don't forget what the IRA did,"" he said. ""But I have a family of my own now and I don't want them to grow up into the sort of Northern Ireland that many people had to live through in the 70s and 80s and because of that I'm prepared to work with, and my party is prepared to work with, Sinn Fein who have a mandate from the electorate. ""I know what Edwin meant when he talked about a stench and it is that legacy of violence, IRA violence, down through the 70s and 80s and into the 90s that left a lot of people dead, left a lot of people injured."" Mr Hamilton, the health minister, has come under criticism recently over the DUP's policy of keeping its ministers in office for only a few hours each week while talks continue to resolve the current Stormont crisis. Asked about his position, he said he would resume his duties for one day next week.",1,415

"Mr Kalashnikov had been involved in the ""anti-Maidan"" protests in support of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych. It is not clear if he was murdered or committed suicide. Police say an investigation has been launched. At least eight Yanukovych allies have died suddenly in the last three months. Most of the deaths are said to have been suicides. However, officials say it was possible some were killed or forced to take their lives. Commentators in Ukraine have accused supporters, as well as opponents, of the current pro-Western government of involvement in the deaths. The BBC's David Stern in Kiev says no motive has emerged linking the deaths and no arrests have been made. Mr Kalashnikov was a former deputy in parliament and a member of Mr Yanukovych's Party of Regions. Accounts of his death differ, with some sources saying his body was found outside his flat in Kiev and others saying it was found within. Mr Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February last year, after months of increasingly violent protests against him, centred on the Maidan, Kiev's main square. He later reappeared in Russia. The government that succeeded him reversed his opposition to closer ties with the European Union - a major factor behind the protests. It has since been plunged into a conflict with pro-Russian separatist rebels in the country's east.",1,417
"It was discovered by a passing police patrol near Holy Cross Boys' Primary School in Ardoyne in the early hours of Sunday morning. Ch Supt Chris Noble said the device was ""sizeable"" and an attempt by dissident republicans to kill police officers. He said the lives of the local community had also been put at risk. ""There's no doubt that device was there to try and kill community police officers on the beat in their local area but also it was left in such a reckless manner and in such a reckless location that it would undoubtedly have led to the death or serious injury of a member of the public had it exploded anywhere near them,"" he said. ""This is an attempt, we believe, by violent dissident republicans to kill police officers but it was also very much an ""anti-community act"" as well, in terms of where it was located and the way in which it was left."" About 20 residents had to leave their homes during the security operation and were given shelter in a nearby community centre. The senior officer said they included ""very distressed young children"" as well as elderly residents and people with ""significant disabilities."" They have since been allowed to return home. Northern Ireland Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, said: ""I am sickened by this incident with dissident republican terrorists placing a bomb close to a primary school in north Belfast. ""This shows their wanton disregard for human life, potentially putting children in danger. ""The consequences could have been utterly devastating and it shows them for what they really are."" North Belfast MP, Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said: ""Those who constructed and planted this device clearly have no regard for any human life. ""Such a device could have caused devastation and we must all pay tribute to the work of those who have made the scene safe."" The Sinn Fein North Belfast MLA, Gerry Kelly, also condemned those who had left the bomb in the area. ""Those who are involved in this need to get off the people's backs and they need to go away,"" he said. ""The message is as simple and straightforward as that, we could have been dealing with death here, thankfully, we're not."" SDLP councillor Paul McCusker said the incident had caused distress to those living in the area. ""In total there were over 20 homes evacuated,"" he said. ""One young girl, a six-year-old, you could see the fear when you were speaking to her and she said [was] woken up by her mum and had to leave the house. ""She told me she actually thought she was dreaming and her and her mum were very frightened.""

"John Fell, from Cumbria, is confident his 1.5kg ostrich egg covered in meat will earn him a Guinness World Record. The existing record was set in 2008 in a London hotel when the snack produced weighed in at just over 6kg. Mr Fell, Calderbridge, used 10kg of sausage meat and 1.5kg of breadcrumbs - about five loaves' worth. It took him seven hours to cook his giant snack - the Ostrich egg was boiled for two hours and it took another three hours to cook the meat. His attempt in a chip shop in Leith, Edinburgh, was filmed by Scottish television and watched by an official record monitor, with each stage carefully documented. Mr Fell said: ""I am a judge in a competition entitled the Egg Awards 2014 - we support local egg producers, and encourage people not to buy supermarket eggs. ""This is to promote local eggs. But ironically the egg used had to come from Mexico as I couldn't track any down in England. ""About 60 people watched me cook the egg and helped us eat it - it was nice - the meat was based on an old Cumberland sausage recipe."" He now has to wait six weeks to find out whether his enormous savoury delicacy will be officially classed as a record-breaker.",1,419

""The whole place just seemed a little but flat in the first half and I asked them to get on the front foot a bit quicker and it looked really exciting after the break. ""Newport are a side that John Sheridan's got well-organised, they came here tonight to get the point they wanted and it was a fantastic finish for them. ""Sometimes you've got to hold your hands up when someone puts one in the stanchion from 30 yards."" Newport manager John Sheridan: ""I think Oxford were the better side and put us on the back foot for a lot of the second half, but I was very pleased with the way we played first half.

"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must change and safeguards are needed. The Rugby Football Union said steps had been taken to make the sport safer. The RFU says the physical and social benefits that rugby offers to children ""massively outweigh any potential drawbacks"" and that myriad safety measures are already in place. These include the provision of a safe environment through investment in pitches and facilities, ensuring adequate first aid and medical facilities, and fully training coaches in methods to prevent injuries to young players. Ministers also want to see more children taking up sport. In 2012, then Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt announced a plan to link up thousands of schools with rugby clubs. But Prof Pollock fears there are not enough safety checks and measures to support this, meaning children could get hurt. She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis. She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players. Each season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch. Some injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability. Most rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed. But scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal. Concussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns. Some injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011. He collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries. Prof Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works. ""Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known,"" she said. She added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries. The RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested. An RFU spokesman said: ""We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game. ""Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact. ""Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18."" A government spokesman said: ""Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it. ""The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork.""",1,421
"The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The White House said North Korea should ""focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations."" The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. ""We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made,"" he said. ""We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments."" Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009. Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year. A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex. But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there. The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons ""in quality and quantity."" It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with ""nuclear weapons any time."" However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear. Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim. North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces. The two Koreas remain technically at war, because the war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.",1,422

"Age Scotland says official figures suggest that each year about 8,640 people in Scotland wait longer than six weeks for a council care assessment. The average ""worst case"" is between two weeks and five months, with the longest delay of 18 months recorded in 201415. Cosla, the umbrella body for local councils, declined to comment. Age Scotland's research, compiled using freedom of information requests, found significant variations across councils in the time taken to carry out assessments. Under national guidelines, people should wait no longer than six weeks for care services to be provided after an assessment has taken place. Age Scotland found that about 10 of people were not provided with services within the six-week limit over the past three years. The charity said its research suggested that about 3,000 elderly people each year wait longer than six weeks for services to be put in place. Most councils do not record the reasons why delays occur, but many cited instances where delays were caused by the person being admitted to hospital or waiting for a place in their chosen care home. Staff shortages, financial constraints and delays in adapting homes were also cited. Age Scotland received freedom of information responses from 25 out of 32 councils. Chief executive Keith Robson said: ""These are deeply concerning figures showing thousands of older people facing delays in the care provision they need being put in place. ""It also means payments for free personal care they are entitled to are not being received. ""This confirms the experiences of a number of older people and their families who have been in touch with Age Scotland's helpline to tell us their experiences of delays in the system. ""As we look to local authority elections next month, Age Scotland has contacted council candidates across Scotland to ask them to ensure providing high-quality health and social care services is made an urgent priority by new administrations.""",1,424
"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that flamingos employ no active muscular effort when they're unipedal, meaning they are also expending less energy. A passive mechanism is engaged in the one-legged position, allowing flamingos to stand proud while having a doze. Previously, researchers had wondered whether the one-legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue, as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other. Other teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature. Now, Prof Young-Hui Chang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, and Lena H Ting, of Atlanta's Emory University, have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick. The researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds. Amazingly, they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one-legged without any external support. In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, they describe this phenomenon as a ""passive gravitational stay mechanism."" ""If you look at the bird from the front, while they're standing on one leg, the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward. That's the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism,"" Prof Chang told BBC News. However, dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs, suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture: ""If you tilt it to the vertical, like you would if you were standing on two legs, the whole thing disengages,"" said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech. The researchers also studied live birds, and showed that when they were standing one-legged and resting, they hardly moved at all - underlining the stability of this passive position. However, the birds did sway somewhat when the one-legged posture was combined with an activity, such as grooming or calling out. Prof Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood - this is the next step in the team's research. But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking. ""A lock would imply that it's fixed in both directions. What we found is that it's fixed in one direction, but flexible in the other direction, so we call it a'stay' rather than a'lock'. It's more akin to a doorstop,"" he told me. Dr Matthew Anderson, an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph's University in Philadelphia, described the team's results as a ""significant step forward."" The researcher, who was not involved with the latest study, added: ""They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg. Importantly, these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question, and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg."" Dr Anderson's own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat. Among other things, his team found that the number of birds resting on one leg falls as temperatures rise. ""Providing evidence of the mechanism that supportsallows for the behaviour to occur does not necessarily provide insight into why it happens in the first place."" Follow Paul on Twitter.",1,425
"The ""surprising find"" in Avebury, which is 30m (98ft) wide, is thought to be one of the site's earliest structures. The square of megaliths appears to have been erected around the remains of a Neolithic house, which sat at the centre of the colossal stone circle - the largest in Europe. Archaeologists have hailed the discovery ""unheard of."" For more archaeological digs and historical findings from around England follow our Pinterest board Dr Mark Gillings, from the University of Leicester, said in their ""wildest dreams"" they had not been expecting to find what he has described as a ""stone square circle."" The discovery comes 80 years after the archaeologist and marmalade magnate, Alexander Keiller, discovered a line of standing stones near the 6m (19ft) upright stone known as the obelisk. The vast 330m (1,082ft) wide stone circle of Avebury was built between about 2850 BC and 2200 BC. Containing three stone circles and boasting 100 huge standing stones originally, it has been the subject of considerable archaeological interest since the 17th century. The discovery of previously unknown megaliths inside the monument has been greeted as a ""great surprise."" ""We have detected and mapped a series of prehistoric standing stones that were subsequently hidden and buried,"" Dr Gillings said. ""Together, these reveal a striking and apparently unique square megalithic monument within the Avebury circles that has the potential to be one of the very earliest structures on this remarkable site."" Dr Joshua Pollard, from the University of Southampton, said their geophysical survey had ""finally completed"" Keiller's work. ""It has shown the line of stones he identified was one side of a square of megaliths about 30m across and enclosing the obelisk,"" he said. ""Megalithic circles are well known from the time when Avebury was built, but square megalithic settings of this scale and complexity are unheard of."" The archaeologists think the stone square might commemorate and monumentalise the ""ancestral house of the first people who lived in Avebury."" If proved correct, it may help to explain why the Avebury monument complex was built.",1,426

"Media playback is not supported on this device Belgium, ranked second in the world, are the next test for Chris Coleman's side as they look to continue their remarkable progress in France. Legendary Wales strikers Dean Saunders and John Hartson, who between them won 126 caps and scored 36 goals for their country, explain how Wales can win and book a place in the semi-finals. Media playback is not supported on this device Saunders: Belgium are going to dominate possession, which is fine, but we have got to stop them from hurting us - that is difficult because they have so many different weapons in their attack. We will have to close down Kevin de Bruyne, who has been playing behind Romelu Lukaku and has got a stinging shot in him on either foot, but if Eden Hazard is fit then he will be Belgium's most dangerous player. When we beat Belgium in Cardiff in June, Coleman kept Hazard quiet by bringing in Jazz Richards at right wing-back and moving Chris Gunter infield to be the right-sided centre-half in our back three. Between them, they handled him really well down Belgium's left, but I don't see Chris doing the same this time because continuity has been a big part of why we have done so well in France, especially at the back where we have been unchanged in all four games. Media playback is not supported on this device I can see Chris sticking with the same team that started against Northern Ireland, but our right-sided defensive midfielder - either Joe Allen or Joe Ledley - will have to get across to help Gunter as soon as Hazard gets the ball, along with James Chester, the right-sided centre-half. Their job will be to stop Hazard from coming inside and to show him down the line instead. When that happens, Gunter will also try to stop the cross from coming in, but you have to be realistic - Hazard is so good, he is going to get some balls over. So all our midfield players will have to pick their runners up around the box, not just De Bruyne, and the most important thing will be to mark Lukaku tightly because he will be trying to get between our other two centre-halves when the cross comes in. Media playback is not supported on this device Saunders: When we clear those crosses, we have got to counter-attack like I know we can do, because while Hazard's attacking play is one of Belgium's strengths, it is also a weakness. Jan Vertonghen's injury means we do not know who will play as Belgium's left-back against Wales but, whoever it is, we will be able to isolate them because Hazard does not run back. Hungary did it effectively, and they do not have the same attacking threat as us. The mistake they made was leaving their wide players too far up the pitch and that allowed Hazard to hurt them more - he was on fire in that game and Belgium should have won by more than 4-0. After watching that game again on Wednesday, though, I now have a clearer picture of what Wales will have to do to win. There is no way we will be as open as Hungary were from the start because we have so many unselfish and disciplined players like Allen and Ledley who do a lot of running just to support our defenders and ensure we do not lose our shape. But, when we steal the ball back, we have to use it properly. That starts with the first header clear from one of those Hazard crosses. I would be telling Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey to drift over to Belgium's left where they will have space - and the aim should be to get the ball to them and build the attack from there. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: There is a decision to be made up front because Hal Robson-Kanu played in both games against Belgium in the qualifiers and did not let us down. Hal is very mobile and gives us a threat in behind their defence with his pace, and he can also carry the ball better than Sam Vokes can. Sam is a big centre-forward that you can hit the ball to, and he will keep hold of it. He has a similar role to the one I had up front for Wales - winning headers and winning fouls so the team can advance up the pitch. It depends which way Chris wants to go, but Sam has started the past two games and I don't think he has done an awful lot wrong. He will contain both of Belgium's centre-halves like he did against Russia and give them problems in the air and on the ground - you cannot get around him. Media playback is not supported on this device Sam missed a good chance against Northern Ireland but the next one he gets like that, he will put it away. I have worked with him and I know how good he is. I also think he will now be feeling like the Wales number nine, not a bit-part player, which is something else I can relate to. At first I was always behind Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Dean Saunders, but when Hughes became manager he made me first choice and my confidence went through the roof. I took on the mantle of being the main striker and I think Sam is in that position now, as an important member of this team. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: Coleman has got pretty much every tactical and selection issue right at this tournament so far but we have to appreciate how good this Belgium team is and what an incredible victory this would be. For it to happen, we need to have total focus at the back and we will rely on our best two players again - Ramsey and Bale, who have been involved in every Wales goal at this tournament - if we are going to score. I am optimistic we can get through, but I would not say I was overly confident about it because watching Belgium the other night was frightening, even if it was only against Hungary. One big factor in our favour is that we are unbeaten in our past three meetings, including a win - so we do know how to get a result against them. Saunders: Belgium are favourites for a reason but we have a good record against them, even going back to when I was in the team. Wales have a winning formula and Bale is part of that. He is a proper match-winner and, for me, the best player in the tournament. With him in the team, anything is possible.

And suddenly this whole little carriage was talking about their injuries, which was remarkable. ""When I got off the Tube, I was so excited. Chatting to strangers gives you such a buzz because there's that element of fear before you talk to someone. ""So I walked from Brockley station back to my house, singing into my phone. And I've got this really funny voice note, which is like,'I'm getting high on humans! Later, Josephine sent the melody to her musical partner, Anthony West, saying, ""We have to write a song about this tomorrow."" ""I just sent a text back saying,'You're crazy, he laughs, but the demo was worked up into a full song, High on Humans, which features on the band's upcoming second album, Ultralife. Like her Tube journey, the song tingles with nervous energy, capturing that extraordinary feeling of connecting with other people; a theme that runs through the record. The duo were moved to write about ""what it means to be a human in this day and age"" after a head-spinning two years, in which their music became an online phenomenon, resulting in a record deal and a tour that ran to more than 200 shows around the world. The success caught them completely off guard. Oh Wonder was conceived as a songwriting project, whereby the two musicians could subsidise their solo careers by giving songs to other artists. In September 2014, they created a Soundcloud page and, prompted to describe themselves, wrote: ""Writing duo, one song a month."" ""We thought it was a good way to build up a portfolio over a year,"" explains Josephine. Then their first song, Body Gold, amassed 100,000 plays in just three days. ""We thought it was a fluke,"" says Anthony. ""But then we uploaded something the next month, and the same thing happened. And it just kept snowballing. ""On the first of every month, we'd go to a little coffee shop and just release a song and thousands of people would play it. It was amazing. It was the best year ever."" Initially, they stayed incognito - partly because of their mantra ""it's about the art, not the artist,"" but mainly because of Josephine's injuries. ""I had no teeth,"" she grimaces. ""It was a really ill-timed accident."" ""For a while, she had a little lisp,"" adds Anthony, who had to edit all of his partner's vocals to remove the erroneous ""esses."" Recording on a budget of just PS200, they hit upon a vocal style where both musicians sing in unison, with Josephine's voice in the centre, and Anthony singing twice, once in the left ear and once in the right. The technique was actually a happy accident - they'd recorded two sets of vocals so the songs could be pitched to both male and female artists, but their managers advised them to blend the two takes, and it became Oh Wonder's unique sonic signature. Fans, it seemed, couldn't get enough of it. ""Because we released a song a month over a long period, our fans had a year of their lives soundtracked by our music,"" says Josephine. ""Rather than just,'Oh, I really like that song you did,' we get,'You released that song when I was at university or I had moved to a different country'. We get the most heart-warming stories. Hundreds a week."" Anthony recalls a gig in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where a 50-year-old woman approached the band to express her gratitude for the band's music. Her son, who had recently died of cancer, had been a fan. In his final months, they would wait on tenterhooks for every new release. ""When he died, she was with him and they were listening to his favourite song,"" says Anthony. ""And she said,'I thank you so much because now, when I listen to that song, my son is there with me. Stories like that helped alleviate the drudgery and loneliness of touring - ""when you go from 3,000 people screaming your name to being back in the dressing room, on your own, eating a yoghurt."" Being whisked around the world has changed the two musicians in ways they never expected. ""I've found that I've become fiercely loyal now,"" says Josephine. ""If someone has an engagement party and I've said I will be there, I will cancel everything, even if it really compromises things, in order to make it."" And that, in a nutshell, is what Ultralife - both the album and its title track - is about. ""You and I will both have days where we're really sad, like,'it's Friday night and I'm in on my own and there's no food in the fridge and I'm miserable, says Josephine. ""And the next day you wake up and you're like,'I feel fantastic, I feel so liberated and empowered and I have loads of mates and it's incredible.' ""Ultralife is the word we use to symbolise the someone or something in your life that pulls you out of those trickier moments and into the celebratory, ultra version of yourself."" So who is that person for Oh Wonder? ""We haven't been asked that yet!"" laughs Josephine, before Anthony chips in with a vague answer about friends and family. Many assume the duo are a real-life couple - but they have been doggedly reluctant to discuss a potential romance, even though they live together and have an uncanny knack for finishing each other's sentences. ""People think we're brother and sister, which suits us just fine,"" Josephine told one interviewer. Instead, they want the focus to be their music, which they wrote eyeball-to-eyeball over a piano in a rented AirBB apartment in New York. Compared to their first album, Ultralife is ""pumped full of energy,"" a direct response to the audience's reactions on their last tour. Sonically, it's a big leap forward, while retaining all of the breathless boy-girl beauty of their debut. The band don't want the album to propel them to Beyonce levels of fame I think it would just be very lonely,"" says Josephine), but it could jeopardise their chances of striking up anonymous conversations on the Tube. Which, as Anthony attests, could be a blessing. ""I once sat with a Danish friend on the Tube,"" he says, ""And there was two girls opposite me talking in a foreign language. ""Later, my friend told me they were Danish, too, and they were tearing into my shoes, talking about how awful they were. ""I thought they were quite normal shoes, honestly.""

"He suffered a stroke two weeks ago and his condition improved before a sudden deterioration on Tuesday. Mr Peres, who was one of the last of a generation of Israeli politicians present at the new nation's birth in 1948, served twice as the country's prime minister and once as president. He won the Nobel Peace prize in 1994 for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier. He once said the Palestinians were Israel's ""closest neighbours"" and might become its ""closest friends."" Obituary: Shimon Peres, Israeli founding father Long legacy of Israel's elder statesman Mr Peres died in a hospital near Tel Aviv early on Wednesday, with his family at his bedside. He had been in the intensive care unit of the Sheba Medical Centre after suffering a major stroke on 13 September. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his ""deep personal grief on the passing of the beloved of the nation."" Meanwhile US President Barack Obama called Mr Peres his ""dear friend"" in a statement, and said: ""He was guided by a vision of the human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together."" Mr Peres shared his Nobel Peace Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was later assassinated, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. At the start of his long political career, he was put in charge of personnel and arms purchases for the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces. He secured a deal with France to supply the new Israeli nation with Mirage jet fighters. He also set up Israel's secret nuclear facility. He was the defence minister in 1976, when Palestinian hijackers diverted a plane from Israel to Entebbe in Uganda. He oversaw the successful rescue of more than 100 hostages. Once an advocate of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mr Peres later became a leading political dove. He often spoke of the need for compromise over territorial demands in Palestinian areas. He maintained an active public schedule into old age, mostly through his non-governmental Peres Centre for Peace, which promotes closer ties between Israel and the Palestinians. In 2013 he said: ""There is no alternative to peace. There is no sense to go to war."" He retired from his role as president in 2014.",1,433
"There has been damage to property but no injuries. Forecasters have indicated that it will be dry and bright for most of Scotland by Wednesday afternoon. Ferry services have been considerably disrupted and falling trees have caused some problems on roads and railways. Transport Minister Keith Brown chaired a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience team. Mr Brown said: ""No-one is being complacent and whilst the weather alerts remain in place, the focused response will continue."" A train travelling south from Aberdeen to Edinburgh suffered minor damage when it hit some fallen branches and a bus was hit in Aberdeen. In Edinburgh a tree landed on the side of a house in Redford Road. No-one was injured. High winds has also forced the closure of the Royal Botanic Garden in the capital. Aberdeen City Council said trees were down across the city, and the tree squad was working flat out. Huge quantities of foam blown in from the sea covered cars, buildings and a park beside Aberdeen beach at the Footdee area. Scottish Borders Council activated its emergency response team after warnings of extremely heavy rain, while Tayside Police warned of an increased risk of surface water on many routes and possible river flooding. Part of a building roof has come down blocking Bridge Street at Peterhead harbour and Grampian Police said minor roads across the region have been blocked by trees.

"Nether Edge Green Party councillor, Alison Teal, was served with a legal notice for her involvement in protests against Sheffield City Council's tree felling programme. Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action,"" from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays.""",1,435
"The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said he had been told not to report for training with the rest of the players on Monday. It is seeking clarification about an incident outside a fast food restaurant in the early hours of Tuesday. Police attended and said a man was taken away by officers but no arrests were made. The WRU said while the player, aged 28, was on an agreed holiday period from pre-Rugby World Cup training it operated a strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: ""The player has been suspended due to a clear breach of the standards which we expect to be maintained by someone involved in one of our national squads. ""Discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the Welsh Rugby Union and we cannot tolerate any compromise of those standards. ""Mike Phillips is an exceptional player, but there is irrefutable evidence.... that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set. ""It is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort. ""That message must be heard clearly by all players, coaches, administrators, volunteers, supporters and, of course, the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of Wales. ""Our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image."" The incident occurred outside a McDonald's restaurant in Queen Street. Footage taken by bystanders shows Phillips being restrained by police before being led away in handcuffs to a police van. South Wales Police say he was not arrested. The player was recently released by the Ospreys regional rugby team after securing a move to French club Bayonne. The WRU said the suspension has been approved by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and agreed by the senior squad management team. Wales team manager Alan Phillips said: ""We have suspended Mike Phillips on the clear evidence of a level of behaviour we regard as unacceptable. ""It is clear there has been a breach of our disciplinary standards.""

"""This is where it all happens,"" says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's a pristine room, free of clutter and distractions, except for a PlayStation 4 and several years' worth of Fifa games. On the mixing desk sits a book on Frank Gehry's architecture, while the far corner is dominated by a gargantuan bean bag, apparently fashioned from the skin of a dead muppet. Outside the sliding glass doors, Tinie has a child-sized Lamborghini, which he's planning to use in an upcoming video. ""Jake Bugg has been here,"" he says. ""MNEK's been here. Sinead Harnett was here the other day. ""Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal."" The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years. The record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots. ""I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out,"" he says. ""I've been in my own world and my own head. ""My engineer Ritchie said,'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.' ""But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened. ""That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends."" You can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a ""personality."" On Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings. ""It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started,"" he says. ""People were like,'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.' ""Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level."" Tinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate. But by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead. Patrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV. Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears. Soon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche. ""I got so many clothes I keep'em in my aunt's house,"" he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out. He acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. ""Eight years sitting on topHip-hop, grime, then I went pop."" Yet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. ""I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music,"" he says. What impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels. ""Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label,"" marvels the rapper. Tinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone. Grime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it ""was almost like the uninvited genre."" He says: ""People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side. ""I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else."" He addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: ""Black boys getting white paperFrom the underground, now we're in the skyscraper."" Reconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying. ""A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three,"" he reflects. ""It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like,'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or,'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking,'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.' ""But equally, they can tell you,'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like,'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.' ""But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense. ""So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the art comes before pretty much everything else."" Tinie Tempah's album Youth is out on 14 April.

"Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested and charged with manslaughter. The stricken vessel, the Nautilus, has been raised but no body was found and the search for Ms Wall goes on. Mr Madsen initially said that he dropped Ms Wall off before it sank but police say he has now changed his statement - although they have not said what to. Police gave no other information on why they thought the Nautilus was deliberately sunk, but it contradicts Mr Madsen's explanation that there was a technical fault. Mr Madsen has denied involvement in Ms Wall's death, and will be held in custody for 24 days while investigations continue. Ms Wall's boyfriend first reported her missing after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the submarine. She had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Police are still appealing for witnesses who may have seen Ms Wall on Thursday evening. ""We're still hoping that we'll find Kim Wall alive, but we are preparing ourselves for the fact that she may not be,"" Copenhagen police homicide chief Jens Moller said.",1,439
"The private CaixinMarkit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in July from 49.4 in the previous month. It is worse than a preliminary reading of 48.2 and is the fifth consecutive month of contraction in the sector. A figure below 50 shows contraction in the sector and one above means growth. The reading was the lowest since July 2013, when it fell to 47.7. The disappointing results, which focus on small to mid-sized companies, come after the official survey over the weekend also showed signs of a slowing Chinese economy. The official PMI, which focuses on larger companies, fell to 50 in July from 50.2 in June as growth stalled unexpectedly. Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG said the data was not surprising and reinforced the view that there will be further weakness in the economy. ""I feel that the macro outlook of China - which is probably slowing further - has already been considered by the market,"" he said in a note on Monday. The deterioration in China's vast manufacturing industry comes despite the government recently intervening heavily to boost the economy and stock market. The central bank has already cut interest rates four times since November. It has also continuously eased lending rules for banks in aggressive measures to spur spending. But manufacturers continued to cut production levels, with July seeing the fastest rate of contraction since November 2011. Factory production - which contributes to the overall manufacturing activity reading- was at 47.1 in July, shrinking for the third month in a row.",1,440

"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, General Lord Dannatt said it was wrong to ""talk up"" the incidents. Five Afghan soldiers died in an assault on the former UK base Camp Bastion and capital city Kabul has been attacked. Lord Dannatt said the Afghan government must retain the support of the West. The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in October, with Camp Bastion in Helmand Province being handed over to local armed forces. But there has been a surge in insurgent attacks over the past month, targeting Afghan forces, foreigners and civilians. It has raised concerns about whether Afghan security forces will be able to protect the country when the bulk of the other foreign troops depart this month. Three South Africans were killed in a Taliban attack on a compound used by a US-based charity on Saturday in Kabul, the third such incident on foreigners in 10 days. Ahead of a conference this week on Afghanistan's future in London, Lord Dannatt said: ""It is important the new government shows it has competence and confidence to govern.... it is absolutely critical to show international determination to go on financing and supporting the developing Afghanistan."" He said: ""The security situation is an important element in this but don't let's fall into the trap of playing the Taliban's game and talking up the number of attacks... ""Of course there are going to be attacks.... a low level, even a medium level degree of insecurity and a continuing insurgency is quite likely, but let's keep the wider picture in mind."" The Ministry of Defence said Afghan security forces are providing effective security and the recent incidents do not represent the situation across the country. Lord Dannatt's predecessor, General Sir Mike Jackson, has reiterated his view that the UK withdrew from Afghanistan too soon. Interviewed on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""The war, conflict, call it what you will, wasn't over. I'm left feeling there was no victory despite what the politicians say."" But he said that while the recent attacks were ""somewhat depressing.... I don't see certainly at the moment, and I hope never, that the Taliban will be in a position where they can overthrow the elected government of Afghanistan."" He said ""great effort"" has been put into training and mentoring the Afghan security forces. Sir Mike, who led the Army between 2003 and 2006 at the height of the UK's involvement in Afghanistan, added: ""Afghanistan is not a military problem per se, the root of it is political. It seems to me there can only be, in the longer term, a political outcome.""",1,442
"The normal body tissues show up as green, while the cancer comes out as intense red spots. The team, at the University of Tokyo and the RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center, says the technology will help explain the deadly process. The research is on mice so far, but it is hoped the method could one day help with treatment too. The spread of cancer around the body is a crucial moment called metastasis. Before a cancer spreads it is easier to contain and cure, afterwards it is incredibly difficult. The tumour itself has to evolve so bits of it are able to break free, survive travelling in the blood stream and invade new tissues. A deeper understanding of how this happens could lead to new ideas for treatment. The mice were injected with cancerous tissue engineered to fluoresce. The researchers then let the disease progress before using chemicals that made the mouse's body and internal organs highly transparent. It meant the body could be rapidly imaged and the location of any cancerous tissue detected. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports, details cancers growing in the lungs, intestines, and liver before spreading around the body. Dr Hiroki Ueda, one of the researchers, said: ""The images reveal cancerous colonies in enough detail to calculate their shapes, volumes, and distributions - characteristics critical to distinguishing between patterns of metastasis. He told the BBC News website: ""We are now applying this technology to the human clinical samples. ""I hope this tissue-clearing and 3D imaging of human samples will make diagnosis easier, more objective and accurate in near future."" Watch an infection take hold in 3D and in real time Further experiments showed how cancer can get better at spreading. Dr Kohei Miyazono said: ""Most of the cancer cells appear to die during circulation in the bloodstream and fail to metastasise."" But cancers then start producing chemical signals to help them grow. The researchers tested the effect of one of them, called TGF-beta, and showed it dramatically improved the chances of cancers colonising the lung tissue. They] are far more likely to survive the journey and form malignant outposts,"" Dr Miyazono added. It is thought the technology could be adapted to other disciplines, including how the body's cells behave in people with autoimmune diseases. Follow James on Twitter.",1,443
"Nico Rosberg headed team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 0.505secs after the Briton made a mistake on his best lap. And the German was a massive 1.834secs quicker than Kimi Raikkonen, third for Ferrari, on the same'soft' tyres. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat were fourth and fifth as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was 11th on the medium tyre. In windy and comparatively cool conditions - it was only 21C and overcast when temperatures are more usually in the mid-30Cs at this race - Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne made his debut in Formula 1 as stand-in for the injured Fernando Alonso. Vandoorne, who had not driven the 2016 McLaren before Friday, flew in overnight from Japan, where he had been testing the car he races in the Super Formula category, and was 18th fastest, 0.952secs slower than team-mate Jenson Button. However, Vandoorne's best time was set on the medium tyre, which is about a second slower than the soft on which Button was running when he set his fastest lap. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier said: ""He did very well - it is not easy to step in to this high-tech car with a lot of processes to learn. He knows most of them but doing it for real is very different."" The comparison between the two will be watched with intense interest through the weekend as it is effectively a partial audition for the job of Alonso's team-mate at McLaren in 2017. Button is out of contract at the end of this season ad Vandoorne, McLaren's reserve driver, is the most highly regarded not to have a regular F1 drive. At the front, Rosberg and Hamilton were only 0.081secs apart after their first runs on the soft tyre - with the German again marginally ahead. On their second flying laps, Hamilton was quicker in the first sector, but then dropped half a second in the middle sector of the lap. The gap between the Mercedes and the rest are not likely to be representative - Ferrari were almost certainly on a different programme. The Italian team have brought two more sets of the medium tyre for each of their drivers than Mercedes for this weekend and appeared to be focusing more on establishing whether that is the correct tyre for the race. Behind the Red Bulls, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was sixth fastest ahead of the Toro Rosso pair Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen, the Haas of Romain Grosjean and Williams' Felipe Massa.

""I was a cross-dresser, I went away dressed as a man and I came home dressed as a man, but in between times I was a woman,"" she said. But cross-dressing was not good enough for her. When Ms McKay returned from her trip, she visited her GP, who referred her to a specialist. She said: ""I had been going to the doctor for a range of ailments and he said to me:'Thank God you've finally told me what's wrong. Every week three or four people present themselves as transgender to the Regional Gender Identity and Psychosexual Service at Knockbracken in Belfast. They typically make contact with the clinic through a GP referral or a drop-in facility every week. 200 people are currently being treated by the clinic with 50 more on the waiting list. More than half of them are aged between 18 and 25. The number of adults going to the clinic is doubling year on year. The clinic provides adults with assessment, psychological support and onward referral for hormone replacement therapy and surgery where appropriate. A gender identity panel to strategically look at the issues facing transgender people met for the first time at Stormont on Monday. It was formed by the peer support group Focus - The Identity Trust. It comprises politicians from Sinn Fein and the Alliance party, as well as a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend Lesley Carroll, and others with a long-standing interest in human rights. The Sinn Fein minister Megan Fearon said the gathering was about ""bringing marginalised people together, giving them space to discuss transgender issues and engaging with politicians in a way that had not been done before."" ""Transgender people still experience discrimination in nearly every walk of life,"" she said. The panel will address trans-phobic hate crime and access to health and education.",1,445
"Protesters hung a sign over the city's famous Rialto bridge and some carried suitcases to symbolise having to leave. Locals say they are being forced out by high rents, housing shortages and a surge in the number of apartments being rented to visitors at inflated prices. The population of Venice has dropped to under 55,000, from about 175,000 in 1951. Some of the protesters were received by the city hall and later said they were encouraged by the meeting. The number of people in the picturesque and car-free lagoon-side city swells in the daytime, especially in peak season when as many as 60,000 tourists can visit. Earlier this year, people on small boats tried to stop a cruise ship from docking. The city's mayor has proposed taxing day trippers to help deal with the problem. ""Venice is losing 1,000 residents each year,"" said Matteo Secchi, head of the association venessia.com which organised the rally. ""We are turning into Pompei, a town which people come to visit and say it's magnificent, but no-one lives there.""",1,446
"Daniel Bragg, 37, hit Julie Cook, 44, so hard he broke her left eye socket in the assault, police said. Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, causing a serious injury. She died in hospital two days later. Bragg, who admitted manslaughter, was sentenced to five years and four months in prison. He initially denied the killing, but changed his plea on the second day of his trial at Winchester Crown Court. Bragg was overheard by friends four days before Ms Cook was killed saying ""one of these days I'm going to kill her,"" Dorset Police said. A Domestic Violence Protection Order had been made against Mr Bragg in April stopping him from contacting or going to Ms Cook's home, the force said. However, the couple, from Bournemouth, remained in contact and on 28 April 2016 - just four days before the assault - a friend of the couple heard Mr Bragg say something to the effect of ""if we carry on like this I will end up killing her."" The couple had been at Pokesdown Railway Station when they started arguing and Ms Cook walked away. After punching her, Bragg initially walked away but returned to help Ms Cook, who was unconscious on the concrete platform, and took her back to her flat. The couple had been together for about four years before the incident and their relationship was described as ""volatile."" Det Insp Neil Phillips said: ""There was no justification for such violence. Bragg and Julie clearly had a volatile relationship and efforts had been made to prevent further abuse. ""However, Julie and Bragg continued to maintain contact and she tragically died as a result of his violent behaviour.""",1,447
"It comes after Swansea City FC's American owners revealed they are in talks with the council over increasing capacity at the ground. The Swans want to add 12,000 seats but shelved expansion plans in December when talks to buy the ground from the authority stalled. Since then, the club has been taken over by American investors. Council leader Rob Stewart said: ""We're pleased they reached a deal to buy the club,"" he said. ""We want the club to go from strength to strength. ""The offer is still there and we're still open to the option of them procuring the stadium or going for a commercial deal with them expanding the stadium. ""We would be interested to see what the the American investors prefer."" The 21,000-capacity ground, which Swansea share with Ospreys rugby region, is the second smallest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth's Vitality Stadium. Swansea have averaged crowds of about 20,500 in their last five Premier League seasons. The club initially wants to increase capacity to 33,000 but the ultimate vision is to expand the stadium to 40,000 seats. Last month, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said the club ""has to make sure the council is on board"" with the plans. But Mr Stewart said the council had not recently commented on the proposals in order to allow the takeover by Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan to be completed.",1,448
"His rival Yvette Cooper has called the war ""wrong"" while Andy Burnham has referred to it as ""an incredibly difficult period"" but said respect should be given to those who made difficult decisions. Liz Kendall was not an MP at the time Parliament voted to take action but has been quoted as saying the ""ghost of Iraq has haunted politicians in this country"" across the political spectrum. But what have the political leaders with direct involvement in the conflict had to say about their decisions? Tony Blair Tony Blair has been dogged by his decision to take the UK to war in Iraq but has not apologised for his decision to go to war or said he made a mistake. While giving evidence at the Iraq inquiry in 2011 the former prime minister said he ""regretted deeply and profoundly the loss of life"" during and after the 2003 conflict. But his sentiment was not well received at the time as members of the public gallery heckled him with cries of ""too late."" A year earlier, he had said the Iraq war made the world a safer place and although he was ""sorry"" it had been ""divisive"" he believed it had been right to remove Saddam Hussein. In his memoir The Journey, Mr Blair wrote: ""I can't say sorry in words. I can only hope to redeem something from the tragedy of death, in the actions of a life, my life, that continues still."" Gordon Brown At the start of Gordon Brown's tenure in 2007 British troops were still in Iraq. Mr Brown said he would learn lessons from mistakes made in Iraq but he did not make any formal apologies during his time as leader. He has also said he empathises with those who lost family members in the conflict but he told the Iraq inquiry he believed the war had been ""right"" and said he had been convinced by intelligence services that Iraq was a threat that ""had to be dealt with."" Ed Miliband Ed Miliband has gone the furthest in apologising on behalf of the Labour party. At the 2010 party conference, in his first speech as Labour leader he said it had been ""wrong"" to go to war. Mr Miliband, who was not an MP in 2003 when Parliament voted to approve British involvement in Iraq, said: ""I criticise nobody faced with making the toughest of decisions and I honour our troops who fought and died there. But I do believe that we were wrong. Wrong to take Britain to war and we need to be honest about that."" George W Bush President George W Bush has never apologised for his decision to take the US into war with Iraq. Ten years on from the conflict the former US president told a US newspaper ""I am comfortable with what I did."" ""I'm confident the decisions were made the right way,"" Mr Bush said. ""It's easy to forget what life was like when the decision was made."" His brother Jeb Bush who is a prospective Republican presidential candidate has recently raised some eyebrows when he responded ""yes"" to a question about whether he would have approved the 2003 invasion of Iraq ""knowing what we know now."" Colin Powell Colin Powell, the former US Secretary of State, supported the decision to invade Iraq despite having reservations. But he has repeatedly come under fire for his role in building the case for conflict. ""I wanted to avoid a war,"" he said in an interview in 2008. ""The president agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the UN and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war."" He has never publically apologised for the decision but he has said he regrets providing misleading evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, calling it ""a failure"" and ""a blot on his record.""",1,449

"The suppliers, one making seats and the other parts used in gearboxes, have stopped delivering to VW in a contract row. Car and parts production has already been halted at four plants and will be stopped at two others later this week. The carmaker said the interruptions in production would affect 27,700 staff. ""Although Braunschweig District Court has issued injunctions obliging the suppliers to resume deliveries, the suppliers have not as yet met their obligations. Volkswagen continues its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers,"" said the company in a statement. The two suppliers are CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which makes cast iron parts used in gearboxes. They are demanding compensation from VW because they say they their incomes were hit when VW cancelled a contract. VW says it is continuing its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers. The company said the production stoppage would not affect cars that have already been ordered. Any effect on future production will depend on how long the dispute lasts. Some production has already been halted at Wolfsburg, which makes Golfs, and at Zwickau where Golfs and Passats are made. Production is due to begin again later this week. Production has also stopped at Braunschweig, which makes chassis parts and plastic parts, but should start again next Monday. Later this week, production will cease at Salzgitter, which is involved in engine production, and Kassel where transmission and exhaust system production takes place. In what the company said was an unrelated issue, production was halted at Emden, which makes Passats, last week and will resume on Wednesday. In some cases employees have been sent home, in others they are engaged in short-time working on other jobs within the plants. The German Economy Ministry on Monday called on VW and the suppliers end the dispute. ""We assume and also expect the companies to solve the sticking issues as soon as possible,"" Economy Ministry spokesman Andreas Audretsch told journalists during a regular news conference. He added: ""It is about thousands of jobs, which could be affected by shorter work hours, and the responsibility to tackle these problems constructively is very high."" VW in the UK issued a statement in which it said the company was ""working intensively on minimising the acute supply risk, the priority being to maintain production in some areas and to ensure that deliveries can be made to customers. ""Volkswagen currently expects to be able to adhere to all confirmed delivery dates,"" it added.",1,451
"The 35-year-old will have security clearance and access to classified information, but no official title or salary when she works in the West Wing. She will serve as her father's ""eyes and ears"" while providing broad-ranging advice, her attorney told Politico. Ms Trump, who owns a fashion brand, will join husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president. The US first daughter said in a statement: ""While there is no modern precedent for an adult child of the president, I will voluntarily follow all of the ethics rules placed on government employees. ""I will continue to offer my father my candid advice and counsel, as I have for my entire life."" After Mr Kushner's White House appointment was announced, Ms Trump said she would focus on settling her family in Washington rather than work for the administration. Her step-mother, First Lady Melania Trump, has so far chosen to stay in New York with Mr Trump's youngest son. Ms Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told AP news agency: ""Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not."" But some have criticised the decision to give her a White House position, even though she will have no actual job title. Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: ""I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. ""But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues."" The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions. But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's ""special hiring authority."" Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times. However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling. Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter. Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an ""unfair advantage"" in the marketplace. She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration. Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms Trump is due to release a book - Women Who Work - in May, with the proceeds going to charity, Ms Gorelick said.",1,452
"One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. We've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that. What's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor? We are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen. All My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April. A full list of tour dates is on the Talawa website. Following its sell-out run at the Young Vic, A View from the Bridge, with Mark Strong leading the cast, opens at the West End's Wyndham's Theatre on 16 February, and is now in preview. The RSC's production of Miller's 1949 Pulitzer prize-winning Death of a Salesman begins previews in March at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Antony Sher and Alex Hassell as father and son, Willy Loman and Biff. Sian Phillips leads the cast of Sheffield Theatres' revival of Arthur Miller's Playing for Time from 12 March - 4 April at the Crucible. A drama originally written by Miller for the big screen, The Hook - about corruption in New York's docks - has its world premiere at Northampton's Royal and Derngate theatre on 5-27 June.",1,453
"Kallum Watkins gave the bottom-of-the-table Rhinos an early lead but Willie Isa's first two Wigan tries put them 12-4 ahead at the break. George Williams, Dom Manfredi and Ben Flower put the Warriors in control before Mitch Achurch pulled one back. But Oliver Gildart and Dan Sarginson went over late on to wrap up the win. Wigan's victory, complete with their biggest points haul of the season, leaves four teams separated by only points difference at the top of the table, although Catalans and Hull both have the opportunity to take over as leaders if they beat Wakefield and Hull KR respectively on Sunday. Shaun Wane's Warriors came into the game - a re-match of last season's Grand Final won by Leeds - having suffered back-to-back league defeats but knowing that they had not been beaten at Magic Weekend since 2008. And once they went in front they proved too good for the out-of-sorts Rhinos, whose nightmare season since winning the treble last year shows no signs of ending. Leeds, who were without 10 regulars through injury and suspension, have now lost five successive games in all competitions and defeat leaves them six points away from eighth-placed Widnes in the race for a top-eight finish before the league splits. Leeds coach Brian McDermott: ""It was a tough way to lose, a tough scoreline. Obviously the crucial part was just after half-time but before then the game was a contest. ""I thought we gave it absolutely everything. We kept on having a crack, probably over-played a bit. ""There was another chunk of effort this week. We're clearly hamstrung with players missing and what's gone on in pre-season and you get to the stage when things don't go your way. ""But quietly there are some positives. I think there is something special to be done for us at the end of the year. ""Your objectives shift as weeks go by and you keep losing games. I don't think I'm giving up on the Grand Final - I know numerically we might just be out of touch at the moment. ""But there is something there to work with, something good for the future. These young fellas are learning some lessons."" Wigan coach Shaun Wane: ""I thought we played well for 40 minutes. We started well in both halves and were ruthless but then we got a bit bored and went away from it. ""I have to say there is loads of spirit in the Leeds team, there is no question about that. They have a competitive coach and competitive players."" Leeds: Hardaker, Handley, Watkins, Keinhorst, Golding, McGuire, Lilley, Galloway, Jones-Buchanan, Singleton, Ferres, Cuthbertson, Walters.

"Two employees of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) were initially quarantined in the office. A note reading ""die a painful death, Muslims,"" was in the envelope with the powder, the group's lawyer said. Initial tests showed that the powder is not hazardous, and the quarantine has been lifted. The BBC's James Reevell at the scene says the package is now being passed to the FBI for further inspection. Hazardous materials crews locked down the building and surrounding area shortly before 14:00 local time (19:00 GMT), while staff from CAIR waited outside. In recent days, President Barack Obama has warned against anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of deadly terror attacks in San Bernardino, California. The Muslim group's leaders said that threats were not uncommon, and had increased since the attacks in Paris about a month ago. Mr Awad tweeted that the office was ""evacuated by DC Fire Dept after receiving envelope with suspicious powdered substance [with] hate message."" The group's lawyer posted a message on Facebook that said: ""It's frightening to experience the hate manifest itself to such a real level. This will not deter us from continuing to protect the civil rights and liberties of all Americans.""

"Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city. Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died and more than 20 were hospitalised after Tuesday's attack. There has been no independent confirmation of the claim. It comes after reports from a rebel-held town in Idlib province that chlorine gas was dropped on it late on Monday after a Russian military helicopter had earlier been shot down nearby. A battle has continued since the weekend in Aleppo, as rebels attempt to break a government siege of a rebel-controlled area. It is expected to be decisive for the future of a city that was once a commercial heartland but has been destroyed by five years of war. About a quarter of a million civilians are living under siege since government forces cut them off last month. The latest reports from the area are that the government, backed by Russian jets, has regained some ground. It is not clear exactly which territory has returned to government control but a reporter for a Beirut-based TV station said the army had regained control of two out of three villages that it lost near Aleppo earlier this week. Russian and Syrian forces say they have been operating seven so-called humanitarian corridors, allowing hundreds of people to leave the besieged area peacefully. On Wednesday, Russian state television ran pictures of civilians and fighters leaving. Smoke was seen billowing over the city in the footage, and gunshots were heard. The UN's Children's Fund (Unicef) said it is ""extremely"" concerned for the safety of children caught up in violence in the city. Saad Houry, of the fund, said children make up a third of the population trapped in the siege, and called for unhindered humanitarian access and for children to be protected. The New York-based Physicians for Human Rights group said the last week of July was the worst week for attacks on medical facilities in the region since the Syrian war began in 2011. In a statement, the group said it has verified six deadly air strikes against hospitals in Aleppo governorate, all perpetrated by Syrian government forces. Widney Brown of Physicians for Human Rights said: ""Destroying hospitals is tantamount to signing thousands of death warrants for people now stranded in eastern Aleppo.""",1,456
"The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) follows a 2013 investigation by BBC Panorama into the Military Research Force, or MRF. Daniel Rooney was 18 when he and a friend were shot by MRF soldiers firing from an unmarked car, as the youths stood on a street corner in the St James area of west Belfast. The army claimed the men were armed. Eyewitnesses dispute this, consistent with forensic tests on Rooney and his friend that suggested neither youth was armed. Mr Rooney was buried without a post-mortem examination. However, while a medical report recorded a bullet entry wound, there was no mention of an exit wound. The PSNI want to see if the bullet can be retrieved from Mr Rooney's remains, assuming it was lodged in his body. It may then be possible to determine whether the bullet came from a military weapon. The year of 1972 was the most violent of the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict. A total of 497 people died, mostly civilians killed in bombings or shot by the Provisional IRA and 151 soldiers and police officers were also killed. Panorama showed that, between May and September 1972, there were several unprovoked ""drive-by"" attacks on unarmed civilians by MRF soldiers similar to the one that killed Mr Rooney. At the time, locals assumed the gunmen were loyalists. One attack is alleged to have been preceded by a friendly wave from the driver before a machine gun protruding from a rear window cut down three unarmed men chatting at a taxi rank. On this occasion the MRF soldiers were armed with a weapon, commonly used by the IRA, known as the ""Chicago grinder."" This was a Thompson sub-machine gun also favoured by the 1920s gangster Al Capone. Panorama showed how in each disputed shooting, the MRF soldiers claimed they were fired on. Yet there was no independent evidence to show that any of the dead or wounded were armed, or that they provoked the attacks, or even that they were members of the IRA. Two months after Daniel Rooney was shot, the military top brass decided the MRF was imperilling the army's already damaged reputation. Declassified papers show that a review of the MRF found there was ""no provision for detailed command and control."" The MRF was wound up after only 14 months. When Prime Minister Edward Heath was told the MRF was to be replaced with the Special Reconnaissance Unit (SRU), he sent a message to the army emphasising that ""special care should be taken"" to ensure that the SRU should ""operate within the law."" Det Ch Insp Neil McGuinness of the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch said: ""Every effort has been made to complete"" Rooney's exhumation ""as sensitively and professionally as possible."" Last year the remains of a father of 12, Joseph Murphy, who was shot by the army in disputed circumstances, were exhumed. Having been shot once, Mr Murphy was brought to an army base where he claimed a soldier shot him again in the place that he had been previously wounded. He later died in hospital. A bullet was recovered from his grave when his remains were exhumed.",1,457
"Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a ""very, very strange year at Uber."" In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day at work, sending her messages about his open relationship. It's just the latest blow for a company that has gained a reputation as a bastion of Silicon Valley's macho ""bro"" culture. But is Uber really any more sexist than other tech giants in the Valley? Ms Fowler's claims have resonated with many women in the tech world, and surveys suggest her experiences are not uncommon. According to a 2016 survey, 60 of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances. The ""Elephant in the Valley"" survey found that 87 of the 220 women interviewed had witnessed demeaning comments from their colleagues. Almost 40 of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. ""I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate,"" one contributor to the study wrote. ""He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company."" Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. ""After that, I was never asked to travel with him again,"" she said. ""This impacted my ability to do my job."" The study followed a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao - one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber. On Twitter, Ms Pao said Ms Fowler's blog post shows ""the state of tech in one woman's story, also the story of many women, many people at many companies."" Sexist van slogans banned in Australia Meet the female gamers challenging sexism Are universities secretly sexist? Discrimination is difficult to quantify - especially when victims are unwilling to speak out. Yet on top of Ms Pao's case, there have been several high-profile lawsuits and sudden exits in the tech world in recent years: Comparing results from different studies with different questions can be problematic - but there are some hints that Silicon Valley has a problem. Statistics on sexual harassment vary widely, but an extensive 1992 US national study found that 41 of women had experienced it; and about 40-50 of women in the EU, according to the United Nations. Both estimates are still lower than the Silicon Valley survey's 60. The 2016 Women in the Workplace study - a major US national survey - found that 19 of the technology sector's top executives are women - broadly in line with sectors like banking, media, or professional services. The same study found that, across all industries, 30 of women who negotiated for a promotion or a better salary were told they were ""bossy,"" ""aggressive"" or ""intimidating."" In the Elephant in the Valley survey, that rocketed to 84 of women being told they were aggressive (though that question was not specifically about negotiation). The world's biggest tech companies know they're dominated by white men, and many are funding schemes to address that. In its annual diversity and inclusion report, Apple said it had closed pay gaps over the past year by analysing salaries, bonuses and stock grants. Facebook has pledged to give 15m (PS12m) to Code.org, a non-profit group teaching young women and underrepresented minorities how to write computer code. 31-33 of the three biggest tech brands' employees are female - but what about their actual technical staff? 19 of Google's tech workforce is female, compared to 31 within the whole firm 23 of Apple's technology staff are women - and 32 of its global total, including retail 17 of Facebook's technology team are women, it says - and 33 of all its staff And in 2015, Google told USA Today it would invest 150m (PS120m) in workforce diversity initiatives that year, up from 115m in 2014. At the moment, 23 of Apple's tech employees are women. At Google, it's 19. And at Facebook, just 17. Change comes slowly in companies of this size, so the path could be a long one. But by broadening the pool of people qualified to work there, Silicon Valley is hoping to change the status quo.",1,458
"Some dairy farmers have said they face going out of business if prices they receive for their products do not rise. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production. Asda has said it will begin paying 28p a litre for milk from Monday. Dairy farmers currently receive about 19p a litre for milk, well below the cost of production at about 27p. Asda confirmed on Friday that it had told Dale Farm, its Northern Ireland supplier, that it will increase the price it pays to 28p a litre. It said this would ""assist our farmers during the current crisis."" Ian Marshall, the president of the UFU, said Asda's move was something farmers were ""glad to see"" and hoped other retailers would follow. But he warned that the situation remained ""dire"" for those in the dairy industry. ""It's a starting point for us,"" Mr Marshall said. ""What we're seeing is a move in the right direction.

"They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are ""of particular interest"" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved their ""causal connection"" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been ""secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine."" ""The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts,"" the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. ""We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17,"" he added. ""If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough."" The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question. The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added. The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia. They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October. The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage. Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as ""premature"" and ""counterproductive.""

"Mylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product ""in several weeks"" at a list price of 300 (PS230). That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies. The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500 in less than a decade. Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs 600 for two doses. Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months. Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007. ""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" she said. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option."" The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of 1bn for Mylan. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market."" Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just 274 of the 600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest. How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12 last week. The stock was flat at 43.04 in afternoon trading in New York. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy. Other drug makers including Valeant, Turing and Pfizer have come under fire in recent months for sharp price increases.",1,464

"It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was seriously injured. This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a PS27.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at PS36m from Monaco. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward clearly wants his man to succeed and his thoughts on the future remain a mystery but there is no doubt an FA Cup win is a much harder sell than an FA Cup win and Champions League football.

"Matthew Gillard, of Connsbrook Avenue in east Belfast, pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping and false imprisonment. The defendant, 25, also denied charges of common assault, assaulting a police officer and driving dangerously. The charges relate to incidents in east Belfast and Comber on Saturday 4 April. Newtownards Magistrates Court heard that the defendant and the woman were in his car in east Belfast when he began questioning her about who she was seeing. A detective giving evidence in court said the woman tried to get out of the Seat Toledo car but the defendant allegedly drove off at speed, through a red light on Bloomfield Avenue. When the car stopped on the Belfast Road in Comber, the woman escaped along a lane but was carried back to the car by the defendant, the court heard. An off-duty police sergeant saw this and went to help the woman. When the sergeant tried to intervene, the defendant allegedly drove his car at the officer, forcing him to get out of the way. The sergeant was able to pull the keys from the ignition through the car's open window, but the defendant wrenched them from his grasp. He then drove to the Grand Parade area of east Belfast where the woman was released. He is also alleged to have sent the woman a message threatening that if she went to police about the incident he would ""ruin her life in every possible way."" The court heard that the defendant handed himself over to police on Wednesday, despite being aware since Saturday that he was wanted by the PSNI. But during police interviews he refused to answer questions put to him. An application for bail was made but this was refused. Mr Gillard will appear again in court on 1 May.",1,467

"Anthony Tavernor has been restoring Plas Cadnant Hidden Gardens, near Menai Bridge, on Anglesey for 20 years, describing it as his life's project. But after days of heavy rain, a ""tidal wave"" of flood water swept through the garden in the early hours of Saturday. It came as floods caused ""chaos"" across north Wales. Former farmer Mr Tavernor has been restoring the 10-acres of garden and buildings at Plas Cadnant since buying the then overgrown 200-acre estate in 1996. It now attracts visitors - both local and from abroad - and its fans include the Prince of Wales, who Mr Tavernor said had hoped to visit the estate. But the force of the water from the flooded River Cadnant has now washed away many precious plants, including some rare botanical species. It also demolished a wall dating back some 200 years, as well stone obelisks, platforms and seats. ""The garden sits down in the valley so a huge amount of water came down from the fields like a tidal wave, devastating everything in its path,"" said Mr Tavernor. ""I'm just devastated.

""I'm sure a lot of people would abandon it but I'm going to persevere."" Days of rain caused floods which led to roads being closed, trains disrupted and homes evacuated on Boxing Day.

"For most of US history, party nominees have been decided by political power brokers and deal-makers behind closed doors. Parties operate like private clubs - they make their own rules and are suspicious of outsiders. Only in recent history has a more open system of primaries and caucuses been grafted onto the process to give the average American a say in who appears on the general election ballot. In a close, contentious primary season, however, the veneer of accountability can rub off, exposing the sometimes unsightly gears that still power the US political system. This has prompted objection from the supporters of two candidates in particular - Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders - who feel that the party establishments are arrayed against their presidential quests. But are their concerns valid? Here are answers to four pertinent questions as the nomination battles approach its final months. 34 Number of delegates Ted Cruz received in Colorado, which held conventions to pick delegates 759 Trump total delegate count 529 Cruz total delegate count Mr Trump is leading the race for the Republican nomination, but it's starting to feel like he's not winning. While he's comfortably ahead, with 757 delegates to 529 for second-place Ted Cruz, there's mounting evidence that he's being outmanoeuvred in the behind-the-scenes political process that could come into play if he doesn't reach the magic 1,237 delegate number necessary to secure the nomination outright. In Colorado - which selected its delegates at party gatherings last week and not through primaries or caucuses - Mr Cruz walked away with all 34 delegates. Even in states that have held contests won by Mr Trump, Mr Cruz's team has been working doggedly to ensure that their people become delegates. While Mr Trump swept South Carolina's 50 delegates, for instance, the state's convention delegation will be riddled with Cruz supporters who, while bound to Mr Trump on the first few ballots, can switch to the Texas senator if there is a protracted convention battle. It has Mr Trump and his people crying foul. ""This is happening all over our country - great people being disenfranchised by politicians,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Monday. ""Repub party is in trouble!"" Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's new aide in charge of managing the delegate-selection process, accused the Cruz campaign of using ""Gestapo tactics, scorched-earth tactics"" in Colorado. If, as Mr Trump asserted on Monday, the system is ""rigged"" and ""crooked,"" however, it isn't always tilted in favour of Mr Trump's opponents. Thanks to the Republican Party's delegate-apportioning system, including Florida's winner-take-all primary, Mr Trump has secured a larger share of the delegates so far (45) than he has of the raw primary vote (37). If Mr Cruz manages to win the nomination at the Republican convention despite trailing Mr Trump in total delegates and share of the popular vote, Mr Trump may have reason to feel aggrieved. But before he complains too loudly, he might want to heed some sage advice attributed (incorrectly) to Albert Einstein: ""You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else."" Mr Trump should be familiar with the quote, since he tweeted it in October 2014. 17 States Bernie Sanders has won 18 States Hillary Clinton has won Mr Sanders has won five state contests in a row and seven of the last eight. If he were an American football team he'd be poised for the playoffs. If he were prize fighter, he'd be tuning up for a title bout. Instead his pledged-delegate deficit to Mrs Clinton has gone from daunting to only fractionally less daunting. Over the course of his recent run, the Vermont Senator has picked up a net of just 91 delegates, despite winning Wisconsin 56 to 43, Utah 79 to 20 and Washington 72 to 27. According to a New York Times calculation, the former secretary of state currently has 1,305 pledged delegates, while Sanders stands at 1,086. Add in the non-binding support of ""super-delegates"" - Democratic officeholders and party functionaries who also cast ballots for the nominee at the convention - and Mrs Clinton's lead balloons to 1,774 to 1,117. To secure the Democratic nomination without drama at the convention a candidate needs the backing of 2,383 delegates The problem for Mr Sanders is that while he's been posting sizeable wins over the past month, they've largely been in delegate-poor states, like Wyoming (14 delegates), Idaho (23) and Alaska (16). His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders. If Mrs Clinton performs as expected in the coming contests in New York (291 delegates), Maryland (118) and Pennsylvania (210), she'll largely erase all the modest ground Mr Sanders made up over the past three weeks. 9,412,426 Votes for Hillary Clinton during primary season so far 7,034,997 Votes for Bernie Sanders during primary season so far If delegate maths and selection rules make your head hurt, at least we can rely on the raw vote totals to get a feel for how popular the remaining candidates are, right? Wrong. According to current tabulations Hillary Clinton has received 9,412,426 votes during the primary season so far. Bernie Sanders has received 7,034,997. That 2.4m vote lead has been relentlessly touted by the former secretary of state and her supporters to counter the claims of Sanders faithful that their man is more popular than the delegate tallies indicate. Some states that hold caucuses - like Iowa and Washington - aren't included in that number, however, because they don't report vote totals. The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler tried to extrapolate numbers for the remaining states based on their total voter turnout and concluded that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 2.3m votes - still a significant margin. Among the Republicans, who are better about providing full vote totals, Mr Trump leads with 8,256,309 votes. Mr Cruz is second (6,319,244), former candidate Marco Rubio is third (3,482,129), followed by Mr Kasich (2,979,379). In the end the popular vote may give the leading candidates a claim of legitimacy as the people's choice - but appearances can be deceiving. ""The media has created the perception that the voters choose the nomination. That's the conflict here,"" North Dakota delegate Curly Haugland told a television interviewer. ""The rules are still designed to have a political party choose its nominee at a convention. That's just the way it is."" ""Well, there's the law, and then there's ethics, and then there's getting votes. I'm not going to get into what tactics are used."" If, as appears to be increasingly likely, the Republican primary season ends without Donald Trump securing the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination, the Republican National Convention could turn into a political free-for-all unrivalled in modern US political history. After several rounds of deadlocked balloting, most convention delegates would be free to vote their conscience. But could that conscience be nudged by, say, a free weekend at a Donald Trump golf resort, a nice dinner with the Cruz family or even a choice spot in a John Kasich administration? Maybe! While there are detailed anti-corruption laws governing the behaviour of public officeholders, convention delegates are private citizens. While government regulations prohibit them from taking money from corporations, labour unions, government contractors or foreign nationals, the law beyond that is much murkier. Campaigns and their wealth donors could likely cover delegate travel expenses, no matter how lavish. Gold watches? Bags of small, unmarked bills? Who knows? State anti-bribery laws may apply, but there's scant legal precedent. Perhaps the greatest deterrent to untoward action by campaigns is the negative publicity such naked attempts at influence could have if they're documented. But public perceptions and attitudes this political season has been difficult to predict, to say the least. Although the national convention is still months away, accusations of dirty tricks have already started flying. On Sunday Mr Trump took to Twitter to accuse the Cruz campaign of misdeeds during the South Carolina state party convention - a charge Mr Cruz vehemently denied. ""I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign,"" Mr Trump wrote. ""Bad system!"" During a television interview that same morning, however, Trump adviser Paul Manafort appeared to acknowledge that his campaign won't be shy in wooing delegates at the national convention, however. ""Well, there's the law, and then there's ethics, and then there's getting votes,"" he said. ""I'm not going to get into what tactics are used. I happen to think the best way we're going to get delegates is to have Donald Trump be exposed to delegates, let the delegates hear what he says."" Another Trump adviser, Barry Bennett, said they wouldn't be offering ""seats on the Trump airplane or anything like that."" ""There's obviously a big line - we're not going to do anything immoral, illegal or unethical,"" he said. But when a presidential nomination is at stake, and it comes down to just a handful of delegates, that ""big line"" may end up looking awfully fuzzy.",1,471

Sunderland survived with a game to spare after victory over Everton with Allardyce describing it as a ""miraculous achievement.""

I ask them to try and ace me for 10 minutes so I get used to seeing the ball go past me, and also reacting to a serve coming at me from that height. Media playback is not supported on this device Q) What do you think about Wimbledon's dress code? (Danyal Khan) It is very strict but I do like that it's all white because it's different. We don't have that the rest of the year and that is one of the things that makes Wimbledon unique. Q) Should the rules of tennis be changed since toilet breaks medical time-outs are being increasingly used to break up sporting momentum, and the integrity of the sport? (James Walker) Yes, they should be. Why not? They could get rid of the medical time-outs, for sure. You can't get rid of toilet breaks but you could have them at the end of the set. Normally the toilets are right by the side of the court. Maybe on the outside courts it's not the case but normally they are right there and there's no reason for a toilet break to last 10 minutes. But sometimes we play for four or five hours and you're drinking so many fluids, you can't get rid of them altogether - what if someone needs to go? You don't want to see what might happen on the court! Q) What is your pet preference after dogs? (Alexander Broadbean) That's a good question. We talked about having a cat before but none of my family ever had cats while I was growing up. I think with what I do for a living, having cats is actually not a bad thing because they don't need as much attention as dogs. I had a hamster when I was a kid, called Whisky. He escaped down the floorboards never to be seen again and I was absolutely devastated. Q) Who would win a fastest sausage-eater contest between your dogs Maggie May and Rusty? (Amanda C) Rusty's a quicker eater. He's just bigger. He's a boy and wolfs his food down. Q) Would you ever consider Grand Slam doubles? (Jake) I would like to. I couldn't at Wimbledon because the doubles is best-of-five sets. You look at some of the matches, you can be out there for three-and-a-half or four hours. There's no way physically I would be able to do that here. But I would like to play because I love the Grand Slams and doing well in the doubles is good. I respect the doubles players, my brother's one, and often doubles matches can be very exciting, especially in the latter stages of Grand Slams. It is a part of our game that a lot of club players play and I think it should be shown more on the TV. Q) Where did you watch Heather Watson's match against Serena Williams and were you on your feet shouting? (Rachel Grace) Media playback is not supported on this device I watched it at home. I watched the first set and the beginning of the second, and then I snoozed for 20 minutes and woke up at 5-4 in the second set. Then I watched the whole of the end of the match. I don't really jump up and scream when I'm watching because of the dogs - Kim was doing that and the dogs were going crazy. I normally go very quiet and quite insular when I'm watching matches that I'm into. With boxing I do that as well - individual sports. With team sports it's different, but with individual sports and when I care about the outcome, I tend to not say a whole lot. Q) Who would play you in a movie and why? (Sandy) Andrew Garfield - I've been told we look alike. Q) Who was your sporting hero growing up? (Greg) Andre Agassi. I loved watching him when I was a kid. He had a great personality - very charismatic, very different. Q) Do you prefer scrambled eggs or fried? (Josh) Scrambled. I've just got into cooking them on my own and I do them pretty well. I learned from watching Gordon Ramsay on the internet. Andy Murray was speaking to BBC Sport's Piers Newbery. You can follow Murray on Twitter,Facebook and Instagram.",1,474
"Security assistance has been withheld since 2011, when the Gulf state put down mass Shia-led protests. But US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Bahrain had made progress on human rights, including the release of political prisoners. Bahrain is home to the US Navy's Fifth fleet and has flown airstrike missions over Syria as part of the US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS). ""We believe it is important to recognise that the government of Bahrain has made some meaningful progress on human rights reforms and reconciliation,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. He added that this did not mean that the US thought the human rights situation in Bahrain was adequate. ""Following the lift of these holds, we will continue to press Bahrain on our human rights concerns,"" Mr Kirby said. He gave no details about what the security assistance would entail. The move was quickly criticised by rights groups. Sarah Margon, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said that the decision to lift restrictions was taking place without any ""real or meaningful political reform"" in Bahrain. She said in a statement that ""Bahrain's jails are bursting at the seams with political detainees and the recent prison sentence for political opposition leader, al-Wefaq secretary general Sheikh Ali Salman, means that a political accommodation remains as far away as ever."" Earlier in June, Sheikh Salman was jailed for four years for inciting hatred, promoting disobedience and ""insulting"" public institutions. Shia-dominated demonstrations against Bahrain's Sunni monarchy have occurred sporadically since 2011. Dozens died when the government moved to quash protests four years ago.",1,475
"Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired. People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the edge of the capital, with their eyes streaming. ""Let the world see what is happening in this country,"" yelled one elderly man. ""We will never stop until this.... government goes."" Ordinary Egyptians appear to be losing their fear of direct confrontation with the security forces. There have been bloody and drawn out clashes all over Cairo and in some of Egypt's main cities. They have a long list of grievances and the demands are an explicit challenge to their rulers. ""We want a real democratic system. This regime of Hosni Mubarak has been in power for 30 years,"" declared Ahmed, a man in his 20s. ""I was unemployed for five years. I had to move to the United Arab Emirates. This is what I was dragged into. My son will not suffer what I have suffered. This ends here."" When you talk to people, they tell you economic reforms have not eased the poverty of Egypt's masses, education and social services are inadequate, and they complain of high levels of corruption and political stagnation. ""We are so furious. We must have change, better chances to work, to buy a flat and have just the life's basics,"" said a bank clerk clutching an Egyptian flag. ""What happened in Tunisia has changed things a bit. It knocked some sense into people."" Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei - who joined worshippers in Giza - was swiftly moved inside the gates of the mosque as clashes began. ""One, two, ElBaradei where are you?"" was the cry that then went up outside. Some expressed disappointment that the Nobel Laureate - who set up the National Association for Change opposition coalition when he returned home to Egypt a year ago - had not taken a more prominent role in protests. He has put up supportive messages on his Twitter account but was absent, in Vienna, for the first ""Day of Rage"" on Tuesday. He returned to Cairo on Thursday night. ""I support ElBaradei, my father wants (Arab League Secretary General) Amr Musa,"" one man said. ""We could have ElBaradei or anyone else,"" added Amgad, who had brought his young children along to witness the protest. ""We need change, not any specific person."" The main opposition movement, the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, subtly changed its message ahead of the latest protests. Despite the reported arrest of some senior figures, deputy leader Mahmoud Izzat spoke encouragingly of the protests. ""People are demanding freedom, the dissolution of this invalid parliament. From the beginning this is what the young people have been shouting and we are with them,"" Mr Izzat told the al-Jazeera news channel. And he went on to criticise ""the excessive force"" of the security services. With multiple flashpoints across Egypt, many thousands of uniformed police, plain-clothed officers and paid thugs have been deployed. They line the bridges and main routes into central Cairo. While they remain strong and well-resourced, there have been unprecedented sights. In one case, a group of protesters tried to push an armoured vehicle into the River Nile. Attempts to close down mobile phone communications and access to Facebook, Twitter and Blackberrry messenger appear to have been ineffective in preventing the co-ordination of opposition activities. Demonstrators in the capital have simply regrouped in traditional gathering places downtown - such as Ramses Square and Tahrir Square. With Egyptians tuned into Arab satellite stations to watch dramatic scenes unfold, a curfew in Egypt's main cities was announced. However, as sirens blared on the darkening streets it was unclear how effective this will be.",1,476
"The athlete set records for the fastest marathon for a double amputee and has won two Paralympic 200m gold medals. Photographer David Baird has charted Whitehead's progress for many years, including his training build-up to the Games. Whitehead said the resulting exhibition was ""quite special."" ""There's lots of photos around my 40 marathons in 40 days and the success and the struggle that we had in that, but also the training towards London and Rio and the different aspects of training,"" he said. ""The ability to showcase your talent on different levels but also what goes into it is quite special. ""For me this is really important to show not just what my success looks like but also the people involved in that."" The runner, from Nottingham, successfully defended his Paralympic gold medal in the 200m T42 in Rio after taking up the discipline because there was no marathon in his category. In 2013 he ran from John O'Groats to Land's End in 40 back to back marathons. Mr Baird said the photographs give people a sense of the training required and is now working with Paralympic hopefuls. ""Quite often in training it looks very lonely, all that time in the gym and on the track. ""The athletes get a lot of exposure during the games but they can be forgotten for the years in between, I think it's important they get the recognition for the preparation work they do.""

"Sean Earle snatched the bag of Linda Clarke, who had cut her wrists and walked out of hospital before sitting on a ledge over the M602 in Salford. After she fell to the ground, the 26-year-old ""saw his opportunity"" to steal her bag before running off, Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court heard. Earle, of Trevelyan Street, Salford, was bailed until sentencing on 17 July. Mrs Clarke, who had two daughters and was a full-time carer of her autistic son, walked out of Salford Royal Hospital in the early hours of 17 April. CCTV footage showed Earle walking the same way before approaching her as she made her way to the bridge nearby. A driver, who saw Mrs Clarke and Earle on the bridge, decided to turn back to check on her welfare. He saw Earle running away and realised the 55-year-old woman had ""gone over the wall and is lying on the carriageway,"" prosecutor Shazia Aslam said. Police were called but Mrs Clarke, who was also a grandmother, was pronounced dead in hospital. It was then discovered that her handbag was missing and a policeman identified Earle from the CCTV footage. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Clarke's husband Gary said his wife's death had devastated the family and Earle had ""added to our pain"" with his ""despicable"" theft. Lorna Wincote, defending, said Earle was not charged with anything related to Mrs Clarke's death after an ""extensive"" police investigation. ""He is also a person who suffers from his own mental health issues,"" she added.",1,478
"All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be ""looking very closely"" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known. Prof Liu, from Hefei University of Technology in China, said the discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the archosauromorphs by 50 million years. The mode of reproduction in Dinocephalosaurus also points to how the sex of its offspring was determined. Co-author Prof Chris Organ, from Montana State University, added: ""Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest. ""We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds."" Prof Benton explained: ""This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic. ""It's great to see such an important step forward in our understanding of the evolution of a major group coming from a chance fossil find in a Chinese field."" The possibility that an eggshell once surrounded the embryo but was not preserved in fossilisation could not be ruled out, said Prof Benton. But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones. Furthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it was alerted to reports of a fire within a property at just after 10:25. Six appliances were sent. One local spoke of hearing a bang. A rest centre at Froghall Community Centre was being set up for residents. A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""Six appliances attended and five firefighters dressed in protective breathing apparatus extinguished the fire using a high-power hose.

"The 23-year-old crowdfunded her way to Rio to compete in the women's single sculls, but finished 20th in the finals last Saturday. However, six days later Snoop Dogg posted a photo of Ukogu on Instagram, telling his nearly 12 million followers that she had won a silver medal - Nigeria's first at these Games: We all have to admit that following the Olympics can be confusing, with heats and umpteen rounds before the finals. Ukogu did get through her heats, and made the quarter-finals, but needed to finish in the top three to progress to the semis with a chance of getting a medal. She came fifth in her race so was demoted to the ""CD"" semis and final. In her ""final D"" race she came second, but her time of 7:44:76 put her 18 places below silver. What may have led Snoop Dogg up the garden path was a tweet last Saturday suggesting she had won silver for Nigeria: This then got picked up on Monday and was retweeted a bit: More of such tweets appeared on Friday - though it's not clear if this was before or after Snoop Dogg instagrammed. At the time of writing, his post had nearly 97,000 likes and more than 1,000 comments, some of which pointed out that it was not true - with others saying Ukogu was still impressive and made Nigerians proud. ""We have to celebrate her for the sacrifices and selfless service to the nation,"" posted Olufemisylvester. And there is no denying that Chierika Ukogu has made history. She is the first athlete to represent Nigeria in a rowing event at the Olympics. Known to her friends as ""Coco,"" she raised 15,000 (PS11,400) herself as she said the Nigerian Rowing Federation was not able to give her financial support. She was born in the US to Nigerian parents and became hooked on rowing at senior school. She continued to row at university - she plans to become a doctor. ""I put medical school on hold to dedicate my time to training,"" she said on her GoFundMe page. ""I hope that my athletic endeavours will inspire other Nigerians to take up rowing and experience the same joy I feel every time I'm on the water."" Her enthusiasm is a soothing balm to what has been a bumpy Rio ride for Nigeria - Africa's most populous nation. The men's football team, playing for bronze later on Saturday, is Nigeria's only realistic medal hope. The footballers only arrived hours before their first match. They had been delayed in the US city of Atlanta because of problems paying for their flight. And Nigeria's Olympic kit only turned up a few days ago, after most athletes had completed their events. For the popular Nigerian actress Genevieve Nnaji, Ukogu's success was all about ""girl power."" Nnaji who also posted her praise on Instagram on Friday, but did not make the mistake about the medal. She said: ""She believed in herself, strangers believed in her..... That's how we change the narrative. Stop asking your country what she's done for you and start asking what you can do for her.""",1,483
"They are worried about losing a rare rest day and the effect on their awards night, Paul Struthers said. The move - supported by top female rider Hayley Turner - could provide the sport with a windfall of more than PS1m. But the organiser of a Good Friday charity open day has called the proposal ""greedy and selfish."" Pros Would give sport a commercial lift, with extra prize money, betting and racecourse revenue Could regenerate the all-weather programme, with a'Champions Series' style schedule building to a Good Friday finale Racing on most other Bank Holidays attracts good crowds Cons Jockeys already struggle to spend time with families and some object to Good Friday racing for religious reasons Annual Lesters awards, where jump and flat jockeys celebrate success, are held the night before Popular Lambourn and Middleham Open Days take place on the same day Several trainers and others within the industry have also voiced their backing for what they see as a unique chance to exploit a valuable commercial opportunity. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has invited applications from racecourses to stage fixtures on Good Friday for the first time from next year. While a final decision is not expected before 30 September, it is understood the governing body is minded to allow two fixtures on 18 April, 2014, provided they meet criteria around prize money and forecast attendances. BHA chief executive Paul Bittar said his organisation was aware of the ""historical sensitivities,"" but added that it was ""a significant leisure day, so we are keen to fully assess the opportunity for racing."" Arena Racing, which owns Lingfield racecourse, has proposed a PS1m championship meeting at the Surrey track on Good Friday. It would form part of a wider revamp of the all-weather winter racing schedule, while Musselburgh in Scotland would also like to race. But jockeys are concerned they will lose one of only four blank days in the racing calendar, and one which falls the day after their popular annual Lesters awards - the sport's equivalent of the Oscars named after legendary jockey Lester Piggott. Jockey Hayley Turner (Racing UK) ""A lot of other sports take place on Good Friday and I think racing is adopting a slightly old-school attitude. ""We are in the entertainment business and as jockeys we want to ride in front of bigger crowds, which is more likely to happen during weekends and holidays."" Trainer Charlie Brooks (Daily Telegraph): ""There is no computer in the world that can quantify the long-term benefits of engaging with the next generation of racing fans at these open days. ""And fostering a love of the racehorse rather than bouncy castles, cheap beer and tribute bands is the right way forward."" ""Most jockeys are unhappy about the idea. It would leave just three days off [23, 24 and 25 December],"" said Struthers, whose organisation represents about 450 riders. ""They can choose not to ride, but a trainer or owner who wanted them is unlikely to have them again. ""If this goes through, a blank day elsewhere in the calendar is vital for the survival of the Lesters. ""Plans for more investment in all-weather racing are welcome, but the logic that there has to be a Good Friday finale does not stack up."" He said some jockeys, including Irish Catholics, were against the idea on religious grounds. ""It is going to be a huge dilemma for those who see it as a religious issue,"" said Struthers. He said there were two ""weak"" Saturdays in late MarchApril where a big all-weather race day could be accommodated. Struthers acknowledges some jockeys are in favour of another chance to showcase their talents - and Turner is one of them. ""I am a little surprised by the opposition to it, some of which has been very aggressive,"" Turner, who has just returned from being sidelined with a broken ankle, told Racing UK. ""Coming from a jockey, who has just spent five weeks on the sidelines, I relish the opportunity to be riding as much as I can, especially in the higher profile races."" At the racing centre of Lambourn in Berkshire, more than 30 trainers open their yards to the public on Good Friday with an estimated 10,000 people meeting horses and trainers. A similar event has been held for 20 years in Middleham, North Yorkshire. Lambourn organising committee chairman Mark Smyly said his event - which was called off due to waterlogging this year - raised about PS60,000 in 2012 for charity, much of which went to a housing project for working and retired stable staff. ""It is not just racing people who come to the open day. The PR for the sport is enormous and to do away with that is just greedy and selfish,"" said Smyly, who helped to run the first open day 23 years ago. ""It brings in a lot of new owners to the sport and there must be other days when they can have racing - why not make Easter Sunday a big day?"" An Arena Racing spokesman said they were aware of ""some opposition"" but declined to comment ahead of the BHA decision.",1,484
"Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks ""resilience.""

In a risk assessment report published by OCCG, it said: ""Patient safety in the 111 service will be compromised due to performance issues caused by a lack of resilience to peaks in demand."" OCCG has ranked the phone line as a ""red risk,"" the highest category for risks to patient safety. It comes after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph in June recorded a worker at SCAS's 111 call centre in Bicester, Oxfordshire, saying all staff had ""killed someone indirectly."" After the report prompted an investigation in January, the Care Quality Commission said the service was ""safe and effective."" The ambulance trust said that a 16 increase in call volume meant phone handlers could not answer calls ""as quickly as we would like."" In January alone, the service received 173,563 calls on both their 999 and 111 phone lines. SCAS has also said that a recruitment shortfall has contributed to issues in responding to calls.

"Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun. Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, which is 250 times as massive as our home star. But the new survey finds many more of the super-objects in a tight patch of sky within the Large Magellanic Cloud. ""In just a tiny bit of this satellite galaxy, we see perhaps a couple of dozen stars with more than a 100 solar masses, of which nine are in a tight core just a few light-years across,"" explained Prof Paul Crowther from Sheffield University, UK. ""But that two dozen number - that's probably more than are in the entire Milky Way Galaxy for this type of star,"" he told BBC News. The observations are to be published shortly in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. They build on earlier work reported in 2010 that first described R136a1 - the most massive and most luminous star identified to date. That study used data gathered principally by a ground-based telescope in Chile. This follow-up research employed the pin-sharp resolution and ultraviolet sensitivity of the orbiting Hubble telescope to tease out yet more detail. In 2010, astronomers saw four monster stars including R136a1 in the central core. Thanks to Hubble, they detect a further five. The stars are not only extremely massive, but they are also extremely bright. Together, these nine stars outshine our Sun by a factor of 30 million, said Prof Crowther. ""Because they are so massive, they are all close to their so-called Eddington limit, which is the maximum luminosity a star can have before it rips itself apart; and so they've got really powerful outflows. They are shedding mass at a fair rate of knots,"" the astronomer added - up to an Earth mass of gaseous material per month. The question is why this tight corner of space, located in the Tarantula Nebula of the LMC, harbours so many giants. Prof Crowther thinks it is because the gas and dust in the region has become compressed as the Large Magellanic Cloud has skirted the edge of the Milky Way. One thing is for sure - none of these monster stars will be around for more than a few million years. To burn so bright is to burn briefly. ""A lot of these stars will be in binaries (in pairs), and when they die they'll produce black holes, which will merge at some point in the dim and distant future. And when they do they'll produce gravitational waves. ""The first detection of gravitational waves [reported by Advanced LIGO last month] was from the merger of a pair of 30-solar-mass black holes. They probably came from 100-solar-mass stars."" and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",1,486
"Researchers hope to learn how much it weighed, how it moved and what it used its iconic back plates for. A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones into a computer and has digitally reconstructed the dinosaur. The specimen, nicknamed ""Sophie,"" has been acquired by the Natural History Museum in London. Although Stegosauruses are one of the most well known dinosaurs, they are among those that scientists know the least about. There are only six partial skeletons of the creature, which lived around 150 million years ago. It could grow to the size of a minibus and the gigantic plates which ran along its back were its most distinctive feature. Surprisingly, it was 100 years ago that the dinosaur's skeleton was properly assessed and scientifically described. Now, using medical imaging techniques and 3D modelling, researchers at the Natural History Museum hope to learn much more about this iconic creature. Prof Paul Barrett, who is leading the research, said that they were particularly interested in finding out what stegosauruses used their plates for. ""We want to find out whether they were used for defence or whether they were used as a radiator to help the animal pick up or lose heat,"" he told BBC News. Sophie is 80 complete and is thought to be the most complete specimen in the world. Dr Charlotte Brassey, who is working with Prof Barrett, helped to scan in its 360 bones and digitally recreate it on her computer as a detailed 3D model. ""I reconstructed the skeleton to see what it might have looked like and then began to reconstruct the muscles and how they connected with the skeleton. From that we can begin to say how effective its muscles were and eventually in the future we would like to reconstruct how it moved,"" she told BBC News.

""We were literally invaded with calls for interviews and people turning up at our house, notes being put through our door,"" she said. ""My youngest daughter was being bullied at school and my eldest son having to lose his job because he couldn't cope with the attention he was getting. ""So I know people will assume it was all done and dusted and everything but it was never that and even today we're still going through it."" Lewes Crown Court heard the maths teacher groomed the girl at his Eastbourne school. He was convicted of child abduction and admitted sex offence charges. The trial heard the pupil had just turned 15 when Forrest started a sexual relationship with her and they had sex in his car, in hotels and at his marital home. Fearing they were about to be exposed, Forrest booked them on a cross-Channel ferry from Dover to Calais. The mother said she was not prepared to talk about how the girl is at the moment. ""Through my investigations into child grooming.... children who are groomed do take many years to actually come to terms with what's happened to them and, until that point starts, the healing process can't happen,"" she said. ""The people who are doing this grooming are so cold and calculating in the way they do it. It's really difficult for parents to pick up on. ""When it came about I had no idea."" She said Forrest rang her and and told her there were rumours the pair were having a relationship. ""And then with that he completely broke down - he was sobbing, he was blaming her, saying she was going to ruin his life, she's going to ruin his career - his marriage is on the rocks,"" she said. ""I found myself in a situation where I was counselling him - going,'You don't have to worry. I'm so sorry my child has put you through this'.""",1,489
"The M8 westbound was closed for five hours at Newhouse in North Lanarkshire because of a jackknifed lorry, which also caused a diesel spillage. The M77A77 has reopened northbound at junction 8 Kilmaurs in East Ayrshire following an accident at 06:00. There was snow in the Inverness area and roads around Fort William and Glencoe were very icy. Head of network operations at Transport Scotland, Hugh Gillies, told BBC Radio Scotland some incidents had lasted for longer than they would have liked, and he urged drivers to remain cautious as the icy conditions continued. He added: ""There can be no complacency. It has been a difficult couple of days with the weather. ""Speaking to Met Office colleagues the forecast for the next three to four days remains challenging, so vigilance remains the case."" The Met Office has issued amber ""be prepared"" severe weather warnings for Central, Tayside and Fife, south west Scotland and Lothian and Borders for Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. A yellow ""be aware"" warning is in place for the Strathclyde area. Five schools in the Highland Council area are closed, according to the local authority's website. In Aberdeenshire, the council warned that there had been some changes to school transport because of the weather, with some school buses not running. In Glasgow, the Clydeside Expressway was closed westbound - leaving the city - at Finnieston due to an accident, but is now open.

BBC Travel online updates Scotland-wide travel updates BBC weather updates Met Office weather warnings Traveline Scotland The M8 in North Lanarkshire was closed westbound at junction six from 04:30 until 09:30 causing long delays. Northern Constabulary said the B9007 Ferness to Carrbridge road was closed at the snow gates. The A9 Causeway Mire had also been affected by snow. Many side roads in the Caithness area are also affected by lying snow. Drifting snow was making driving difficult on the A836 Tongue to Lairg road between Altnahara and Crask. All other routes were open and passable with care. Grampian Police said several routes were affected. A number of minor routes in the Formartine and Buchan area had lying snow, as did the A920 Huntly to Dufftown road near Dufftown, the A939 Ballater to Corgarff stretch between Ballater and Gairnshiel, and the A939 Cockbridge to Tomintoul road from Corgarff to the Lecht Ski Centre. Police said: ""If travelling, drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journey and to ensure that both they and their vehicle are suitably equipped and prepared for changeable wintry weather, to exercise caution and drive according to the prevailing weather and road conditions."" In Dumfries and Galloway, the freeze caused a spate of accidents with at least eight vehicles involved. The accidents were spread across the region from the A76 at Auldgirth to the A75 at Crocketford. Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said: ""We have seen a few incidents that have caused some disruption. That is why the Multi Agency Response Team and SGoRR remain operational. ""Our operating companies have also worked through the night, with over 120 gritters out on the trunk roads and motorways to treat every route at least once.

Organisers said the event will go ahead as planned, but a decision on Sunday's Great Manchester Run ""is expected in the next 24 hours."" The FA Cup final, EFL play-offs and the PGA Championship are also this week. An eight-year-old girl was among those killed in Monday's suicide bombing at Manchester Arena, at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK terror threat level has been raised to its highest level of ""critical,"" meaning further attacks may be imminent. Manchester United cancelled a news conference on Tuesday, due to be held prior to their Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday, and will wear black armbands for the match. The club said: ""Our thoughts are with the victims and their families at this terribly difficult time."" United's players held a minute's silence at training on Tuesday, and the club closed its megastore, museum, cafe and stadium tours to the public. A staff event scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Manager Jose Mourinho said: ""We are all very sad about the tragic events; we cannot take out of our minds and our hearts the victims and their families. ""We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. ""I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one."" Ajax manager Peter Bosz said: ""What happened yesterday evening in Manchester is something we all feel in Ajax and on behalf of all of us at Ajax we express our sympathies with the victims that fell. The feeling that prevails is the final does not have the glow it should have. ""Tomorrow evening should be a football feast but because of the events in Manchester we are affected. It is horrible. My sympathies are heartfelt."" Football's European governing body Uefa announced a minute's silence will be observed prior to the final. The opening ceremony will also be considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. Aleksander Ceferin, president of Uefa, said he was ""deeply saddened"" and shocked that ""so many innocent people lost their lives."" A Uefa statement said there was ""currently no specific intelligence"" to suggest Wednesday's game could be a target for further attacks. ""Uefa has been closely working with local authorities and the Swedish FA for many months and the terrorist risk had been taken into account since the very beginning of the project,"" it said. ""Furthermore, a number of additional security measures were implemented following the attacks in Stockholm last April."" There will be a minute's silence observed at Headingley cricket ground before England's one-day international against South Africa on Wednesday.

"Figures from the university admissions service, Ucas, show it was the highest number for five years. Students placed through clearing tend to be those who did not get the grades for their favoured courses. But a dip in university applications has left universities looking to fill more places than usual. There have been reports of some leading universities offering places through clearing. This year's early figure is nearly double the number of students placed through the system at the same point five years ago. Overall, 437,070 students have been accepted on to university courses - the vast majority getting the grades for their chosen places of study. This is down 1.3 on the same point last year, Ucas figures show. About 134,840 students are still registered as looking for places in clearing. Since 2013, universities have been able to recruit unlimited numbers of students who achieved certain grades in their A-levels. It comes after the proportion of candidates awarded top grades rose slightly on last year. Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant said with nearly 45,000 courses looking for students there was a huge amount of choice out there.",1,492
"Scores more are still missing in Teluk Wondama district after flash floods and landslides that were triggered when a river burst its banks. Hundreds of people have been injured and more than 5,000 are being housed in tents set up in emergency camps. The National Search and Rescue Agency and military have sent reinforcements to help deal with the disaster. The sudden flooding on Monday caught residents by surprise, officials said, contributing to the high death toll. The local airport has now reopened and roads have been largely cleared of debris, which is helping to speed up aid deliveries to the area, reports say. Navy warships had previously been used to carry tents, medical supplies and food to the disaster zone. Thousands of buildings, roads and bridges in five villages have been damaged or destroyed. The head of the the provincial relief agency, Dortheis Sawaki, said 104 bodies had been recovered, but many more people were missing and the death toll was expected to rise. ""It's a tragedy. The smell of rotting corpses is everywhere. Power is down. There's no clean water,"" she was quoted by AP as saying. Many parts of the country had been badly hit by heavy rains, winds and high waves this year, meteorologists said.",1,493
"Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as ""an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?"" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a ""witch hunt"" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: ""Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations."" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. ""I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,"" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. ""But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous."" Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, ""cocaine is against the law of the land."" There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: ""We can't have a belt held hostage."" One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. ""Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,"" was Hatton's grim assessment. ""He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. ""But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same."" Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.",1,495

"Media playback is not supported on this device With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters. Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality. Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit. In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National. Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course. The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee... Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan. Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: ""We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters."" We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in. Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par. Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead. The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said,'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner. Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week. Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10. Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11. Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us. Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5 Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us. Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous. Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery. Media playback is not supported on this device Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard. Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one. Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting. Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking'this is what you practise for'. I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead. Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot. Media playback is not supported on this device Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet. Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused. Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt. Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt. Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers. Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row. Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip. Jonny: I was thinking'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot! Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is. Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood. Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green. Danny: He said:'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.' Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand. Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees. Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger. Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable. Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him:'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.' Danny: I'd done 80 of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before. Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more. Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters. Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting. Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off. Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does. Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him. Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true. Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now. Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.",1,497
"Nearly 25,000 signatures - 10 of Cardiff's voters - are needed to force a vote on the issue. But Labour councillor Ashley Govier told BBC Wales only about 8,000 have been collected. Cardiff council's Labour group said it was ""willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue."" The Mayor for Cardiff campaign was launched earlier this year with a budget of more than PS20,000. Daran Hill, from the campaign, said at the time that an elected mayor was a ""new, fresh idea"" that could ""energise the people of Cardiff."" There are currently 17 directly-elected mayors in England with more on the way, but there are none in Wales. Mr Govier, a councillor for Cardiff's Grangetown ward, said the debate has ""moved on"" and a regional mayor was now needed. ""We're not going to hit the target, especially because the council refused to allow online petitions,"" he said. ""We feel we've moved the debate on and the focus now needs to switch to a regional mayor for south east Wales. We have to go bigger."" Mr Govier claimed the Cardiff Capital Region City Deal - a funding package agreed between UK, Welsh and local government worth PS1.2bn over 20 years - was beginning to stall ""because of governance."" ""The region has to work together on infrastructure and transport,"" he said. ""A regional mayor is needed."" He added there are ""sympathetic ears throughout the region and across political parties."" Ceredigion is the only Welsh local authority to have had a referendum on the matter. Voters there rejected the idea in 2004 by a margin of nearly three to one. A spokeswoman for Cardiff council's Labour group said: ""Cardiff Labour are willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue, and as we have seen there is very little interest in introducing a further level of bureaucracy. ""The City Deal is definitely not stalling and is moving forward, despite uncertainty caused by Brexit. ""It will be a huge boost for Cardiff and the region, and suggestions to the contrary are just mischief making."" A Wales Office spokesman said: ""The Cardiff City Deal is the biggest of its kind in the UK and we are confident this ambitious project is on target."" The Welsh Government declined to comment in response to Mr Govier's comments.",1,498
"Kirsty McGuire, from Dover, Kent, said her son Codie McDowell was left screaming with pain. The accident in East Sussex has led his family to warn of the dangers of barbecues on beaches to prevent it happening to anyone else. But Rother council said disposal barbecues were banned from the beach. Ms McGuire said: ""He stood on it, yelped'just get it off me, get it off me' and that's when my brother's picked him up and all the bottom of his foot's just blistered."" She said when they looked at the sand they first realised it was bright red and then they saw the barbecue underneath it. ""How someone could just be so selfish and not put their rubbish in the bin,"" she said. ""It doesn't take long to put a barbecue out especially with the amount of sea that's there and dispose of it properly."" She added: ""I felt helpless. He was in so much pain and screaming and there's nothing that I could have done to prevent it and when he's laying there in hospital and he's'mummy take the pain away', obviously it breaks my heart."" She said her son now needed hospital visits every three or four days for his injuries. Councillor Simon Elford, tourism portfolio holder at Rother District Council, said: ""We were very sorry to hear at the injuries received by this young boy and wish him a speedy recovery. ""To ensure the safety of everyone using this popular beach, disposable barbecues are banned and our officers carry out regular checks of the beach during busy periods.""",1,499
"Foredowne Boarding Kennel is facing allegations about how dogs, seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and placed there, were kept without exercise. The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating. The kennel said it was staffed by ""animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs."" The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels. Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised. These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised. The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise. Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these. However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages. Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised. A spokesman for the kennels said: ""The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression. ""We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us. ""One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs."" The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had ""an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police."" The spokesman said: ""We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great. ""We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA. We are confident that we have abided by all the relevant rules and regulations."" A spokeswoman for Teignbridge District Council said: ""We take all complaints of animal welfare seriously and will be carrying out an investigation into the specific allegations that have been made."" Pit bulls Smokey and Lola were seized by police from the same owner over suspicions that the dogs were trained to attack. Their three puppies were seized at the same time. Mr Clark said: ""The three pit bull terrier pups came in at 11 weeks. They were initially exercised before deteriorating so much they were deemed unsafe. ""The police were informed and they went on to do at least six months with no exercise."" In a statement, Ch Supt Jim Nye said: ""Since 2012, we have seized and placed into kennels in the region of 200 dogs, of which only four were given a strict order not to exercise by Devon and Cornwall Police due to the dog's unpredictable and dangerous nature."" He said they included Stella, Gnasha - another pit bull, Smokey and Lola. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police added: ""As regards any other dogs the kennel has chosen not to walk during this time - there may be some - that is a decision made by the kennel as part of their duty of care for the animals they have. ""While we have individual care plans for all dogs which we have seized, ultimately the kennel maintains this duty of care.""",1,500

"Zeid Raad Al Hussein described the incident, in which 10 people were wounded, as ""extremely shocking."" Cizre has been the focus of an offensive by Turkey's army against the Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. Mr Al Hussein also expressed concern over reports that the man who filmed the incident was arrested. ""Filming an atrocity is not a crime but shooting unarmed civilians most certainly is,"" he said. ""It is essential that there is a thorough, independent, impartial investigation into this and any other events that have led to the wounding or killing of civilians."" The incident in Cizre, a predominantly Kurdish city, occurred on 20 January. Video footage posted online purporting to be of the immediate aftermath of the shooting shows people being loaded into ambulances amid screaming and the sound of explosions. Reports suggested that the group who came under fire were attempting to rescue people wounded in an earlier clashes. The video footage also appears to show that some of the group were pushing a cart loaded with bodies across the street, watched by an armoured military vehicle. Mr Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the victims had been ""apparently cut down in a hail of gunfire."" The unrest came just days after security forces killed 20 Kurdish militants in clashes in nearby Diyarbakir, according to the Turkish military. Three Turkish soldiers also died in a rebel attack, the military said. The region has suffered its worst violence in two decades since a ceasefire between the Turkish government and the PKK collapsed in July. The PKK, which has fought for autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish minority for decades, has been attacking security forces, while the army has been besieging Kurdish-dominated towns. The Turkish Human Rights Foundation says at least 198 civilians, including 39 children, have died in areas under curfew since August. Since July, more than 200 Turkish soldiers and policemen have been killed in attacks by the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and US. The European Union has called for an immediate ceasefire.",1,504

"On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at North Middlesex University Hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated ""inadequate."" The hospital said it was ""extremely sorry"" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the AE department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already ""turned a corner"" since the inspection. He said: ""A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. ""There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely."" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said ""urgent action"" was needed. ""The important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,"" he added Tottenham MP David Lammy said the ""damning"" report is ""even worse than I feared"" and demanded answers from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: ""It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal."" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement. The trust is now required to improve the care of patients in the emergency department by 26 August 2016 following a warning from the CQC.

"Invisible Edinburgh said the aim was to reveal a different side to Scotland's capital city. The tours start in the Grassmarket, Castle Terrace and Middle Meadow Walk and each has a different theme and is tailored to the guide's individual experience.

"Dickson carried his bat for 207 not out, as Shiv Thakor's maiden five-wicket haul saw Kent all out for 412. Derbyshire's Billy Godleman retired hurt without facing a ball after he was hit by a throw, before Chesney Hughes was bowled by James Tredwell for one. Matt Coles then dismissed Tom Taylor and Hamish Rutherford for ducks. Dickson resumed batting without Joe Denly, who retired overnight after the birth of his child, but remained unfazed throughout the day as he reached his century off 243 balls. The 24-year-old accelerated after going past three figures and made his second 100 runs off only 107 balls.

"Sentinel-1b was carried into orbit by a Soyuz rocket that flew out of Sinamary in French Guiana. The new platform will monitor shipping lanes for pollution and icebergs, and survey land surfaces for evidence of subsidence - to name just three of the myriad applications for radar imagery. Sentinel-1b will work alongside the 1a spacecraft, which was launched in 2014. Operating in the same orbit but separated by 180 degrees, the pair will be able to map the entire Earth every six days. This promises an avalanche of data - some five terabits per day - and both satellites are carrying laser communications systems to help get all the information to the ground. The Sentinels are a flagship space project for the European Union, which has committed billions of euros to the endeavour. The satellites fit into a programme the European Commission calls Copernicus, which draws together all sorts of data about the health of the Earth, not just from orbit. Copernicus will support a multitude of services, ranging from air quality updates to crop-performance monitoring, from water-resource management to transport infrastructure planning. Esa is acting as the technical agent, procuring the satellites for the EU. Sentinel-1b is the fourth to launch, with more platforms to follow. ""At the moment, we have around 36,000 self-registered users (for Sentinel data), who have downloaded already about four million images, mainly from Sentinel-1a; although this is now picking up because Sentinel-2a (a visible colour camera) has just become operational as well,"" explained Esa's Earth-observation director Prof Volker Liebig. The Soyuz' lift-off from French Guiana occurred at 18:02 local time (21:02 GMT), following three postponements in previous days due to meteorological and technical issues. The 2.1-tonne Sentinel was ejected 23 minutes into the ascent. The planned injection altitude was 686km (426 miles). ""We will not start commissioning until we have raised ourselves to the proper orbit (693km), which could take two weeks, a maximum of three,"" Esa's Sentinel-1 project manager, Ramon Torres told BBC News. ""We will then go into detail with the calibration of the radar instrument. We plan the commissioning review (to declare Sentinel-1b operational) for 14 September."" Four other satellites were put in orbit on the same Soyuz flight. Three were university cubesats. One, however, was a French space agency mission called Microscope - a fundamental physics experiment. This satellite will spend the next couple of years investigating the so-called ""equivalence principle."" It is the concept in general relativity that holds that gravity accelerates all objects equally, regardless of their mass or composition. The Apollo 15 astronaut Dave Scott famously demonstrated the principle on the Moon in 1971 when he dropped a geology hammer and a falcon feather. Both hit the surface of the airless body at the same time. Microscope's examination will be much more exacting, of course. It will ""drop"" metal cylinders made from titanium-aluminium-vanadium and platinum-rhodium - to see if they also fall at the same rate in the vacuum of space. The experiment can sense accelerations that are a millionth of a billionth of Earth's gravity. and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",1,509
"The players, who each represent one of the four Welsh regions, have 160 Wales caps between them. Dual contracts are funded 60 by the Welsh Rugby Union and 40 by the regions. ""Having our best players in Wales is vital to the future health of our game,"" the WRU's Martyn Phillips said. The WRU chief executive continued: ""Seeing international players re-sign these contracts highlights the success of the programme as we continue to work hard to drive the game forward. ""We have made no secret of that and the importance both on and off the field at regional and national level in Welsh players playing their rugby in Wales."" The quartet have made more than 370 regional appearances between them. Cardiff Blues' Wales captain Warburton, 28, was the first Welsh player to be given a dual contract in September 2014. Flanker Lydiate returned to Welsh rugby on a national dual contract in December 2014 when he joined Ospreys following a spell in France with Racing Metro. Scarlets prop Lee, who has won 26 caps for Wales, signed his first dual contract in January 2015. Newport Gwent Dragons' Amos, 22, signed his national dual contract in December 2014 and has won 10 caps for Wales. Amos' deal is a boost to the Dragons as he had been linked with a move away from Rodney Parade.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The Premier League side led when Calum Chambers superbly curled in from 18 yards with the outside of his foot. Championship side Burnley hit back as Sam Vokes headed in Tendayi Darikwa's cross and an Alex Iwobi interception denied Andre Gray after the break. Sanchez - making his first start since November - finished coolly to win it. The Chile international - who has made just one substitute appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in November - was lively throughout and turned in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross after Darikwa was dispossessed in midfield. There can be no doubt the holders deserved a place in Sunday's draw as they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and chances, though Burnley created a nervy finish. The impressive Gray caught sight of goal late on but could not get meaningful power in his shot and as the visitors threw bodies forward, substitute Theo Walcott missed a glorious chance to add a third on the break as he failed to round Tom Heaton. Arsenal's match programme featured the FA Cup trophy on the front cover along with the words ""To have and to hold."" They move a step closer to emulating the Blackburn Rovers side of 1886 by winning a third FA Cup in a row, though this was far from vintage. They made nine changes to the side beaten by Chelsea last weekend but still fired 23 shots at the Burnley goal as Arsene Wenger maintained his record of only losing to lower-league opposition once in 41 FA Cup ties. Solid appearances from the likes of Chambers and Iwobi show he has a squad capable of maintaining a challenge in this competition but the anxious moments - particularly with the ball in the air in their box - will continue prompt some concern. Mohamed Elneny saw more of the ball than any other player - with 100 touches - on his first outing since joining for PS5m from Basel earlier this month. His completion of 96 of his passes was impressive but as a deep midfielder, he often found himself with plenty of time on the ball, meaning there will be tougher tests to come. ""I felt he started a bit cautious, played a bit secure,"" said Wenger of Elneny. ""He became more adventurous. It will take him some time to adjust to the power side of our game here, but the intelligence, the mobility and the technical level are good."" While Elneny was steady between the penalty areas, Sanchez was pivotal inside the box. He did not break stride to slam home his goal, created the opener for Chambers and looked lively throughout. His return could be crucial ahead of a key February when Arsenal play the likes of leaders Leicester, Barcelona and Manchester United. Like Arsenal, Burnley sit third in their respective table and their offering at the Emirates shows they have the grit needed to win promotion back to the top tier at the first time of asking. Gray missed an early one-on-one chance and looked set to put his side 2-1 up after the re-start but for Iwobi's last-ditch intervention. His manager Sean Dyche was bold in making just two changes with a league fixture at Sheffield Wednesday to come on Tuesday. But the Clarets looked cohesive and more finishing of the quality Vokes displayed could have asked tough questions of the Premier League side. They undoubtedly look capable of staying the pace in the second tier. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: ""Burnley are a good side. For the first 20 minutes we looked quite in control but when they equalised suddenly you could see, energy, commitment, and we had to dig deep to win the game. Every free-kick you worry because Sam Vokes is very strong in the air and he scored their goal - they are strong on set pieces and we needed to be alert."" Burnley manager Sean Dyche: ""It was a closer-run affair this year, and we had some good chances. I'm really pleased with the growth my players have shown in that year, but we didn't quite have enough and ultimately the disappointment is we haven't gone through."" Arsenal host Southampton on Tuesday - where they could go top of the Premier League - and Burnley travel to Sheffield Wednesday on the same night as they bid to close a four-point gap to the automatic promotion places.

"The 25-year-old midfielder had received approaches from Scottish Premiership rivals Dundee United and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Manager Alan Archibald said: ""Steven has proved over the last few seasons what a valuable part of the squad he is. ""It came as no surprise that Steven had offers from other Premiership clubs."" Lawless, who joined Thistle from Motherwell in 2012, made 40 appearances this season, scoring five goals. Thistle are also waiting to hear from Frederic Francs and Gary Miller after contract offers to the defenders. Caley Thistle, who finished two places above the Glasgow side in seventh, had also made approaches to Lawless' midfield team-mates, Stuart Bannigan and Abdul Osman.

"The sculpture, depicting a sprawled murder victim surrounded by police tape, was crowned winner of the Cornwall Beach Games sandcastle competition. But Devon and Cornwall Police was criticised after boasting officers tweeted about their victory. Labour councillor Hannah Toms said some would find it ""very offensive."" The force said it was a ""fun event"" and officers had not intended to cause any offence. Ms Toms acknowledged officers had intended to be ""light-hearted"" but said the sandcastle ""somewhat misses the mark and is in a bit of poor taste."" ""I like a joke as much as the next person but this is a family beach event,"" she said. ""As a parent I would not be very happy to explain to my child what it was all about. ""It's trivialising quite a serious matter."" Ms Toms added: ""I think there's a level of sexual stereotyping with the large bottom and the large breasts. Police have been working really hard to break down barriers on reporting sex crimes and I don't think this image really helps their cause."" Reaction on social media was mixed, with some defending the sandcastle. Hazel Jago said on Facebook: ""So it's a team of police officers representing the type of work they deal with. What's the problem!? There is always someone that will whinge about something."" Lorraine Lardon said: ""People need an injection of humour."" A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: ""If any offence has been cause by the nature of the sculpture, this was never intended and we apologise for that.""",1,515

"Ajinkya Rahane became the fifth Indian to score centuries in both innings of a Test match as they declared on 267-5. In reply, captain Hashim Amla (23 not out) took 46 balls to score a run, as South Africa made 72 in as many overs. A 300-plus target has been reached just once on Indian soil, when the home team struck 387-4 to defeat England in 2008. India resumed 403 runs ahead on 190-4 but skipper Virat Kohli added only five runs to his overnight 83 before a low Kyle Abbott delivery trapped him leg before to end the only century partnership of the series at 154. Rahane, the only centurion of the series, was not to be denied another hundred, however. The 27-year-old slog-swept Imran Tahir over mid-wicket for his second six of the innings and flicked Dean Elgar for another to move into the 90s. He joined Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar (three times), Rahul Dravid (twice) and Kohli as the only India batsman to reach three figures twice in the same Test match. South Africa blocked resolutely after left-hander Elgar was caught at slip in the fifth over, with India spinner Ravi Jadeja conceding only 10 runs from his 23 overs. The usually destructive AB de Villiers maintained the team tactic, using 33 balls to score his first run. His partnership with the captain did not produce a single run in the first 10 overs, but both batsmen survived to retain their team's hopes of avoiding defeat. A 3-0 series victory for India would put them second in the world rankings behind the South Africans, who will lose top spot if they lose their next Test series at home to England, which begins on 26 December.",1,518
"Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's programme was pushed through without debate, according to parliamentary speaker Salim al-Juburi. Under the plan, Mr Abadi will cut spending and eliminate senior posts. It follows recent anti-government protests over an unreliable electricity supply amid a major heatwave. Thousands of people have turned out in Baghdad and other cities to vent their anger at the authorities and pressurise them to make changes. Iraq's system of sharing government jobs has long been criticised for promoting unqualified candidates and encouraging corruption. The country has three vice-presidents - two from the Shia Muslim majority and one from the Sunni Muslim minority - and three deputy prime ministers - a Shia, a Sunni and a Kurd (also a Sunni). As a result of the reforms, senior political appointments will no longer be based on sectarian or party quotas, and the posts of vice-president and deputy PM will be abolished. Mr Abadi's seven-point plan also includes a requirement for a number of government positions to be filled with political independents - a move aimed at cracking down on corruption. Officials' benefits will also be reduced. The changes come after weeks of protests by voters angry at the way the country is governed and at the lack of investment in infrastructure. In some areas of Iraq it is common to have only a few hours of electricity each day. Tensions have become particularly fraught during a heatwave that has seen temperatures rise to 51C (123F). Frequent power cuts have made the sweltering conditions even more unbearable. Many Iraqis have cautiously welcomed the passing of the reform package, seen as a victory for Mr Abadi. But he still faces pressure to ensure the measures are properly implemented. Mr Juburi said a complementary plan containing even more reforms was needed, and called on Mr Abadi to sack ministers who were guilty of negligence and corruption.",1,519
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son is the first member of the UK Royal family to have his first birthday marked by a new coin. The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July. The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne. It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014. Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: ""We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. ""The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies... ""Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the PS5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations."" The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost PS80 each from the Royal Mint. The heraldic royal arms incorporates the four quarterings of the royal arms, each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek, a sprig of shamrock and a crown. It was originally created for the Queen and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New York in 1960. George's birth and his christening were also marked with commemorative coins.",1,520
"To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on later in the match. However, for as tricky as the surface became - and some deliveries did do a lot - there were too many dismissals in England's second innings in particular that were not down to the pitch. The tourists were shown the way initially by Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in the first innings, then by opening pair Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed in the second. Yet, English collapses - Michael Vaughan has referred to a ""little disease"" when panic appears to set in - were common. Four wickets for 29 runs and then four wickets for 30 runs in the first innings, eight wickets for 68 runs on the final day. It ultimately comes down to a batsman's state of mind. When you get a difficult delivery or the ball misbehaves, it can be very hard to put that out of your thoughts, but that is what the very best are able to do. The ability to clear your mind and focus on the next delivery is a skill my Test Match Special colleague Geoffrey Boycott speaks of so often. Media playback is not supported on this device So it seems that the next three Tests in this series will be about England's mindset. Can they play every ball on its merits? Can they keep their chins up if they lose the toss? Can they be positive without being reckless? Can they remember that they have played some good cricket? Do they believe that they can beat India? The answers to those questions are not straightforward because India is such a difficult place to tour. We knew from the start that playing five matches here straight after two in Bangladesh was going to be difficult in terms of managing morale and keeping spirits high. England do not have to look too far into the past for inspiration. They came from behind to win here four years ago. Going further into the past, the 1984-85 tour led by David Gower that I was part of was a real success because the togetherness of the team helped us overcame everything that was thrown at us. Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, was assassinated hours after the touring party arrived. The UK's deputy high commissioner Percy Norris later suffered the same fate, a day after hosting a reception for the England team. England stayed out there despite fears the tour would be cancelled, then lost the first Test because of some questionable umpiring. Yet, England came back to win that series 2-1 and that is the mindset that the class of 2016 have to adopt. If they can, India can be beaten because we have already seen that these are two evenly matched sides. The hosts' only advantage is they have greater experience playing in these conditions. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's leading Test wicket-taker this year, does not look too frightening when conditions are not in his favour. The same can be said for his partner in crime Ravindra Jadeja. These are bowlers that can be handled. India also have plenty of batsmen yet to register runs. Openers KL Rahul and Murali Vijay both need a score, as do Ajinkya Rahane and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. Yes, Cheteshwar Pujara is in good form and captain Virat Kohli was in stellar touch in Visakhapatnam - he scored 248 runs and the winning margin was 246, so imagine the boon it would be for England if they can remove him cheaply. Not that the tourists do not have personnel issues of their own. Ben Duckett, who has made only 18 runs in three innings, looks very unlikely to play in the third Test in Mohali. England got into a muddle by not opening the batting with Hameed in Bangladesh and now both Gary Ballance and Duckett have failed at number four. The next available option appears to be Jos Buttler, one of the most exciting limited-overs players in the world. Is he the answer in the top order of a Test line-up against the spinning ball? We just do not know. Add to that the fact Buttler has played only one first-class match in the past year and there will be a lot of pressure on him if he is chosen to play in the next Test. Anyone saying with certainty that Buttler is the cavalry to solve England's problems is making a very big statement. Spinner Zafar Ansari is another who looks set to miss out on playing in the third Test. He may well have been left out anyway in order for England to play a fourth pace bowler, but he had a poor time with both ball and bat in Visakhapatnam. Those two aside, the other players that England have used in this series will all feel good. Cook, Hameed, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Stokes and Bairstow have all made runs. Adil Rashid is really looking the part as a Test spin bowler, James Anderson has made an excellent return from injury and Chris Woakes will be raring to go after being rested for the second Test. The only question England will have is over the fitness of Stuart Broad, who returned his best bowling figures in India with a strained tendon in his foot. India can be beaten and England certainly have the ability. Do they have the mentality? Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.",1,521
"Revised growth estimates now suggest the construction industry shrank in the first quarter of 2012, but by less than previously thought. Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean the overall economy narrowly avoided falling into recession for a second time. The ONS is due to give official confirmation of this in June. The revised figures show the construction sector shrank by 5 in the first three months of 2012, less than the 5.4 contraction initially reported. The ONS gives its final estimates for growth in June, and if other parts of the economy remain unchanged, the economy as a whole would register zero growth, rather than a contraction of 0.1. The economy needs to register two consecutive quarters of negative growth to be in recession. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor However, the ONS may also revise the growth of other parts of the economy when it publishes its final estimates in June, such as the much larger services sector, which may offset the gains in construction. Construction accounts for less than 7 of the UK economy, whereas the services sector makes up about three quarters of output. Despite this, the construction sector's weakness has been blamed for dragging down economic growth. The ONS figures showed that construction output fell again in the first three months of this year, reaching its lowest level in 15 years. It was down 2.4 compared the last quarter of 2012. Output has fallen by nearly a fifth since the height of the construction boom in 2008. The ONS will publish the Quarterly National Accounts on 27 June.",1,522
"In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments - even though she has admitted it could bankrupt her. Ms Yau and fellow party member Sixtus Leung won elections in September, gaining more than 55,000 votes between them. Ms Yau, a daughter of two civil servants, had little previous political experience, and made headlines for edging out a veteran politician to win a seat. The Chinese Studies graduate had been involved in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, when tens of thousands of people, including large numbers of students, took to the streets demanding fully democratic elections in Hong Kong. She describes the protests as an important part of her political awakening. After the movement failed to win any concessions from Beijing, Ms Yau and Mr Leung became involved in a new political party - Youngspiration - that campaigns against mainland China's influence on Hong Kong, and advocates a ""Hong Kong first"" approach. The party struck a nerve with many young Hong Kongers unhappy with China and disillusioned with traditional pro-democracy parties, who they argue have failed to achieve any reform. But, after their election victory, things quickly spiralled out of control. Ms Yau and Mr Leung sparked a furore when they were being sworn in last month. Instead of pledging allegiance to the ""Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China,"" the duo swore allegiance to the ""Hong Kong nation,"" used a term considered derogatory towards China, and displayed a banner that read ""Hong Kong is not China."" Their oaths were invalidated, and thousands of people protested against their actions, demanding they be removed from parliament. A top Chinese official even likened the duo to ""two cancer cells - if you don't care about it, it will continue to hurt your body."" The Hong Kong government launched a court case to disqualify them. And the Chinese government also decided to intervene - issuing a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong's law on oath taking, to say that any oath that is not ""sincere"" should be automatically disqualified. After losing the court case, Ms Yau and Mr Leung were disqualified as legislators - and are now also bombarded with angry comments on social media, where people accuse them of being useless, politically naive, or insulting their country. But for all the controversy surrounding her, Ms Yau comes across as mild-mannered and determined in person - and less slick or media trained than many other politicians. ""We know that appealing the court decision will cost a lot,"" she says. ""We may face bankruptcy, but we have no choice."" She is concerned that if the case is not challenged, it may set a legal precedent for other pro-independence legislators to be disqualified, which would allow the government to ""negate the results of a democratic vote."" She says she believes in independence for Hong Kong because the ""One Country, Two Systems"" model under which it is governed, after it was handed back to China from the British in 1997, is ""a failed experiment."" Despite the model, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, ""in these few years we have seen the PRC [People's Republic of China] government having direct interventions into the internal affairs of Hong Kong."" ""We have to find another way to solve this problem,"" she says. ""One solution may be independence - or maybe we can find another kind of solution, but right now I can't think of any other solutions."" It is true that there has been growing anger in Hong Kong at perceived Chinese involvement in its affairs. In particular, the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers who published books critical of mainland China in late 2015 sparked concerns over Hong Kong's future. But a majority of people in Hong Kong do not support independence - or think that calls for independence are part of the problem, not the solution. Hong Kong relies on China for much of its food and water supplies - as well as much of its trade - and the Chinese government has shown that it has zero tolerance for moves towards independence from any of its territories. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, supported democratic reform in Hong Kong - but recently said that independence for Hong Kong is ""something which is not going to happen."" He has argued that the campaign for independence ""dilutes support for democracy and makes a mockery of a serious political argument,"" and that it would be ""a tragedy"" if the ""moral high ground"" of those seeking democracy was lost. Veteran democracy activist Martin Lee has even said he felt suspicious of Ms Yau and Mr Leung's actions, saying that they are ""giving [Beijing] the excuse"" to destroy Hong Kong's judicial independence. Some have even accused Ms Yau and Mr Leung of secretly working with Beijing to undermine Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Ms Yau flatly denies this, and says her party has faced such accusations ever since it was founded. ""There are no external forces telling us what to do, to make long term plans, or betray Hong Kong."" Looking amused, she adds: ""If we really were undercover agents, surely we'd still be in the legislative council - we wouldn't have let ourselves get kicked out, would we?"" Ms Yau is known for being outspoken. She supported gay marriage in her election campaign - despite receiving criticism for it - and also raised eyebrows when she said that Hong Kong's housing shortage meant that young people had ""no room to bang."" But a lot of the comments about Ms Yau have focused on her gender and appearance, rather than her policies. One newspaper wrote articles about what she wore to rallies, highlighting what they called her ""protest look,"" while others nicknamed her ""goddess"" in reference to her appearance. And the sexism appears to have stepped up a notch since the oath-taking controversy. At one pro-Beijing protest, demonstrators stuck a photo of Ms Yau on a sex doll - and internet commentators have shared photos of Ms Yau's dress being hiked up during a scuffle in parliament. Ms Yau says she believes the sexist attacks are ""not because of my gender - it's because my ideology is different from theirs."" However, experts have argued that the remarks are indicative of gender stereotyping in Hong Kong media - and worry that they could put off other women from entering politics. As for Ms Yau, she says she will continue to work to fulfil her campaign pledges - even if she loses her appeal and her seat in parliament. ""The fact is that many Hong Kongers take [independence] as an aim for the future of Hong Kong,"" and the government can't ignore those voices, she says. ""I hope in the future, Hong Kong people have the power to choose their destiny and the future they want - whatever it is they decide to choose.""

"A 25-year-old woman testified that Larry Nassar molested her from the age of six until 12 during family visits to his Michigan home. Mr Nassar, 53, is accused by more than 60 former patients and athletes of sexual abuse during pelvic procedures. He is facing separate federal charges for possession of child pornography. After testimony at a court in Mason, Michigan, Judge Donald Allen ordered Mr Nassar to stand trial on three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person under 13 years old. The accused, a sports doctor who treated US Olympic gymnasts, faces up to life in prison if convicted. He was stripped of his medical licence last month, amid at least six criminal and civil lawsuits. The unnamed woman, who was neither a patient nor an athlete, testified against him for more than two hours on Friday. She detailed how Mr Nassar allegedly molested her during family visits to his home in Holt, Michigan, from 1998 to 2005. ""Almost every time I was there for a couple of years, something occurred,"" she told the court. Some of the abuse happened under a blanket as he sat next to her on the sofa, while her unwitting older brother sat nearby, she said. When she tried to tell her parents about the molestation, they did not believe her. ""They made me feel like I had done something terrible,"" she said, adding that they told her to apologise to the doctor. She refused. When the woman left home for university, she again told her parents about her experience with Mr Nassar. Her father, who committed suicide in March 2016, ""crumpled"" when she repeated her claims. Mr Nassar was fired in September after working for decades as a doctor for gymnasts at Michigan State University, as well as USA Gymnastics - the sport's governing body. Allegations of sexual assault were first revealed by the Indianapolis Star newspaper in September 2016 when he was accused by two former gymnasts. Since then, more than 60 women have accused him, and at least 40 have filed lawsuits. Several of those suits name USA Gymnastics as a co-defendent, claiming they had not done enough to prevent the abuse. MSU gymnasts coach Kathie Klages quit abruptly this week after being named in several legal actions. She had worked as a coach for nearly 30 years, before she was suspended by the university, leading to her surprise departure.",1,524

"""The decision has dealt the final blow to democracy in the country,"" said the Organisation of American States. The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would exercise congressional functions. The charge stems from alleged electoral irregularities by three opposition lawmakers in elections in 2015. The head of the OAS Luis Almagro accused President Nicolas Maduro's government of carrying out what he described as a coup against itself. Brazil's foreign ministry said the court's decision violated the country's separation of powers. Several other Latin American countries expressed concern too. Peru recalled its ambassador to Caracas, saying there had been a rupture of democracy. The United States also condemned Venezuela's government. ""This rupture of democratic and constitutional norms greatly damages Venezuela's democratic institutions,"" said a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner. Venezuela's opposition had earlier said President Maduro was becoming a dictator. Venezuela's foreign ministry accused critics of the government of forming a right-wing regional pact against President Maduro. He says the OAS is a pawn of US ""imperialism.""",1,526

Their promoter said no further information was available. They are scheduled to play five more concerts in Australia. The following date from Perth is due to take place on 22 March in Adelaide. The BBC's Phil Mercer said ticket holders for Wednesday's gig were being asked to hold on to their tickets until a further update is available. Scott, who was believed to be 49, was found by her assistant at 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Monday. The Stones are due to perform in Sydney, Melbourne and Macedon later this month before playing two dates in Brisbane and Auckland, New Zealand, in April. The On Fire tour is then scheduled to move to Europe in June, with concerts planned for the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Belgium. Sir Mick, 70, began dating Scott in 2001. On Monday night, a spokesman for the singer issued a statement to deny a report that he had recently ended his relationship with the designer. ""The story in the New York Post re: a split between Mick Jagger and L'Wren Scott is 100 untrue,"" said his spokeswoman, Victoria Scarfone. ""There is absolutely no basis in fact to this story. It is a horrible and inaccurate piece of gossip during this very tragic time for Mick."" The UK's Press Complaints Commission (PCC) told the BBC it had received a small number of complaints from the public over images published which apparently showed an upset Sir Mick at the time he was told Scott had died. It is understood the singer has not yet complained personally, but the PCC would deal with the matter in due course. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, Vogue editor Anna Wintour and singer Madonna were among those who were fans of the designer. Scott was found dead by her assistant 90 minutes after sending her a text message asking to come to her Manhattan apartment without specifying why, the Associated Press news agency reported. Police said there was no sign of foul play and no note was found. Naomi Campbell said Scott was ""the epitome of elegance and femininity."" Anna Wintour described Scott as ""a total perfectionist.... always unbelievably generous, gracious, kind and so much fun."" She added: ""Her old world American manners and charm were from another time, but her sensibility was always fiercely modern."" Madonna wrote in a statement: ""This is a horrible and tragic loss. I'm so upset. I loved L'Wren's work and she was always so generous with me."" Actress Nicole Kidman, said to be a friend of many years, was ""heartbroken and in shock right now and unable to say anything,"" according to a spokeswoman. Bianca Jagger, one of Sir Mick's former wives, tweeted: ""Heartbroken to learn of the loss of the lovely and talented L'Wren Scott. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. May she rest in peace."" According to its last UK filing Scott's firm, LS Fashion Limited, owed creditors about 7.6m (PS4.6m), as of 31 December 2012. It had assets of 1.7m. Scott's death comes a month after she cancelled a show at London Fashion Week, saying production delays had left key pieces unready for the show. Scott, born Luann Bambrough, was raised by Mormon adoptive parents in the US state of Utah. The 6ft 3in (1.9m) tall former model began her career in Paris, then moved to Los Angeles to become a fashion stylist, according to a biography on her company's website. She founded her own high-end fashion label in 2006 and created a more affordable line of clothes with Banana Republic. Scott had dressed actresses such as Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Jessica Parker and Angelina Jolie for red carpet events.

Rodgers added that the club had not given Sterling permission to speak to BBC Sport and that he thought it was a ""mistake"" to carry out the interview. ""There was no permission from us,"" he said. ""He will learn. We all make mistakes in life, especially when we are young. ""I think the kid has tried to put off all talk about contract and money. For now hopefully the focus will be on football."" Sterling, who joined the Reds from QPR in 2010, says he will not discuss a new contract with the Reds until the summer. ""I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player,"" he said. Newspaper reports have linked him with moves to Manchester City,Arsenal,Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. But Rodgers said he and Sterling were ""relaxed about the situation."" ""This is one of the great clubs of the footballing world and, for Raheem, to be playing here it's an honour,"" added Rodgers. ""He understands that, he sees that."" Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson, who won five league titles and a European Cup with the club, said Sterling is not yet good enough for the top clubs in Europe. ""He's 20 and not going to Real Madrid or Barcelona or Paris St-Germain,"" Lawrenson told BBC Sport. ""He's not at that level and he has a lot of work to do.""",1,528

"Police were called to Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, after he was found unresponsive on Tuesday. The American had to be driven to hospital because he was too tall to be airlifted in a helicopter. Mr Odom, 35, has played basketball for Miami, Dallas and the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers. He also played for the US in the 2004 Athens Olympics, winning the bronze medal. His condition is unknown but well-wishers tweeted their support following the news. Mr Odom, who was married to reality television star Khloe Kardashian, has long struggled with alcohol and drug addiction. He was involved in a drink-driving case in 2013 and was suspended from the NBA for violating its anti-drug policy in 2000. He and Ms Kardashian were married in 2009 in a ceremony that was taped for US television network E!. They divorced in 2013. Odom won the NBA championship with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010 and was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011. He last played in the NBA in 2013 with the Clippers.",1,530
"Some reports put the number even higher. The roof of the church caved in on worshippers who had gathered for the ordination of a bishop on Saturday. Those inside the Reigners Bible Church included Akwa Ibom state governor Udom Emmanuel, who survived the disaster. The church was still under construction and workers had rushed to complete it for the ordination, witnesses said. Mr Emmanuel said there would be an investigation into whether safety standards had been compromised. Eyewitnesses told Reuters news agency that they had seen more than 100 bodies at the local morgue. Etete Peters of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital told the AP news agency that at least 160 people had been killed. Many more victims may have been taken to private mortuaries across Uyo, AP adds. President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed ""deep sorrow"" over the incident. An unnamed survivor quoted by Nigeria's Channels TV said: ""Suddenly, the roof fell on worshippers. The governor was quickly rescued. But others were not that lucky."" Building collapses are relatively common in Nigeria, mainly due to the use of sub-standard materials and the violation of building regulations. In 2014, scores of people were killed when a church hostel belonging to a Nigerian TV evangelist collapsed in the city of Lagos.",1,531
"Mr Maduro said the room would be kept intact and a wing of the presidential palace turned into a monument to Mr Chavez's ""Bolivarian revolution."" Mr Chavez died of cancer last month. Following his death, presidential elections were called for 14 April, pitting Mr Maduro against main opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Mr Capriles says that despite Mr Maduro's attempt at portraying himself as Mr Chavez's heir, the acting president lacks the late leader's charisma. ""I'm going to look after it for a few years, but it'll always be Chavez's home,"" Mr Maduro said referring to the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, where Venezuela's presidents have their office. Full of confidence ahead of Sunday's polls, Mr Maduro said he would ""occupy a small office in Miraflores in another wing,"" so that Venezuelans could roam the rooms of the presidential palace and ""learn how the commander had lived, and what he had eaten."" Fierce battle Since Mr Chavez died on 5 March, Mr Maduro has cast himself as his natural successor in office. He has called himself ""Chavez's son"" and said that the late president had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. Speaking last week at the official start of the presidential campaign in the house where Mr Chavez was born, Mr Maduro said a small bird had flown around him three times and looked at him ""oddly,"" at which point he he had felt in his soul it was a message from Mr Chavez. ""I felt its blessing, telling us:'Today the battle begins, go for victory, you have my blessing',"" Mr Maduro said. Henrique Capriles mocked Mr Maduro saying that he had ""not seen a little bird, but swallowed one, the one he has in his head!"" He has also questioned Mr Maduro's ability to lead the country saying that ""whatever the outcome, I don't see how Nicolas Maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government."" Mr Capriles has dismissed polls that suggest Mr Maduro has an unassailable lead over him. ""Of course I can win,"" he told AFP news agency, ""Maduro lacks charisma and leadership."" Mr Maduro said his rival was ""jealous"" and promised to beat him by 10 million votes in Sunday's polls.",1,532

"The 29-year-old terminated his contract with the O's after the transfer window closed, and cannot join another EFL side until January. ""I wouldn't say I'm in a predicament, but I have never been in this position before,"" Cox told BBC Radio London. ""It is not a nice thing for a footballer. I'm not able to do my job."" The former Brighton man continued: ""I am going to have to sit it out again for four months before I can kick a ball in the League again. ""I'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done."" Cox left Orient on 1 September after turning down a move to League One Northampton Town. Having spent six years with the O's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, Cox said he was ""an emotional wreck"" on his departure from Brisbane Road. ""I didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, I felt like I had no choice,"" he said. ""We had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons. ""It is a club I will always love. When I finish playing I want to be a manager and if I can go back there and manage one day that would be great."" Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an EFL club which will commence in January before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness. ""I was just getting back in the groove,"" he said. ""If I can get something sorted sooner rather than later League-wise, then great. ""Hopefully the clubs I speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as I need to play. ""Come January, I need to be ready to kick on."" Cox has already held initial negotiations with League Two side Crawley Town. ""It interests me because they are local to where I am,"" he said. ""It ticks the boxes and I used to play with the captain Jimmy Smith at Orient.

"Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness. He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the clinic, which aids accompanied suicide. His wife Elaine and three daughters said they respected his decision. The family said in a statement: ""Whilst we are now in a state of all-consuming grief and miss Jeffrey very much, we also recognise that he is now at peace and away from the fear which surrounded him in the last few weeks of his life. ""Jeffrey ended his life with dignity and control which was his overwhelming desire."" In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette last week, Mr Spector said: ""If I am paralysed and can't speak, send me to the spirit world."" He reportedly said the condition was affecting his nervous system. Friend Linda Earle, who had known him for 20 years, said: ""He's fought it every step of the way. I've never known a man try so hard. ""I don't blame him for a minute....it's no one else's decision but his own."" Journalist David Graham told BBC Radio Lancashire he had spoken to Mr Spector at his hotel near the clinic in Zurich. Mr Graham said Mr Spector, a director of an advertising agency, had had a series of consultations with leading surgeons across the UK. ""He had one operation which failed and I think that spurred him on the Dignitas route,"" said Mr Graham. In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt. Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said he would attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK. He said it was ""completely wrong"" that terminally ill people did not have the option to end their life. ""Whatever your take on the subject, it should be debated,"" Lord Falconer told the BBC. Last year the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, clarified assisted suicide guidelines, making the prosecution of health professionals less likely. However, in April, disability rights campaigners who said assisted suicide policy was too ""liberal"" won permission to bring a legal challenge to her policy. Rob George, president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, said he was concerned about any possible law change. He said: ""This is a dangerous distraction from providing decent health care, and actually it's the dying that we need to look after. ""Our job is to look after people as they die.... not in order that they die."" However, the daughter of a woman who died at Dignitas last year said she wanted the law to change so that terminally ill people could end their life at home. Jayne Bramwell's daughter Lindsay said that it would help to ""ease the path for everyone involved and make what is a horrendous time a bit easier."" She said it was ""enormously distressing"" for her mother to have to travel to Switzerland in a wheelchair. ""She just wanted to be at home and have all her family with her..."" she said. In 2008, a paralysed rugby player from Worcester died at Dignitas. Daniel James, 23, had a collapsed spine following an accident during training with Nuneaton Rugby Club. The Director of Public Prosecutions said prosecutions in the case would not be in the public interest. Dignitas, which said it aided ""accompanied suicide,"" often described as assisted suicide, has not commented specifically on the Jeffrey Spector case. The charity, founded in 1998, said: ""The main work of Dignitas is not assistance in dying but in fact suicide preventive work, above all suicide-attempt-prevention work in a broad sense.""",1,535
"Murray, 25, who has already secured Rio Olympic qualification, was down in 21st after the fencing round. Strong swimming and run-shoot combined events helped her climb to ninth and reach Sunday's final in Bath. She is joined by Great Britain team-mates Kate French, Freyja Prentice and Francesca Summers. Britain will claim the maximum of two Olympic berths for the women's event if any of the GB athletes - other than Murray - can finish in the top eight in Sunday's final at the University of Bath. ""I sometimes struggle to find that spark and have the same adrenalin that I do in the final during qualification,"" said Murray, who was fourth in the women's team event alongside Mhairi Spence on Wednesday. ""Hopefully I can step things up at the weekend,"" she added. World junior champion Summers, who won Youth Olympic silver in 2014, secured the last automatic qualification place in the first of the combined heats. ""I took lots of confidence from winning world junior gold in Mexico,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It's a big step-up in standard, but the target was to reach the final and I'm so happy I've done that.""

"Media playback is not supported on this device At 44 years old, Owens was the oldest of the 12 referees chosen for the World Cup, but his age will not prevent him from taking part in Japan in 2019. Selection criteria is based on performances and fitness, and Owens feels he has plenty more years in him. ""My plans at the moment are quite clearly to go on until 2019,"" he said. ""We had a meeting with the assessors and I was asked what my plans were and I said'I'm enjoying my refereeing and as long as I keep reffing well and I'm fit enough I want to go on to 2019'. ""Their response was'great, we're glad to hear that, we'd like you to be there in 2019'."" Saturday's World Cup final at Twickenham, which New Zealand won 34-17 against Australia, was the pinnacle of Owens' 68-Test career. He became the second Welshman to oversee the final following Derek Bevan, who was in charge in 1991 when Australia edged England, also at Twickenham. South African Andre Watson is the only referee to be in charge of two finals. He was 45 on his second appearance in the 2003 final, won by England against hosts Australia. World Rugby, the game's governing body, has welcomed Owens' decision to prolong his international career, adding he had shown exceptional fitness standards during the recent tournament. Owens admits the pressure, scrutiny and physical demands on referees are higher than ever, but he insists the passion for the job remains. ""I just thoroughly enjoy it and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I can and as long as I'm good at it,"" he said. ""When the time is right and I know the body or the mind can't take it any more because of the travelling or the pressure, or when the legs can't get there to make those big decisions, then I'll know that and I will be calling it a day when that happens."" Sections of the Australian media have criticised aspects of Owens' performance in the final, claiming he missed a forward pass in the passage of play that ended with Dan Carter kicking a penalty to stretch New Zealand's advantage to 9-3. Owens, though, says he has learned to deal with criticism, and feels his decisions on Saturday did not affect the eventual outcome. ""If you can't deal with criticism as a referee you just can't do this job,"" he said. ""There's something in you that helps you deal with that. ""It doesn't make it any nicer for me to hear criticism, especially if any criticism is personal. ""As long as you can look back on a game and say'I did my best, I gave it my all' that's what counts."" Owens revealed he was hugged and thanked for a ""great game"" by Australia number eight David Pocock moments after the final whistle. ""For someone who's just missed out on winning the Webb Ellis Trophy to come up and do that to you says a lot about the integrity of the man himself and what a wonderful sport rugby is,"" added Owens. The Welsh village of Gowerton will be Owens' next destination for a Swalec League Division One West match with Crymych. Two weeks later, he will be in the south of France for Toulon's European Champions Cup tie with Bath. ""I could've had a weekend off this weekend - a couple of refs have taken a couple of weekends off,"" said Owens. ""But I'd rather be out there reffing, whether it's under-12s, a schools game, youth game, a Division One West game or a World Cup final.""",1,537
"World road champion Armitstead finished in the peloton to extend her overall lead over South Africa's Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio to eight seconds. The 2014 winner Vos won the 119km stage from Nottingham to Stoke in a sprint finish. Sunday's 113.2km final stage runs from Northampton to Kettering. Vos, who lost the yellow jersey to Armitstead on Friday, won in what was a reduced sprint, with only 20 riders at the front of the race to battle it out after the bulk of the day's climbing was packed into the second half of the stage. Boels Domans rider Armitstead had attacked along with Elisa Longo Borghini, Moolman-Pasio and Emma Johansson with a little under 20km remaining, catching and passing lone breakaway rider Emilia Fahlin. Armitstead said: ""The race stayed together until the climb and then me, Ashleigh and Elisa went on the second Queen of the Mountains [intermediate sprint]. Emilia was in no-man's land so she came back up to us. ""There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking."" But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish. She added: ""In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back. ""Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them.

"The public car park is just off the Upper Newtownards Road, one of the main routes into the city. Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars. The bonfire makers are involved in a dispute with the city council over the storing of pallets. They say the council collected pallets from the area earlier this year, agreed to store them and return them this month but failed to do so. Bonfire builder Macauley McKinney, 21, said: ""We had an agreement with the council that they were going to store the pallets in a safe place, and now because the agreement was broken, they've let us down."" Belfast City Council is not commenting in detail on the issue, as an investigation has been called into the storing of pallets. A spokesperson said: ""It was agreed at a meeting of Belfast City Council's Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday that an investigation and full review, led by the chief executive with independent input, would be carried out into the issue of collection and storage of bonfire material, and the future approach of bonfires across the city."" The committee's decision needs to be approved at a full council meeting next week. Traditionally, bonfires are lit in many loyalist areas of Northern Ireland on the ""eleventh night"" - the eve of the Twelfth of July, an annual celebration to mark William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.",1,539
"Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised ""lowlanders"" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed ""work in progress,"" has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called ""new breed"" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to ""tame"" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia. The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia. There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview. Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility. However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",1,540

"The jury praised Ahmed Mansoor for regularly raising concerns about arbitrary detention, torture and degrading treatment in the Gulf state. As a result, it said, he had faced repeated intimidation, harassment and death threats from the UAE authorities and their supporters. Mr Mansoor could not collect the award in Geneva because of a travel ban. The Martin Ennals Award is named after the late British lawyer who became the first head of the human rights organisation, Amnesty International. Mr Mansoor was selected as one of the human rights defenders nominated for the award by a jury of 10 global human rights organisations. The other nominees were Asmaou Diallo of Guinea and Robert Sann Aung of Myanmar. Before Tuesday's awards ceremony, the jury had said Mr Mansoor's absence would ""mark a very disappointing position for the UAE, which is a country that prides itself as one of the hubs of international business and tourism in the Middle East, as well a safe haven in the region."" ""As a member of the UN Human Rights Council, which is running for a second term, we expect the UAE authorities to honour their obligations to uphold human rights and protect human rights defenders,"" a statement said. Mr Mansoor and four other activists who called for democratic rights in the UAE were arrested and jailed in 2011 on the charge of ""insulting officials."" Although pardoned and released later that year, he was banned from travel and had his passport confiscated. In a video message recorded for the ceremony, Mr Mansoor said: ""I hope that my presence as a finalist can show people that we have deep human rights issues that PR companies and a complex network of interests try to dismiss, or at least present as contrary to the reality."" The UAE has shown little tolerance towards dissent since the 2011 Arab Spring.

"Mr Charney, who also founded the company, was ousted last year because of the employee complaints and amid accusations of misuse of company funds. In the San Francisco court filing, the board said it did not expect him ever to return to the firm. Mr Charney's lawyer said many of the statements made were false. ""The company has engaged in an invasion of Mr Charney's privacy in a shameful attempt to extort him and gain leverage over him,"" said his lawyer Keith Fink. The court filing documents evidence of illicit emails written to female employees by the former chief executive, as well as racially derogatory taunts. They come in response to Mr Charney's defamation lawsuit against the company and its chair. Mr Charney ""repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the company's sexual harassment and anti-discrimination policy,"" the company's papers say.

"SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes in November 1982, before being translated into English and shown on BBC One the following year. Barry-born Young, now 70, has spent most of his working life in animation in California, working as an independent in Hollywood dominated by the big studios. The former advertising copywriter has now produced a feature-length animation, Norm Of The North, and his next film project is close to his heart - about a former legend with his beloved Cardiff City football club. A BEAR BEGINNING In 1978, Young created SuperTed as a story to read to his young stepson Richard, who was afraid of the dark, at bedtime. But the tales of the crime-solving superhero with special powers - and rivals like Texas Pete - soon got a wider audience. ""I went to the village hall one day to pick Richard up from play school and they said'we love the SuperTed stories' and I said'how do you know about those?' ""They said that'he always tells us the story you told him last night'. ""We then got the books published, a couple of hundred were written, and then S4C came along and they wanted at least one thing which would travel all over the world - and it was successful. ""We became the first company to sell to Disney and we never looked back."" Three TV series were made in the mid 1980s, with Derek Griffiths and Jon Pertwee providing the voices. Young also launched Welsh-language cartoon Wil Cwac Cwac and helped develop Fireman Sam. Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team. HOLLYWOOD BECKONS Young and his wife Liz created Mike Young Productions - which later become Splash Entertainment - and moved to Los Angeles in 1989. With much bigger rivals in Hollywood, he called it ""one of the most stupid, crazy decisions you could make."" But the company flourished. As well as collaborations, its animations have included Chloe's Closet, Dive Olly Dive!, Hero:108, Growing Up Creepie, Pet Alien and ToddWorld. NORM OF THE NORTH Young's latest production is an animated feature film Norm Of the North about a polar bear. Norm, who can talk but cannot hunt, goes to New York with a gang of lemmings for adventure and to fight a tourism development in the Arctic. Although it does not have a big budget, the film uses the latest computer generated imagery (CGI) technology. ""We wanted to make something economic because I want the independents to have a chance and really get back into this business,"" said Young. ""It's all well and good having Disney, Pixar, Universal and DreamWorks but fundamentally they go a certain route but we can take more risks with what we do."" The film, which includes voices from actors Rob Schneider and Bill Nighy, got its Welsh premiere at the Market Hall cinema in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, earlier this week. CARDIFF CITY FAN IS THE RIGHT MATCH He may live in California, but Cardiff City fan Young is now on the team making a film about one of the Bluebirds' most colourful characters. Friday (The Greatest Player You Never Saw) is about the late Robin Friday, who played for Cardiff and Reading in the 1980s before he died aged 38. ""He made George Best look like an angel,"" Young said. ""We've put together finance for it and got some big stars in it and it looks like we'll be shooting it in England or Ireland later this summer.""",1,546
"Ali Asghar Zarean told state TV that Iran would sign an agreement with China to modify the reactor before doing so. On Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency cited unnamed sources as saying the reactor had been decommissioned. It would represent a final step towards the implementation of July's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Iran has agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. Iran has for years been building a heavy-water nuclear facility at Arak, the spent fuel from which would contain plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb. The P51 group of world powers - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - had originally wanted Arak dismantled because of the proliferation risk. But they eventually agreed that Iran could redesign the reactor so it would not produce any weapons-grade plutonium. Monday's report by Fars, which is close to the powerful Revolutionary Guards, said technicians had removed the core of the existing reactor and poured concrete into the cavity. In July, Iran agreed a landmark nuclear deal with six world powers to limit its sensitive nuclear activities for more than a decade in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. The US is confident the agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy - and stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. Iran will not see the UN, US and EU sanctions lifted until the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), certifies that it has fulfilled its commitments under the deal. The precise date of the so-called ""implementation day"" has not been determined. But Iran says it has met those commitments earlier than expected and last week US Secretary of State John Kerry declared: ""We are days away from implementation."" The sanctions have cost Iran more than more than 160bn (PS102bn) in oil revenue since 2012 alone. Once they are lifted, the country will be able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. Iran has the fourth largest oil reserves in the world and the energy industry is braced for lower prices. Iran will also be able to access more than 100bn in assets frozen overseas. But on Tuesday, Mr Zarean insisted that Iran would not decommission the reactor until it had signed a deal with China regarding its redesign - something that is expected next week. ""Definitely, we will not apply any physical change in this field until a final agreement is finalised,"" he said, without making reference to the Fars report directly. Mr Zarean also said that once the modifications were completed and Arak went online, Iran hoped to export excess heavy water produced there to the US for research purposes, via a third country. Iran estimates it will need about 6 of the 20 tonnes a year of heavy water it will produce for medical isotopes. Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht separately announced on Tuesday that the sanctions on Iran would be lifted ""in the coming days."" The precise date when the nuclear deal is implemented and the sanctions are lifted by the UN, US and EU has not been determined and depends on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certifying that Iran has fulfilled its commitments.",1,547
"Campaigners fought to save Ipswich Airport after it was earmarked for housing by Ipswich Borough Council, with some occupying the terminal building for about four months. The anniversary of the closure is being marked with an exhibition. Organisers said: ""There is now a generation that probably doesn't even know Ipswich had its own airport."" The site was formerly a World War Two airfield and home to RAF Blenheim light bombers, Hurricanes and - for short periods - Spitfire squadrons. During its 66-year history, the airport launched a daily flight to Clacton with a journey time of just 15 minutes in 1938 and it later handled flights carrying royal passengers and sports stars. In the 1980s, Suckling Airways started operating flights to Amsterdam and Manchester and by 1990 the airport housed flying schools, a helicopter school, parachute centre and various support firms. But in 1996 the borough council, which owned the airport, announced the site would close later that year, to be turned into what is now the Ravenswood housing estate. Saturday's exhibition at the town's Transport Museum has been put together by Ipswich Airport Association (IAA) whose members will be on hand to answer questions. The reunion and exhibition will also feature press cuttings, photos and memorabilia to mark 20 years since the airport officially closed on 31 December 1996. Martyn Steggalls, a director of the IAA, who worked part-time at the airport, said: ""It's a time when a lot of people involved in the airport can get together and reminisce. ""It's a focal point to people who used to fly from there, work there and lived nearby.""",1,548
"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK may want to be more ""obliging"" to certain countries to secure future commercial advantages. The EU is keen to maintain a united front and conduct central negotiations. Meanwhile, a leading candidate to be France's next President says he will take a ""pretty tough"" line on Brexit. Emmanuel Macron, who opinion polls suggest could win May's election, told Channel 4 News the UK should not be punished for voting to leave the EU but the EU's interests had to be paramount into the upcoming negotiations. ""We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequence,"" he said. Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave. Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and ""frictionless"" cross-border trade. She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one. The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states. There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive. Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against ""punishing"" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals. ""A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,"" he said. ""It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions.... with certain individual countries."" Mr Kern said that Europe would not ""capitulate"" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member. ""If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,"" he said. The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier. Speaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK. ""We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,"" he said. The UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be ""humungous"" in scope. Preparatory work has been taking place in more than 50 different sectors, spanning manufacturing and services as well as key industries such as farming and fishing.",1,549
"Last month he became the first player to speak publicly about being sexually abused as a boy at Crewe in the 1980s. There are now 155 suspects in the UK-wide football child abuse scandal. Woodward said he gave police further information five weeks ago, but has ""still not provided statements despite my continual requests to do so."" On Twitter he wrote: ""People should know I suffered more than one abuser. ""I've now been waiting five weeks to provide my statement with the police, for further abuse on me. ""I've not mentioned it before now but it hurts. I need to let go of that pain, yet still waiting."" He later told BBC Sport that police had now said they would visit him next week - but called the delay ""shocking."" Police say there are now 429 potential victims linked to football, some as young as four at the time of the alleged offence, and 148 clubs are now involved. Woodward, who is also a former police officer, has launched an independent trust to help other abuse victims ""fight for justice."" The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) set up Operation Hydrant to oversee investigations of ""non-recent"" child sex abuse within institutions or by people of public prominence. The spotlight has fallen on abuse in football since a a number of former footballers came forward publicly to tell their stories, and the number of suspects has almost doubled in a fortnight. In a statement on Wednesday, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the NPCC lead on child abuse, said allegations received by police across the country ""were being swiftly acted upon,"" but acknowledged that a ""higher than usual"" volume of calls was causing delays. The latest figures from the NPCC, released on Wednesday, show there have been 819 referrals from police forces and a special helpline set up for victims of abuse in football. Chief Constable Bailey, said: ""The numbers keep growing. We are dealing with some of the most complex investigations you can imagine. ""We are dealing with incredibly sensitive matters, sometimes in very high profile cases and of course all those factors create a huge challenge for the service."" The official overall Operation Hydrant statistics show there were 3,469 suspects of historical child abuse under investigation as of December 2016. This compares with 1,433 in May 2015. Among the overall statistics for child sex abuse there are 366 people of public prominence - including 162 from TV, film or radio - under investigation. There were 3,531 people classed as victims, of which 2,604 (74) were male and 899 (25) were female. A further 28 victims were of unknown sex. In November 2016 there were 26 sports institutions under investigation. That figure has since increased to 74. Mr Bailey urged victims of child sexual abuse to report it by dialling 101 or contacting the dedicated NSPCC helpline for those abused in football, ""regardless of how long ago the abuse may have taken place.""",1,550
"The man, who has not been named, was dismissed following disciplinary proceedings, Devon and Somerset Fire Service said. Molly Wigmore, 76, died in the fire at her Plymouth home in October last year. The first 999 call was made at 05:17 GMT but none had arrived by the time a second call was made at 06:44, ahead of a fire engine arriving at 06:50. Ms Wigmore's house, in Sussex Road, is about a mile and a half from Camels Head Fire Station. An inquest is expected to examine whether the delay played any part in her death, on 19 October. The fire service said in a statement it was unable to comment on the case until the inquest was over. ""We continue to offer the family of the deceased our deepest condolences,"" the service added. Tributes left at the house said Ms Wigmore was an ""inspirational, kind, gentle and sweet lady.""",1,551
"The star wore a Gary Barlow mask as he began playing Could It Be Magic on a piano at Cabot Circus shopping centre. Shoppers watching the mystery performer were astonished when he revealed his true identity and sang the hit song. The 45-year-old entertainer is known for surprising fans - in 2015 he ""crashed"" a number of weddings. Hundreds of people had soon gathered to watch the former X Factor judge at the city centre mall, with many posting videos and photographs of the performance on social media. As news of the concert spread, people around the UK tweeted the star to ask him to attend weddings, birthday parties - and other shopping centres. In 2015, Barlow promised to sing at the weddings of three fans - but went on to sing at more. Among them was Natalie Purkis, who was stunned when the star turned up at her wedding reception in Oxfordshire at the request of her husband Martin. Barlow later tweeted: ""I'll look back fondly at 2015 as the year of the wedding crasher!""",1,552
"The 28-year-old's nine-year-old daughter was also threatened by a member of the gang, who had a knife. The burglary happened at their home in the Turf Hill area at about 05:30 BST on Wednesday, Greater Manchester Police said. The three balaclava-wearing men stole cash, jewellery and a mobile phone before fleeing. The offender carrying the gun, said to be a small silver metal handgun, was described as Asian, slim and aged between 20 and 30. The man with the knife was black, between 30 and 40, of a medium build and with bloodshot eyes. It is believed they were met by three other men outside the property. Police are now appealing for anyone with information to contact them. Det Con Rich Shelton said: ""This gang targeted a mum and her young daughter, even stooping as low as to hold a gun to the head of a woman who was clearly heavily pregnant and absolutely terrified.

"The Chesterfield striker was cleared of rape at a retrial in 2016. He had been charged with attacking the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, Denbighshire. Following the retrial, North Wales Police investigated after the woman's name was revealed on social media. Anyone who reports being a victim of a sex offence is guaranteed lifelong anonymity. North Wales Police's temporary Supt Jason Devonport said the publishing of her name was a ""serious"" offence. The men, aged between 16 and 23, were from the Sheffield, Derbyshire and Birmingham areas. All were cautioned after admitting publishing the name of the woman - who has lifelong anonymity under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 - after the retrial verdict. Supt Devonport said: ""This type of offence is fortunately rare, however, I'd like to emphasise all police forces take offences of this nature very seriously. ""We will vigorously pursue and prosecute those who don't respect victims' anonymity."" In November 2012 - following the initial trial - nine people were made to pay compensation to the woman after they admitted naming her on Twitter and Facebook. Mr Evans, 28, was originally found guilty of rape at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, but that conviction was quashed in April 2016. A retrial jury found him not guilty of the offence six months later. The Chesterfield striker had been charged with attacking her at a hotel on 30 May 2011. He was found not guilty of the same charge, after a retrial at Cardiff Crown Court, in October 2016. Mr Evans' former club Sheffield United announced this week it was to re-sign him.",1,555

"The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95 compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than PS10,000 a year. The introduction is a gradual process with 66 of employees now signed up. The latter stages are widely seen as the most challenging as employees such as nannies, care workers, plumbers and bar staff are enrolled into a pension. This means employers who only have one or two staff may need to add a pensions policy to their pay and conditions. This group represents more than a third of those who will be required to comply with the rules from now. Employees have the option to opt out of saving. The auto-enrolment system was started in 2012, and aimed to ensure that workers save to enable them to top-up their state pension on retirement. This has reversed falls in workplace pension saving. The full roll-out is taking years to complete, but MPs and regulators have welcomed a successful take-up by workers and compliance by employers - both of whom pay into the pension pot. ""The compliance rates achieved have been consistently at the top of our expectations and the savings landscape has been transformed. But we know the job is not yet done and there are still significant challenges ahead,"" said Charles Counsell, executive director for automatic enrolment at the Pensions Regulator. Those challenges include a question over whether enough is being put into these pension pots. There is concern that some workers may feel that the pensions box has been ticked, only later to find that their pension does not offer them the standard of living they are expecting. New figures from the Pensions Regulator show that the average contribution from employers is 3 a year of an employee's salary. Steve Webb, now director of policy at Royal London insurance company, was pensions minister when the system was created. He said such contribution rates were ""woefully inadequate to provide a decent retirement."" ""The fact that the average employer contribution rate among firms so far is just 3 shows the mountain that we have to climb,"" he said. ""Getting the combined rate of contributions from employers and employees to realistic levels as quickly as possible should be the central focus of the 2017 review of automatic enrolment. Without this, millions of workers in generations to come will simply be unable to afford to retire."" Minimum contribution rates will increase from 2 to 5 in April 2018, and from 5 to 8 in April 2019. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: ""We want to make it as easy as possible for businesses to manage automatic enrolment which is why we made the decision to gradually increase the amount employers contribute to workplace pensions. We also know that people will need to save more and we will be considering how to get people to do this as part of our 2017 review."" Concerns also remain about certain trusts that administer these pensions for small firms, as revealed by a BBC investigation.",1,557

Ms Jacobs told BBC South East Today she was initially excited to be invited for the interview for a position of office administrator.

So far, she said she has received no apology or explanation from Tecomak. Employment lawyer Richard Atkins, said all jobseekers are entitled to equal treatment when applying for positions. ""On the face of it, this e-mail does not show that she has been treated with fairness and respect,"" he said.",1,558
"HS2 Action Alliance says a paper by HS2 Ltd shows engineering work will mean closing parts of some passenger lines for 133 weekends, and some freight lines for 50 weekends. It would also mean 19 weekend closures at Euston station, the group said. HS2 said any closures would be carefully planned. On the Derby to Birmingham lines for example, the document says 32 weekends will be hit between 2017 and 2022, 13 of them for just a day and 19 for the entire weekend. The CrossCountry rail firm and freight services would both be affected. For the Coventry to Leamington Spa route, it says four whole weekends will be lost in 2018, with passengers asked to catch a replacement bus instead. Part of the busy West Coast Mainline will close for 31 weekends in 2018-19, as they build a new flyover junction in the Handsacre area, with trains diverted via Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Richard Houghton from HS2 Action Alliance said: ""It is clear that once again HS2 is being less than honest with the travelling public. It is planning a huge number of weekend closures which will impact the travelling public. ""Combined with this its arrogance continues. It is planning to issue PS7bn of supplier contracts before the Hybrid Bill passes through Parliament and now we discover it will start closing Euston before they have the legal go-ahead for the new line."" The document does say that the number and length of the closures are just estimates at the moment, and that work will be tied in with everyday engineering projects wherever possible, to minimise disruption. But it does warn that ""HS2 phase one will need to recognise the cumulative effect on passengers and operators of disruption."" Train operators could also be compensated for the impact on their services. HS2 Ltd spokesman David Meechan said: ""Our railways are becoming increasingly crowded. Britain desperately needs this new high speed rail network to boost rail capacity and improve links between our biggest cities. ""There will be times when construction impacts on the current railway, but this will be carefully planned with Network Rail and the train operators. ""HS2 Ltd will do all it can to minimise disruption to passengers. Compensation to the train operators for any such disruption will be drawn from the existing budget for the HS2 project."" Two years ago a government commissioned report said that the alternative to building HS2, basically beefing up what is already there, would cause 14 years worth of weekend problems across the network.",1,559

"India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was home to ""many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India."" Gandhi had moved in with his wife, Kasturba, and some followers. There was also a steady stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi, a callow young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma, was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera, he was taking pictures of the leader. He had wanted to become a doctor, but his parents had goaded him to join Gandhi's personal staff doing clerical work, looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography, but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a camera. The nephew did not relent. Finally, Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 rupees (1.49; PS1.00) to Kanu so that he could buy the camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer: he forbade him from using flash and asking him to pose; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made do with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspapers. Over the years and until Gandhi's assassination in 1948, Kanu Gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades, his pictures remained in obscurity, once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now, 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decade of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation, a non-profit trust founded by two of India's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is possibly my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing scale at the Birla House in Bombay (what is now Mumbai) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace, demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the picture is telling. ""This is a picture of a man keeping an eye on his weight, testing himself all the time. It tells you a lot about the man,"" says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here, Gandhi is seen in front of his office hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heat. It is, at once, an intimate and remote image. Which is one of the reasons, many say, that made Kanu Gandhi's pictures of the Mahatma so special. ""Although he had incredible access to the icon, we are always struck at the way Kanu, perhaps because he was in awe of Gandhi always kept a respectful distance, and yet managed to convey a sense of intimacy and proximity,"" says Panjiar. ""And because he kept a certain distance, Kanu intuitively found a more modern language of photography than what was prevalent in those times in India, framing many of his images with an interesting and unconventional use of the foreground, breaking many of the accepted rules of composition."" Kanu Gandhi travelled far and wide with the leader. Here's his image of a van carrying Gandhi being pushed by Pathans and Congress workers over some rough terrain in the North West Frontier Provinces in October 1938. This is a picture of Gandhi, and his wife Kasturba, in Abottabad in November, 1938. Kanu Gandhi's first-ever book of photographs chronicles the leader's political and personal journey in his last decade in vivid detail. There are pictures of Gandhi in his many moods - brooding, joyous, pensive, grieving - and with his supporters. Here Gandhi is being massaged by a relative and his elder sister Raliatbehn during a three-day fast in Gujarat's Rajkot city in March 1939. ""These images may be old, but they are not old-fashioned. They are not straightforward, beautifully shot and carefully framed, neat pictures which were popular then,"" says Panjiar. ""It possibly helped that Kanu was not a trained photographer because many of his images would have been rejected by his contemporaries on account of being blurred, slightly out of focus or double exposed. But these find pride of place, lovingly pasted by own hands in albums."" Gandhi and his wife Kasturba are seen here at a wedding of a Christian man and an untouchable woman in Sevagram ashram, 1940. Sanjeev Saith says the picture of a dying Kasturba Gandhi lying on a bed at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune in 1944 a few months before her death counts among his favourites. A broken shaft of light is streaming in through a window behind her. ""Here is this austere woman lying regally on this stately bed, she is about to die. This picture just shakes me up,"" he says. And then there is this historic 1938 picture of Gandhi in a convivial mood with freedom hero and radical nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. In the background, Kasturba Gandhi is drawing her sari, and looking into the distance. This was the high noon of Bose's political life: he had been elected as president of the Congress party. Gandhi had overruled objections from independence hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had objected to Bose's appointment. The two leaders had shared a complex relationship and fell out later over differences. ""This is an amazing picture,"" says Saith. ""It contains two of India's greatest heroes in one frame. Bose is young, cherubic, almost looking at Gandhi in admiration. Gandhi has his characteristic toothless grin. It is a nice, warm moment."" Here's Gandhi and Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, in February 1940, a study of two great men in meditation. ""Look at the bottom of the picture. It is an accidental double exposure [a technique which combined two different images into a single image]. It's rather inventive. Kanu Gandhi knew it was a good picture, and he didn't throw away the negative,"" says Saith. There's a series of pictures of Gandhi collecting donations for a fund for the untouchables during a three-month long train journey that took him to Bengal, Assam and southern India in 1945-46. In some he's stretching his arm from a carriage for money; in others he's surrounded by people and collecting the money in a slender basket. ""He's an old man, but he looks agile. He's almost begging for alms, and he's serious about picking up every bit of money for a good cause. He understands money,"" says Saith. ""I am a bania and there is no limit to my greed,"" Gandhi once said, alluding to his Indian caste comprising mainly of moneylenders. Being the only person who was allowed to take Gandhi's photographs at any time, Kanu Gandhi was shooting every day. Sometimes Gandhi intervened: one such moment was when Kasturba, lay dying in his lap at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. The nephew, however, was allowed to shoot this image of the leader, draped in a shawl, looking at Kasturba after she passed away in February 1944. According to several accounts, Gandhi kept a vigil for hours, sitting by her side, praying. ""After sixty years of constant companionship,"" he said later that night. ""I cannot imagine life without her."" Ironically, for a man who followed Gandhi like a shadow, Kanu Gandhi was away in Noakhali in east Bengal when his leader was killed in 1948. ""Gandhi's death had a profound effect on Kanu and his wife, Abha's life. For Kanu, photography was no longer as important as the need to convey his leader's message,"" says Panjiar. Kanu Gandhi died after a heart attack while on a pilgrimage in northern India in February 1986. Photographs by Kanu Gandhi Gita Mehta, heir of Abha and Kanu Gandhi.",1,565
"The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-112 to Burns, 115-113 to Beltran and 114-114, which did not seem to reflect Beltran flooring Burns or his dislocating the champion's jaw. Brave Burns was constantly pushed back and landed heavily on occasion. And his courage was rewarded, controversially, when he retained his belt. Burns's preparations were unlike any of his 38 previous fights. His wife had given birth to their first child, his son Leon's safe arrival coming only nine days ago after a four-day labour. The question troubling his fans was what state of mind would he be in to face a challenger known for being a regular sparring partner of the legendary Manny Pacquiao? The opening blows were fairly evenly shared, both fighters lively and aggressive, while in the second round Beltran had the champion pinned on the ropes for a spell, though Burns managed to take most of the Mexican's artillery on his arms. Burns promised he had learned from, principally in the way he had over-stretched to land blows on his reclining opponent, only to be caught on the counter. His exertions in the third round, though, suggested he was still trying to blow the challenger away and he was caught several times with Beltran's left hook before using his jab to good effect. Beltran stepped up the pace in the fourth and had Burns reeling from two crunching lefts, the second wobbling the 30-year-old from Coatbridge. The challenger, two years Burns's senior, was controlling the ring and he had the best of the exchanges in round five, though Burns, often on the back foot, had cleared his head and was occasionally getting through the Arizona-based fighter's guard. Burns continued to use the counter-attack, more out of necessity than choice, to inflict pain on Beltran. His reward was to land two excellent shots to Beltran's head in the closing stages of the sixth. The home fighter's recovery continued into the seventh as he made good use of a quick left jab, right-cross combination. But in the eighth round the champion was floored for the first time in three years with a sickening left hook to the head. Burns took the count of eight to gather his senses and to his credit had the guts to hang in there and land a peach of a left hook on Beltran's chin. Worryingly for Burns's camp, the challenger did not flinch. The Scot's refusal to panic paid dividends in his bout against Gonzalez, when his opponent retired injured after nine rounds. Similarly, he kept calm in this bout despite that knockdown and the pain in his jaw and gave his all in rounds nine and 10, without truly disrupting the forward momentum of Beltran. The crowd feared that Burns might need a knockout in the final two rounds to retain his belt but the technical and tactical nous of Beltran made this seem a forlorn wish. Again and again, the fans witnessed the wonderfully composed Mexican break Burns's increasingly erratic defences without risking a knockout blow himself. The final round signalled more of the same, sporadic bursts by Burns merely interrupting the hail of leather-clad fists. But when the MC announced a draw, Beltran sharply exited the ring while the home fans, though proud of their brave champion, squirmed at the result. On the undercard, Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons lifted the WBC international cruiserweight silver championship title with a deserved unanimous points win over Germany's David Graf, though the Scot suffered a nasty cut under his left eye in the fifth round. Scott Cardle, from Lytham St Annes, with plenty of home support from the Glaswegian side of his family, beat Fishburn's Gary Fox, taking a 79-73 points decision in their lightweight contest. Liverpool's 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medal winner Callum Smith dispatched Lithuanian super-middleweight Kirill Psonko in the first round. Glasgow's Jonathan Slowey, 22, made it 15 straight wins by outpointing his rangy Spanish opponent Angel Lorente. The unanimous decision of the three judges landed him the WBC international featherweight silver championship. Garnant's 25-year-old Prizefighter winner Chris Jenkins beat the French light-welterweight Laurent Ferra on points. It was also at that weight that Lochend Boxing Club's Paul Appleby made a winning return to the ring 15 months after his defeat by John Simpson. The South Queensferry fighter emerged from a bruising six-rounder against Chesterfield's Lee Connolly with a 59-56 triumph, a touch harsh on the Englishman.",1,566
"Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that represented Arsenal's worst defeat since 1896. Wenger sent out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this cannot excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career, but Ashley Young also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott reduced United's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited, broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal, teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this season when he was sent off. Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday. For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inaction Read more of the blog This result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance. Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny. Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth. Media playback is not supported on this device With the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea. It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear. Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra. And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot. Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career. Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.

"The Confederation of African Football (Caf) are inviting new bidders for the tournament. Caf say that countries wishing to host the tournament have until 30 September to express their interest. A decision on Libya's replacement will be made next year. African football's ruling body also state that because of the limited time left to organise the 2017 Nations Cup, the Caf Executive Committee will select a host country who can guarantee that accommodation, transportation and hotel facilities, as well as training sites and stadiums already exist. Libya has endured weeks of recent chaos as the government struggles to control former rebel groups who helped topple former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Libya were originally scheduled to hold the Nations Cup in 2013 but because of the civil war swapped with 2017 hosts South Africa. The north African country had been planning to build 11 stadiums at a cost of 314 million, including a showpiece new 60,000-seater Austrian-built stadium on the site of a former military camp in Tripoli. Benghazi and Misrata were also set to have new major stadiums. Libya's government said last year it hoped the hosting of the Nations Cup would allow it to demonstrate that life had returned to normal in the country and encourage investors. Former World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer had accepted a role as an ""ambassador"" to help promote the tournament and the country and the former Spain coach Javier Clemente was hired to prepare their team for the tournament. Caf's decision follows the visit of a delegation from the Libyan FA to Caf's headquarters in Cairo this week. Libya also delayed the scheduled start of their new league season earlier this month because of the fighting while teams competing in international competitions in recent months have been holding home matches in neighbouring Tunisia. In February, Libya claimed their first senior African title, winning the 2014 African Nations Championship (CHAN), a tournament they were originally set to host. The civil unrest in the country meant that the event ended up taking place in South Africa instead. Caf are due to decide the host countries for the 2019 and 2021 Nations Cup finals at a meeting in Addis Ababa on 20 September. Algeria, Cameroon, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Zambia are bidding.",1,569

"Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it had put forward the idea ""reluctantly."" The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500 in 2011. The DHPA said if numbers continued to fall, the breed could lose its hardiness to survive on the moor. It said demand had dropped for the ponies as pets because of the economic downturn. The ponies were traditionally used for farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts. Charlotte Faulkner, founder of the DHPA, said in a letter to South West Equine Protection (Swep): ""It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. ""We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether."" Ms Faulkner said selling ponies for riding and driving would continue. ""The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association believes the meat trade should be (used) too,"" she said. ""Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sale."" Becky Treeby, of Swep, said: ""Dartmoor hill ponies were there for a reason, for ecology purposes to keep grass on the moors down, and they have been there for thousands of years. People have never eaten them before. It is promoting over-breeding for profit."" You can see more on this story on Inside Out SW on BBC One, Monday 29 September, at 19:30 BST. Correction 2 December 2014: This story has been amended to clarify that it refers to Dartmoor Hill ponies rather than Dartmoor ponies.",1,571
"The 22-year-old, who is on a season-long loan at Turkish side Kasimpasa from Chelsea, has been told by the team doctor he needs time to recover. ""I feel sad about it as it was another good opportunity for me to represent my country,"" Omeruo told BBC Sport. ""The doctor insists I need rest to start next season without injury."" Omeruo was first called up by Nigeria in January 2013 and he went on to play at that year's Africa Cup of Nations and Confederations Cup - and at the 2014 World Cup. He admitted he was looking forward to playing at the Games, especially after the Super Eagles' failure to qualify for the 2015 and 2017 African Cup of Nations. ""It is disappointing and frustrating to say the least. I'd be lying if I said I would not want to be out there playing,"" he said. ""But at the same time I need to be fully fit to be at my best and I have no doubt that the squad will do great in Brazil. ""I would also like to thank the coach [Samson Siasia] for even considering me in the first place."" A firm fixture in the Kasimpasa side, such has been Omeruo's impact that the Turkish club are now exploring the option to buy him at the end of his loan spell. He joined Chelsea from Belgian side Standard Liege in 2012 and developed on loan at ADO Den Haag in Netherlands in an 18-month spell from 2012 to 2013. The centre-back, who is yet to make his competitive debut for Chelsea, then went on loan to Championship side Middlesbrough in January 2014 and made 14 appearances. He returned to Teesside again for the whole of 201415 season where he made 22 appearances.",1,572
"Nick Hardwick said staff shortages, population pressures and prison policy all contributed to problems, with a 69 rise in self-inflicted deaths. The Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence linking the rise in such deaths to government policy. Presenting his annual report, Mr Hardwick also pointed to problems involving so-called legal highs. He highlighted the growing availability of the drugs as a cause of debt, bullying and health problems, warning their use had grown sharply. According to the HM Inspectorate of Prisons annual report, cannabis substitutes Spice and Black Mamba were particular ""causes for concern"" in more than a third of the jails inspected. It says current mandatory random drug testing does not detect legal highs and reduced staffing had made some ""suspicion"" testing programmes ""virtually inoperable."" Mr Hardwick said profits for prisoners selling legal highs outstripped other drugs because they sold for 10 times as much as they would outside jail. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""We all want prisoners to come out of prison less likely to commit offences than when they went in and if they [prisons] are not safe places where people aren't working and are not doing rehabilitation activities, then that's not going to happen."" But warning cracks in the system had ""widened,"" Mr Hardwick's report said: ""Of most concern, the number of self-inflicted deaths rose by 69 from 52 in 2012-13 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years."" The term ""self-inflicted deaths"" includes suicides and any death as a result of the prisoner's own actions. Bullying was a factor in ""many cases,"" the report said, warning that adult male prisons were becoming ""more violence every year."" Andrew Selous, the Conservative prisons minister, said it had been a ""challenging year"" for prisons staff dealing with ""major organisational change."" But he added: ""During this time we have always had enough staff to deliver decent and safe prison regimes, and this will continue to be our top priority. ""We remain committed to reducing violence and understanding the reasons for the recent rise in self-inflicted deaths. ""But this is a complex issue and the chief inspector has failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that this is linked to the reforms made under this government."" Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the report ""lays bare the deteriorating conditions in our jails under David Cameron's government"" and showed ministers were ""burying their heads in the sand."" ""The government should be alarmed at reports of prisoners idling away their time in their cells rather than being on courses or working,"" he added. ""It does nothing to improve rehabilitation and puts the safety of communities at risk from unreformed prisoners drifting back into a life of crime and creating more needless victims."" Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""This report spells out in painstaking detail the mounting challenges faced by prisons and gives the lie to repeated assertions by the Ministry of Justice that the system is not in crisis. ""If prisoners are spending most of their days locked up in their cells doing nothing, while regimes are violent and wracked with drug abuse, then how can we magically expect people to be safer citizens when they are released? He added: ""The end result will only be more crime and more victims of crime.""",1,573
"The force said paedophile hunter activities can hinder investigations and lead to offenders walking free. Det Ch Supt Tom Richards of Kent Police said it also diverts resources away from cases involving real children. Kent group The Hunted One said: ""Police should concern themselves more with tackling paedophiles than us."" But Mr Richards said: ""There have been zero cases in Kent where a vigilante paedophile hunter group has identified an individual who has at that stage presented a real risk to a real child. ""In the last two financial years, vigilante groups in Kent have contributed to 20 individuals being arrested but my resources alone in the same period have arrested 299 people."" Professor Martin Gill, a criminologist working for Perpetuity Research, said: ""There is nothing worse than a police investigation to get to its crescendo and then be undermined by an often well-intentioned but disastrous intervention."" The Hunted One claims to have caught 57 people, leading to 27 convictions. In October last year, Mark McKenna from Northfleet was jailed for five years after he was snared by The Hunted One. The 38 year-old thought he was meeting an 11-year-old girl for sex at Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent.

"Many people have been reluctant to seek medical treatment for Ebola, fearing that diagnosis might mean death as there is no proven cure. A team of 30,000 people is going house-to-house to find those infected and distribute soap. But critics say the lockdown will damage public trust in doctors. Meanwhile in neighbouring Guinea, the bodies of eight missing health workers and journalists involved in the Ebola campaign have been found. A government spokesman said some of the bodies had been recovered from a septic tank in the village of Wome. The team had been attacked by villagers on Tuesday. Guinea's prime minister said an investigation was under way, and vowed to catch the perpetrators of the ""heinous murders."" Correspondents say many villagers are suspicious of official attempts to combat the disease and the incident illustrates the difficulties health workers face. Sierra Leone is one of the countries worst hit by West Africa's Ebola outbreak, with more than 550 victims among the 2,600 deaths so far recorded. In the capital, Freetown, normally bustling streets were quiet, with police guarding roadblocks. During the curfew, 30,000 volunteers will look for people infected with Ebola, or bodies, which are especially contagious. They will hand out bars of soap and information on preventing infection. Officials say the teams will not enter people's homes but will call emergency services to deal with patients or bodies. Volunteers will mark each house with a sticker after they have visited it, reports say. 11,315 Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected (Includes one in the US and six in Mali) 4,809 Liberia 3,955 Sierra Leone 2,536 Guinea 8 Nigeria On Thursday, President Ernest Bai Koroma said: ""Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures."" He urged citizens to avoid touching each other, visiting the sick or avoid attending funerals. Freetown resident Christiana Thomas told the BBC: ""People are afraid of going to the hospital because everyone who goes there is tested for Ebola."" Another resident in Kenema, in the east of the country, told the BBC families were struggling because the price of food had gone up. In the hours leading up to Sierra Leone's lockdown, there was traffic gridlock in Freetown as people stocked up on food and essentials. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in Sierra Leone Cities and towns across the country were quiet without the usual early morning Muslim call to prayer and the cacophony of vehicles and motorbikes that people wake up to here. Thousands of volunteers and health workers have assembled at designated centres across Sierra Leone and started moving into homes. But they had to wait for hours before their kit - soaps and flyers - could reach them. MP Claude Kamanda, who represents the town of Waterloo near Freetown, told local media that all the health centres there were closed, hours after the health workers and volunteers were meant to assemble for deployment to homes. He complained that the delays were not helping the campaign. The UN Security Council on Thursday declared the outbreak a ""threat to international peace"" and called on states to provide more resources to combat it. Meanwhile, the US military has started work in the Liberian capital Monrovia to establish an air bridge - a link by air transport - to take health workers and supplies to affected countries. The UK has pledged to help build new treatment centres and provide 700 new hospital beds in Sierra Leone, although a majority of the beds could take several months to arrive. Aid workers have welcomed the UK aid but say all of the beds are required immediately, the BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle reports. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has been strongly critical of the lockdown, arguing that ultimately it will help spread the disease as such measures ""end up driving people underground and jeopardising the trust between people and health providers.""",1,575
"The boar - which has a moving head - is one of a number of animated replica creatures at Mountfitchet Castle. Staff at the site, an open air museum, were surprised to find two nests had been created next to the arc of its belly. Owner Jeremy Goldsmith said seeing the hatched chicks on Thursday morning had been a ""lovely surprise"" for staff. He said it remained unclear why the hens had made the nests next to the boar, though it was likely they chose it because it was a secluded spot with straw, and perhaps for a sense of protection from the replica animal The chicks have been seen playing on top of the boar's back and head.",1,576
"The next public consultation in the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) scheme was due in September but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor Andy Burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced ""in due course,"" the mayor's office said. The GMSF scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last October to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr Burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in May, promised to ""radically re-write"" the plans, calling them ""unfair and disproportionate."" The BBC understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew Collinge from the Save our Slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between Middleton and Royton, said the delay was ""disappointing."" He said: ""It stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this September deadline. ""We now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours."" Matthew Good, a spokesman for the House Builder's Federation said: ""It's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this. ""Councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen. ""Without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that."" A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the mayor had appointed Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett to lead a ""radical"" rewrite of the plans. He added: ""This re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course.""",1,577

"England's win over South Africa on Sunday secured the Twenty20 series. The game was officially sold out, as were England's two ICC Champions Trophy matches at the SSE Swalec Stadium. The near-15,000 crowd comes as counties bid for the next round of five years' worth of international games. ""To have three full houses over 19 days for England matches is something we've very proud of,"" said Morris. Cardiff hosted England's win over New Zealand and semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka versus Pakistan and the less well-attended Bangladesh v New Zealand match. Around 3,000 seats were not occupied for the England v New Zealand match because of poor weather forecasts, while cancelled trains are believed to have contributed to some empty seats for the T20 on Sunday. But a rapid re-allocation of tickets worked well for the England-Pakistan game after fears that India supporters, who bought tickets for both semi-finals, would not turn up. ""It's particularly important (to have big crowds) this year, because at the back end of the year we are likely along with other counties to be bidding for our international programme between the years 2020 and 2024,"" explained Morris. ""There's also the new city-based franchise T20 as well, so it's important we can demonstrate we can fill houses and people have a great time when they are here."" England's score of 181 in 20 overs against South Africa could also come as a relief, after captain Eoin Morgan criticised the use of a previously-used wicket for the Champions Trophy semi-final, a choice attributed to the International Cricket Council. ""I wasn't surprised (with the score), it's a wicket that has played extremely well this year in domestic and international cricket, in recent years we've had some very good marks,"" said former county captain and England opener Morris. Glamorgan have forecast an operating profit for 2017 on the back of five days of international cricket.

"Leaving the union would see prices rise and threaten jobs, the prime minister said, in a move seen as an attempt to reach out to Labour voters. Writing in the Daily Mirror, he said leaving would be ""a national error."" Meanwhile, more than 300 business figures and entrepreneurs have signed a letter in support of Brexit. The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to remain in, or leave, the European Union. With less than six weeks to go before polling day, Mr Cameron continued to make his case for staying in the EU. He said being in the union helped working people and British manufacturing. ""I've been in this job for six years now. Whatever you think of me, I know how Britain gets things done in the world,"" he wrote in the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror. ""I've seen how free trade within Europe benefits working people. I've seen how manufacturing is boosted by trade deals the EU has done with the rest of the world. ""I've seen how shared intelligence keeps families safe. It's my deep, considered, steadfast belief that leaving Europe would be a national error, a big mistake."" He said three million people's livelihoods were directly linked to trade with Europe, with ""countless more"" linked indirectly. Mr Cameron's comments comes as 320 business figures have signed a letter backing Vote Leave. The letter, published in the Daily Telegraph, said being a member of the EU undermines British competitiveness and Brexit would ""create more jobs."" Signatories include Peter Goldstein, a founder of Superdrug, Steve Dowdle, a former vice-president of Sony, and David Sismey, a managing director of Goldman Sachs. Tim Martin, chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Adrian McAlpine, from construction firm Sir Robert McAlpine, and Jon Moulton, chairman of Better Capital LLP, also signed the letter. They say British business would be free to ""grow faster, expand into new markets and create more jobs"" from outside the EU. ""Year-on-year the EU buys less from Britain because its economies are stagnant and millions of workers are unemployed,"" the letter said. It adds: ""Brussels' red tape stifles every one of Britain's 5.4 million businesses, even though only a small minority actually trade with the EU."" Both the Leave and Remain campaigns have previously published letters revealing the backing of other business figures. It follows a dispute over the weekend, after Boris Johnson compared the EU's aims to Hitler's, saying both involved the intention to unify Europe under a single ""authority."" The pro-Brexit Tory MP and ex-London mayor said both the Nazi leader and Napoleon had failed at unification and the EU was ""an attempt to do this by different methods."" Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, who backs Remain, said the comparison was ""offensive and desperate."" ""Leave campaigners have lost the economic argument and now they are losing their moral compass,"" the Labour MP said. Former Labour minister Yvette Cooper, who also supports the Remain campaign, accused Mr Johnson of a ""shameful lack of judgement"" and a willingness to play ""the most divisive, cynical politics."" Lord Bramall, a former head of the Army, said making a comparison between the EU and Nazi Germany was ""absurd."" However, Tory Leave campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson's comments were ""absolutely true."" He said Hitler and Napoleon ""wanted to create a single European power.... by force.

The site, which is 750m from where he was last seen, is close to where officers started digging last month.

"The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too ""narrow"" and residents not properly consulted. He wants an interim report on the cause of the fire by September, followed by a wider probe into building regulations, council funding and other issues. The presumed death toll stands at 80.

Retired former Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to head the inquiry on Wednesday. It will sit in public and have the powers to compel witnesses and obtain evidence. Visiting the scene of the blaze on Thursday, Sir Martin said he believed the probe and its recommendations would be ""pretty well limited"" to what had caused the fire and its rapid spread. Setting out his ambition to produce a report within a year, he said he was aware that people in the area want a broader investigation but he was not sure that his inquiry would be the right setting. The prime minister has said she expects an interim report to be made available as soon as possible and that survivors and residents should be consulted on the terms of reference. But Mr Corbyn said he wanted a guarantee the initial findings would be published by the end of the summer. In a letter to Mrs May, he said the inquiry would be best served by being split into two parts to ensure ""timeliness would not have to be sacrificed for rigour."" While understanding how the fire started was of the ""utmost importance,"" he said survivors and other residents had a multitude of other questions about how their safety had come to be compromised and what could have been done to prevent the disaster. ""Whilst the detail of the specific failures at Grenfell needs to be uncovered, it is also clear that the Grenfell fire has much wider implications for national policy issues,"" he said.

The PM has said the immediate priority is to establish the facts of what happened at Grenfell Tower and to take the necessary action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.

"Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock was killed was ""the day that all your nightmares came true."" Mr Lock was attacked on the A24 at Findon, near Worthing last July. Earlier defence counsel David Howker QC said Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised to Mr Daley's family for having ""failed"" him in his care and treatment. Mrs Daley told the court her son had many debts and the recent breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend had left him ""distraught."" ""We were never provided with a proper diagnosis. We were frequently in meetings but we were not listened to,"" she said. ""It's been continual over the last 10 years. In the past 10 years we have pleaded to people, it has been on a regular basis."" Mrs Daley told the court the apology from the NHS trust was ""10 years too late."" She said she feared her son was involved in the killing in Findon when she saw the news on television. When she failed to contact him she drove to the stables where he worked and saw his damaged car. The court heard the family decided to go to Worthing police station and as Mrs Daley was about enter, her son called her saying: ""I need to know where you are and that I can trust you."" Mr Daley also told her he had done ""something really bad or something really wrong. ""I killed someone."" The court also heard Mr Daley police told a police officer ""when I drive, people try and break into my thoughts."" He also said: ""It's sad that I had to kill someone who was so aggressive to me when I wasn't aggressive at all."" Mr Lock was returning from a cycling meet when he was stabbed 39 times during a ""ferocious"" attack on the A24 at Findon in July. Witnesses have described Mr Daley as being ""expressionless"" during the attack, as though he was ""having a passport photo"" taken. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of Mr Daley's Ford Fusion and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Jurors have been told that Mr Daley's defence team will claim the defendant may have been acting in self defence because Mr Lock was angry and aggressive.

"The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids. It can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is set to say. Health officials said the review was expected to recommend the LCP should be phased out within six to 12 months. The system was developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the city's Marie Curie hospice in the 1990s to provide a model of best practice in the care of dying patients. It can mean an end to invasive tests, treatment or feeding through tubes that is deemed to cause unnecessary suffering at the end of life - but it should be discussed with the patient, family or carer where possible. The pathway was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute. It was intended to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients - whether they were in hospital, at home, in a care home or in a hospice. Previously, there were concerns that care had been patchy, with some hospitals failing to meet acceptable standards, and accusations that people were subjected to invasive treatment and testing that offered no chance of preventing death, but merely prolonged their suffering. Under the LCP, patients are regularly reviewed to ascertain whether medication should be stopped - and whether fluids should be withdrawn once they have ceased to be able to eat and drink. However, families have complained relatives were put on the pathway without their consent, and that death has been hastened in people who were not dying imminently. Critics say that it is impossible for doctors to predict when death is imminent, so the decision to put a patient on the pathway is at worst self-fulfilling. There have also been suggestions that the pathway has been used to help hospitals save money. NHS Trusts do receive payouts for hitting targets related to its use - but the suggestion that the pathway has been used for cynical reasons has been vigorously denied by the Department of Health. The Department of Health (DoH) in England set up an independent review amid fears the LCP was being used to hasten death, to clear beds and save money, and that patients or their families were not being consulted. The review, led by crossbench peer Baroness Julia Neuberger, applies only to England. The LCP is also used in Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in Wales, which has its own framework for end-of-life care and support. A Scottish Government spokeswoman told the BBC it welcomed the Neuberger review. ""Recommendations set out in the report will be considered by the Living and Dying Well National Advisory Group, so that any learning for Scotland can be taken forward with stakeholders,"" the spokeswoman said. The review for England was asked to focus on the use of the LCP model rather than re-evaluating its basic merits. But the DoH said the review team, which heard evidence from patients, families and health professionals, encountered ""numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care."" The review was likely to conclude the LCP needed to be replaced, it said in a statement. ""The independent review into end of life care system the Liverpool Care Pathway, commissioned last year by Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb and backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is likely to recommend that the LCP is phased out over the next six to 12 months,"" the DoH said. The statement gave no indication of what might replace the LCP. But Mr Lamb said: ""We need a new system of better end-of-life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families."" He ordered the review in November last year amid intense media scrutiny of the LCP following criticism from patients' families. At the time, he said he was concerned about the ""unacceptable"" cases that had come to light. British Medical Association president elect Baroness Finlay said the LCP was originally brought in because patients were ""dying badly, in hospitals in particular."" They were being ""walked past, ignored and neglected,"" she said, and the LCP was an attempt to ""roll out the best of hospice care into other areas."" ""By and large that worked well but the problem has been that it hasn't always been used properly,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. She said that if the LCP was phased out it was vital something better replaced it. ""Something which is very clear, very simple and which drives up professional behaviour,"" Baroness Finlay added. Dr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians - which has been reviewing the LCP every year since it was introduced in 2004 - said the system was ""very helpful."" ""But if the execution of it in all instances has not been right then we need to review that,"" she added. ""All doctors dealing with patients who may unfortunately die need to be trained in end-of-life care. We need to know what the standards are, we need to be able to apply them, our junior doctors and trainees need to be fully trained in it. And we also need time - time to be able to discuss these very difficult issues."" Jason Suckley, director of policy and campaigns at Sue Ryder, said the healthcare charity's research had shown the timing and quality of conversations health professionals had with terminally-ill patients amounted to a ""lottery."" He said workers' communication skills needed to be improved and urged Health Education England, which provides training and support for healthcare professionals, to include end-of-life training in its workforce mandate. ""When it comes to dying we cannot afford to get it wrong and health professionals need to be supported to communicate with people effectively at a very traumatic and emotionally difficult time,"" he said. The review's findings are due to be published in full on Monday.",1,589
"Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over PS600m in 2014 to only PS55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from PS500m in 2014 to PS30m in 2016. Knight Frank said the low oil price ""continued to take its toll"" in the north east, with few deals going through in 2016. But it added that market conditions could improve in the year ahead, with crude prices making a recovery. The report found investors spent nearly PS1.8bn last year across all sectors in Scotland, including offices, hotels, shops, student accommodation and industrial units. The figure was 12 down on the previous year but above the 10-year average of PS1.72bn. Edinburgh registered a particularly strong year for investment, with almost PS1.2bn transacted across all sectors - 92.5 up on 2015. But Glasgow saw a ""more muted"" 12 months, with transaction volumes down by 59 at PS280m. Alasdair Steele, from Knight Frank, said: ""Overall, the Scottish commercial property market remained resilient, despite an unstable 12 months. ""Across the country, political uncertainty has influenced investment levels over the last year. ""However, there's a general feeling beginning to emerge that Scotland offers good value and strong fundamentals - an attractive proposition for investors seeking solid returns at an especially turbulent time. ""We'd hope to see that reflected in transaction volumes picking up in 2017, provided the political climate remains stable."" Meanwhile, a separate report has suggested that investor interest in Scotland's commercial property market has failed to pick up despite an increase in occupier demand. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said both domestic and foreign investment inquiries stayed in negative territory in the last quarter. At the same time, the supply of property for investment purposes fell across all sectors. Some surveyors described market conditions as ""challenging."" The latest Rics UK commercial market survey suggested increased demand from occupiers in the office and industrial sectors. But it was a different story for retail in the fourth quarter, with a net balance of 14 more chartered surveyors reporting a fall in demand for retail space. Gavin Anderson, from Montagu Evans in Glasgow, said: ""The current economic outlook isn't looking great and consumer spending on the high street is feeling the effect of growing fears about the economy. ""Hopefully, the anticipated reduction in the rateable value of retail premises from April 2017 will act as a catalyst to help retailers' profit margins across their shop portfolios and increase their confidence to expand and take more stores next year."" Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: ""The results for the survey suggest that the commercial property market in Scotland has failed to attract investor interest despite an increase in occupier demand for commercial property in the last quarter.

"Their lawyers had asked the court to declare ""unlawful"" the consultation process that led to the proposed axing of the PS320m fund. The five are among 19,000 people who receive money from the ILF, which the government plans to scrap in 2015. The scheme aids independent living and the average pay-out is PS300 a week. The government has said that councils, which administer most social care, will take over funding this help. On Wednesday, a judge dismissed the application, saying the consultation process had been lawful. The claimants feared that disabled people could be forced out of independent living arrangements and into residential care, or trapped at home by the fund's closure. At a hearing in March, they had argued that there have not been clear reasons given for closing the fund; the consultation featured inadequate information on the differences between the fund and local authority assessment and provision; and there had not been proper assessment of the impact of the change on disabled people's ability to live and work independently. The Department for Work and Pensions has previously said that help for disabled people has been fundamentally changed by personal budgets, intended to give recipients more control, and that it makes sense to have a single system administered by local authorities. The ILF was established in 1988, but the government decided in 2010 that it had become ""no longer appropriate or sustainable"" to keep running the scheme outside the mainstream social care system. The fund closed to new applicants soon afterwards. One of the five applicants, Gabriel Pepper, from Walthamstow, east London, has accused the government of imposing ""appalling cuts"" which were ""a vicious attack on the disabled."" The claimants have said the money enables them to employ personal assistants to help them with their personal needs and to ""go out and have a full life."" Richard Hawkes, chief executive of the disability charity Scope, said: ""Expecting councils to pick up the tab when they are facing the biggest funding cuts in history is an impossible ask."" ""Not getting the support to wash, dress and leave your home is unacceptable.""",1,592
"The Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, held 47 trillion (PS30tn) in private wealth last year as the number of new millionaires rose in China and India. North America is the world's richest region with 51tn, but is expected to be surpassed by Asia in 2016. Asia is also projected to hold 34 of global wealth in 2019. Overall, global private financial wealth grew by nearly 12 last year to 164tn, lifted by strong gains in the stock and bond markets. ""A strong old world versus new world' dynamic was observed, with the so-called new world growing at a far faster pace,"" the report said. ""As in both 2012 and 2013, Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) remained the fastest-growing region in 2014.

"The club's latest accounts, for the year ending May 2014, also show the Bluebirds owe around PS174m - most of it to owner Vincent Tan. This was despite revenue increasing more than five fold to almost PS80m. The club's annual report says support from Malaysian investors ""will continue"" as long as ""the business develops as planned."" The financial figures showed that the club's broadcasting and commercial income rose from from PS8m to more than PS70m. Wages and salaries went up from just over PS27m to PS46m. During their time in the Premier League Cardiff sacked Malky Mackay and replaced him with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The club said they paid just over PS2m on ""exceptional costs"" relating to the change of football and senior management. The accounts show the club received loans of around PS130m - mainly from Tan, but also including a loan of PS7.5m from Torman Finance, understood to be chairman Mehmet Dalman's company. The report adds: ""Following relegation from the Barclays Premier League the owners are aware that they needed to again invest in strengthening the playing squad, but that they needed to spend wisely. ""Whilst long term funding is not guaranteed, the Malaysian investors have indicated that providing the business develops as planned, they will continue to support the company in the foreseeable future and provide additional finances in order that it can settle its liabilities."" Tan has previously said he will convert the club's debt into equity. Keith Morgan, a chartered accountant who sits on the board of Cardiff City Supporters Trust, told BBC Radio Wales Sport: ""The club is highly insolvent. ""It has far more liabilities than assets and at any point in time it could be called upon to repay that debt owed to Vincent Tan.""",1,594

""Substantial evidence"" has been gathered so far, according to Lynch. Properties in the Alps have been seized in a separate Swiss investigation. The US authorities are working closely with their Swiss counterparts, and held a joint news conference in Zurich to provide updates on their respective investigations into world football's governing body. ""The scope of our investigation is not limited, and we are following the evidence where it leads,"" said Lynch. ""I am grateful for the significant co-operation and substantial evidence that we have received from all quarters.""

"The team discovered a set of 12,000-year-old Ice Age stone tools while excavating Rubha Port an t-Seilich, on Islay in the Inner Hebrides. The tools included scrapers used for cleaning skins and sharp points for hunting big game such as reindeer. The excavation had been started after pigs foraging along the Islay coastline uprooted Mesolithic objects in 2009. Archaeologists from the University of Reading found animal bones, plant remains and a fireplace at the Mesolithic site. However, on the last day of the excavation in 2013, the team also uncovered tools which would have been used 3,000 years earlier. It is now thought they were made by people of the Ahrensburgian culture, which flourished in mainland Europe towards the end of the last Ice Age. Similar sites have recently been discovered in Denmark and Sweden, suggesting the Ahrensburgian people may also have been coastal foragers hunting sea mammals from skin boats. Prof Steve Mithen, who led the excavation with Dr Karen Wicks, said: ""The Mesolithic finds were a wonderful discovery - but what was underneath took our breath away. ""The Ice Age tools provide the first unequivocal presence of people in Scotland about 3,000 years earlier than previously indicated. This moves the story of Islay into a new historical era, from the Mesolithic into the Palaeolithic."" Dr Wicks admitted the initial discovery was ""more swine team than Time Team."" She added: ""Archaeology relies on expert planning and careful analysis, but a bit of luck is also very welcome.""",1,598
"He was speaking after crowds in Tehran cheered negotiators who had agreed to curb some of Iran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. The six-month interim deal agreed in Geneva prompted a fall in oil prices on markets on Monday. But Israel's prime minister has warned the agreement is a ""historic mistake."" On Monday Benjamin Netanyahu announced that an Israeli team led by national security adviser Yossi Cohen would travel to Washington for talks on the deal. ""This accord must bring about one outcome: the dismantling of Iran's military nuclear capability,"" he said. On Sunday, US President Barack Obama told Mr Netanyahu in a phone call that the US understood Israel ""has good reason to be sceptical about Iran's intentions"" and promised to consult its ally closely, the White House said. Mr Netanyahu has warned that Israel ""will not allow a regime that calls for the destruction of Israel to obtain the means to achieve this goal."" Saudi Arabia - Iran's regional rival - cautiously welcomed the deal on Monday. ""This agreement could be a first step towards a comprehensive solution for Iran's nuclear programme, if there are good intentions,"" a statement said. However, a London-based Saudi official earlier told the BBC his country had been lied to. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the Geneva accord, but said it was only a ""first step."" ""We are right to test to the full Iran's readiness to act in good faith,"" he told the House of Commons. Mr Fabius told French radio that ""Iran is committed to giving up the prospect of nuclear weapons. It's perfectly clear."" However, he insisted the temporary deal could be reversed if its terms were not adhered to. Asked when sanctions could start to be lifted, he said it could begin ""in December."" France, the UK, Germany, the US, Russia and China took part in the talks with Iran, hosted by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Baroness Ashton's spokesman Michael Mann said the timing would be co-ordinated with Iran. ""It could be in December, it could be in January, it depends how long the legislative process takes,"" he told reporters. Under the deal which will last six months, Iran would receive some 7bn (PS4.3bn) in ""limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible [sanctions] relief"" while a permanent agreement is sought. In return, Tehran has agreed to a series of measures. Key points of the deal include: Arriving at Tehran's Mehrabad airport, Iran's negotiators were welcomed by hundreds of cheering supporters carrying flowers and flags. Addressing state TV, Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Iran was prepared to take the necessary steps to keep the deal on track. World powers have suspected Iran of secretly trying to develop a nuclear bomb - a charge Iran strongly denies. A raft of sanctions has been imposed on Iran by the UN, US and the European Union. President Obama welcomed the deal, saying it would ""help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon."" It has also been revealed that the US and Iran held a series of face-to-face talks in recent months that paved the way for the agreement but were kept secret even from their allies. The interim agreement with Iran - the world's fourth-largest oil producer - prompted a fall in oil prices in early Asian trading with Brent crude falling by more than 2. By Mark MardellNorth America editor Although Iran will not be allowed to increase its oil sales for six months, analysts say the deal is perceived by the markets as reducing risk in the Middle East. Earlier, US Secretary of State John Kerry told ABC's This Week programme that he hoped Congress would not pass new sanctions on Iran. Some senators have expressed concerns about the deal and say more sanctions are possible. In a nationwide broadcast on Sunday, President Rouhani repeated that his country would never seek nuclear weapons. ""No matter what interpretations are given, Iran's right to enrichment has been recognised,"" he said. The deal comes just over three months since Mr Rouhani - regarded as a relative moderate - took office replacing the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It has also been backed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in nuclear matters.",1,599
"The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the United States and western Europe. The forecasts for the shape of the ""global talent pool"" in 2020 show China as rapidly expanding its graduate numbers - set to account for 29 of the world's graduates aged between 25 and 34. The biggest faller is going to be the United States - down to 11 - and for the first time pushed into third place, behind India. The US and the countries of the European Union combined are expected to account for little more than a quarter of young graduates. Russia is also set to decline - its share of the world's graduates almost falling by half since the beginning of the century. Indonesia, according to the OECD's projections, will rise into fifth place. Is this an end-of-empire moment? Higher education has become the mirror and magnifier of economic performance - and in the post-World-War-II era, universities in the US, western Europe, Japan and Russia have dominated. The US in particular has been the university superpower - in wealth, influence and until recently in raw numbers. Up until 2000, the US still had a share of young graduates similar to China. And Japan had as big a proportion of young graduates as India. Now China and India are the biggest players. Their rise in graduate numbers reflects their changing ambitions - wanting to compete against advanced economies for high-skill, high-income employment. Instead of offering low-cost manufacture, they are targeting the hi-tech professional jobs that have become the preserve of the Westernised middle classes. As the OECD figures show, this is not simply a case of countries such as China expanding while others stand still. Across the industrialised world, graduate numbers are increasing - just not as quickly as China, where they have risen fivefold in a decade. The OECD notes that by 2020, China's young graduate population will be about the same as the total US population between the ages of 25 and 64. This changing world map will see Brazil having a bigger share of graduates than Germany, Turkey more than Spain, Indonesia three times more than France. The UK is bucking the trend, projected to increase its share from 3 in 2010 to 4 in 2020. This push for more graduates has a clear economic purpose, says the OECD's analysis. Shifting from ""mass production to knowledge economy occupations"" means improved employment rates and earnings - so there are ""strong incentives"" for countries to expand higher education. But will there be enough graduate jobs to go round? The OECD has tried to analyse this by looking at one aspect of the jobs market - science and technology-related occupations. These jobs have grown rapidly - and the report suggests it is an example of how expanding higher education can generate new types of employment. These science and technology jobs - for professionals and technicians - account for about four in every 10 jobs in some Scandinavian and northern European countries, the OECD suggests. In contrast - and showing more of the old order - these technology jobs are only a small fraction of the workforce in China and India. The OECD concludes that there are substantial economic benefits from investing in higher education - creating new jobs for the better-educated as unskilled manufacturing jobs disappear. The OECD forecast reveals the pace of growth in graduate numbers. But it does not show the quality or how this expansion will translate into economic impact. There are other ways of mapping the changing distribution of knowledge. A team at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute has produced a set of maps showing the ""geography of the world's knowledge."" This measures how populations are consuming and producing information in the online world - mapping the level of internet use, the amount of user-generated material in Google, concentrations of academic activity and the geographical focus of Wikipedia articles. And in contrast to the rise of the Asian economies, this tells a story of continuing Western cultural dominance. ""In raw numbers of undergraduates and PhDs, the Asian economies are racing ahead,"" says Prof Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, from the Oxford Internet Institute. ""But what's interesting is how the West persists in its positions of strength - because the West controls the institutions. ""There are more students in China than ever before - but they still use Western mechanisms to publish results, they accept the filters,"" says Prof Mayer-Schonberger. ""The big question will be whether the Chinese researchers can be as insightful as their Western counterparts - we don't know yet."" The maps also reveal how much Africa and South America are losing out in this new scramble for digital power. Prof Mayer-Schonberger said he was ""completely shocked"" at the extent of the imbalance. Another feature of the Oxford study is to show how research bases and their spin-out economic activity are clustered into relatively small areas. In the US, says Prof Mayer-Schonberger, there is hugely disproportionate investment around Silicon Valley and the Boston area, with large tracts of ""wasteland"" between. ""Each era has its own distinct geography. In the information age, it's not dependent on roads or waterways, but on bases of knowledge. ""This is a new kind of industrial map. Instead of coal and steel it will be about universities and innovation.""",1,600
"The Carneddau Landscape Partnership has been awarded PS198,700 Heritage Lottery funding to help it manage the natural and cultural heritage of the area. It claims the mountains' archaeology, ecology, peatland and Bronze Age cairns are among the things ""under threat."" Funding has also been set aside to improve the heritage of Holy Island, off Anglesey. The initial funding approval for the Carneddau Landscape Partnership means the seven-year project can now seek the full PS1.9m grant. The project, led by Snowdonia National Park Authority, will cover 81 sq miles (210 sq km) which features Carnedd Llywelyn as its highest peak. Jonathan Cawley, the national park authority's director of planning and land management, said: ""We are truly excited about working on such an important project which will be of enormous benefit to the local communities and to the natural and cultural heritage of the mountains."" Of the funding set aside to improve Holy Island, Anglesey council has been awarded PS117,200 to develop plans on behalf of the Tir a Mor Landscape Partnership. The plans will be presented to the Heritage Lottery Fund at a later date to seek final approval for the full PS1.2m grant. They include projects which celebrate Holy Island's culture and landscape, involving people who live and work there. Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, said: ""Heritage Lottery Fund money works hard to ensure all of our important heritage is looked after. ""But it's not all about grand old buildings, castles and museums. There is natural heritage all around us, especially here in Wales, which is vital to our economy, our livelihoods and our wellbeing.""",1,601
"Kaori Okuni, one of the women campaigning for change, said the ruling would lead to ""suffering for those who plan to marry and those who are set to be born."" Most women in Japan end up taking their husband's surname, a practice set to continue after Wednesday's ruling. But what do other countries do? In most well-populated countries, women are free to change their surname on marrying, if they wish. Many go further than that, putting in place laws stating that women do not have to change their names. France's law has been in place since the 18th century but, much like in Italy, there is some flexibility allowing wives to use their husband's surnames in an informal way. On all official paperwork, however, the maiden name must remain. The laws are much tougher in Greece and Quebec. In Greece, you must petition a court for a name change, and in Quebec, even if they wanted to, a wife cannot take her husband's surname at any point. In Iceland, women keep their maiden names after marriage. A surname is derived from a father's first name - so Bjork, Gudmund's daughter, becomes Bjork Gudmundsdottir - or, in certain circumstances, the mother's. A similar pattern is also followed in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there is no concept of surnames as known in many Western countries. At birth, people are given one name, that is then followed by the father's name then the grandfather's name. Even after marrying, women retain their original three names. Could the Avatar actress Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego - now Marco Saldana - be trend setters? The couple announced the move earlier this year, with Mrs Saldana calling her husband ""a man who stood by change."" In one case from 2012, however, a Mississippi man needed the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to take his wife's surname, having initially been prevented from changing the name on his driving licence. And in France, a change in the law now allows men to take their wife's surname - the first case was registered in Lyon in 2012, but only after seven attempts to do so were denied, despite the amendment.",1,602
"The aircraft, nicknamed ""Bette"" after one of its pilot's girlfriends, was built in 1941 from donations from the Borough of Lambeth Spitfire Fund. It was stationed in Cornwall, Hampshire, Norfolk and Shropshire during the war but crashed in 1944. Bidding stalled below its PS120,000 to PS150,000 valuation. The aircraft saw service with four RAF squadrons between 1941 and 1944 and was flown by author Alec Lumsden, who gave it the name Bette and added a character from the Daily Mirror cartoon strip'Just Jake' to the paint work. After it crashed in Shropshire in September 1944, killing its Australian pilot, its wreckage was taken to Ibsley museum, Ringwood, Hampshire and displayed. The aircraft was later passed to a collector who showed it at events. It has also been immortalised by modelmakers Airfix and Revell. John Tomlin, from Historics at Brooklands, said: ""The historical side of war birds is an up-and-coming market. There are now about 42 flying Spitfires and this seems to be increasing ever year. ""The rarity, the history and the provenance of all these aircraft make them very investable items and they're investments that can be used and enjoyed by a lot of people."" Experts believe it would cost about PS1.8m to fully restore the plane.",1,603
"Alice's family had asked for the scope of the inquest to include why Arnis Zalkalns was allowed to live unchecked in the UK. The chief suspect who was jailed for murdering his wife in Latvia, Zalkalns was found hanged in west London. Alice's parents said they welcomed the coroner's decision. The full inquest, to be held in front of a jury, will start in June. Alice, 14, went missing on 28 August last year having last been seen alive on the Grand Union Canal towpath near Hanwell. Her body was found on 30 September after Scotland Yard's biggest search operation since the July 7 bombings in 2005. Builder Zalkalns, 41, is believed to have killed Alice in a sexually motivated attack and then dumped her body. He had been imprisoned in Latvia for murdering his wife but was released and travelled to the UK in 2007. His body was found in woodland in Boston Manor Park. Police said he would have been charged with Alice's murder had he lived. Alice Gross investigation - timeline The Gross family lawyer asked at a pre-hearing in October that the inquest should cover whether there was any failure by the authorities to implement statutory safeguards to protect the public under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to life. Sitting at the High Court earlier, Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said she accepted the submissions, adding that witnesses would be called to determine ""how he (Zalkalns) came to be in the country in the first place, given his convictions for murder and firearms offences."" The inquest will also look at ""the systems that were in place at the time, and whether appropriate checks were carried out."" Katerina Laiblova, Zalkalns' girlfriend, could be called to give evidence to the inquest about his mental state prior to his death, Dr Wilcox added. In 2009 Zalkans was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a teenage girl but no charges followed. At the time of that alleged offence it appeared he was still subject to a supervisory or probationary arrangement in Latvia, that hearing was told. A statement from Alice's parents, Ros Hodgkiss and Jose Gross, said they were pleased ""at the range of information that the coroner is willing to put in front of the jury."" They also said it was their hope that the coroner ""will be able to make recommendations to prevent this kind of thing happening again.""

"Figures shared with 5 live Investigates by the charity RoadPeace reveal a 23 drop in prosecutions in England and Wales in the five years to 2015. In the same period the number of convictions fell by nearly 30 per cent. The charity blames a reduction in the number of specialist police officers. The number of road officers in England and Wales fell by nearly 40 per cent from 7,100 in 2005 to 4,350 in 2014. The Department for Transport said: ""Britain has some of the safest roads in the world and in 2015 we had the second lowest total of road fatalities on record. ""We are determined to do more and we've recently announced tougher penalties for those caught using a mobile phone while driving. ""We have also tightened the law to make it easier to prosecute drink-drivers and drug-drivers."" Five people die on the UK's roads in the UK every day but campaigners say these incidents are often seen as unfortunate accidents and prosecutions are few and far between. John Thompson's 27-year-old son Jake died from head injuries in 2011 after he was hit on a pedestrian crossing in Bristol by a lorry travelling at 38mph in a 30mph zone. The family had to fight to persuade Avon and Somerset Police to re-open an investigation into Jake's death after the Crown Prosecution Service said there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges against the driver. John is highly critical of the original investigation. He said: ""We thought straight after the crash there would've been statements taken. It was about a month before the witnesses were interviewed, the phones weren't checked, the interview of the driver didn't take place until about two or three months afterwards and the interview failed to meet the standards which you would expect. ""There hadn't been a proper investigation. They hadn't followed up on certain key leads like CCTV evidence; they hadn't checked the driver's medical history."" When the case was eventually taken to court in 2014, it was thrown out, with the judge ruling that there was no case to answer. ""I felt hurt, disappointed,"" said John. ""It was almost as if Jake's life had been lost but there were no consequences as far as the legal system was concerned."" A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: ""After the collision involving Jake we carried out an investigation which, when reviewed, was found to have fallen below standards. Following a complaint raised by Mr and Mrs Thompson we recognised and accepted the need to revisit these matters. ""As a result, the investigation was re-opened and we renewed our appeal for witnesses, reviewed the information we already had and looked to see if any new lines of enquiry had presented themselves in the interim period. Improvements have since been made in respect of how we approach these types of investigations."" RoadPeace believes that the declining number of prosecutions for careless and dangerous driving reflects the police's increasing reluctance to investigate fatal collisions. ""Police are not evaluated on their collision investigation performance. Hence it is not a priority,"" said Amy Aeron Thomas from RoadPeace. ""There are no national standards for collision investigation, not even for fatal crashes. Guidance exists but has been weakened in recent years. It is not clear how police evaluate their investigation effectiveness, or if they even do evaluate this."" The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) - a charity which advises MPs on road safety - wants the government to create a UK road collision investigation branch. This would be similar to existing organisations which investigate air and rail crashes, and would have the remit of reducing the number of road casualties. Steve Barry, an Assistant Chief Constable at Sussex Police and the National Police Chief's Council lead for collision investigations, says he doesn't believe that the reduction in the number of traffic police has impacted on the number of prosecutions and convictions. He supports the idea of a national investigation branch but says there is a now a very different approach to road safety. ""It's less focused on enforcement and prosecution, it's more focused on what is in the public interest, in terms of educating the public, diverting them away from the court. ""We need to learn how to keep ourselves safe on the roads, as oppose to prosecuting our way into a situation of better safety. ""The balance is between justice and public interest, or learning, and that's a really difficult balance to explain to a [bereaved] family, but what we have to try and explain is there is a balance between justice, for the victims, justice for the families, at the same time of getting as much evidence, as much learning out of it that informs how we keep other people safe on the roads in future."" 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 2 April at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio.

"Smith, 34, lost WBO title bouts with Arthur Abraham in 2014 and 2015, and trainer Joe Gallagher said Saturday's fight was a ""last roll of the dice."" The Briton has now been beaten seven times in his 45 professional fights. The three judges in Wetzlar, Germany, each ruled the fight 119-108 in Zeuge's favour. It was Zeuge's third defence since he won the WBA title from Italian Gioavanni de Carolis in November 2016. In a largely one-sided contest, Smith was given a count by the referee in the closing seconds of the final round despite appearing to slip. ""Is it the end at world level for him? 100. Is there another level he wants to compete at? That is one for Paul Smith,"" promoter Eddie Hearn said on Sky Sports. ""We talked about last-chance saloon before the fight, he left it much too late. I think he will be kicking himself for that. ""He had a good spell in the third round when he wobbled Zeuge, and he did in the 11th and 12th rounds too. We would have liked to see that earlier, but it's easy for us to say. Zeuge was very good and countered well.""",1,610
"But when Paul Gascoigne appeared on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, everyone listened, including Russell. For all of Gazza's amazing moments on the pitch, he's also known for his long term battle with alcohol. Despite visible signs of vulnerability over the years the former footballer seemed back to his old ""daft as a brush"" self. Paul Gascoigne was massive news when you were growing up. He picked up 57 England caps and was described as the most naturally gifted footballer of his generation. Type ""Paul Gascoigne Euro 96 wonder goal"" in your search engine and you'll see for yourself. He was also famed for cracking jokes and playing pranks on teammates. He began the interview talking about how the tabloids have reported on his problems with addiction. "" (What) the press what they've been writing about it, it's scandalous. ""The press were actually outside my house and were taking pictures and they even wrote the next day that I was in rehab in Spain somewhere,"" he said. ""I wasn't, I was somewhere else. It was just the lies that keeps coming on."" He then remembered a conversation which led to him signing for Tottenham. ""I played against Spurs at Newcastle, scored two, and walking off the pitch Terry Venables (Spurs manager) said'If you come and sign for me I guarantee you within 10 days you'll be playing for England'."" ""That's all I wanted to do. ""Then I did in about eight games of coming to Tottenham, I got my chance to join with the England squad, which was unbelievable."" Then, almost inevitably, things took a funny turn when Gazza remembered trying to help out the Spurs groundsman. ""He [the groundsman] said'I've got to get rid of these pigeons', I went'OK then I'll help you.... I'm not doing anything.' ""I walked across the pitch, and he says:'There's one at the top of that roof'. ""I went:'OK how'd I get up there? Once he got up onto the roof things soon went, hilariously, wrong. ""I went over and I just heard [a cracking sound], and I fell through the roof, I landed 30 foot down on the steps! ""I said, gaffer, I don't think I can train today,"" ""He said'what for?' ""I said'A pigeon did it. The 47-year-old talked about turning down a deal to sign with Manchester United, in favour of a Tottenham package which included a house for his parents, as well a sun bed for his sister. What he didn't bank on was getting a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson himself. ""It wasn't a good letter, I got cained. ""It was like'I can't believe you turned down the biggest club [for a sun bed. Gazza enjoyed a spell in Italy in the 1990s after Lazio paid more than PS5m for the striker. ""The one team I wanted to play for was AC Milan, I eventually got to play them - away. ""I thought this is my chance to prove against them, how good I am."" ""We got beaten 5-1, I think it's the only game I wanted to end quickly, I think I had one touch with about five minutes to go."" Gazza famously cried when he was booked during an England World Cup match - because it would have stopped him playing in the 1990 final. And he admits he still gets tearful today, especially when it hits him afresh that his playing days are behind him. ""I was in tears to my sister and my dad last week, I just felt a little bit lonely. ""That's why I sometimes find it hard to go to games.""

"Andronicos Sideras, 55, is accused of mixing horsemeat with beef before selling it on through his company Dinos Sons. Two men who ran FlexiFoods - a meat suppliers linked to Dinos Sons - have admitted passing horsemeat off as beef. Mr Sideras denies one count of conspiracy to defraud. The discovery of horsemeat in processed beef products sold by a number of UK supermarket chains in 2013 resulted in a series of product recalls. The plot to pass horsemeat off as beef only came to light after horse identification chips were found in the meat by inspectors. Ulrik Nielsen, 58, the owner of FlexiFoods, and his ""right-hand man,"" Alex Beech, 44, have already admitted their involvement in the conspiracy. Mr Sideras, of Southgate, north London, told the court in that in 2012 he agreed to store horsemeat for FlexiFoods. He admits he relabelled the shipment because the packaging had been damaged during transit, but denies purchasing, selling or using the horsemeat. The trial continues.",1,612

"Joseph Fox photographed the mudlarkers who comb the shore of London's River Thames. Originally a term for the city's poor who scraped a meagre living by scavenging in the river's mud, it has been adopted by a new breed of treasure hunters, often armed with metal detectors. These men and women show off their favourite finds, and discuss the joys of mudlarking. Dave Hiddleston, Limehouse Long fascinated by history and collecting, Dave first discovered mudlarking while he was working on Cannon Street and saw people on the foreshore in wellington boots. His favourite find is an English community cloth seal, which he believes was used to stamp cloth bags coming through London in about 1618. It was inside a lump of burnt cinder. Dave said: ""I am always encouraging others to go mudlarking. It is a great escape from the humdrum of modern life, and interesting doing research on your finds. ""Plus you get to meet some really interesting like-minded people."" Edward Sandling, Vauxhall Ted discovered mudlarking by chance. ""I was walking along South Bank,"" he said, ""and I just hopped over a gate and came down to the foreshore. You get a sense of quietude and the perspectives on the city are so different, just by that small change of level."" He then noticed the objects at his feet, such as this pipe stem shaped like a horse's hoof. He said: ""I have finds that are older and perhaps more beautiful, but this is the one that set it all off. ""It's absolutely beautiful. To hold it and know that someone else was smoking it 150 to 200 years ago is amazing."" Ted believes that London's beauty lies in the fact that it hasn't all been embanked, and its tides allow these things to be found on the beaches: ""It churns up discoveries every day. Every tide there are new things to be found."" The one item he is holding out for is a Bartmann jug, decorated stoneware from Germany that was used to transport food, drink and goods. For Ted, ""they inspire thoughts of darkly forested mountains."" Andrea Smith, Rotherhithe Although she began only in October last year, Andrea makes time to go to the shore up to six times a week. She uses a metal detector, alongside her eyes and a trowel, to find shards of pottery such as this, painted with a willow pattern. Andrea said: ""It does not happen often that a shard contains both doves. ""I have found great joy, serenity and peace with my soulmate and best friend, my husband Iain. This shard represents this to me."" Sara Cannizzaro, Vauxhall It's the unexpectedness of mudlarking that drew Sara to it, in contrast to the routine of London life. ""I feel the excitement when I'm walking along the bank,"" she said. ""It's a way of making order out of chaos."" Sara has managed to find a piece of Bartmann jug, which - from the splashes of cobalt blue glaze - she has dated to 1600-20, made in Frechen. She said: ""The face that was impressed on the neck of these jugs is a prized find from all mudlarkers - everyone wants to find one!"" Mark Smalley, Rotherhithe Mark picks the shore in Rotherhithe because of the area's history as the place where pilgrims sailed to America, making him believe it is easier to find trader tokens and hammered coins. He uses a metal detector, explaining: ""You're looking for the black areas where there's a lot of erosion - that's hopefully where your history will be. The hard pack underneath holds the history."" His favourite find is a potted ham jar lid, which despite being only Victorian, is very rare as it is intact. The peacefulness of mudlarking is what appeals to Mark. ""The whole world is buzzing above you and you're just out of it completely,"" he said. ""You're just in your own world.""",1,614
"The research, by William C Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Youyou Tu, has led to drugs to treat diseases affecting more than 3.4 billion people around the world. One of them, malaria, most people have heard of. But the other two illnesses, onchocerciasis or ""river blindness"" and lymphatic filariasis or ""elephantiasis"" - both caused by roundworm parasites - are lesser known. People catch these worms from bites from infected insects such as flies or mosquitoes. Left untreated, the worms grow and multiply, causing disabling symptoms in their host. The drug ivermectin kills the first larval stage of the parasite - the babies of adult female worms. William C Campbell discovered this by studying bacteria living in soil samples obtained by Satoshi Omura from a Japanese golf course in Ito City, in the Shizuoka region. One particular strain of bacterium, Streptomyces avermitilis, caught his eye because of its potent anti-parasitic properties. Working with drug company Merck and Co, he then set about purifying this agent. Since 1987, Merk (MSD) has given ivermectin away free to those countries that need it most. Last year, it donated more than 300 million doses to treat river blindness and elephantiasis. Meanwhile, Chinese scientist Youyou Tu had been focusing her attentions in the 1960s and 70s on finding a new treatment for malaria. The staples quinine and chloroquine were failing because the parasite that causes malaria - Plasmodium falciparum - had learned how to evade their attack. Disheartened by the lack of effective drugs to tackle this mosquito-borne disease, the professor turned to traditional medicine to hunt for a new option. She found that an extract from the sweet wormwood plant Artemisia annual was sometimes effective - but the results were inconsistent, so she went back to ancient literature, including a recipe from AD350. This ancient document - Ge Hong's A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies - recommended a handful of qinghao [the Chinese name for the plant extract] immersed in two litres of water, ""wring out the juice and drink it all."" This she did (with a few tweaks), testing it on herself as well as animals in her lab. She said: ""During the Cultural Revolution, there were no practical ways to perform clinical trials of new drugs. So, in order to help patients with malaria, my colleagues and I bravely volunteered to be the first people to take the extract. ""After ascertaining that the extract was safe for human consumption, we went to the Hainan province to test its clinical efficacy, carrying out antimalarial trials with patients,"" she wrote in Nature Medicine. Her discovery eventually led to the creation of an antimalarial drug - artemisinin - that is still relied upon today. The World Health Organization credits the expanding access to artemisinin-based combination therapies in malaria-endemic countries as a key factor in driving down deaths in recent years. In 2013, 392 million ACT treatment courses were procured by endemic countries - up from 11 million in 2005. But artemisinin-resistant strains of malaria are emerging. As of February 2015, artemisinin resistance had been confirmed in five countries: And so the quest for new drugs continues.",1,615
"A public consultation has opened on the new proposals, which include a single tower rather than two skyscrapers, for the Jackson's Row area of the city. The former Manchester United stars put the project on hold following criticism from conservationists. Historic England said the plan was ""getting there."" The revised proposals had the potential to ""enhance"" the area's character ""rather than dominate it,"" it said. The public body said the previous scheme threatened to ""erase"" the area's history. The St Michael's development plan includes a five-star hotel, apartments, offices and a synagogue. Neville said the scheme would make a ""significant contribution"" to the growth of Manchester city centre and create 1,500 jobs.

"The Reds looked in control when Roberto Firmino converted James Milner's pass and Daniel Sturridge backheeled to Sadio Mane to clip home a second. But Leicester were given hope when Lucas inexplicably passed the ball to Jamie Vardy to shoot into an empty net. However, Adam Lallana sealed the win by firing a shot into the top corner and Firmino got a second from Mane's pass. Jurgen Klopp's Reds are up to seven points from four games, having played their first three matches on the road because of the expansion of Anfield's Main Stand. Meanwhile, Leicester remain on four points as they prepare for their Champions League debut against Club Brugge on Wednesday. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet picked up blood injuries to his nose and then eye, but he lasted the 90 minutes with summer signing Loris Karius remaining on the bench. Liverpool, as has often been the case under Klopp, looked brilliant in stages, especially in the first 35 minutes when they could have been out of sight. Their opener was a good passing move, which ended in left-back Milner playing a great ball through to Firmino, who stepped inside Robert Huth to steer the ball into the bottom corner. The Foxes defence were again caught out by Jordan Henderson's ball forward for the second and Sturridge squared it with his heel for Mane to score on his home debut. But there will be cause for concern as Brazilian midfielder Lucas started at centre-back, with Mamadou Sakho not in the squad, and he let Leicester back into the game. He miscontrolled a simple pass from Mignolet and - under pressure and in a panic - played the ball across goal to Vardy, who just had to tap into an unguarded net. That gave Leicester hope and they could have had an equaliser when Robert Huth headed a Luis Hernandez long throw-in off the bar. Luckily for the Reds, they got their act together in the second half and Lallana scored his second goal in a week, after his England winner against Slovakia, to wrap up the win, from Georginio Wijnaldum's lay-off. And they added a late fourth when Kasper Schmeichel - who made seven saves in an otherwise good performance - came flying out of his goal with Mane rounding him and unselfishly passing to Firmino to steer the ball past several Leicester defenders. Media playback is not supported on this device Media playback is not supported on this device After record deadline day signing Islam Slimani only returned from Algeria duty on Friday night, Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri decided to wait before giving the striker his debut. Leicester lined up with 10 of their 11 regular starters from last season's title-winning team, with Daniel Amartey in for N'Golo Kante, who was sold to Chelsea earlier this summer. And they were outplayed throughout the game, with their only good spell inspired by Lucas' mistake. Ranieri's side only had three shots on target, including the goal, with Vardy also forcing a save from Mignolet from Riyad Mahrez's ball forward. Last season that combination ended so often in a goal - but this year they might need new ideas, so Ranieri will be eager for PS29m Slimani to give them fresh impetus up front. Former Foxes captain Matt Elliott, in his role as BBC Radio Leicester summariser, said: ""I didn't see anybody have a glaring howler of a game for Leicester, it was more of a general lack of quality. ""At times last year maybe the intensity was a little bit more, and the opposition weren't as good as Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City are going to be this season."" The game was played in front of Anfield's biggest crowd since 1977, with a 54,000 sell-out in the newly expanded stadium. Some 8,500 seats were added to the Main Stand this summer. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: ""It was a tough game against a really strong opponent. ""This team is really capable of a lot of exciting things. We played quick but then we conceded and had to show we could fight and stay in the game. ""I don't think about where we can reach. We have to be really strong in this league. We have had four away games to begin with, so let's go for it, enjoy it and today I saw some really wonderful things."" Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri: ""Liverpool played well and deserved to win. We started well, but after the first goal we lost our shape a little. ""We tried in the second half, but everything Liverpool tried came good. We created chances, but were a little unlucky. ""We have to clear our minds for the next match. When we have lost in the past, we have always had a good reaction.""

"The 28-year-old footballer's contract was terminated hours after he was dropped for Saturday's Premier League match against Manchester United.

"She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet. It had been her decision to call the election, and her leadership of the campaign that faltered and in what was described as the most human performance they had seen for quite some time, Theresa May said sorry, time and again. ""We saw the human being, not the Maybot""; ""it was the first time in seven weeks she didn't say strong and stable""; more poignantly for the Tories MPs who commiserated with each other, ""if she'd campaigned like that, we'd have won."" They were cheered, relieved perhaps, that she had, tonight, managed to pull it off, to show regret at the calamity her decision to go to the country had unleashed, relieved too that she rose to this particular occasion that seems likely to settle nerves enough to avoid the possibility of the party plunging into another leadership election and potentially therefore, another general election that they might lose. The sense of immediate danger to her leadership has faded. But while her enemies are not breathing down her neck, they are still in the room. One MP told me she wasn't asked any hard questions but deliberately took the time to take all of them, to show willing, ""her strategy has been to take as many questions as exist."" It's like that episode of the West Wing where the Presidential Candidate Vinick was in deep trouble, so he took endless questions until the press finally got tired and went home - apologies if the American series isn't your thing, but it's an obsession of rather a lot of Westminster types. While publicly it is tonight the done thing for Tories to be fulsomely on the record praising the prime minister, privately it's hard to find a single MP who believes that she will take the party into the next general election. PM survives first bout of battle for control It is, however, also very hard to find a single MP who wants to unleash even more potential chaos by triggering an election contest, let alone a general election. But it's the circumstances, rather than newly discovered rapture, for the PM that have saved her. One former cabinet minister told me ""having a Tory prime minister is much more important than our own wound licking."" Another minister told me in the medium term it is ""hard to see how"" the PM can stay. Theresa May has survived the first bout of what will be a fight to stay in control. The election has redressed the balance, not just between the two main parties, but also between the Tory leader and her party. And the PM knows it, most tellingly also saying to her MPs tonight, ""I'll serve as long as you want me."" Hardly a bold statement of a leader who feels they are in charge, but an acknowledgement that others will decide when their time is up.",1,621

"Eight year-old Phoebe Hanson wrote to BBC Radio 4's PM saying she worried how the ""bongs"" would be replaced while Big Ben is being repaired next year. PM's editor, Roger Sawyer, told Phoebe: ""It would be quite a task."" A Facebook post by Phoebe's father, Jon Hanson, about the exchange has been liked and shared thousands of times. The ""Big Ben"" bell, after which the Palace of Westminster's Elizabeth Tower is more commonly known, is expected to fall silent early next year for the first time since 2007 for a three-year renovation project. The work will cost PS29m and involve repairs to the clock's hands, mechanism and pendulum. Replying to Phoebe's letter on 12 December, Sawyer said he was ""very much taken with your idea,"" but there could be some operational obstacles because ""the bongs are live."" He explained: ""You'd have to rush in after school each day (and at the weekend), rush home for tea, homework, a bit of chillin', then a quick sleep. ""And then - here's the hard bit - you'd have to rush in again at midnight, because there are live bongs again before the midnight news. ""That's an awful lot of work for someone who is still quite young. I wouldn't like to do all that."" Speaking to BBC News, Mr Hanson said: ""She was listening to Radio 4 in the car and Eddie Mair was saying that Big Ben would stop chiming next year, and she said,'Oh no, we have to do something about it. I want to write a letter.' ""She was absolutely stunned to get a reply, and was so pleased she took it to school and showed everyone. ""She takes things very literally as she is on the autism spectrum, so I think she still wants to do the bongs. ""I'm very proud of her. I work in IT and we try to increase our internet presence, but then she has stepped in and done it in one fell swoop."" Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Hanson called Sawyer's response ""priceless."" ""She thinks I should drive her up to Broadcasting House and back twice a day,"" he told others who had commented on his page. Sawyer said that although he was surprised to receive the letter, he was aware that the bongs at the end of the programme ""seem to chime with the younger audience especially - no pun intended."" He said Phoebe's hand-written letter - accompanied by a covering letter - suggested she could hum the Westminster chimes before playing her own instrument for the bongs, and that she could record everything on her own microphone brought with her to the studio. ""What I say to people who ask what the job [of working on PM] entails is that it requires a lot of determination and tenacity, but also what is vital is imagination and free thinking,"" he said. ""She has a great future because she has that ability to problem-solve in a free thinking way. Those are the kinds of skills that the BBC needs.""",1,623

Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8 of delegates.",1,624
"Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands town becoming ""Land Rover Land""? Discovery, Defender, and Freelander models line the leafy cul-de-sacs that surround the plant on the outskirts of the town centre. Families talk about the difficulty of finding their cars in supermarket car parks because there are now so many of the same cars from the same company. Even Solihull Council is in on the act, with the mayoral car being - of course - a black 2013 Range Rover Vogue. ""Suddenly they are everywhere, throughout the streets of Solihull,"" said mayor Joe Tildesley. ""I look out the window and it's the first car I see. It's a status vehicle people aspire to have. ""They are here and are - quite properly - endorsed by many people, including the council. I don't see it as a bad thing."" Mother-of-three Julie Henn, lives in Nerstal Drive in Solihull, just a stone's throw away from the Jaguar Land Rover site. The 55-year-old said she regretted leaving her Land Rover behind so much when she moved to the UK from South Africa about eight years ago that she ended up buying a replacement soon afterwards. Her husband is now hoping to buy a new one as well. ""There was not a day that went by when I did not regret it,"" she said. ""Now I can't believe how many there are. On Saturday I saw four in a row. ""A Range Rover, two Discoveries and a Freelander - one after the other."" Mrs Henn said she knew people who struggled to find their Land Rovers in supermarket car parks because they were so common. Mother-of two Joanne Rumney, who lives around the corner in Oakslade Drive, owns a Land Rover Discovery from the 1990s. ""People are proud to have JLR here,"" said the 38-year-old. ""It has a status that people like. They are good family cars."" Jaguar Land Rover, which also has manufacturing bases in Castle Bromwich and Halewood on Merseyside, has said the latest announcement will bring the total number of jobs it has created in the UK over the past three years to almost 11,000. Mr Tildesley said the firm's investment had ""undoubtedly"" boosted Solihull with other firms benefiting from knock-on trade. Rachael Eade, from the Manufacturing Advisory Service, said every job created by vehicle manufacturers leads to two or three in the supply chain. ""It's a huge confidence booster locally and UK-wide,"" she said. ""It's 1,700 jobs and three times that in the supply chain. ""I think the new technology involved will attract a new, younger market and will make a difference to the supply chain. ""Younger people have more of a desire to be involved in that as they probably view car manufacturing to be a bit dusty, dirty and not for them."" But not everyone is happy. Some shops said the expansion had brought with it increased parking problems. Terry Cosma, manager of Solihull Fish Bar in Hob's Moat Road, said: ""I have not noticed any change in business. We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers. ""The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads."" Julie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: ""The parking is ridiculous - diabolical. ""There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there."" In 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site. But Ms Eade said she did not believe Solihull would suffer a similar fate and collapse if JLR's fortunes changed in the future. ""The automotive industry has learnt lessons from MG Rover,"" she said. ""They are not as heavily reliant on one customer now and if you are a designer you probably work for JLR, Mini, JCB, Ford. ""I don't think the bubble will burst for the foreseeable future.""",1,625
"Friars Walk has been years in the planning and the development ground to a halt in the 2008 financial crisis. Now it is opening with Debenhams as its anchor store and retailers such as Marks and Spencer moving back. Newport Council lent the developers PS90m in a commercial deal to ensure the centre opened on time. Council leader Bob Bright said there had been a renaissance over the last decade and people ""underestimated Newport."" As well as 30 new shops, there will be about a dozen restaurants and an eight-screen Cineworld multiplex cinema. Welsh fashion designer Julien Macdonald opened the Debenhams store. Newport Council borrowed PS90m at a lower rate of interest and then lent it on to the developers in a ""calculated risk"" to ensure the project was built. ""Everything in life is risky but we were at an impasse when the developer was unable to raise the funds in the money markets because of the interest rates,"" said Mr Bright. ""We took the innovative step of using public money to develop Friars Walk."" ""We didn't do it blindly, we will make a profit on the financial deal of several million pounds and we have a negotiated agreement where we will participate in the profit when the centre, as I believe it will be, is sold eventually. ""It's a commercial deal with is good for Newport and it will make a profit."" The complex is estimated to create 1,200 jobs within its shops and restaurants. Queensberry Real Estate started building the development in April last year. Bob Evans, who runs the Waterloo pub and restaurant near the dock gates, said he hoped it would benefit the whole city. ""It's been really hard but Newport is up and coming now. This is good for Newport, it will bring in lots of people who currently go to Cwmbran or Cardiff to shop and bypass us."" Conservative shadow business minister William Graham's family surveying firm has history going back to 1844 in the city centre. He added: ""It will provide the impetus for Newport city centre to re-emerge as the both the premier retail district in this region and the centre for social and cultural entertainment.""",1,626
"The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close when his low shot was saved by Stephen Bywater. Tom Naylor inadvertently put the ball in his own net after the break before Daniel Sturridge tapped in his first and then thumped home the Reds' fifth. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made only four changes from the XI that started in the 2-0 league defeat at Burnley on Saturday. The quality of the visiting team was soon apparent at the Pirelli Stadium against a Burton side who have had a mixed start to their first ever season in the Championship. After Liverpool's Belgian forward Origi cleverly profited from tricky work in the box from Sadio Mane, Brazilian Firmino doubled the lead following a terrible throw-out from goalkeeper Bywater. It was 3-0 just after the hour when the unfortunate Naylor had little time to react as James Milner's ball came towards him at pace. And substitute Sturridge then grabbed a late double, converting at the far post from Milner's pass before firing in low from 15 yards. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""There were still a few situations where we were missing a bit of sharpness but the main problem was, it was unbelievable, our build-up and style of play at Burnley - one more pass but 15 times we are completely free in the box. ""So we needed to use this game and that's what we did and it was better."" Burton manager Nigel Clough: ""It's difficult for our lads to compete with that sort of quality. With this being 72 hours before the Derby game, our focus was always with that one. ""When you think we finished with a couple of teenagers and a 20- or 21-year-old, you could train with them for a couple of seasons and not gain the experience they've got tonight.""",1,627
"Mr Blair said the party he used to lead should aspire to govern, rather than be a ""fringe protest movement."" He has been a vocal critic of leader Jeremy Corbyn, warning before his leadership election victory that the party risked ""annihilation"" if he won. Mr Corbyn's office declined to respond to Mr Blair's comments, made in a Spectator article. ""All wings of the Labour Party which support the notion of the Labour Party as a Party aspiring to govern, rather than as a fringe protest movement agree on the tragedy of the Labour Party's current position,"" he said in the article, which does not mention Mr Corbyn by name. His comments come amid divisions within the party over its future direction. Most Labour MPs did not back Mr Corbyn for leader, but he overwhelmingly won the contest with over half of the membership's vote. Tensions have surfaced since the Commons voted on air strikes in Syria. Some MPs have complained they were abused online after backing military intervention, and Mr Corbyn has warned members ""abuse and intimidation"" will not be tolerated. There have also been claims so-called moderate Labour MPs could be unseated by pressure from the grass-roots Momentum group, formed from Mr Corbyn's leadership campaign, which the group denies. In his article, Mr Blair also defended his party's record under his leadership, during which he said it had ""effectively discarded"" its ideological commitment to socialism. Labour ""fell short"" in areas when hard choices had to be made, he said, with ""significant elements"" of the party unhappy with the ""compromise"" and ""pragmatism"" required for government, seeing it as a betrayal of Labour's principles. Looking forward, Mr Blair said ""more modernising and less ideological thinking"" was needed to cope with challenges such as the housing shortage and social exclusion. ""Right now we're in danger of not asking the right questions, never mind failing to get the right answers,"" he said. Many current Labour members feel the party ""lost its way"" in government, Mr Blair concluded. ""I feel we found it,"" he said. ""But I accept in the process we failed to convince enough people that the true progressives are always the modernisers, not because they discard principle but because they have the courage to adhere to it when confronted with reality.""",1,628
"The end-of-season event gets under way on Sunday, with more than 250,000 spectators expected across eight days. Security is under review but the same measures are in place as last year, when the venue was on high alert. Jamie Murray opens play at the O2 Arena alongside doubles partner John Peers at 12:00 GMT on Sunday. ""It's obviously a terrible thing that's happened,"" said Murray. ""It's affected so many people and I guess there are a lot of shockwaves around the world that something like that can happen."" At least 128 people were killed in attacks carried out by eight gunmen and suicide bombers in the French capital. Mahut, 33, and Herbert, 24, are making their debuts at the season finale for the best eight teams in the world. They will play Croatia's Ivan Dodig and Brazilian Marcelo Melo in their opening match at 18:00 on Monday, and hope to reflect events in their home country. ""We are discussing with the ATP to do something, at least to wear something on the shirt,"" said Mahut, who lives in Paris. ""We didn't talk with the other players but I'm sure they will do something. That is the only thing we can do and have a thought for the families, and let the politicians do what they have to do."" The ATP confirmed ""enhanced security"" is in place and preparations continue as normal, reminding spectators that bag searches will be in place and no food or drink can be taken into the O2 Arena. The French pair watched events unfold on television in London and Herbert said they were ""still in shock"" on Saturday. ""Right now are thoughts are with the victims, the families and the guys fighting to get peace and Paris secure again,"" he said. Having confirmed that his friends and family - who live in Strasbourg - were safe, he added: ""I'm one of the lucky people, but it doesn't matter because I feel really, really touched by what is happening right now in France. ""When it happens in your country I think the feeling is even worse. I mean, I'm scared right now. ""Yesterday we were quite happy, it's the first time for us here working in a kind of euphoria, and then you get a message, a call, and from one second to the other you're scared, you feel bad about what happened in France. ""Right now it's tough to realise because I think we're still in shock and afraid of what's happening."" While the pair still plan to play in London, Mahut said ""tennis comes second now"" after confirming his friends and family were also safe. He said: ""Of course we were scared but I think that's what they want. ""It's not easy to talk about what happened right now. I just talked to the family and friends - I had some friends who were having dinner in the Bataclan area last night. ""At this moment we should be having fun playing the World Tour finals but today it's really complicated for us."" The World Tour Finals is the season finale for both singles and doubles, with world number one Novak Djokovic taking on Japan's Kei Nishikori at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, followed by Roger Federer against Tomas Berdych at 20:00.",1,630
"The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers' survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: ""Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. ""This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. ""The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. ""On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. ""Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. ""Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes.""",1,631
"The teenager suffered a serious leg injury in the fall at Devil's Cave in Chellow Dene, near Bradford, on Friday night. During the two-hour rescue, Calder Valley Search and Rescue Team lowered a team member down into the cave by rope and the boy was placed on a stretcher. He was later carried to an ambulance waiting nearby. The incident was attended by 18 search and rescue team members, West Yorkshire Police, West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service and Yorkshire Ambulance Service.",1,632
"Research suggests women will not earn as much as their male counterparts until 2069, nearly 100 years after the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. Holyrood's economy, fair work and jobs committee will examine why women working in Scotland still earn an average of 6.2 less than men. Ministers said they were committed to removing the barriers faced by women. The difference between men and women's median hourly earnings for full-time work in Scotland fell from 7.7 in 2015 to 6.2 in 2016. Studies show fewer women work in higher-paid sectors like technology, IT and engineering, and continue to be under-represented in senior management and leadership roles. Despite 51 of workers in finance and insurance being female, it is the sector with the highest pay gap, at 29.9. The committee cited UK government figures as showing that ""equalising women's productivity could add almost PS600bn to the economy"" across the country. Convener Gordon Lindhurst said much had changed in the labour market since the 1970 legislation. The Conservative MSP told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the inquiry aimed to be ""open-minded"" about how closing the gap could affect the economy. He said: ""The committee wants to hear from businesses and individuals who may be affected by this issue and we want to take their views and experiences on board, and look at how we can weave that into policy recommendations for the Scottish government. ""We want to encourage companies to look at the issue in perhaps a more positive way than sometimes is thought, and to see how this can be of benefit not just to the employees but also to the companies themselves. ""The committee is open-minded about this. We're interested in seeing how this can affect the economy - it's not a matter of presupposing the answer. It's a very complex matter - work patterns have changed since the 1970 Equal Pay Act was brought in, we've got remote working, internet working, we have flexitime, we have all sorts of things in which the world has moved on, and it's important to review matters and see how this all fits together."" Mr Lindhurst said the education system and the way people were brought into the workplace ""may be key"" to the inquiry. Tricia Nelson, a partner at professional services firm EY, told the programme that it was ""such a good thing"" that the issue was being discussed. She said: ""In my own experience, you don't set out in your career thinking'gosh, is there a gap?'. ""But the more experienced you become and as you progress through the years, you do start to think,'is everything fair? Am I getting treated the same as everyone else?' And without the data and without the conversation we can't be bold for change and move the agenda forward. ""There is empirical evidence that the economy works better when women are a massive contributing factor to the workforce. And the more we can encourage organisations to look at the data and understand how they can proactively drive change the better. ""Certainly the work my colleagues and I do is about men and women having the conversation and being really open about this - there is a degree of unconscious bias, we know that, and in my experience when you start to talk about that things do change."" The Scottish government has said equality is ""embedded"" in its economic strategy and ""at the heart of ambitions for a socially just and inclusive Scotland."" Employability Minister Jamie Hepburn told the BBC that the gap was ""a long-standing issue,"" adding that ""we still have some way to go despite having had an equal pay act for a considerable amount of time."" He said: ""We have to start with the fundamentals. One of the things we're embedding in the school environment is the developing young workforce agenda. ""One of the things we can try and do through that is tackling some of the gender norms in terms of subject matter and in terms of areas of study that we see in schools, and going on into colleges and universities, which leads to gender segregation in the workplace. ""We know if we can better remunerate people in the workplace, if people are better respected in the workplace, then it's going to boost innovation and it's going to increase levels of productivity, which is a win for individual companies and a win for our overall economy.""",1,633
"The 23-year-old, Ulster's Player of the Year, made his international debut for Ireland in the Six Nations game against England at Twickenham in February. McCloskey still had a year remaining on his previous contract but had no hesitation in signing a long-term deal. ""I grew up in Ulster and it was always a dream to wear the jersey,"" he said. ""Despite some strong interest from other clubs, it was a fairly straightforward decision since all of my family and friends are here. ""The supporters, the facilities we have and the quality of the coaching were all factors in my decision. ""We had a disappointing finish to the season but I believe things are promising for the future and I'm excited to be part of that."" McCloskey has accumulated 42 appearances, scoring five tries, since making his debut for the province in February 2014 as a replacement in the Pro12 fixture against the Dragons. Ulster Director of Rugby Les Kiss described McCloskey's expressed delight at McCloskey's decision to extend his stay. ""Stuart has been one of our standout performers all season. A major strength of his is his gain-line busting runs, which we used to great effect this season. ""In addition to his powerful carrying ability, his deft handling and decoy lines have also caused havoc for defences.""",1,634
"Amber Rudd told the BBC the manifesto was ""not going to be identical to the last one"" and said things had changed since 2015 because of Brexit. The target, set by David Cameron in 2010, has never been met and recent figures put net migration at 273,000. The PM indicated in April that she would stick with the aim. Speaking on a campaign visit last month, Theresa May, who was Ms Rudd's predecessor as home secretary, told the BBC: ""We want to see sustainable net migration in this country."" ""I believe that sustainable net migration is in the tens of thousands."" Questions had been raised about whether the commitment would feature in the Conservative manifesto after Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said that immigration was ""not about putting numbers on it"" but about ensuring Britain had the skilled workers it needed. Asked whether she agreed with her colleague, Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics: ""It's too early to say. I appreciate you want to push me on this but we are going to have to wait until the manifesto comes out."" Pressed on the issue again, she added: ""That's why we're having a new manifesto. It's not going to be identical to the last one. ""We're setting it out for hopefully for a five year term, we've got a lot to think through to work out what's the best way to deliver on our priorities."" She added: ""My personal view is, we need to continue to bring immigration down. I want to make sure that we do it in a way that supports businesses, you know we're ending freedom of movement when we leaving the European Union. ""So the situation from that time the [2015] manifesto.... has changed because we're leaving the European Union, so it's right that we look at it again."" Ms Rudd also played down the potential impact of excluding students from net migration figures, saying: ""It's a complete red herring to talk about taking students out of those numbers and it making a big impact."" This was because, in theory, roughly the same numbers of students should be leaving the UK at the end of their courses as are arriving each year. Official figures out last month show EU migrants make up more than one in 10 manufacturing sector workers in the UK. The government has promised new migration controls after the UK leaves the EU, when freedom of movement rules will no longer apply, but it has yet to set out the precise model it will adopt. Labour says it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said new immigration controls should not be the ""overarching priority"" as the UK leaves. UKIP has said that Mrs May's failure to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 while she was home secretary suggests that she could yet ""back slide"" on delivering Brexit.",1,635
"A deal was made by the two main parties and the British and Irish governments to resolve a crisis at Stormont. Solutions were found on issues over paramilitarism and welfare reform. But Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said a lack of consensus over how to deal with the past was a let-down to police and Troubles victims' families. DCC Harris said an extra PS160m of government funding to tackle dissident republicans that was agreed in the deal was much needed. He added the agreement's initiatives to tackle paramilitarism and organised crime were also positive. But a proposed new independent Historical Investigations Unit, which would have taken on the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) responsibility for outstanding Troubles murder investigations, has not yet been approved. DCC Harris said: ""We are on record as saying the formation of a Historical Investigations Unit would provide an opportunity for a more structured and coherent approach to dealing with the past, allowing the PSNI to concentrate primarily on keeping people safe today."" He said that in absence of that body the PSNI would have to ensure its ""finite resources are used in the most effective manner."" ""We must balance keeping people safe today with our continued duties in relation to the past. ""The reality is the financial challenges facing us will continue to have a direct impact on how we respond to the demands of the past and the pace at which those demands can be serviced."" Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness said talks on the legacy of the past failed because the government would not commit to full disclosure of classified documents relating to Troubles incidents on national security grounds. He added: ""That pretext for blocking disclosure is clearly nonsense as much of the information families are looking for is related to events 30 to 40 years ago."" Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, who helped broker the agreement, is to meet relatives of Troubles victims to discuss their concerns over the deal. It had been a ""bitter pill for victims to swallow,"" according the the victims' commissioner Judith Thompson. She said victims ""deserve respect and consideration and they cannot be shunted off into a dead end."" ""It is not good enough to build up hopes for the most comprehensive set of proposals yet to address victims' and survivors' needs and then fail to deliver."" Ms Thompson added that politicians must give a timescale for ""the issues that are being put in the'too difficult' box once again."" Alan McBride, whose wife was killed in the IRA's 1993 bombing of a fishmonger's on Belfast's Shankill Road, said he was uncertain whether legacy issues would ever be resolved. ""My frustration is that they're not going to be able to agree on this, so therefore there's going to be another opportunity wasted,"" he said. ""There is talking still on going, and that has got to be welcomed, because we have to give out hope to victims and survivors."" Mike Ritchie, a case work manager for the Relatives for Justice victims' group, said that while he was disappointed with the outcome of the political negotiations, he would prefer no deal to ""a bad deal."" ""To set up a bad process again would be very difficult for victims' families,"" Mr Ritchie said. ""If we're going to have a deal let's have a good deal."" He added that pressure would remain on Northern Ireland's politicians to deal with legacy issues. ""This isn't going away. I think that we'll be back talking about this in due course.""",1,636

"A group led by Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan bought a controlling 60 stake in Swansea in a deal ratified by the Premier League on 1 July. They are due in Swansea on Thursday but the Trust, which retains a 21.1 holding, is disappointed with progress. ""We are still to receive information regarding plans for the football club,"" said Trust chairman Phil Sumbler. He added the new owners were yet to give any indication ""what investment into the football club, if any, is proposed."" Sumbler said the Trust urgently wanted to discuss the long-term plans for the club and the negotiation of a new shareholders' agreement. ""We are disappointed that our desire to enter into these discussions has not been matched by the buyers or the other remaining shareholders,"" he said. ""However, we remain keen to work with Messrs Levien and Kaplan and their representatives in order to ensure all parties pull together in the long-term interests of the football club. ""We are also keen to introduce improved governance and structure to the football club to ensure we have an effective plan for the coming season and beyond."" BBC Wales Sport revealed in April which of Swansea's directors would be selling all - or part - of their shareholdings. The previous shareholders took charge in 2002, at a time when Swansea were struggling in the lowest tier of the Football League, and oversaw their climb to the Premier League. Their shares were believed to have increased tenfold in worth by the time of the takeover in June 2016. Sumbler added: ""This is a key time for both Swansea City and the Supporters' Trust and it is in everyone's interest that we swiftly conclude negotiations so that, both on and off the field, we can concentrate on the new football season ahead."" When the takeover was ratified by the Premier League, a statement issued by Levien and Kaplan said they were keen to work with the Trust. ""There are still a few minor loose ends to tie up on the deal which we envisage will be completed before the end of the month,"" they said. ""In the meantime, we are both extremely excited to be part of a new era for Swansea City and working with Huw Jenkins and the Supporters' Trust in taking the club forward.""",1,638
"The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: ""Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services. ""We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications."" It later said no patient data or care had been affected. Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: ""It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems. ""However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online."" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware. In that case, it paid 17,000 to get access to files back. Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension.locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros ""if the data encoding is incorrect."" Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said: ""It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. ""I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.""",1,639
"Isabelle and Stanley Larson from Oxted, Surrey, were burgled in October 2005. The Marine Policing Unit's dive team were working on an unrelated case at Slade Ponds when they recovered the items in a supermarket carrier bag. The Larsons were traced after a public appeal by the police. One of the items found was a watch belonging to Mrs Larson's uncle, that he was given in 1972 in recognition of 40 years' service with the South Eastern Gas Board. Mrs Larson said: ""I was amazed when my daughter-in-law said she'd seen a police appeal with pictures of my father's cycling medal and uncle's watch. ""I saw the pictures myself and recognised the items straight away - it's wonderful news. ""After all this time I had lost hope of ever seeing these items again."" PC Steve Morgan, from the Met's dive team, met the couple at their home to return the medal and jewellery. ""A decade after these items were stolen it was a privilege to be able to meet the Larsons and give back these items which have such meaning to the family,"" he said.",1,640
"Media playback is not supported on this device The 34-year-old beat three-time champion Tony Martin by 26.23 seconds on a hilly 47.1km course in Spain. After finishing second to Martin in 2011 and 2013, Wiggins finally has a rainbow jersey on the road to go with the six he has won on the track. ""I knew coming into it that I had the legs,"" Wiggins said afterwards. ""Once I saw the course I realised if I was ever going to beat Tony again it was on a course like this. ""It's been an up and down year - obviously I didn't ride the Tour de France. I want to dedicate this to my family because they had to put up with me when I was at home in July. ""It's my last Road World Championships and I've finished with a gold medal."" Martin trailed Wiggins by 9.64 seconds at the final time-check and the Briton extended his lead in the final 12km. Wiggins clocked 56 minutes 25.52 seconds to claim a convincing win over Germany's Martin, who was chasing a fourth-successive title. Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands finished third. ""I knew it would be difficult on the final loop, but I paced it perfectly and still had pace in the final few kilometres,"" Wiggins explained. ""On my last descent, I heard on the radio that I was 10 seconds up but I pushed all the way to the line because I did not want to take any risks."" Wiggins collapsed to the ground in exhaustion at the finish line but recovered to raise his thumb in celebration when Martin crossed the line. Victory in north-west Spain gives the 2012 Tour de France winner a world time trial title to go with his three national titles and gold at the London Olympics in the discipline. ""To add the world title is just fantastic. Now I've got the set,"" added Wiggins. It is the perfect end to a patchy year on the road and track for Wiggins, who won the Tour of California in May, but then missed out on Team Sky selection for the Tour de France and had to settle for silver in the velodrome in the team pursuit at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. His success means he becomes the first British male rider to take world time trial gold since Chris Boardman in the inaugural race in 1994. Emma Pooley was the last British female to win gold in the event in 2010. Wiggins has announced that he intends to return to the track for the Rio Olympics in 2016 and also hopes to attempt to break the hour record set by Germany's Jens Voigt last week. Result: 1.

"The rail union is calling on the Scottish government to set out an immediate timetable for Abellio to be stripped of its ScotRail franchise. It has said making Scotland's railways safer can only be done with a publicly-owned service. ScotRail said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds on new trains and improved technology. Protests are being held at railway stations across the country. The RMT claims that Dutch firm Abellio is plundering a PS1m-a-month profit which Scotland's railways desperately need. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Any notion excessive profits are siphoned off is quite simply a fallacy."" Abellio was awarded the ScotRail franchise in 2015 for 10 years but could be stripped of the contract after five years if punctuality falls below 84.3. ScotRail said the union's comments bore no scrutiny. It accepted that performance had dipped, but insisted it was still around 90. Almost 20,000 people have signed a petition calling on Transport Minister Humza Yousaf to ""make ScotRail bosses improve Scotland's trains or strip them of their contract."" ScotRail was recently fined PS483,000 for failing to meet required standards for trains and stations. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week indicated that stripping the company of its contract to run the railways was on the table if performance failed to improve. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""RMT is campaigning to make Scotland's trains safer, more secure and accessible. ""This can only be done with a publicly-owned service where profit isn't the main motive of the operator."" He added: ""RMT calls on the Scottish government to set out a timetable for bringing ScotRail under public ownership, and with the current level of anger that's reinforced in the petition there can be no excuse for the dragging of heels. ""The union is available for talks with ministers to take the issues of safe staffing, investment and public ownership forwards."" A ScotRail spokesman said: ""These comments bear no scrutiny whatsoever. ""Performance has dipped by around 1 - but is still tracking around the 90 mark - and we have a robust performance improvement plan to rectify that. ""At the same time, we are investing hundreds of millions of pounds on new trains, refurbishing our existing fleet and introducing queue-busting smart technology to keep people moving."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""This government has ensured profits are capped, that this cap is tighter than any previous franchise and that at least 50 of revenue above that cap is reinvested into our railways. ""A manifesto commitment was made to facilitate a public sector bid for our railways and ministers remain firmly committed to this. ""Currently, 89 trains out of 100 arrive within five minutes of the timetable - our contract demands 91. ""That is why we asked ScotRail to implement the improvement plan which looks at addressing service-quality issues and tackling congestion, while minimising'skip stopping', until new train fleets arrive."" The spokesman added: ""We fully expect ScotRail to hit their anticipated targets to lift performance. ""This contract will deliver very real improvements across the term - new and better trains, improvements at stations, initiatives on fares and a revolution in the end-to-end journey experience.""",1,643
"Tens of thousands of pilgrims joined him for the Way of the Cross ceremony, recalling Jesus' crucifixion. Among the cross bearers were Syrian and Iraqi refugees, and Nigerians who had escaped Boko Haram persecution. The service came a day after almost 150 people were killed in an al-Shabab attack on a Kenyan university. ""We still see today our persecuted brothers, decapitated and crucified for their faith in you [Jesus], before our eyes and often with our complicit silence,"" Pope Francis said, presiding over the ceremony at the Colosseum. Earlier, he condemned the attack in Kenya, where Christians were singled out and shot, as an act of ""senseless brutality."" In another Good Friday ceremony, Pope Francis listened as the Vatican's official preacher Raniero Cantalamessa denounced the ""disturbing indifference of world institutions in the face of all this killing of Christians."" He too mentioned the Kenya attack, as well as the beheading of 22 Egyptian Coptic Christians by Islamic State (IS) militants in Libya in February. Pope Francis has spoken out against the persecution of Christians before, saying that the world would be justified using military force to combat the ""unjust aggression"" by IS.",1,644
"Media playback is not supported on this device Doull emulated fellow Welshman Geraint Thomas, who won at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, by helping Great Britain win team pursuit gold in world record time. The 23-year-old joined record-breaking Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to beat the world champions. ""That was just surreal, it feels dreamlike"" said the Cardiff rider. Media playback is not supported on this device ""We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable."" He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio. ""I've dreamt of this moment for so long,"" added Doull. ""It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work."" Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics. Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics. But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold. Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand. But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds. Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title. ""It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me,"" said Doull. ""It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.""",1,645

"Charity Twelves Company, based in Devon, said it had turned away 112 people seeking support in 2015. A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a 55 rise in reports of sexual abuse in the past four years. Police urged victims to come forward and said they would be protected. Updates on this story and more from Devon and Cornwall Between January and November 2015, 1,326 reports of sexual abuse were made to the force, compared with 853 in 2011. The figures show more than 380 historic allegations - in which the offence was committed before 1 May 2004 - of rape involving a child have been reported to the force since 2011. Jon Brown, head of development and impact at the NSPCC, said: ""Unfortunately there is a significant gap between the number of people who need help and therapy as a result of the abuse, and the availability of services."" He said the rise in reports was a result of historic cases of child sex abuse in the news, which had encouraged more people to come forward. 853 - 2011 888 - 2012 979 - 2013 1,221 - 2014 1,326 - 2015 Mr Brown said the prime minister had highlighted child sexual abuse as a priority along with dealing with terrorism which was ""encouraging."" However, Mr Brown said there needed to be a ""more joined up approach [between authorities] to provide the provision of help for victims"" including ""greater treatment and help"" and working with schools and families to prevent abuse. He said local authorities, health services and the police, as well as charities such as the NSPCC, had a duty to protect and care for victims. Tom Dingwall, chief executive of Twelves Company, which supports sexual and domestic abuse victims in the South West, said it provided services to almost 300 victims in 2015. ""Last year, demand outstripped our capacity to deliver services and we turned away 112 adults from receiving specialist support."" Across Devon and Cornwall there are four Local Safeguarding Children's Boards - which aim to protect those at risk. Andy Bickley, chair for Plymouth, said investments, including training courses for those who come into contact with children, have been made. David Taylor, the chair for Devon and Torbay, said authorities were ""getting better at identifying abuse."" He said: ""It is an extremely complex and challenging area of work, and authorities in the region are learning from best practice in other parts of the country."" Source: Devon and Cornwall Police Det Ch Insp Neil Ralph said the rise in reports of abuse was a ""challenge for the police service, locally and nationally,"" but the force had made a ""huge investment"" by creating a dedicated unit and was working with other forces. ""It is a large increase and we've increased our digital and online footprint as these things can be really difficult to report over the phone so it enables them to report abuse [online] much easier. ""People have a high level of trust in the police and the Operation Yewtree impact [means] they have felt more compelled to report abuse to police. He said a high number of the reports, which were released in response to a freedom of information request by BBC News, related to historical crimes and the force ""would do everything it can to investigate them and bring the offenders to justice."" - Local authorities have the statutory responsibility for safeguarding children. - The safeguarding is overseen by Local Safeguarding Children's Boards. - These Boards are made up of a number of agencies such as local authorities, police, education health providers. - Police will lead on criminal investigations with social care services leading on the safeguarding.",1,647
"In a statement (in French) it said it was ""worried about the continued worsening of the situation."" On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The fighters, the YPG militia based in Syria, have rejected Turkey's demand to leave areas it has seized, saying Islamists would return if it left. Turkey's assault is a new thread in an already-complex conflict that has drawn in competing regional powers. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Sunday that Turkey ""will not permit the [Kurdish militia] to carry out aggressive acts."" ""Our security forces gave the necessary response and will continue to do so,"" Mr Davutoglu said. Syria has also condemned the Turkish action as a violation of its sovereignty and asked the UN Security Council to intervene. France also called on the Syrian regime and its allies to stop their bombardments ""across the whole of the country."" France said priority should be given to implementing an agreement reached in Munich this week on ceasing hostilities, and the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Almost five years of civil war in Syria have led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people. More than 11 million people have been displaced. How Putin is succeeding in Syria Displaced Syrians struggle to survive Syria: The story of the conflict Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds: What's going on? Attempts to broker a peace deal have repeatedly failed, but on Thursday, world leaders agreed to work towards a so-called cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. The US and Russian presidents agreed in a ""frank and business-like"" phone call to work more closely to achieve this, the Kremlin said on Sunday. Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been carrying out air strikes since September against what it terms ""terrorists."" Among the targets shelled by Turkey is the Menagh airbase, which was seized by the YPG on Thursday from Syrian Islamist rebels. The YPG controls much of Syria's northern border with Turkey. Syria's war hardly needs a new front, but another has now opened up. Ankara sees the Kurdish PYD party and its YPG militia as terrorist organisations. It's worried that weapons are seeping over the border from Syria to the PKK, with which Turkey has renewed its armed conflict since a ceasefire broke down last year. Washington rejects Ankara's view that the PYD is a terrorist organisation, seeing it instead as an effective ally against so-called Islamic State (IS). That has caused rifts between the two Nato allies and is hampering international peace talks. Syria is the stage for several proxy wars, and Turkey has just started another, going after its Kurdish nemesis there and vowing to stop the PYD from cementing control of northern Syria. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish forces shot at Kurdish fighters inside Syria on Sunday after coming under fire themselves. Ankara sees the group as being linked with Kurdish guerrillas from PKK, which has waged a campaign against security forces in Turkey for decades. In other developments: Under the agreed cessation of hostilities plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria. The halt would not apply to the battle against the jihadists of IS and al-Nusra Front. However, neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved in the deal and both have since vowed to continue fighting. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that he intended to retake ""the whole country"" from rebels - a statement the US government said was ""deluded."" Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo. Also on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev repeated a warning that any foreign ground operation in Syria would lead to ""a full-fledged, long war."" Turkey has said its troops and forces from Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS.",1,648

"He faces a number of charges. First, he pulled out of a long-planned trip to Moscow after the US missile strike on a Syrian airfield. It was agreed the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should go instead. Poodle, cried his critics. Next, Team Boris briefed journalists that the foreign secretary wanted to get the G7 to agree new sanctions against Russia at its meeting in the Italian city of Lucca. But Mr Johnson entirely failed to persuade other countries to agree. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there was no consensus new sanctions would help and argued they could push Russia into a corner. Mr Johnson's own view of the Syrian conflict seems to have swerved around like a shopping trolley since he became the UK's chief diplomat in July. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee at the start of 2017, he signalled a shift in UK policy towards Syria. Mr Johnson said the ""mantra"" of calling for President Assad to go had not worked and the military space had been left open to Russia to fill. The Foreign Secretary told peers President Assad should be allowed to run for election as part of a ""democratic resolution"" of the civil war. Now, however, Mr Johnson believes the Syrian leader has to go. How much of this is fair? And what might the episode say about Boris Johnson's standing in Theresa May's government? First, the UK was a bystander to the Trump administration's missile strike on Syria. The government was given a courtesy call to say it was coming but the UK was not asked to be involved. Mr Johnson's trip to Moscow (which would have been the first by a British foreign secretary to Russia for five years) was long planned and quickly binned. I understand Mrs May told Mr Johnson it was his call whether he wanted to go or not. After speaking to Rex Tillerson, Mr Johnson and his US opposite number agreed it was best for one man to deliver a single message to Moscow. Mr Johnson then spent a weekend hitting the phones to other G7 countries trying to get a united position agreed ahead of the meeting in Lucca. In its final communique, the G7 did agree to state the Assad regime had to end. But further sanctions - an idea endorsed by Number 10 - got nowhere. It was clearly a snub to Mr Johnson although government sources insist sanctions have not been taken off the table. On Wednesday, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said other countries were ""less forward-leaning"" than the UK on the issue. Diplomacy is tough. But it may have been unwise for the Foreign Office to suggest sanctions were an ambition when key G7 nations clearly didn't agree. At the weekend, I was told by Team Boris that he was very relaxed about the sniping and criticism being lobbed his way in recent days. And Mr Johnson has provoked quite a lot since he became foreign secretary, largely because of his use of decidedly undiplomatic language. He was taken to task by a Swedish MEP in February for calling Brexit a ""liberation."" A month before that, Mr Johnson warned the French president not to respond to Brexit by administering ""punishment beatings"" in the manner of a World War Two film. Guy Verhofstadt, who speaks for the European Parliament on Brexit, branded the remarks ""abhorrent and deeply unhelpful."" It was several days after President Trump's election that Boris Johnson said it was time for Mr Trump's critics to get over their ""whinge-o-rama"" - a comment I know left some officials in Brussels agog. Mr Johnson is always keen to speak with the swashbuckling pluck of the newspaper columnist he once was. His many fans in the Tory party might love it. But even Mrs May has hinted at exasperation. At the Conservative Party conference last autumn, the prime minister said: ""Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about."" It was a joke. But not many prime ministers joke about their foreign secretary's erraticism. Then in December, Mrs May described Boris Johnson as an FFS - saying that in this case it stood for being a Fine Foreign Secretary (and not the punchy abbreviation for a term of exasperation). When Mrs May was home secretary and Mr Johnson was London mayor they had a prickly relationship. She then beat him to the job he craved. Her appointment of the Brexit campaign's most prominent champion to the job of foreign secretary stunned Westminster and it remains one of the most intriguing political relationships within the government. While happy to clip his wings publicly from time to time, Theresa May also needs Boris Johnson on board as she embarks on Brexit. A force so effective in persuading Britain to vote to leave the EU is not a politician the prime minister wants sniping from outside the cabinet as the negotiating trade-offs begin.",1,650

"Allan Whittern ran the grocer's store in Suffolk Parade from 1932 until his death 50 years later, in 1982. Following its closure in 1991, the door painted with his father's likeness was donated by his son to the Wilson Art Gallery and Museum in the town. The Cheltenham Trust, which runs the gallery, wants to restore it for an exhibition later in the year.

""The chap said'well what can we put on?' and Allan promptly replied'you can put me on'. And so the chap did,"" she said. She said since it disappeared, people have asked after its whereabouts. ""People used to pass by in semi-darkness and see the portrait there and [saygoodnight Mr Whittern', thinking he was coming out of the warehouse. ""Since he's gone we've been asked by so many,'where is it? What have you done with it? You haven't destroyed it?"" A crowdfunding campaign for donations has reached more than half of the PS3,000 needed for the work to be carried out. A further PS1,400 needs to be raised by Friday. The trust's Chloe Moorhead said: ""Championing Cheltenham's rich heritage is of huge importance to the trust and to the town. ""This is a fantastic opportunity for people to play their part in preserving an important part of Cheltenham's art history for generations to come.""",1,652
"The humpback has been seen at Pettycur Bay, Kinghorn in Fife. Humpback sightings are not uncommon in Scotland, but a large whale so far up the Forth estuary is a lot more unusual. Police Scotland is warning boat owners to keep a safe distance from the whale. Lindsay Kerr, Police Scotland wildlife liaison officer, said: ""This is a fantastic opportunity for wildlife watchers and marine tourism but it is essential that the health and well-being of the animals is considered at all times. ""The Forth estuary is subject to large tidal changes and any disturbance to the visiting whale could cause significant risk of it becoming distressed and moving further into shallow water and then becoming stranded by a rapidly outgoing tide. ""Legislation is in place to protect these marine mammals. Please enjoy this wonderful occurrence but do show respect to the whales and be aware of the protection afforded to them. ""I recommend boat and vessel owners follow the Wildlife Safe (WiSe) scheme. In this particular case, commercial and recreational users should not make any attempts to approach or actively pursue the whale. ""The scheme, which is a UK standard for commercial marine wildlife watching, includes a code of conduct and sets out best practice for wildlife watching."" Endangered species such as dolphins, porpoises and whales are protected by wildlife legislation including the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Under the Act, it is an offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb them.",1,653
"Noah Zunde, who was 22 months old, succumbed to heatstroke after being left in the car for seven hours. His mother, Romy Zunde, had mistakenly believed she dropped Noah at childcare, the Coroners Court of Victoria heard. Ms Zunde was sleep-deprived, stressed and dealing with a change in routine before the tragedy, the court was told. Police did not lay charges. A coronial lawyer recommended that Ms Zunde should not be held criminally responsible. The inquest into the death in the Victorian town of Kyneton in 2015 is investigating ways to prevent similar incidents. A psychologist told the inquest he believed Ms Zunde suffered a memory lapse called ""forgotten baby syndrome."" ""If you are capable of forgetting to post a letter, you are capable of forgetting to take your baby out of the car,"" said Matthew Mundy, an associate professor at Monash University. ""Your memory is limited, it's limited in the number of things you can remember at any given time, and it's limited in the amount of time you can remember a thing for. ""Your brain at the neural level doesn't discriminate between [posting] a letter, a baby or remembering to pick up your mobile phone."" In his opinion the lapse could happen to anyone, he said. Noah is one of five children within 10 years who have died in Victoria after being left inside a vehicle. The court was told sensors installed in some cars in the United States alerted parents to the presence of children. Coroner Sara Hinchey will hand down her findings at a later date.",1,654

"They were able to hold a metal plate a few centimetres above the rabbit's chest and use it to regulate the animal's heartbeat. If such medical implants could be made to work in humans, it could lead to smaller devices that are safer to fit. The findings are published in the journal PNAS. The researchers from Stanford University hope their development could also eventually dispense with the bulky batteries and clumsy recharging systems that are currently a feature of such devices. The central discovery was a new type of wireless power transfer that could safely penetrate deep inside the body, using roughly the same power as a cell phone. ""We need to make these devices as small as possible to more easily implant them deep in the body,"" said co-author Dr Ada Poon, from Stanford's department of electrical engineering. There are broadly two categories of electromagnetic wave that have been considered until now: far-field and near-field. Far-field waves, like those broadcast from radio towers, can travel long distances, but either bounce off the body harmlessly, or are absorbed as heat. Near-field waves can be safely used, but they can only transfer power over short distances. The researchers were able to design a device that blends the safety of near-field waves with the reach of far-field waves. ""With this method, we can safely transmit power to tiny implants in organs like the heart or brain, well beyond the range of current near-field systems,"" said John Ho, a graduate student in Dr Poon's lab.",1,657
"Inspectors criticised teaching and leadership at the Phoenix Academy and Lakeside Academy following visits in February, rating both schools inadequate in all areas. Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement,"" while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate,"" while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive."" There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations,"" while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact."" A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were ""beginning to have a positive impact.""",1,658
"The prime minister stressed her belief he was committed to advancing the ""special relationship"" with the UK. But Mrs May told the Financial Times she expects ""very frank"" talks on areas where their opinions seem to differ such as the EU and Nato. The PM said she hoped for early progress on a US-UK trade agreement. Mrs May said she believed Mr Trump ""recognises the importance and significance of Nato,"" despite him being quoted earlier in the week as describing the military alliance as ""obsolete."" ""I'm also confident the USA will recognise the importance of the co-operation we have in Europe to ensure our collective defence and collective security,"" she told the FT. Mr Trump also said recently he did not really care if the EU separated. Mrs May, who this week outlined for the first time her plan for Brexit, said: ""The decision taken by the UK was not a decision about breaking up the EU. ""I want the EU to continue to be strong and I want to continue to have a close and strategic partnership with the EU. It is important for security issues. With the threats we face it's not the time for less co-operation."" Mr Trump was sworn-in as the 45th US president on Friday. In a statement issued after the inauguration, Mrs May said: ""From our conversations to date, I know we are both committed to advancing the special relationship between our two countries and working together for the prosperity and security of people on both sides of the Atlantic. ""I look forward to discussing these issues and more when we meet in Washington."" In her FT interview, Mrs May said she was ""confident we can look at areas even in advance of being able to sign a formal trade deal."" But despite Mr Trump's indication he backed a quick post-Brexit trade deal, there was a heavily protectionist tone in the inauguration speech. Some Labour MPs questioned how the prime minister's aim of a free trade deal with the US would be possible given the ""America first"" strategy outlined by Mr Trump. David Lammy tweeted: ""Every decision on trade will be made to benefit Americans. Hmm - looking forward to this trade deal, then."" Chris Bryant said: ""I'm not sure a UK trade deal with Trump will be very mutually beneficial."" However, speaking to the BBC in Myanmar, also known as Burma, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was every reason to ""be positive and optimistic"" about a trade deal. ""I think the new president has made it very clear that he wants to put Britain at the front of the line.... and obviously that's extremely exciting and important."" Earlier Mr Johnson offered his own ""warmest congratulations"" to Mr Trump. He said the UK would ""work hand in glove for the stability, the prosperity and the security of the world."" Meanwhile, Thousands of women are expected to join a march in London later as part of an international protest campaign on the first full day of Mr Trump's presidency. Mr Trump has appeared to make good on a pledge to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House's Oval Office. The sculpture of the World War Two prime minister's face is said to be a replica of one given to President Lyndon B Johnson in the 1960s and first appeared in the Oval Office during George W Bush's administration in 2001. It was replaced by a bust of civil rights champion Martin Luther King Jr during Barack Obama's presidency. The presence of the Churchill bust was noticed as Mr Trump signed his first orders as president. A report that the bust of Dr King no longer remained in the Oval Office was later found to be discredited.",1,659

"Media playback is not supported on this device The Premier League paid PS174m to agents, up from PS130m, with Manchester City being the biggest spenders (PS26.3m) ahead of Chelsea (PS25.1m) and Manchester United (PS19m). England's second tier, the Championship, spent PS42.4m on agents, an increase of 62. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record PS1.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43 increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent PS3,098,508, down from PS3,167,964, while League Two teams spent PS821,450, down from PS1,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' fees when the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from PS14.3m to PS13.8 for the 2016-17 period. Manchester City now top the Premier League list with PS26,3m, up from PS12.4m, followed by Chelsea, who have also more than doubled their spending on agents' fees, up from PS12m to PS25.1m. Manchester United (PS19m) and Arsenal (PS10.2m) complete the top five, while Tottenham's outlay has risen from PS6m to PS7.2m. Yet despite being considered part of the Premier League's'big six' clubs, Spurs trail behind West Ham (PS9.5m) and Bournemouth (PS7.4m) in agents' fees paid for 2016-17. Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for PS1m, why would there be another PS1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5, 10 or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy.",1,663
"""Fracking"" involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure. The joint report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering say the technique is safe if firms follow best practice and rules are enforced. Exploratory fracking is being mooted in at least seven sites around the UK. The report was commissioned by the government's chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, following the decision last year to halt the UK's most advanced project, in Lancashire, after fracking caused small earth tremors. ""Our main conclusions are that the environmental risks of hydraulic fracturing for shale can can be safely managed provided there is best practice observed and provided it's enforced through strong regulation,"" said the report's chair, Prof Robert Mair from Cambridge University. ""The UK regulatory system is up to the job for the present very small scale exploration activities, but there would need to be strengthening of the regulators if the government decides to proceed with more shale gas extraction, particularly at the production stage,"" he told BBC News. The report contains 10 top-line recommendations for strengthening regulations, including: Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves drilling down into shale formations and fracturing the rock using explosives or hydraulic pressure. Water is pumped in containing sand particles that prop open the cracks in the shale, allowing the gas out, and a tiny amount of chemicals. In the US, concerns have been raised that the gas or the chemicals can enter drinking water supplies. However, the report concludes that gas contamination should not be a problem - the risk is ""very low"" - provided that fracking takes place at a depth of many hundreds of metres, a long way below the level of aquifers, and that the wells are properly constructed. Each well is lined with layers of steel and cement; and if this stays intact, the scientists conclude, gas leakage should not be a problem. They also say that with good management of waste water, chemical contamination should be avoided; they criticise the US practice of leaving it in open ponds, which would not be permitted in the UK. The report says the risk that fracking will generate significant seismic events is also small. The actual explosions are far too small to be noticed at the surface, said Prof Zoe Shipton from the University of Strathclyde. ""If the fluid moves into existing faults in the rock that are close to slipping anyway, you'll bring that slippage forward in time,"" she said. ""But the Magnitude 2.3 event in Blackpool last year - that is like a lorry going past your house - in fact the British Geological Survey can't measure below Magnitude 2 in towns because of the traffic."" The European industry is in its infancy compared with the US, and governments' views on the technology are mixed. Fracking has been banned in France, but countries such as Poland are taking a strong interest. UK ministers see shale gas as a way of cheaply bridging the transition to a low-carbon fuel mix, despite calculations showing that widespread adoption without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology would mean future UK governments missing their legally-binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Prof Mair said climate impacts were outside his remit, but a detailed look at the issue should happen at some stage. ""The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed,"" he said. ""It's a very wide issue - energy policy, CO2 reduction, all of that needs to be looked at - and gas in general is part of that."" Follow Richard on Twitter",1,664
"The Lions, who won the semi-final first leg 3-1, looked to have put the tie to bed when Lee Gregory slotted home. But Jamie Proctor's strike just before half-time, after Jordan Archer blocked his first effort, gave City hope. Proctor then wasted a further chance moments later, and it proved costly as Millwall held on to set up a showdown with Barnsley on 29 May. Neil Harris' side were rarely troubled after Proctor twice turned down the opportunity to shoot when excellently placed - and, if anything, they looked the more likely to score again after the break. Centre-half Byron Webster came closest, sending a header narrowly wide of Ben Williams' post, as the second leg petered out in front of a raucous crowd at The Den. Millwall's success against Bradford means that, across this season's Football League play-offs, all five teams who won the first leg of their semi-final went on to reach Wembley. The majority of the damage was done even before half-time at Valley Parade, where goals from Gregory, Steve Morison and Joe Martin had put the Lions in full command against Bradford. The Bantams have twice previously come back from a first-leg deficit to progress to the final and win promotion, but Gregory's calm, side-footed finish ensured there would be no repeat in south-east London.

"The team-mates collided while racing for the lead on the last lap of the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday. Hamilton went on to win and now trails Rosberg, who was fourth, by 11 points. Triple world champion Hamilton said: ""I've been in that position before. It goes against all racing values."" The two drivers will resume their contest at this weekend's British Grand Prix, where a crowd of 140,000 is expected on race day at Silverstone. But Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has indicated he could impose restrictions to prevent them from racing freely, reducing the likelihood of another crash. ""I didn't come into this sport to be in that situation, so I will pray and hope that's not the case,"" said Hamilton, 31. ""Firstly for myself, because that would take the joy of racing out. Secondly for the fans, because that will rob them of what they pay so much money for. ""They save up all year to go to the British Grand Prix. Team orders are not something that should deprive them of their excitement. ""Even if it's the other way around and the guy's coming for me, that's racing.

Rosberg was held responsible for the incident by race stewards, who penalised him 10 seconds and added two penalty points on his licence. Wolff, who operates the team on the basis that the two drivers race freely but must not crash into each other, called the collision ""brainless"" and said he would consider ""all options"" to try to control the situation. Responding to Wolff's comments. Hamilton said: ""Emotions are running high but it might not have been the best thing to say. ""There's more than just me, Nico and Toto. There are 1,300 people on the team that are watching us. Even through this difficult time, it's important how we project that energy as leaders."" Wolff will discuss the situation with senior Mercedes management before deciding what policy to introduce. But Hamilton insisted: ""I feel like I have the right to say my opinion regardless of the boss. I don't feel anyone is above or below, regardless of how you live, wealth, religion, whatever it might be. ""You can talk to anyone on that level with respect so I would tell them I have an opinion that needs discussion. They hire me as a racing driver to race.

"It said just 8 of councils had built enough to replace half of their stock sold through the scheme, which allows council tenants to buy their homes. The charity said there was a danger of some areas having no affordable homes. The government said it was committed to building 275,000 affordable new homes over the course of this parliament. Right to Buy was first introduced in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government and was given a boost in 2012 when discounts for tenants were increased to PS75,000. In this year's Queen's speech the government announced the scheme was being extended to 1.3m housing association tenants in England. Shelter, which looked at provisional figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government, said just two of the 166 councils in England listed as selling properties through Right to Buy had succeeded in replacing more than 100 of the properties sold. Under existing policy, the government has promised that each home sold after 2012 would be replaced. The charity's chief executive Campbell Robb warned the problem of not enough council homes being replaced was only likely to get worse, leaving some areas with no affordable homes.

South Cambridgeshire 59 The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, said many council housing programmes were hampered by complex rules and restrictions on the use of receipts from sales of homes. LGA housing spokesman Peter Box said: ""It is imperative that councils are given the powers to replace housing sold through Right to Buy quickly and effectively as part of the Spending Review. ""Councils need to be able to retain 100 of receipts from sales while Right to Buy discounts should be set locally so they reflect the cost of houses in the area."" Mr Box said the LGA estimated this would allow councils to replace 50,000 homes sold over the lifetime of the next Parliament. The government said nearly 40,000 new homeowners had been created since it increased discounts for council tenants in 2012. A spokesman added: ""Councils are continuing to fulfil the requirement to deliver one for one replacements within three years, and over 3,000 replacement homes have already been delivered across England. ""We have been absolutely clear that if councils do not deliver one for one replacements for the additional homes sold under Right to Buy the government will.""",1,667

"They arrested 57 people in Barcelona, Valencia, San Sebastian and Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. Chinese nationals illegally living in Spain reportedly paid the ring EUR8,000 (8,960; PS6,820) each to obtain fake contracts as domestic workers. In return they were given residency permits to work in Barcelona. ""They would return to Barcelona once they obtained a residency permit to work in the textile sector, without ever carrying out the job they were hired for,"" a Spanish police statement said. The ringleaders, a Chinese couple, allegedly paid employers between EUR1,500 and EUR2,000 for the contracts. Most of the employers allegedly involved are linked to the hotel trade in Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands. Chinese immigrants are the fifth biggest foreign community in Spain with almost 170,000 people as of 2015, according to the National Statistics Institute.",1,670
"The pop star was given the night's top honour for her multi-million selling record 25, but told the audience, ""I can't possibly accept this award."" ""I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful, but Beyonce is the artist of my life."" The British singer then appeared to break the award in two accidentally and offer a piece to her fellow nominee. Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists. Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis. Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not ""seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."" Two years ago, West rushed onto the stage in protest when Beck's Morning Phase beat Beyonce's last LP in the best album race. However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1. It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened. The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too ""commercialised."" Main winners Whatever the outcome, Adele remains one of the night's biggest winners. She won five prizes in all, including three of the top four: Best album, song of the year and record of the year - the latter two both rewarding her 2015 comeback single, Hello. Chicago's Chance the Rapper also took three prizes, including best rap album for his self-released record Coloring Book. ""I know people think independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom,"" he said as he picked up best new act at the start of the ceremony. Rock icon David Bowie won in each of the five categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album, for Blackstar, and best rock performance, for the album's title track. And Beyonce wasn't left completely empty-handed: she took home best urban contemporary album and best music video, for the politically-charged Formation. The star, who is pregnant with twins, also gave an ambitious and logistically complex performance of the songs Love Drought and Sandcastles, themed around the ideas of rebirth, regeneration and healing. Dressed in flowing, golden Egyptian robes and an elaborate headdress, she dedicated the performance to motherhood, proudly displaying her baby bump as she sang. But while Beyonce's performance was flawless, others were marred by technical issues. Lady Gaga duetted with Metallica on the song Moth to the Flame, but singer James Hetfield was inaudible throughout the first verse. He later sang cheek-to-cheek with Gaga, sharing her microphone, but angrily threw his guitar to one of his roadies at the end of the performance. Adele also went off-key during a tribute to George Michael, and tearfully asked if the song could be started again. It was, and she received a standing ovation for her troubles. Respects were paid to Sir George Martin, Leonard Cohen and other musicians we lost in 2016, while Bruno Mars honoured Prince by playing the star's trademark cloud guitar in a pitch-perfect rendition of Let's Go Crazy.

"The images appeared to show the pair on foot during a safari in June at the Gir National Park in western Gujarat state. Officials at the park said they imposed a preliminary fine because ""the cricketer flouted the rules."" Visitors to the park are not allowed to leave their vehicles. Jadeja's photos were posted days after Gujarat forestry officials warned of the dangers involved in taking selfies with lions, following a number of attacks. Wildlife officers say they will submit a final inquiry report to their superiors soon. A.P Singh, chief forest conservator in Gujarat state, told AFP they ""had instituted a probe and called Jadeja for a statement.... but since he was not available, his father-in-law Hardevsinh Solanki gave a written statement on his behalf"" and paid the fine for him. Jadeja, 27, was part of India's team for the recent World T20 tournament.

"Just minutes after leaving harbour, the ferry capsized. 193 people were killed in the tragedy. Belfast man Bill McCrea was more than 1,500 miles away in Kent, when the ship began its final journey. A chaplain for the Sailors' Society, Bill was on duty at the Merchant Navy and National Sea Training College in Gravesend. Despite the distance, news of the tragedy travelled to the college fast. ""Our centre had younger trainee sailors coming through, and also older seafarers who were there to update their training. ""We had three men from the Herald at the centre that night who we had to try and comfort."" When Bill speaks, it's with a soft, instantly recognisable Belfast accent - a voice apparently unchanged by decades spent posted across the globe. He grew up on the Donegall Road in the city and before entering the ministry, discovered an early love for the sea. ""I used to go down to the Belfast docks with my brothers and sisters to see the ships,"" he said. ""I would say to them,'look, see that ship? Someday I'll be a captain too'."" In the end, he took to the sea as a chaplain when he accepted the role with the Sailors' Society in 1969, a position he held until retirement in 2006. In that 37-year period, the Zeebrugge disaster would become ""the most traumatising tragedy that ever happened in my life."" The disaster marked the beginning of months of shared grief and years of recovery, as signified by the annual remembrance service that continues with this week's 30th anniversary memorial. After the incident, Bill travelled to Dover where he spent two weeks in the Sailors' Society's Seafarers' Centre, providing support to sailors and families alike. Bill often travelled to visit those grief stricken by what happened, and also conducted the funerals of four victims. ""The disaster and the subsequent weeks was a shock to my system. I have dealt with loss of life with seafarers' families over the years, but it was the enormity of this situation - so many people lost their lives that night."" One funeral the chaplain presided over was for a young man who he knew from the training centre - the Herald of Free Enterprise was his first posting as a sailor. ""It was his first assignment and he didn't come back. I visited his family and they were devastated. ""He had just finished his college course two weeks before. I knew him well."" He continued: ""The first month or so (after the disaster) was hard going. In their way, actually, the families were a big support to me. ""It can be difficult because families always react differently to your presence. Some are happy to have you, some will swear, some will be annoyed, some will be anti-God. ""In my case, most families needed help - not so much talking, just being there. ""The tragedy left people on their knees. The area of Dover was devastated, but the community came together in huge support. ""I think that's what helped my visits. I was able to pray with the families, and not one refused a prayer."" Among the sadness and grief, there were unlikely tales of heroism too. ""I visited the wife of a man who died, she felt very guilty on top of everything else. ""She had talked her husband into the trip. When the boat capsized, they were trapped. It was actually incredibly hard to escape, particularly with a lifejacket, because you were trapped at the bottom of a boat that was on its side. ""She was trapped there and hypothermia set in, but there was a lorry driver beside her. He kept her alive by slapping her face and nipping her, to make sure she didn't fall asleep. ""It was a nightmare situation on board."" He said that surviving crew members attended funerals as part of their ""shared grief."" A year on from the disaster, Bill led a memorial service at the request of the victims' families. This began an annual service that the Sailors' Society has continued every year since. ""Each year we've held the service and families have come. About 10 years ago, the question was asked if the service should end but the families wanted it to continue. ""They've never really got over it completely. ""I've never really got over it myself.""",1,674
"Beauly will be the only representatives of the lower leagues in the semi-final draw at BBC Scotland's Pacific Quay on Monday 11 July. This follows a heroic 1-1 draw away to in-form Kinlochshiel in which Beauly held a lead for more than half the game. Lochaber also came close to creating an upset when they forced Kyles to come from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw at Tighnabruich. Camanachd Cup rules require drawn games to be replayed. Meanwhile, at The Eilan, Newtonmore cruised to a 4-0 lead over Skye who then struck back with two late goals. Kilmallie showed little regard for Oban Camanachd's Premiership status and went ahead three times in the first half through Liam MacDonald, Brian MacKay and Duncan Rodger only to be pulled back on each occasion by MacCuish. Connor Howe then got Camanachd's winner just after the hour. Marc MacLachlan opened for Beauly after just three minutes and it was 11 minutes into the second half before John MacRae struck for Shiel to take the tie to a replay at Braeview. Ben Delaney got Lochaber's opener and Dunky Kerr Kyles' first equaliser just before half time. Neil MacDonald shot Lochaber ahead again and Grant Irvine secured Kyles' second bite at the cherry at Spean Bridge. An Evan Menzies double in the first half and one each from Norman Campbell and Iain Robinson in the second had Newtonmore on easy street. Jordan Murchison struck back with two in the last six minutes but by then it was too late for Skye. In the Marine Harvest National Division a goal in each half from Alan MacDonald helped Inveraray to a 4-1 victory on Bute which extended their lead to four points. The new second-placers in the five horse race for this title are Glasgow Mid Argyll who have three games in hand.

"Russia's plan for ""de-escalation"" zones was backed by Iran at talks in Kazakhstan. Both countries support Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor. But some delegates from the rebel forces angrily rejected the plan. As the three countries were invited to sign the document on Thursday in the Kazakh capital, Astana, rebel delegates angrily shouted that they did not accept it and walked out. Reporters at the talks said the rebels were unhappy about Iran's involvement in the deal as a guarantor. The US also expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had ""only contributed to the violence, not stopped it."" The Syrian government is not a signatory, but its state news agency said it supported the plan. The talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Under the Russian plan, safe zones would be established in rebel-held territory in the north-western province of Idlib, in parts of Homs province in the centre, in the south, and in the opposition enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, the AFP news agency reported. Syrian and Russian warplanes would stop bombing rebel positions while opposition groups would halt attacks inside the ""de-escalation zones."" The objective is to ""put an immediate end to the violence"" and ""provide the conditions for the safe, voluntary return of refugees"" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The safe zones would remain in place for six months, the Kremlin has said. They would be surrounded by checkpoints manned by rebels and government troops, and foreign troops could also be deployed in observer roles, according to AFP. The UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the agreement a step in the right direction. Syria's envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari said he hoped Russia and Iran would discuss the plan's details with the Syrian government as soon as possible. Syria's war has claimed more than 300,000 lives since it erupted in 2011.",1,678
"The birds, which are native to southern Europe, set up nests by burrowing tunnels in the banks of Low Gelt Quarry, near Brampton. An RSPB viewpoint on the perimeter of the quarry has attracted more than 1,000 people in two weeks. The RSPB said all chicks had hatched and would fledge in the next few weeks. The pairs were discovered by a foreman, who noticed the colourful birds flying among the site's colony of nesting sand martins. They are expected to leave the nest in about four weeks. Two pairs successfully raised chicks on the Isle of Wight last year and previously in County Durham in 2002. An RSPB spokesman said they were ""delighted"" the birds had bred in the UK for a second consecutive summer. Bee-eaters can burrow up to 10ft (3m) and usually lay clutches of four to nine eggs.",1,679
"Entertainers Starkidz were ""cornered"" by the gang after a Christmas lights switch-on in Formby, Merseyside. The performers, including one as young as 13, were abused, with one punched and another threatened with an airgun, said the troupe's manager Jan Hayes. ""We may not return to Formby next year,"" she said. ""We've been going for five years and we have never had any trouble like this. ""It started off with these teenagers trying take their hats or telling the children they are not real elves. ""Later on, a gang of about 20 cornered our group and one member was punched in the stomach as they were abused."" Ms Hayes said the one of the performers had an airgun held to his head. ""It was a very traumatic experience,"" she added. ""The group member is extremely upset by this."" The elves have received dozens of messages of support via social media from parents. One local mother, Nicola Cowie, said: ""Starkidz bring so much to our community, they bring magic to life. ""Her Elves give it their all, they live and breath as elves while they're dressed in those costumes. I'd be so disgusted if my child acted they way those youths did.""

"Police forces tasked with implementing strict state interpretations of Islamic morality exist in several other states, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Malaysia. Many - especially those with an affinity with Western lifestyles - chafe against such restrictions on daily life, but others support the idea, and growing religious conservatism has led to pressure for similar forces to be created in countries that do not have them. Here are some places where ""morality police"" forces patrol: Name: Gasht-e Ershad (Persian for Guidance Patrols), supported by Basij militia Who they are: Iran has had various forms of ""morality police"" since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but the Gasht-e Ershad are currently the main agency tasked enforcing Iran's Islamic code of conduct in public. Their focus is on ensuring observance of hijab - mandatory rules requiring women to cover their hair and bodies and discouraging cosmetics. They are empowered to admonish suspects, impose fines or arrest members of the public, but under reforms that come into force this year, will soon no longer be able to do any of these things. Instead, 7,000 undercover Gasht-e Ershad agents will be deployed to report suspected transgressions to the police, who will decide whether to take action. The Gasht-e Ershad is thought to draw a lot of its personnel from the Basij, a hard-line paramilitary unit; it also includes many women. What people think: They are mainly seen as a scourge for urban women - usually from wealthier social groups - who try to push the boundaries of the dress code. This includes wearing the headscarf as far back on the head as possible, or by wearing looser clothing, especially in the heat of summer, although men sporting ""Western"" hairstyles are also at risk. Fear of encountering them has even prompted the creation of Android app that helps people avoid Gasht-e Ershad mobile checkpoints. President Hassan Rouhani has expressed opposition to the Gasht-e Ershad, but Iran's constitution gives him little sway over the security forces. Name: Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, or Mutawa (Arabic for Particularly obedient to God) Who they are: Formed in 1940, the Mutawa is tasked with enforcing Islamic religious law - Sharia - in public places. This includes rules forbidding unrelated males and females to socialise in public, as well as a dress code that encourages women to wear a veil covering all but their eyes. Instead of a police-style uniform, they wear a traditional Saudi robe and keffiyeh. What people think: Although the Mutawa is widely disliked among liberals and the youth, general opinion in the conservative Sunni-majority kingdom supports it. But even conservatives have been irritated by recent high-profile cases deemed excessive or internationally embarrassing, such as an actor being charged for letting fans take selfies with him, or a female mannequin being seized because of its clothing. Perhaps in response to this criticism, the authorities have curbed the force's powers, as a result of which it can no longer arrest or pursue people but can only report them to the regular police. Name: Public Order Police Who they are: The Public Order Police was set up in 1993 to enforce Sharia enshrined in law for Muslims in the then-northern Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir. They have the power to arrest, and suspects are tried - often at speed - in special Public Order Courts; punishments can include flogging or prison. What people think: Many Sudanese resent their activity as an oppressive and often arbitrary interference in private lives, although some - mostly Salafists and other religious conservatives - support their activities. The force is known for shutting down private mixed-sex events, upbraiding women for immodest dress and raiding businesses seen as being in breach of Sharia. It drew international condemnation when female journalist Lubna al-Hussein was arrested and jailed after being caught wearing loose-fitting slacks in public in 2008. Name: Various, usually collectively known as ""religious officers"" Who they are: These are bodies run by Malaysia's federal states - or the federal government for federal territories - to enforce Sharia, which applies to the two thirds of the population who are Muslim. They have the power of arrest, and possible offences range from day-time eating during Ramadan to women and men being ""in close proximity."" Cases are tried by Sharia courts separate from the ordinary court system. What people think: Religious officers have often been accused of overstepping their remit - a situation often muddied by ambiguity about which takes precedence in certain cases - normal legislation or Sharia. In April, religious officers arrested several people during a raid on a transgender group's fundraising event, accusing participants of hosting a beauty pageant, which Muslims were banned from attending by a 1996 fatwa, or Islamic religious decree. The group denies the accusation. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.",1,683
"According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote. Erin Fyfe McWilliam, 16 said: ""I'm glad the government thought we were able to make decisions for our country."" She thinks it's put young people in the spotlight: ""Usually the older generation see us as being the'tallywags' who don't care about politics at all. ""But I do think this referendum has taught the younger generation a lot about politics."" A survey, commissioned by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, said 71 of 16 to 17-year-olds voted for Scotland to be independent and 29 voted against. So even if the age-group contributed their political views, it didn't appear to influence the outcome. Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom after the ""No"" campaign won. The Scottish referendum was a one-off for 16 and 17-year-olds, after the Scottish Parliament passed legislation allowing it to happen. But for years youth campaign groups have been trying to get the UK voting age lowered, arguing you can get married at 16 and pay your taxes, so why not vote? Gaelan Miller 17, who voted in the referendum, agreed that he didn't have that much life experience but said that shouldn't matter. ""Sometimes I think young folk like me can be influenced by your parents and we don't have mortgages,"" he said. ""But that's not to say we can't look at statistics at what's happened before with mortgages and ask your parents questions."" The Lib Dems are all for 16 and 17-year-olds voting and promised it in their 2010 manifesto. Labour leader, Ed Miliband, also backs lowering the age. UKIP are against it, the Green Party is for and the Scottish National Party (SNP) is in favour as well. David Cameron and the Tories oppose it, so until all the parties agree to debate the issue it's unlikely to happen. Senior Lib Dem minister and Scottish MP, Danny Alexander, told Newsbeat he believes young people ""bring a freshness to the debate and ask important questions."" He said: ""I've always believed that 16 to 17-year-olds should have the vote. ""Some of the best debates and discussion I have had about the Scottish referendum have been with young people in schools and Newsbeat's Big Debate."" But when asked about lowering the voting age before the next General election in May 2015, he was less optimistic. ""Not every party wants that so that we will have to look at that. We need to build a consensus across all parties for that happen. So we could have debate the constitutional changes in the UK,"" the chief of the Treasury said. ""All parties have to agree to do that. But I think the time has come for reform."" 17-year-old Erin added: ""It's a bit disappointing being given this opportunity, then being told a few months down the line you have to wait a few years. I think it should be changed so that 16 and 17 year olds can vote."" In the last general election in 2010, fewer than half of all 18 to 24-year-olds voted, which was much lower than the national average.

"Inspired by the lily pond in Monet's garden at Giverny in France, the painting was the top lot at Sotheby's sale of modern and impressionist works. It totalled just under PS122m, including PS15.2m for Piet Mondrian's 1927 Composition with Red, Blue and Grey. Sotheby's said it proved collectors are still keen to acquire ""trophy art."" Paintings by Sisley, Picasso, Manet and Kandinsky were also among the 46 works, with only four pieces failing to find buyers as many sold close to the top end of the pre-auction estimates and sometimes above. ""The Nympheas selling for such a huge sum is again a reflection that this is still a market that is driven by trophies, that the great works by the major masters are still really sought after,"" said Philip Hook from Sotheby's. The auction house said the bidding for the Monet work attracted buyers from Asia and all over the world and went on for 10 minutes, going up in PS250,000 increments in its final stages. It said the painting, from the ""most iconic and celebrated of Monet's painting series, can be counted among the artist's greatest achievements."" It once belonged to Paul Durand-Ruel, the legendary art dealer who championed the Impressionists and represented Monet. The same work had been offered for auction in 2010 but failed to reach its reserve price. Sotheby's said this time it had carried a more ""realistic"" estimate of PS20m to PS30m. The sale price of PS31.7m included a buyer's premium. Two other Monet paintings were also offered in the sale, La Seine a Argenteuil which sold for PS8.5m and Antibes, vue du plateau Notre-Dame, which sold for PS7.9m.",1,685
"The Scot dug deep to claim a 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-4) victory in a match that lasted two hours 59 minutes. He recovered from two breaks of serve in the third set, his opponent serving for the match at one point. Murray now faces Austria's Dominic Thiem in the last four. Ramos-Vinolas, who is at a career-high world ranking of 19, capitalised on a string of unforced Murray errors to take the first set but was pinned back in the second as the Scot battled back to level. In Monte Carlo, Murray had led 4-0 in the final set before capitulating to a defeat to Ramos-Vinolas. In Barcelona, it was the Spaniard who held a final set lead, winning the first two games before injuring his foot attempting to receive a volleyed return, which led to a lengthy period of treatment. The incident initially benefited Murray, who won the next three games, but Ramos-Vinolas steadied the ship and looked set for victory after breaking in the ninth game. However, Murray dug deep and immediately broke back before taking the match to a tie-break that he largely dominated and clinched on his second match point. ""It was obviously a very tough match,"" said Murray. ""It was kind of the opposite of the match we had last week where probably today he deserved to win. He created a lot more chances, he served for the match and couldn't quite get it. ""Last week I had 4-0 [in the third set], I felt like I had all of the chances. Sometimes on clay matches happen this way, so very happy to get through."" Rafael Nadal, a 10-time winner in Barcelona, joined Murray in the last four courtesy of a 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 win over Korean qualifier Hyeon Chung.

Bedene came through qualifying in Budapest to reach his first ATP Tour semi-final since January 2016. He also won back-to-back titles on the second-tier ATP Challenger Tour earlier this month.

"Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. ""Think of your car in the 1970s,"" David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. ""The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. ""We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology."" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. ""It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds,"" David says. Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying. In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu. The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire. Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out. Next time you fly, look at the floor. You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit. That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke. ""Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines,"" says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace. ""This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too."" Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, ""which means they are fail-safe."" ""It's a chemical process so they don't need power - sever it and it still works,"" he says. For the most part, computers fly modern airliners. And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear. Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop. Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane. So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator. The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place. Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots. Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky. Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots. ""A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge,"" David Learmount tells me. ""Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training."" Having said all of that, just bear in mind: Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft ""accident"" are lower than ever.",1,687
"The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77. The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick,"" the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor."" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. ""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. ""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. ""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something."" Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock."" ""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that."" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age."" ""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said. ""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. ""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them."" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being."" ""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family."" Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer,"" a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. ""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family."" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick,"" and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back."" The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. ""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. ""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals."" Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family. For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family."" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard."" Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius,"" saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone."" Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man. ""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter."" Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. ""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it."" Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. ""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine."" Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.",1,688
"The hosts had Josh Passley dismissed for bringing down Garry Thompson before Wycombe went ahead when Paul Hayes fired home Paris Cowan-Hall's ball.

"The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed its investigation after it found no evidence of a defect in the vehicle. Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with a lorry while operating in Autopilot mode. Tesla has stated Autopilot is only designed to assist drivers, who must keep their hands on the wheel. The feature is intended to be used on the motorway, where it lets cars automatically change lanes and react to traffic. The NHTSA report said data from the car showed that ""the driver took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision."" Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said the driver should have been able to see the lorry for seven seconds, which ""should have been enough time to take some action."" The investigation did not find any evidence that the car's systems ""did not perform as designed."" However, Mr Thomas said there was ""industry-wide"" concern about the way driver-assistance features were explained and advertised to customers. ""These systems require continual and full attention of the driver,"" he said. ""It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. ""Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual."" He said systems should be designed with the ""inattentive driver"" in mind. The NHTSA said it would continue to monitor the safety of Autopilot and would take further action if necessary. Mr Thomas warned manufacturers that if safety defects were found in semi-autonomous cars, they would have to be recalled, even if the vehicles were capable of receiving over-the-air software updates. Following the closure of the investigation, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the report was ""very positive.""",1,690
"Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC ""Syria is doing its best"" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile. Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia. ""We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast,"" he said. ""The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups."" He added: ""This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration."" He described as ""absolutely unacceptable"" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. ""We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,"" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of ""still supporting terrorist elements"" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had ""thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups."" The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison. It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons. The US said last week that so far only about 4 of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was ""concerned"" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus ""had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment."" Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns. Mr Mekdad stressed: ""Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council. We shall implement on time all our obligations.""",1,691
"PC Gareth Browning, 33, was on foot in Whitley, Reading on 30 November when he was hit by a black Mazda Aerosport driven by Luke Haywood, 28. Haywood admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving at Reading Crown Court. PC Browning was critically injured and remains in hospital in a serious condition. Haywood, of no fixed address, had previously admitted aggravated vehicle taking and one count of going equipped to burgle. He is currently serving a prison sentence for separate burglary offences. PC Browning was attempting to stop the stolen vehicle, driven by Haywood in Shinfield Road, when he was injured. Det Supt Chris Ward said: ""No sentence can ever reflect the injuries that PC Browning received as a result of Haywood's reckless actions.

"But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1 increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3 a year on average. What is more, the offer is ""non-consolidated,"" which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1 increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1 pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1 next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1 pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4 and 5 a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on ""quick fixes"" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10 during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40 of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid. Like all pay disputes, it promises to be a game of brinkmanship. But one in which the stakes could not be higher.",1,693
"Tour de France winner Wiggins became the most decorated Olympian in British history, with a total of seven medals. He won the cycling time trial after Glover and Stanning rowed to victory in the women's pairs; all three were hailed by PM David Cameron. GB's Michael Jamieson later took the silver in the men's 200m breaststroke. Team GB kept the nation waiting until day five of the Games for the first home gold medals; however, there are high hopes for further podium finishes in Thursday's cycling. After his victory, Wiggins, 32, cycled through cheering crowds gathered at Hampton Court, where he hugged his wife Catherine and his children Ben and Isabella. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday evening, Wiggins said that despite his success, he did not consider himself to be Britain's greatest ever Olympian. He also said that, fresh from his victory in the Tour de France, he had been ""greedy"" and also intended to win Olympic gold. ""I felt I could do both,"" he said, adding that the crowd support on his Olympic time trial ride was ""incredible."" David Cameron described the successes in rowing and cycling as a ""golden moment for Britain."" Mr Cameron said: ""I think it's already a great Olympics, already a great start but this is really going to put rocket boosters on it for the whole country. I'm very, very excited."" Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found illegal websites still offering tickets - which they have no right to sell - and which buyers may never receive. Police have warned that such sites do not have access to tickets. Det Supt Nick Downing, the head of the Olympic crime squad, said: ""If they're an authorised site selling tickets, you've got to ask the question - where did they get their tickets from? How can they guarantee a supply? They can't."" In other developments: Briton Chris Froome took the bronze medal in the time trial, which was watched along the route by an estimated 300,000 people. Wiggins's grandmother Maureen Cousins was also at the side of the road as he crossed the finish line. ""I screamed when he won. It is a combination of delight and relief.... We all think he is the greatest,"" she said. Earlier, Glover and Stanning made history by becoming the first British women to win an Olympic gold medal for rowing. Mr Johnson said an ""historic triumph will be celebrated throughout the country today."" ""It's an outstanding achievement and I'm sure it will spur on all our athletes in the medal stakes. It's fantastic - Go Team GB,"" he added. Glover, 26, a former PE teacher from Penzance, Cornwall, had been rowing for only four years before securing gold with Stanning, 27, a Royal Artillery captain, from Lossiemouth, Moray. They stormed home in front of cheering crowds at Eton Dorney after leading from the start of the women's pair race. After crossing the line they hugged each other and saluted the crowd, which included Princes William and Harry and the Princess Royal. Speaking at the finish line, Glover's mother Rachel said her family was ""absolutely delighted."" Stanning is likely to be deployed to Afghanistan next year. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, said: ""Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK. ""I am sure that they have been inspired by her performance and we look forward to welcoming her back to the regiment later this year."" Lt Col Palmer spoke to Stanning on the BBC News Channel, telling her she had ""done a very special thing."" ""We're looking forward to a very big party when you do come back to the regiment,"" he told Stanning. Labour leader Ed Miliband praised the athletes as ""fantastic"" and said the games were going ""beyond"" expectations.",1,694
"However, the resolution is non-binding, with Nigeria and Senegal opposing a withdrawal. South Africa and Burundi have already decided to withdraw, accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty and unfairly targeting Africans. The ICC denies the allegation, insisting it is pursuing justice for victims of war crimes in Africa. The AU took the decision on Tuesday following a divisive debate at its annual heads of state of summit in Addis Ababa. Part of the resolution also said the AU would hold talks with the UN Security Council to push for the ICC to be reformed. After being discussed in several previous summits, this was a huge announcement showing how frustrated the AU was with the international court. But the debate itself showed how divisive the whole issue is. The resolution isn't as strong as many who are opposed to the court would have liked. It only calls on countries to consider how to implement the decision but does not bind them to it. It's a victory for human rights activists who insist the court still has a very important role to play in the continent where many countries have weak judicial systems. The resolution also calls for African countries to continue pushing for reforms of the court - another clear indication that ditching the court en masse isn't such a popular decision. The likes of South Africa and Kenya, which have pushed for withdrawing, will be disappointed that the discussions about completely severing ties with the ICC will have to wait another six months for the next summit. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the court on charges of genocide in Darfur, was at the summit. In 2015, a South African court criticised President Jacob Zuma's government for failing to arrest Mr Bashir when he attended an AU meeting in the main city, Johannesburg. The government later announced that it was withdrawing from the ICC because it did not want to execute arrest warrants which would lead to ""regime change.""

"Media playback is not supported on this device Kyrgios, 21, lost 7-5 6-1 6-4 to British number one Andy Murray in Monday's much-anticipated last-16 tie. ""I hope he sees the writing on the wall before this gets chronic and irreparable,"" the American seven-time Grand Slam champion told BBC Sport. ""It's not just the mental side, he needs to work harder at his game."" Kyrgios is the youngest player in the world top 20, but his success has been marred by questions about his attitude. He rose to fame by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon but has been involved in a number of controversies, such as making remarks about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match last year, resulting in a suspended 28-day ban from the Association of Tour Professionals. ""He doesn't understand what it takes to be someone who wins Grand Slams at this level and that is unfortunate,"" McEnroe added. Kyrgios did not react to McEnroe's criticism, but asked if he felt he was applying himself the best he could, he replied: ""No."" He added: ""When things get tough, I'm just a little bit soft. ""I've got experience, but it ultimately comes down to just laying it all out there and competing for a long time. I didn't do that today at all. ""At times, like I've previously said, I don't love the sport. But I don't really know what else to do without it. I know that I have the talent to do good things. ""I woke up this morning and played computer games. Is that the greatest preparation? I don't know, but it was fun. ""Every time I come here, I lose to good players. But it's just disappointing. I don't know. I just want to do better."" Kyrgios made 19 unforced errors in the fourth-round match against Murray - three times more than the Scot - and did not earn a break point. The second set lasted just 26 minutes after a tight first set, which Murray claimed by breaking Kyrgios in the 12th game. ""Kyrgios has to look in the mirror if he wants to become a top player and win Slams,"" said McEnroe, who was involved in a number of heated exchanges with umpires during his career. ""I still think he will win Slams but not how he did it there. You can't give away points and games against someone as good and focused as Murray. Inexplicable. He's got to ask himself how badly he wants to become the best player in the world."" Shortly before the match, Kyrgios was pictured courtside as fellow Australian Lleyton Hewitt competed in the doubles competition. McEnroe said: ""What kind of preparation is that? Two hours before you're out on Centre Court you're watching a doubles match! I know you need to keep nerves down, but come on."" Kyrgios denied that watching compatriot Hewitt's match before taking on Murray had hindered his performance. ""Whether I was in the locker room sitting down or sitting down next to the court, I don't think really made a difference,"" he said. Compatriot Pat Cash described Kyrgios as a ""different sort of kid"" but also said he is ""definitely talented."" Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, added: ""I think that is what frustrates a lot of Australians. To see that much talent, you want it to be utilised better. ""I just don't think he is that type of kid. He is getting better. He is doing his best to not get in as much trouble this year, though he still has a few fines.

In a statement, Women's Premiership chair Mark Francis said ""the competition will be weakened"" by Lichfield's absence and also ""welcome the RFU to reconsider the decision."" The RFU have said they are willing to work closely with the club and help ""support future ambitions to compete in the new competition."" Applications for a spot in Super Rugby were based around coaching and training, sports science and medical support, training and playing environment, player pools, and financial streams. There will be no promotion or relegation from the competition for the first two seasons, which starts in September. While Lichfield boss Williams is disappointed the club has been overlooked, she does stress the RFU's efforts to establish a better funded and resourced top-flight competition is ""absolutely fantastic."" England and Lichfield prop Justine Lucas echoed the sentiment, adding: ""For the bigger picture, the RFU investing so much money into women's rugby is absolutely fantastic. ""But it is a real blow for Lichfield. We have all worked so hard this year and put so much into our club rugby, Lichfield means a lot to everyone involved.""",1,699
"They started arriving at Poldhu Cove on the Lizard on Sunday, and National Trust volunteers have been clearing them away as they are said to pose a risk to wildlife. The bottles are sealed, but witnesses say some have leaked. The National Trust said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: ""While it is fact that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container containing bottles of'Vanish', there is no currently available evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from this container; all evidence is currently circumstantial."" It is thought the vessel lost the container near Land's End in May. The BBC has contacted Vanish, but the company is yet to comment. Other nearby coves including Gunwalloe, Polurrian, Church Cove and Marazion have also been affected, conservationists said. Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was ""highly concerned"" about the impact on ""sensitive marine life."" Justin Whitehouse, from the National Trust, said: ""The main worry is all that detergent going into our beautiful marine environment, but thankfully most are full. ""We think it's a container that has gone overboard from a container ship, during stormy seas."" Cornwall Council said the authority and partners, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Natural England, would be monitoring beaches in the area. It said: ""The National Trust who own the beach at Poldhu have arranged for the bottles to be cleared away. ""In the meantime the public are advised to keep children and dogs at a safe distance from the bottles should any more be washed up. ""No attempt should be made to recover the bottles.""",1,700

"The Hydrus Group, an oil and gas service company, has started work on a specialist manufacturing base at the Brechin Business Park. It is forecast the new development will bring tens of millions of pounds into the local economy. The new facility should be complete by spring 2015 and bosses say it will create 100 jobs over five years. Hydrus presently employs 50 people in Brechin at a site on Eastmill Road, which will trade in tandem with the new premises. The facility will include capacity for specialist engineering structures to be built on site, ready for export.

"David Cameron said a stadium would ""inspire young people, brings jobs and wealth"" to the county. Labour said it was a ""cynical"" attempt to distract voters, the Liberal Democrats questioned where the funds would come from, and Mebyon Kernow said it did not believe the Tory's promise. Recent planning rows have left the future of the stadium in question. In March, Cornwall councillors deferred a decision to grant permission to build a supermarket that would have paid for the facility, which supporters claimed had put the plans in jeopardy. Revised proposals for the stadium at West Langarth are expected to be submitted to the council in May. Mr Cameron said he planned to get the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to work with Sport England, Cornwall Council and local sports teams to find a way to get it built. ""The stadium proposal is an exciting one. If it takes some extra money I'd make that money available,"" he added.

Choudry, 23, from Maidenhead, and Rahman, 39, of Luton, were found guilty at the Old Bailey after a retrial. They will be sentenced at a later date. The pair were among a group of five covertly recorded when an undercover officer infiltrated their Luton-based group over a 20-month period before police arrested them. More news from Bedfordshire Bedfordshire Police said the five men attended meetings at a church in Luton and a marquee in Rahman's back garden, during which members praised IS and urged others to support the terror group and travel to Syria to fight. The meetings were attended by up to 80 people including young children. The Old Bailey heard that, during a July 2015 gathering, Choudry spoke of ""40 trucks driving down Oxford Street full of explosives."" He also said: ""A wave is coming. Either be a part of it or you drown.."" The five men were arrested by officers from Bedfordshire Police and the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command in December 2015.

"Jolie, whose directorial debut is set in Bosnia's 1992 to 1995 war, received a standing ovation as she picked up the honorary Heart of Sarajevo award. ""I told Brad in the car I was afraid I was going to cry,"" she said. She presented the festival's best actor award to Thomas Schubert who starred in Atman, also named best film. Romanian leading lady Ada Condeescu won best actress for her role in Loverboy. Jolie, 36, who was at the 17th Sarajevo Film Festival with boyfriend Brad Pitt, visited Bosnia several times last year as a goodwill ambassador for the UN's refugee agency. She said she was ""so honoured to be here."" ""There is no greater example of the strengths of the artists and the festival that began during the war and grew stronger every year,"" she added. The festival began as an act of resistance in 1995 with residents braving mortar shells to gather in a basement to watch Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Some scenes from Jolie's film In the Land of Blood and Honey - due for release in December - were shot in Bosnia while others were shot in Hungary. The film, which stars Zana Marjanovic and Rade Serbedzija, tells the story of a love affair between a Bosnian Muslim woman and a Serb, on opposite sides of the conflict. The licence to film in Sarajevo was at one point revoked following local rumours that the film featured a rape victim who falls in love with her assailant. The licence was given back when producers proved the rumour was not true. At the time, Jolie asked people to ""hold judgement until they have seen the film."" ""There are many twists in the plot that address the sensitive nature of the relationship between the main characters and that will be revealed once the film is released,"" she said. On her visits to Bosnia for the UN last year, Jolie drew attention to the thousands of people who have been unable to return to their homes despite the war ending 16 years ago.",1,709
"Many of the dead were young boys who were in a trophy ceremony hit by the bomber, himself said to be a teenager. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it carried out the attack. IS is a mainly Sunni group which controls large swathes of northern and western Iraq, and has attacked numerous Shia targets in the country. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in Iraq for talks with the government, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. ""I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest condolences to the people and government of Iraq, and particularly those members of the families affected by terrorist attacks yesterday,"" he told reporters in Baghdad. Mr Ban urged Iraqi leaders to step up reconciliation efforts between Shias and Sunnis in order to defeat IS. Friday's attack happened in Iskandariya, a mainly Shia town 40km (25 miles) south of the capital, Baghdad. Video posted on social media showed the moment of the blast, as an official was speaking in front of a crowd of dozens of people, including the young players. The footage cuts off with a big flash of yellow light. It then shows the chaos and screaming of people fleeing the area. A medical official said 17 of the dead were boys aged between 10 and 16, AFP news agency reported. Islamic State group: The full story Crisis in seven charts Mayor Ahmed Shaker was also killed, as was one of his bodyguards and at least five members of the security forces, it said. Some 84 others were wounded, and 12 of them were said to be in critical condition. Iskandariya is in a region that was once called ""the triangle of death"" and was badly affected by sectarian violence that followed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. In a statement, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said he was ""shocked"" by what he described as a ""tragedy."" The UN chief also urged politicians to foster reconciliation with the minority Sunni, who say they were marginalised under the Shia-led government. Some discontented Sunnis have joined IS and other extremist groups. ""National reconciliation is an important part of the strategy to defeat Daesh, who have ruthlessly exploited divisions and targeted the marginalized and disenfranchised,"" he said, using another name for IS. IS has been losing some territory of its self-declared caliphate that includes parts of neighbouring Syria, and Iraqi forces have started an operation to retake Mosul, the largest city under the group's control. Meanwhile, thousands of supporters of the powerful Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr continued their sit-in outside the gates of the heavily fortified Green Zone, an area of government offices and embassies in Baghdad.

"Austin Haughwout claims he was kicked out of Central Connecticut state university over the footage. The institution says he was expelled over threats to shoot people there. Mr Haughwout argued he was only joking. Last month, Mr Haughwout and his father were ordered to give information about the drones videos to the authorities. Two separate videos showed drones rigged up to carry to the weapons hovering low in woodland in Connecticut, in the north-east United States. The first, posted in July 2015, showed a handgun firing rounds of ammunition. The second, which appeared in December that year, featured a flamethrower attached to a drone burning a turkey on a spit. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) opened an investigation into whether or not Mr Haughwout had broken any laws, though local police said they did not believe he had. Ruling last month, a judge said that he and his father, Bret, must hand documents over to the FAA, relating to the purchase of the gun, the drone and any money made from having posted the videos on YouTube, among other information. Mr Haughwout, 19, blamed his expulsion on the notoriety that followed the posting of the drone videos and is taking legal action in the New Britain superior court in a bid to be allowed to return, AP reports. It says Central Connecticut state officials denied that claim and instead pointed to the alleged threats. But a lawyer for Mr Haughwout said that what some may have interpreted as threats, were actually jokes, which are protected by the right to free speech. Mr Haughwout has also been in the news over two other incidents. In June this year, local police said they had charged him with enticing a minor with a computer, attempted sexual assault and possession of images of child abuse after officers said they had found images of child abuse on his mobile phone, AP reports. It says Mr Haughwout's lawyer reportedly called that arrest warrant ""overly broad"" and suggested that Clinton police had it in for his client because of the drone videos. Last year, Mr Haughwout was also charged with assaulting police officers. That case continues. And, in 2014, before the posting of the weaponised drone videos, a woman was charged with assaulting Mr Haughwout because she was upset that he had been using a drone to record video above a beach. Mr Haughwout posted footage of that confrontation on YouTube.",1,712

"The trial, which targets women who are too late to undergo surgery, gives six weeks of additional chemotherapy. On average, 94 women in Northern Ireland each year are diagnosed with cervical cancer. Approximately 22 will die. Tara Millar from Belfast was diagnosed on 1 April 2015. After her diagnosis which was stage 2b, research staff at the cancer centre in Belfast offered her the choice of joining the UK trial. ""After I did all the research it was a no brainer,"" she said. ""I knew I was going to lose my hair and I had a mane of hair at the time. In fact, it weighed four pounds when it was cut off. ""But I looked at the facts and it gave me a higher percentage chance of surviving. "" The trial, which is called Interlace, is being conducted by Cancer Research UK. This week it awarded PS1.3m to Belfast Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre for trials. Currently, four women in Northern Ireland are taking part in the trial, which is now in phase three of its research. Additional nurses are often required which offer one-to-one treatment to the patient. Wendy Cunningham has been a cancer research nurse for 20 years and looked after Tara. ""The trial involves half of the women getting two extra drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for about six weeks before their standard round of chemotherapy starts,"" she said. ""And these drugs are already being used for ovarian and breast cancer. So we know what their side effects are like. ""We know they work but they are given at a certain dose, and weekly, so it is not harmful. That means the patient, all being well, can be ready to start the standard treatment after six weeks."" While not all women are suitable for the trial, even those who are eligible sometimes refuse. as it adds another six weeks to the standard round of treatment. According to Tara, who was 31 when diagnosed and is now two years in remission, the prospect of losing her hair, while daunting, was worth it. ""I knew my hair would grow back and it has. I said'yes' to the trial very easily. ""I was asked,'Do you want more drugs? If it gives you more of a chance to survive, it was just an extra six weeks'. So far it's been worth it."" One of the problems around the condition is women are being diagnosed too late. Tara said she regrets not taking up the offer of a smear test in her local GP surgery and is appealing for other women to go. Richard Wilson is a consultant oncologist and a professor at the centre of cell research at Queen's University Belfast (QUB). Prof Wilson said this it was a very exciting time for Belfast and its research into cancer. He said there was one current area of research that is particularly exciting. ""This is a trial in ovarian cancer and it's a trial of a drug that's being developed from research in QUB. ""We're giving this drug here and in two English centres to patients for the first time ever - it's a drug called ALM201. ""It cuts down the blood supply to ovarian cancer. We've finished the first phase of it and are going into the second phase."" He said the number of cancer cases in Northern Ireland is increasing as people are living longer and diagnosing cancer is improving. But he had this stark warning. ""Cancer is increasing inexorably year on year. It occurs in all ages but it is more a disease of older people. We're all living longer but are living longer to get cancer. ""Lifestyle choices are driving more cancers as well - the increase in obesity for example is fuelling cancer, so we're getting better at treating it but we're playing catch-up all the time. Meanwhile, Tara is looking ahead. Recently married she and her husband are planning to do a lot of travelling - she is also intending to grow her hair long again. The trial is still recruiting new candidates.",1,714
"Police are investigating events linked to the funeral and wake of the mother of INLA man Patsy O'Hara, who died in the 1981 hunger strike. Dozens of people wearing military-style uniform, berets and dark glasses attended the funeral in Londonderry. Unionist politicians criticised the paramilitary display at the funeral in Londonderry on Saturday. But Edel Kelly said it was what her grandmother wanted. ""She meant the world to me, to my sisters and my brothers as well and to a whole lot of people in Derry, because everyone knew Peggy O'Hara,"" Ms Kelly said. ""My granny organised everything herself before her death, she wanted what happened at the wake and she wanted what happened at the funeral."" It was reported earlier this week that shots were fired over Mrs O'Hara's coffin. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) is a republican paramilitary group believed to have been responsible for more than 120 murders from its formation in 1975 until its ceasefire in 1998. Ms Kelly defended the paramilitary theme of the funeral and she also criticised deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness. After the funeral, he had tweeted: ""Honoured to attend Peggy O'Hara's funeral Mass this morning. Masked men parading after did little to respect the memory of such a good woman."" But Ms Kelly disagreed. ""I'm just speaking from my granny's point of view because I knew what her feelings on Martin McGuinness were. He's actually disrespecting her as the mother of a hunger striker. ""It's something that my granny wanted. If he's condemning that, then he's condemning the wishes of my granny. ""If it happened in their tradition I would have no problem with that. Patsy O'Hara died. He gave his life for Ireland."" DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell was critical of the police response at Mrs O'Hara's funeral. ""Despite our efforts with the police, it would seem that there were no visible signs of police in close proximity to the funeral cortege on Saturday,"" he said. ""Men and women dressed in paramilitary garb with faces covered were free to march, for almost two miles, around the streets of Londonderry."" Ulster Unionist Ross Hussey said people would expect to see convictions ""after this brazen display of paramilitary thuggery."" Responding to the criticism, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the nature of their operations are made on a cases by case basis. ""There is no'one size fits all' approach however where offences are disclosed they will always be investigated. ""These sorts of displays and paramilitarism have no place in a modern Northern Ireland. ""We absolutely reject any suggestion of bias in policing. Such remarks are inaccurate, unhelpful and ill-informed."" Edel Kelly believes her grandmother's death is being used a political football. ""As we walked along from Longtower chapel, down past where we used to live in Ardfoyle where Peggy brought us up, everybody on Bishop Street came out and blessed themselves. ""We didn't go through any contentious areas, it wasn't about that. It was about honouring my granny and the suffering that she's gone through all these years. ""They shouldn't be bringing this into politics.""",1,715
"With all the walking, running, cycling and gym activity you intend to do, obviously you need an activity tracker -a small, trusty device that you can wear 247 to monitor every footstep, every mile clocked up, every calorie burned, and even the quality of every moment's shuteye. You'll believe what it says. I mean, why wouldn't you? Millions of these things have been sold, and you're not exactly going to buy multiple devices to check they come up with the same results. And that's why I felt compelled to carry out this experiment for you. I've spent a full week wearing four of the latest and best-known trackers to see if they all came up with the same results. My findings? They don't. This isn't about which device presents your text messages to you, or comes in three shades of pink, but about cold, hard data. The Garmin Vivosmart, Fitbit Charge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone Up Move are all in the dock. At their worst, one day saw a variation between them of 23 in distance covered, and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of 2,649 calories burned - that's more than an entire day's calorie intake for someone of my build. Both companies are united in saying that it's not the figures that matter, but the pattern. Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend. ""Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern,"" he says, ""Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week? Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day, week to week? Because it's that trend that's going to make you healthier."" It's a sentiment echoed by Jawbone's head of international partner and product development, Jorgen Nordin. ""What's important really is that our system is all about getting better, becoming a better version of yourself,"" he says. And maybe there is something in that. Goodwill, good intention, motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being. Yet rely too much on the tech, inviting in third-party apps, inputting what you've eaten, and taking the figures as gospel, and you may just find it all going the wrong way. But, surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you? Well, Misfit's medical director Matthew Diamond explains it's not an exact science. ""Variations in algorithms, the sensors used, the characteristics of the individual wearing the device, like height and gait, as well as wearing position, can result in observed differences,"" he says. That's not dissimilar to Mr Jones's view - he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm. Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heart-rate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy, which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to. ""Garmin's activity trackers are all about motivation, nudging the user to make healthier choices,"" says Chrissy Winchcombe, Garmin's marketing executive of wellness. ""You can also use it with a heart-rate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising."" Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly, some with looks to replicate mere watches. Others, like the Swarovski crystal, solar-powered Misfit - tracking abilities aside - would put J-Lo's bling to shame. But providing stats and prompting ""do more exercise"" notifications are just the start of their makers' ambitions. ""With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band, you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you,"" says Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin. ""For example, you've been out running, you come home. Your house knows you've been running, not just because of the temperature of your skin, but it also knows you've been sweating based on sensors. ""Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down. Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler. ""If you're in a house with a boiler connected to your shower, that could be turned on as you walk into your house."" Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes. For most of us though, the simple question now is more likely to be: ""Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then?"" Sensors are still improving, and as we've seen, we can't expect military precision, but this is a personal choice. Will I be laying mine to rest? No chance. It makes me think more about my activity. It makes me walk instead of getting the bus. It makes me feel smug at the end of the day (usually). My husband I can compete over footsteps - don't worry, we have the same device. And now, maybe I'll work that extra bit harder just in case it's going easy on me.",1,716

Farrell is among the replacements, and Gatland says there is ""every chance"" he will play alongside Sexton at some point in the game. Gatland has previously played down the possibility of Farrell and Sexton operating in the same backline. ""Owen Farrell has had quite a bit of rugby and he's pretty important to us at the moment,"" Gatland said. ""We need to make sure he is fit for the following week, because he has been pretty crucial to us.

""It's really lifted the team and helped bring them together as a unit.

"The works on Gdynia Way near Plymouth's city centre have been in place since June to widen the road to three lanes. But police said they had seen an increase in the number of collisions on the Maxwell Road, Macadam Road junction. Plymouth City Council (PCC) said a new set of temporary traffic lights would be put on the junction. Pc Ian Tanner, Plymouth's road casualty reduction officer said: ""There have been some collisions since the new system was put in place, with four or five injury collisions in that area. ""The council are diverting quite large volumes of traffic on to roads that, although perfectly up to the job, people don't usually travel on, and as a result it hasn't worked as well as we would have liked it to. ""It's a balancing act for the council, as to what is the best thing to do, to keep the traffic moving as well as they can and to keep the level of injuries down."" Pc Tanner added that the increase in collisions could also be a result of drivers, familiar with the route, not reading new signs properly. In a statement, PCC said: ""During the last couple of months it has become apparent that there could be further improvements to the revised junction layout. ""The decision to install temporary lights has been made after routine discussions with various stakeholders including the police. ""The lights will reinforce the changed priorities and help drivers negotiate this junction."" The council said that up to 1,000 drivers used the junction each hour. The new traffic lights will give priority to traffic travelling between Plymstock and the city centre in the morning and vice versa in the evening, until the work is completed in October.",1,718
"He argued that you can only have a vibrant West End if you've got a strong regional base developing the talent and he sees no reason why so much more arts funding goes into London per head of population than it does to the regions. The MP for Colchester argued: ""The West End is often the showcase of our best theatre, but it does not exist in a vacuum; it exists because it is fed and sustained by the talent of regional theatres across the country."" As ever, the nub of the argument was money. ""Much of our regional theatre is not self-financing,"" Mr Quince said. ""It relies on subsidies from the Arts Council and local government to ensure its year-to-year viability. In Colchester, the Mercury theatre's income is 30 grant income, with the other 70 earned."" Mr Quince argued every pound spent on the Mercury theatre made PS3 for the local economy. He was well-supported by MPs who praised the New Theatre Royal in Portsmouth, the Buxton Opera House and the Theatre Royal in Bury St Edmunds. The MP for Bury St Edmunds, Jo Churchill, outlined the community value of local theatres: ""I have in my constituency the only example of a regency playhouse in the country. We have the historic value of the building - it is 87 self-funded and, as it reaches out, it is very hard to put a price on its social value. ""We reach out to Women's Aid and work with them. We reach out to children with physical and mental disabilities and to Suffolk Age Concern. We also work with the YMCA, and young people who are homeless and without work have come to work in the theatre. Does my honourable friend agree that a price cannot be put on that? Ed Vaizey, the minister for culture, replied for the government, arguing that changes in funding were moving in the right direction. ""There is a lively debate about the amount of funding that goes into London and to other areas outside London,"" he said. ""It is important to say that when we came into office around 60 of lottery funding went outside London. That has now risen to 70, and the Arts Council has an ambition to go further to reach 75 by the end of 2018. ""It is also following the same strategy with its national portfolio organisations. In 2012, 49 of funding went to London and 51 went outside London. By 2015, that had changed to 45 in London and 55 outside London."" The minister welcomed the debate and agreed in principle that regional theatres deserve every penny they get but made no promises that any more money would be forthcoming. The member for Colchester, who treated BBC Essex listeners to a burst of Les Miserables following the debate, said he would continue to campaign for theatre but promised he had no plans to tread the boards anytime soon. ""They do say that politics is showbusiness for ugly people,"" he concluded. A thought perhaps better not shared with his colleagues.",1,719
"East Sussex Wildlife Rescue said it had rescued 25 birds in the last 12 months at Ditchling Common Country Park. In the latest incident a fishing hook had to be removed from a swan's tongue in the charity's operating theatre. East Sussex County Council (ESCC) said it inspected the lakes and removed any discarded fishing equipment. The injured swan, along with its three cygnets was rescued on Thursday after the charity received six calls from walkers who reported seeing the bird with blood on its body and a fishing hook in its mouth. Wildlife rescue founder Trevor Weeks said a large carp hook was embedded in the swan's tongue. ""The removal of the hook was a very dangerous procedure and could have resulted in the death of the swan,"" he said. ""We've had a whole variety of calls to that lake. ""We are getting everything from abscesses in their necks where hooks have become embedded, to breathing difficulties where they have got lines tightly wrapped round their necks. ""There are a lot of very responsible anglers and they are just as concerned about the problem as we are but if this doesn't improve they should be banning it completely."" Anglers need to apply for a permit to fish at the country park. ESCC said the danger discarded fishing equipment poses to wildlife is made clear to anglers when they are granted a permit to fish. ""We litter-pick at the site once a week but, in light of the recent injury to the swan, we will carry out a further inspection at the pond and surrounding area and remove any discarded fishing lines, hooks and litter that we find,"" it said.",1,720
"Stuart Coffey, 44, transferred cash from Bracebridge Heath Medical Practice into his own account between 2008 and 2013. Lincoln Crown Court heard he stole so much money the surgery fell into rent arrears of PS37,000. Coffey, of Bede Close, Quarrington, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud. The fraud was discovered when Coffey left the practice and staff discovered the rent had not been paid and other invoices were outstanding. Prosecutor Jonathon Dee said a review of accounts found ""pretty much consistently over five years the defendant had been stealing from the practice.""

"The Lions looked the more dangerous side in the early stages and experienced striker Steve Morison twice hammered efforts over the crossbar. There was little goalmouth action at either end until Millwall broke the deadlock in the 35th minute. Morison helped on a free-kick from Tony Craig and central defender Byron Webster fired a shot on the turn from 15 yards into the bottom corner of the net. Shrewsbury almost equalised early in the second half but visiting right-back Mahlon Romeo's clearance from Shaun Whalley's cross just went over the bar. Millwall doubled their advantage in the 77th minute, Shaun Hutchinson turning in the loose ball from close range after Shrewsbury were unable to clear Shane Ferguson's free-kick. Shrewsbury, now without a win in six games, grabbed a late consolation when Whalley, set up by Stephen Humphrys, squeezed a shot past goalkeeper Tom King.

"Donald Skene grappled with worshippers and headbutted prayers posted on the walls of the Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road last December. Skene, 38, was ordered to complete 156 days of the unexpired portion of his jail term for breaching his licence. He was also sentenced to a year's supervision following his release. Dundee Sheriff Court was told Skene shouted: ""I'm white but I'm one of you, brothers,"" to the Muslim congregation after being arrested. In CCTV footage shown to the court, Skene was seen entering the mosque's wash room and wandering around crying, as members of the congregation prepared to enter the prayer room. Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin the court: ""His behaviour is bizarre - attempts are made to try and calm him down."" Skene is then seen running in circles around the prayer room as worshippers speak to him. Mrs Gilmartin said: ""There are various religious texts in glass frames around the room. ""The accused punches some of them and latterly headbutts them. ""He had entered using Islamic greetings, and when he was arrested he refers to members of the congregation as brothers and shouts'I'm white but I'm one of you'.""

"Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, told the BBC that domestic gas and electricity prices should be cheaper ""for the vast majority of people."" Wholesale energy costs make up nearly half of a domestic bill, and have fallen by about a third in the last 12 to 18 months, he said. Yet, prices had not fallen, he added. Energy UK, which represents the major energy energy companies, insisted that there was a competitive market of 34 suppliers and that people should switch for savings of hundreds of pounds. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the trade body, said the industry had made ""mistakes in the past"" in failing to assist those languishing on variable deals but that the situation had improved alongside increased competition. The regulator has said 70 of consumers remain on standard variable tariffs which have hardly changed since early last year. Pressure is mounting on the UK's big six energy suppliers to cut their prices in line with falling costs after the latest analysis showed wholesale gas and electricity prices in the UK hit a five-year low at the end of 2015. Figures published on Thursday showed the cost of energy on the wholesale market tumbled to PS36.76 per megawatt hour on the Power Index, compiled by market information provider ICIS.",1,727
"The classic adaptation, which opened on Wednesday, is presented on a set designed like a Victorian toy theatre. Broadbent plays his role with an undercurrent of his well-known affability, according to the critics. Yet he said his Scrooge had been partly inspired by modern bankers and the issue of pay-day loans. ""There are an awful lot of echoes of what's going on today. We don't mention pay day loans but it's implied,"" he said. ""It's not a faithful view of Victorian London. It's a subtle piece of writing that allows all sorts of elements in to make it more relevant. ""At the beginning of the play Scrooge presents himself as someone who's rather smooth and into marketing. He presents a benevolent front to the world so he can carry out his financial activities. "" The play is written by Patrick Barlow, with whom Broadbent performed for many years in the cult comedy troupe The National Theatre of Brent. And the small cast - including actors Adeel Akhtar, Amelia Bullmore, Keir Charles and Samantha Spiro - play multiples roles alongside some ingenious and heart-rending puppetry. Playwright Barlow said it had been a joy to bring Broadbent back to the stage. ""It was the clown in him that I first worked with and the clown in him that I wanted to work with again. I said it had to be Jim to play Scrooge because he can be tragic and terrible - and also hilarious."" The critics seemed largely to be won over by Broadbent's take on one of the meanest men in literature, despite concerns that the actor is just too nice to be convincing. Dominic Cavendish of the Telegraph was among those won over: ""The spirit is one of send-up; and Scrooge is, perhaps for the first time ever, having a laugh - albeit at the expense of the poor..... This is Dickens retained in cod-period yet nodding to our own banking age. ""All told, this is a surprising, quirky reading which traditionalists may find hard to stomach, but Dickens' hardy perennial is robust enough to take the knockabout."" Tiffany Pritchard of the Londonist said: ""Furthering to the overall lighthearted, and equally over-the-top, tone is the wonderfully charismatic Jim Broadbent whose animated grumblings and comedic gestures make the otherwise cantankerous Ebenezer Scrooge almost endearing. ""With a few'tickety-boos' and the occasional song and dance number, the show at times feels more panto than stage play aEUR"" but judging from the finale's standing ovation aEUR"" that's not a bad thing."" While Lyn Gardner of the Guardian described Broadbent's Scrooge as ""genial and cuddly."" But she concludes: ""All this is quite fun, warm and silly.... Broadbent's Scrooge.... is lovable and baby faced even when supposedly at his most curmudgeonly. ""The danger is that amid all this, bonhomie is lost. Scrooge's apparent change of heart is oddly sudden, and there's no sense that he has been on a real emotional journey - rather than simply a jokey one.""

"The pontiff granted Spanish Monsignor Lucio Vallejo Balda a Christmas-time clemency after he served half of his 18-month sentence, the Vatican said. The priest was convicted in July. The leaked papers were cited in books published in 2015, that alleged corruption in the Catholic Church. A former colleague of the priest was given a 10-month suspended sentence. On Tuesday, the Vatican said in a statement that Pope Francis granted ""conditional freedom"" to Mgr Angelo Lucio Vallejo Balda. ""This is a clemency measure which allows him to regain his freedom. The penalty is not quashed."" The statement added that all his professional ties to the Vatican had ended, and he would now be under the authority of the Bishop of Astorga in Spain - the priest's original diocese. Mgr Balda has made no public comment on the latest developments. The books, by journalists Emiliano Fittipaldi and Gianluigi Nuzzi, were based on leaked materials and exposed waste and financial mismanagement in the Church. The original Vatileaks episode saw the last Pope's former butler, Paolo Gabriele, sentenced to 18 months in jail in 2012 after being found guilty of stealing sensitive documents from the pontiff's desk.

"In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed and their hostage freed. In Paris itself, a gunman holding hostages in a Jewish supermarket has been killed, but a number of hostages also died. Here is what we know about the attackers so far. Two brothers accused of carrying out the massacre at the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday were killed two days later when police stormed the building where they had been holding a hostage. Two men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had been barricaded in a printing factory in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) from Paris. Cherif, 32, was jailed in 2008 and had long been known to police for militant Islamist activities, prior to the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, which killed 12 people. Cherif, who also went by the name Abu Issen, had been part of the ""Buttes-Chaumont network"" that helped send would-be jihadists to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-UK invasion in 2003. He grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes, where he trained as a fitness coach. In the early 2000s, he joined his elder brother at his home near Paris and worked as a pizza delivery man, media say. Police detained him in 2005 just as he was about to board a plane for Syria - at the time the gateway for jihadists hoping to fight US troops in Iraq. Le Monde reports that, following Cherif's imprisonment between January 2005 and October 2006, he first came into contact with the man who would become his mentor - Djamel Beghal. Beghal was sentenced to 10 years in prison in France in 2001 for his part in a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris. In 2008, Cherif Kouachi was jailed for three years for his role in sending militants to Iraq, but 18 months of the sentence was suspended. Eric Bade, a neighbour living in Genneviliers, north-west of Paris, described Cherif as ""well-behaved, friendly, polite, clean-looking and above all, which is very important, he was willing to help old and disabled people."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bade said Cherif ""wasn't aggressive - he wasn't a crazy zealot, he was a calm person."" 'Iraq connections' The brothers had allegedly attended a mosque near the Buttes-Chaumont, an area of northern Paris, where they came under the influence of a radical imam called Farid Benyettou. He reportedly encouraged them to study Islam at his home and at a Muslim centre in their area. A key figure in the Buttes-Chaumont network was Boubaker al-Hakim, a militant linked to al-Qaeda resistance against US forces in Iraq, a French expert on Islamists says. A French court jailed Hakim for seven years in 2008, at the same time as Cherif, along with Farid Benyettou, who got six years. That action broke up the jihadist network they had created. In a blog article (in French) Middle East expert Jean-Pierre Filiu says Hakim had recruited militants to fight in Falluja, an Iraqi city that became an al-Qaeda stronghold in 2004. Hakim is also wanted in Tunisia over the murder of two Tunisian left-wing opposition politicians in 2013 - Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi. Hakim claimed the murder in the name of the Islamic State militant group, Mr Filiu says. In 2010 Cherif Kouachi was named in connection with a plot to spring another Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, from jail - a plot hatched by Beghal, according to French anti-terror police. Belkacem used to be in the outlawed Algerian Islamic Armed Group (GIA) and was jailed for life in 2002 for a Paris metro station bombing in 1995 which injured 30 people. Said Kouachi, 34, was also named in the Belkacem plot, but the brothers were not prosecuted because of a lack of evidence. Said's ID card was found in the brothers' getaway car which they abandoned after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, police sources say. The gunman who is thought to have killed four people and held a number of others hostage at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris has been identified as 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly. Police also believe he killed a policewoman in the Montrouge area of the French capital on Thursday. Coulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity - including drugs offences - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers. Born in Juvisy-sur-Orge on the outskirts of Paris, he is said to have been one of 10 children. He worked for Coca Cola. He met then-President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace in 2009, as part of an employment initiative. In an interview with Le Parisien at the time, he said it would be ""impressive"" to meet Mr Sarkozy, and that he was not sure what he would say. He had added that his temporary job at the local Coca Cola plant would be over soon, and that he hoped Mr Sarkozy could help him get a job. Reports say Coulibaly - along with Cherif Kouachi - was a committed follower of Djamel Beghal. In 2013 he was jailed for five years for his involvement in the 2010 plot to free Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from prison, following the militant Islamist's conviction over the 1995 Paris metro station bombing. He met Cherif Kouachi while in prison. Coulibaly was released last year. He is said to have told police from the supermarket on Friday: ""You know who I am."" An acquaintance told AP news agency that he was ""totally shocked"" when he found out about Coulibaly's role in the attacks. ""He never went to prayers or talked about Islam,"" the fellow drug dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Coulibaly's mother and sister have issued a statement condemning his attacks. They offered ""sincere condolences"" to the families of the victims, and said: ""We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion."" Meanwhile, police are still trying to trace Hayat Boumeddiene, a 26-year-old woman who was Coulibaly's partner. She is thought to have married Coulibaly in a religious ceremony in 2009 - however, these ceremonies are not recognised in France unless an official civil ceremony is also carried out. She is now believed to be in Syria. She arrived in Turkey in early January, before crossing into Syria on 8 January, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on 12 January. Police had previously identified her as a suspect in Thursday's shooting of a policewoman. Francois Molins, the chief prosecutor in France, said Boumeddiene had exchanged more than 500 phone calls with the wife of Cherif Kouachi in 2014. French newspaper Le Monde published a series of photographs said to show Coulibaly with Boumeddiene in 2010. In one, she is pictured pointing a crossbow at the camera while wearing a full-face veil, which is banned in France. Police questioned Boumeddiene about Coulibaly in 2010. During the interview, she was reportedly asked about her reaction to attacks by al-Qaeda, and responded: ""I don't have any opinion,"" before blaming the US for civilian deaths. Who is Hayat Boumeddiene?",1,730

O'Connell made 174 Munster appearances and earned 108 Ireland caps.

The injury meant that O'Connell was forced to cancel his contract with French club Toulon. Former Lions captain O'Connell spent 14 seasons at Munster and helped the province win two European Cup titles and three Celtic Leagues.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (PS11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange the notes for smaller denominations, but will have their fingers marked. The government wants to stop holders of ""black cash"" offloading their old rupee notes in small tranches. Authorities often use indelible ink to stop people from voting more than once in Indian elections. People were told they should deposit their high denomination notes in the banks, or could only exchange up to 4,500 rupees, (65; PS52) for smaller notes. But to clamp down on holders of unlawfully held or untaxed cash, depositors can only make such transactions once and so the banks are using the ink to prevent them from making multiple deposits. India scraps 1,000 rupee notes overnight Chaos at banks over India money ban Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption. The finance ministry suspects ""unscrupulous"" people have been trying to get around the crackdown by sending proxies to exchange their banned rupee notes. The withdrawal of the big notes is aimed at'black money' and targets people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash. While the authorities say people will not be allowed another cash swap, critics are wondering what happens if the ink wears off? During elections, people have used chemicals to remove the ink from their fingers so that they can vote more than once. The government's ban on big bank notes first received widespread approval because less than 3 of Indians file tax returns. But the switch has caused chaos with tens of millions of Indians queuing for hours to exchange and withdraw cash. The government was ill-prepared for the ban which suddenly put 86 of the country's money supply out of circulation. Many businesses only accept cash and hundreds of millions of Indians do not have bank accounts and only use cash.",1,734

The flowing, fast Silverstone circuit and the huge crowds - 80,000 spectators are expected to attend practice on Friday, with about 95,000 due for Saturday's qualifying and 120,000 for the race on Sunday - make the British Grand Prix a favourite amongst drivers. Rosberg says he will do everything he could to prevent Hamilton recording a home victory on Sunday. ""I definitely am going to try,"" the German said. ""It's not going to be easy here, but I will do my best and I'm optimistic."" Having won seven of the eight races so far this season, only missing out in Canada last month when they ran into a rare reliability problem, Mercedes are expected to win at Silverstone, with Hamilton and Rosberg fighting it out at the front. World champions Red Bull should be their closest challengers, despite a poor race in Austria two weeks ago. Daniel Ricciardo, who was eighth in Austria, is the highest Red Bull driver in the championship in third place, 82 points behind Rosberg. The Australian, who took his maiden career victory in Canada, said the team said the team think they know what went wrong in Austria and were expecting a better weekend at Silverstone. That's because the plethora of high-speed corners suits the aerodynamic excellence of the Red Bull, while the power disadvantage of the Renault compared to the Mercedes engine is less of a handicap. ""If we can be the strong package we normally are here, it can definitely bring us close to the other teams,"" said Ricciardo. ""All going well, I think we should be the ones behind Mercedes. I think they'll still be quickest but whether that's half a second or two or three tenths [of a second] we'll have to find out. ""If we get it all right we can be within a couple of three tenths from them."" Ferrari are in a similar situation to Red Bull, with a good car let down by a poor engine, but double world champion Fernando Alonso is pessimistic about his chances of a podium finish at Silverstone. In fact, the Spaniard does not think his team will taste victory at all this season. ""If I'm honest with you, I would say no, it's not possible to win this year,"" Alonso said. ""But I thought in 2011 it was impossible to win a race and we won here. ""Anything can happen in this sport, so we try to do the best we can. If one opportunity arrives, we will take it to win a race, but it is extremely difficult to win with the performance we are showing."" If Alonso fails to register a win in 2014, it would be the first time since 2009 the 32-year-old has not won at least once in a season and only the second time since 2003. Alonso said he expected Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, who locked out the front row and finished the race third and fourth in Austria, would again be strong in Silverstone. ""They will be a threat,"" Alonso said. Listen to Lewis Hamilton's interview with BBC Radio 5 live British Grand Prix coverage details",1,735
"The service was held at the 22-year-old's school in Ohio, before his burial at a nearby cemetery. His death has heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Pyongyang has called President Donald Trump a ""psychopath,"" while he describes N Korea as a brutal regime. Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper claimed Mr Trump might launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea to divert attention from his domestic difficulties, and warned South Korea ""that following psychopath Trump.... will only lead to disaster."" Earlier in the week, after announcing Mr Warmbier's death, President Trump said he was determined to ""prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency."" The thousands of funeral goers formed two lines as Mr Warmbier's coffin was carried into Wyoming High School for the 45-minute service, and then along the three-mile route to the cemetery. There was only space for 800 people inside the school's auditorium so most attendees watched the service on monitors in overflow rooms, CNN reports. Mr Warmbier's brother and sister, along with some friends, spoke during the service. Bagpipes played as mourners, wearing blue and white ribbons - the school's colours - to honour the former student, left the school. Thousands of people from his small hometown of Wyoming, Ohio, packed into Otto Warmbier's old high school for his funeral. For most, his casket was the first they had seen of Otto since he went to North Korea - awful confirmation of the shocking, surreal set of circumstances that had played out since early last year. Among several politicians in attendance, including officials from the state and defence departments was the Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who had been involved in the quest to bring him home. Mr Portman reflected a sense that while today was a time to talk about Mr Warmbier's life, as a young man with huge potential, the issue of responsibility had to be addressed. After the funeral, mourners stood to watch the cortege pass and disappear through the streets with blue and white ribbons tied to all the trees in his honour. As they reflect, there are many not just here but across the country, asking how North Korea will now pay for what many see as the murder of an American citizen. Otto Warmbier was returned by North Korea to the US last week, more than a year after he had been sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. He was in a coma and died a few days later. His parents say that though he never spoke or opened his eyes, ""the countenance of his face changed - he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that."" US doctors say he suffered a ""severe neurological injury,"" the most likely cause of which was a cardiopulmonary arrest that had cut the blood supply to the brain. A post-mortem examination was not carried out at the request of the family. Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was travelling with a tour group when he was arrested at Pyongyang airport in January 2016. He was accused of stealing a propaganda sign from a hotel and, two months later, was sentenced during a short trial. His family had no news of him until 13 June, when Pyongyang said he had been in a coma since his trial after contracting botulism and receiving a sleeping pill. US doctors say there is no evidence he suffered from botulism, and the Warmbier family believe he died as a result of ""awful torturous mistreatment.""",1,736
"He is the latest casualty of the Trump White House, and takes the record for the shortest term in a top job: he was fired 10 days after being announced as communications director. But of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump. Here's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with ""The Mooch."" The brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews. Although he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines. He appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Why was he sacked? Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus. The White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were ""inappropriate."" Time in post? Ten days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.) The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles. Mr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president. Why was he sacked? President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Time in post? Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Why did he leave? Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" Sarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had ""vehemently"" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a ""major mistake."" Time in post? Six months. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing and alleged indiscretion of the announcement, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. But Mr Trump praised the FBI director heavily, saying it ""took a lot of guts"" to make his announcement and that he had ""brought back his reputation."" He blew Mr Comey a kiss at the White House. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Why was he sacked? The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a ""showboat"" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking if the ""Russia thing"" when he made the decision to sack him. Later it emerged that he allegedly told Russian officials that the dismissal had taken ""great pressure"" off him. Special counsel Robert Mueller is reported to be investigating whether obstruction of justice occurred. Time in post? Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. Mr Trump was briefed on the possibility that Mr Flynn was open to blackmail, because Moscow knew he was lying, but 18 days elapsed before the president sacked him, raising questions about exactly what the president knew and when. Why was he sacked? It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. The question with this sacking was, why did it take so long? White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. Time in post? 23 days. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. Within hours, she was fired. Why was she sacked? A White House statement said Ms Yates had ""betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States."" It also described her as ""weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration."" But it was also Ms Yates who informed White House counsel that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about his contacts with Ambassador Kislyak and presented a risk of Russian blackmail as a result. The president's sacking of an Obama-era holdover who had openly defied him was certainly less controversial than the Comey dismissal, but it drew heavy criticism from Democrats, who said Ms Yates had done her job in standing up to the travel ban. Time in post? 10 days. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. Mr Bharara had built a reputation as the ""Sheriff of Wall Street"" after a number of aggressive prosecutions of traders. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including an investigation into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign finances and allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Why was he sacked? Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. A few days before he was sacked, three ethics groups called on Mr Bharara in an open letter to investigate whether Trump companies in his jurisdiction had received foreign payments. Meanwhile, a ProPublica investigation revealed that Mr Bharara was overseeing an investigation into stock trades by Mr Trump's incoming health secretary Tom Price. Three Democratic senators wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions asking him to investigate the Bharara sacking. Time in post? Seven years, seven months. Less than two under Mr Trump. Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. Why was he sacked? The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a boilerplate statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives.

"Cumbernauld has the dubious distinction of winning the Plook on the Plinth title for having Scotland's ""most dismal"" town centre in 2001 and 2005. Judges have compared it to Kabul and described its shopping centre as a rabbit warren on stilts. Now an online poll has seen it top a public vote for civic pride. The Scottish Design Awards is organised by Urban Realm - which also organises the Carbuncle awards. During the past few weeks of online voting, Cumbernauld residents helped the town move ahead of rivals such as Broughty Ferry, Dunkeld, East Kilbride, Eaglesham Linlithgow, Peebles and Pitlochry. When the polls closed at midnight on Thursday, Cumbernauld had narrowly beaten Peebles. The prize will be collected by a delegation from the town at a ceremony in Glasgow on Friday evening. The Carbuncle Awards were created by Gordon Young, now editor of The Drum, one of the sponsors of the Scottish Design Awards. He said: ""The initial complaints against the town concerned the disastrous design of the town centre. ""There has been some investment in that area but the level of improvement is not great. ""However, Cumbernauld's real success story is how it has prospered despite these problems."" Mr Young said ""the surrounding countryside, the high demand for housing, rich and diverse suburbs, transport links to Glasgow and Edinburgh and a vibrant community spirit"" had all helped make Cumbernauld ""a decent place to bring up a family."" He added: ""Basically, economic success plus people power have made it a nice place to live.""",1,740
"Speaking about the 1948 contract Nye Bevan, the founding father of the NHS, offered consultants, he said he had ""stuffed their mouths with gold."" That gold was the ability to continue private practice - something senior doctors have carefully guarded since. Down the years, several ministers have had a look at the issue, but concluded it was simply too tricky to tackle. One former health secretary told me they thought consultants would simply walk away en masse if the government got tough. There has been some movement. In fact, the current contract had a little nibble at restricting private practice, by insisting that any doctor doing fewer than 11 shifts (of four hours each) a week offers any extra work to the NHS first before accepting private work. It has probably had some impact, but only a little. A full-time contract is 10 shifts, so it ties them to only an extra four hours a week before they are free to work in the private sector. But after years of shying away from the issue, the government looks like it wants to tackle this head on. It is not being explicit in coming out and saying it wants curbs on private practice. But the implications of the move by NHS England to publish earnings is clear: there is a suspicion that some doctors are raking it in and that affects their motivation when it comes to the NHS - both in terms of working extra hours for the health service and how productive they really want to be - and by publishing the details there is a hope it will make doctors think twice about how much they do. Longer NHS waiting lists means more private work as either people will pay to go private or, and this is more common, the NHS has to pay for patients to be seen privately. The private market is worth PS4.6bn a year, according to market analysts Laing Buisson, with a quarter coming via NHS referrals. At a time when money is tight and ministers want to get more seven-day services, tackling this is clearly an attractive proposition. Although with the consultant contract currently in the process of being renegotiated (talks have slowed because of the junior doctor dispute), expect consultants to be hopping mad that their pay is once again in the headlines. It promises to be the mother of all battles. But if the register of private work is published, what will it show? What is known about the extent of private work is pretty sketchy. A British Medical Association survey from 2009 suggested about half of doctors in the UK (it's not limited to England) did private work - but this was a fall from six in 10 when it was done several years before that. Of those that did private work, a quarter earn under PS10,000 a year, while one in six made in excess of PS100,000. This included private hospital work, alongside earnings from other sources such as providing advice to pharmaceutical companies and assessments for insurance companies. But it must be said this was a self-selecting poll - doctors were not compelled to take part, so it is hard to gauge whether it was truly representative. There are plenty of specialities where private work is not so easy to come by. But there are others - orthopaedic surgery, urology, ophthalmology and anaesthetics to name just four - where there is plenty of work. It means for some, earnings can be extremely high. Average basic salary for NHS work is PS89,000 in England. But this ignores a number of ways doctors can make much more. There are bonuses - called clinical excellence awards - which can be worth tens of thousands of pounds a year. Once awarded, they are difficult to take away. And then there is overtime work. For some, this can be pretty lucrative - a BBC investigation earlier this year found one made PS375,000 in a year. Now that figure is very revealing. That consultant was thought to be on a special deal as they worked in an area where there is a shortage of consultants. It meant the NHS was prepared to pay them close to what they could have got on the private market. All in all, it suggests there are consultants out there earning in excess of PS500,000.

"Only 50.5 overs were possible at the MCG, but Australia still got wickets at regular intervals with Jackson Bird taking two for 53.

All transactions on the virtual exchange have been suspended while the security breach is investigated. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said that it was ""deeply concerned about the issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it."" The hack is one of the biggest thefts in bitcoin's history and is being treated as a ""major deal"" by many in the virtual currency community.

"Reactions range from the ""BBC has killed Top Gear,"" to praise for a ""brave BBC."" The story was also news for media in areas as far apart as Latin America and Europe, with the Russian Defence Ministry even offering Clarkson a job at its own TV station. French daily Figaro said the announcement had had ""the effect of a bomb on Twitter."" It added that ""the sense of disappointment can be read in messages posted on the social network across the Channel and even in France."" Italian journalist Federico Garimberti recalled on Twitter: ""Like it or not, a BBC that shows Clarkson the door demonstrates that it doesn't give a damn about its audience. Top Gear is watched by 350 million people in 212 countries."" ""This is the end of Top Gear as we know it,"" Jan Micka exclaimed on the Czech website Auto.cz. In Iran, a disappointed Twitter user tried to start a trend in defence of the British TV presenter. ""We are all Jeremy Clarkson,"" declared CmpiChism, arguing that ""no one can present like him."" Other Iranians seemed to agree. Saman Vatanshenasan wrote on Facebook that it was ""meaningless to imagine the Top Gear without Jeremy.... I need to say this in support of him that I am Jeremy Clarkson."" ""Now that the BBC has sacked Clarkson does anyone watch Top Gear anymore? They are crazy,"" sellar said on Twitter. But not everyone in Iran on social media was pro-Clarkson. Facebook user Mohammad E. Amini pointed out that it was ""important to know the red line between fame and extremism."" ""BBC saved its name by making this decision,"" he added. ""BBC decision to stop its cooperation with Clarkson was a very brave and respectable move. Even if you have 30 million viewers there is still no reason for assault,"" argued jaavid on Twitter. In the Czech Republic, the move to drop the Top Gear presenter was welcomed by journalist Ivan Kytka. ""For the BBC, principles are clearly more important than profit. Money is not the most important thing for a public service broadcaster,"" he said on the Czech TV website. The BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract was greeted with approval by internet users in Argentina. Last September, the Top Gear crew had to abandon filming in the country amid angry protests over a car number plate that appeared to refer to the Falklands War. ""Thanks Jeremy... we don't need you around here... when you do come back it'll be to cover the story of when your delinquent countrymen give back the Malvinas [Falklands],"" said a reader in the online forum of Clarin newspaper. ""The best TV channel in the world can't have this type of employee,"" was another opinion in the same forum.

"The company said it had faced a ""chorus of music label representatives and artists"" accusing it of ""mistreating"" songwriters and performers. Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said YouTube gave musicians ""new revenue streams."" The row comes as the video-sharing website renews its agreements with major record labels. Prominent voices in the music industry have accused YouTube of paying low royalties for music video streams and turning a blind eye to copyright infringement. In March, the Recording Industry Association of America said YouTube paid ""meagre"" royalties when compared to subscription music services such as Apple Music and Spotify. On Monday, music manager Irving Azoff, formerly in charge of Ticketmaster and who now represents artists such as Christina Aguilera, said artists were paid a ""pittance"" on the advertising-funded site. In an open letter, he said YouTube did not allow musicians to put their tracks behind its YouTube Red pay-wall to earn more revenue. He also accused YouTube of ""hiding behind"" a so-called ""safe harbour"" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which stops websites being held responsible for copyright infringement by users, in some circumstances. Trying to keep copyright music off YouTube was ""an impossible, expensive game of'whack-a-mole',"" he said. ""When the artist sends a'take down' it should be a'stay down'."" YouTube said comparing subscription services to free advertising-funded websites was ""like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi."" In a blog post, the company said it paid ""a majority"" - more than 50 - of its advertising income to content creators and the music industry. However, it added that the average YouTube user listened to only one hour of music a month, compared to the 55 hours a month it said Spotify subscribers consumed. The company said its Content ID technology could detect when copyright music was uploaded to the website and automatically dealt with 99.5 of copyright claims. It said record labels had the choice of whether to earn advertising revenue from unauthorised uploads or have them blocked indefinitely, and that half of the 3bn (PS2bn) it had paid out to the music industry came from monetising these ""unauthorised uploads"" by the public. Income from its subscription service YouTube Red, available in the US, was shared with content creators and musicians in the same way as advertising revenue. YouTube has been separately criticised by video-makers who say Content ID does not respect the ""fair use"" of television and film extracts, which is protected by a provision of the DMCA. It has attempted to address the problem by allowing disputed videos to earn advertising revenue which is kept until the correct copyright holder can be identified. Hank Green, co-founder of the world's biggest online video convention VidCon, described YouTube's Content ID technology as a ""win-win"" situation for record labels. Record labels] can take the video down, or they can claim the revenue for themselves.... this is not an expensive game of'whack-a-mole', it's 100 automated,"" he wrote in a reply to Mr Azoff. ""They've been given a new 10-figure revenue stream of claimed fan creations that they never would have had without YouTube."" Singer Dave Giles, a regular performer at YouTube events, said musicians did benefit from advertising-supported streams on the video site. ""It was interesting that when Taylor Swift took her songs off Spotify, she kept them on YouTube,"" he told the BBC. ""If it wasn't really helping her career, surely she should have taken them off there as well. ""Spotify might be paying more per stream than YouTube, but they have more subscribers. There's an argument that YouTube should be doing more to push its subscription model, but they are still rolling it out. ""It's still more than artists get on Facebook.

"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance.

Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: ""The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. ""With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. ""We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been."" QPR boss Ian Holloway: ""I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. ""The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. ""Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. ""My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team."" Match ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Second Half ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Attempt saved.

"Jim McCafferty, 71, appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court charged with eight counts of touching a boy under the age of 16. The crimes are alleged to have happened in Belfast between 2012 and 2015. Mr McCafferty, who previously lived in Glasgow and worked at Celtic more than 20 years ago, was arrested last December. He was also a kit man for other Scottish clubs, including Falkirk and Hibernian, before moving to Northern Ireland about seven years ago. Mr McCafferty, who now has an address at Raby Street in south Belfast, has been on remand at Maghaberry Prison amid fears for his safety. He was escorted into the dock on a walking frame for the hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Dressed in a white T-shirt and and grey tracksuit bottoms, the pensioner spoke to confirm he understood the allegations against him. The judge ordered his trial to be held at Belfast Crown Court on a date to be fixed. No application for bail was made and he is expected to remain in custody until the proceedings get underway.",1,750
"The 30-year-old signed a new three-year contract with Notts on Monday. Gurney told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""Notts are a very special club with a lot of history. In my five years here, my career has been on an upward trend. ""Despite the fact we've been relegated, I feel pretty optimistic about the future and quite excited to be getting stuck in under Peter Moores."" Gurney joined Notts from East Midlands rivals Leicestershire in 2011 and has since taken 306 wickets for the Trent Bridge club in all formats. ""I am really grateful to Mick (Newell) who originally signed me and I feel loyalty to him, as well as the club to be honest,"" continued Gurney. ""I think we can rebuild next season, tweak a few things and hopefully build a foundation which can propel us back into Division One.""",1,751
"Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Meadows in Downpatrick. The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast. Regarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. His brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison. Joseph Hughes, who pleaded guilty to a single charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was given a three-year sentence. Six months of this will be spent in jail, with the remaining 30 months on supervised licence upon his release.",1,752
"The government wants some households to pay more to raise money for education, and finance secretary Derek Mackay gave evidence to committee backing the plan. The committee formally recommended the scheme to parliament after members voted four to two in favour of it. Members also rejected an amendment from Green MSP Andy Wightman noting ""concerns"" about wider local tax plans. The proposals would see the average band E household pay about PS2 per week more, and the average household in the highest band (H) about PS10 a week more. Parliament has to pass an order, a piece of secondary legislation, to change the bands, and Mr Mackay has now won the formal backing of the committee for that. Members will submit a report to parliament, before the order is voted on by all MSPs at a later date. Putting forward a motion to have the committee recommend the move to parliament, Mr Mackay told its members that his plans would lead to a ""more progressive"" and ""fairer"" system of local taxation. Mr Wightman lodged an amendment to the finance secretary's motion to ""note concerns"" about the fact the council tax base has not been updated since 1991 and recognising the recommendation of the Commission on Local Tax Reform that ""the present council tax system must end."" Labour's Elaine Smith backed Mr Wightman, saying the committee should ""reflect the evidence"" heard from members. But SNP and Conservative members united against the amendment, with Tory Graham Simpson saying there ""isn't much point"" to adding it to the debate. Mr Simpson also opposed Mr Mackay's original motion, saying it represented a ""fundamental change"" to the way local services are funded, and undermined local accountability. The motion ultimately passed by four votes to two, with Ms Smith joining the three SNP members and Mr Wightman abstaining. The committee will now compile a report on the issue for parliament, while it will be down to the parliamentary bureau to decide if there needs to be a further chamber debate on the issue as well as a vote. The government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale's vote failed to register. Opposition members had successfully amended a government motion promoting its council tax reform strategy, changing the wording to condemn the approach as undermining local accountability. But the final vote on the amended motion was tied after Ms Dugdale's vote was not counted. Mr Wightman had also called for a revaluation of council tax bands during the committee debate, pointing out that the current bands were based on property values dating back to 1991. The Green MSP said he had a constituent whose flat was in band E, but was worth PS20,000 less than neighbouring flats in band B. Labour's Elaine Smith pointed out that some council tax payers weren't even born when the council tax values of their properties were determined. Mr Mackay said a ""costly"" revaluation would ""take time"" and could be a ""shock"" to many households - with some potentially facing ""astronomically high"" tax increases under a full revaluation. But he said the changes to bands were ""not the end of the story in terms of local tax [reform],"" saying the government was taking a ""balanced approach"" while seeking to ""make council tax more progressive."" The Scottish government has started the process of reforming local taxation following on from the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which called for a fairer, more transparent and progressive tax to fund local services. Opposition members have accused the government of ""tinkering"" with the system rather than making bold reforms. The Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands, but oppose the changes to bands E and F. But Labour and the Greens both want to see the ""hated"" council tax scrapped, with Labour repeatedly accusing the SNP of abandoning an earlier promise to do so.",1,753
"Hirst rose from humble beginnings in Leeds to become the UK's richest living artist, worth PS215m according to the Sunday Times' Rich List. Penguin Books has promised to push the book in the same ""radical"" manner as Morrissey's autobiography, which was published under its classic imprint. The artist has selected journalist James Fox as his ghostwriter. Fox was the writer behind Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards' autobiography, as well as the book White Mischief, which recounted the Happy Valley murder case in Kenya in 1941. Hirst was one of the founding members of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement, which also counted Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas and Mark Wallinger amongst its numbers. Many of them were students at Goldsmiths College in London in the late 1980s. Their first major exhibition, in a warehouse, attracted a number of influential art collectors, including Charles Saatchi - who would later become one of his Hirst's greatest supporters. Hirst's work - which includes spot paintings and a sheep and shark preserved in formaldehyde - has frequently had the ability to shock. A two-day auction of his work in 2008 raised a record-breaking PS111m. Speaking on the Today programme, Fox said: ""He (Hirst) grew up in a pretty bad situation, with his mother, and he and his gang - many of whom became YBA artists, spent half their time housebreaking, stealing, [indulging in] criminality, and the rest of their time indulging their passion for art, which started very early on in their years. ""I found that completely fascinating, moving, the idea of a saving connection to art. The fearlessness of Damien, his ability to take on authority, to never say anything can't be done, to break all the rules. That very much comes from that background.""",1,754
"They were arrested last week by police investigating dissident republican activity in the area. Three men, aged 22, 24 and 46, have been charged with targeting a former member of the security forces in the Craigavon area. A fourth, aged 22, has been charged with the attempted murder of police officers. He is also charged with possessing explosives with intent to endanger life on 31 August in Lurgan. The men will appear at Craigavon Magistrates Court on Tuesday. A 22-year-old man arrested last Thursday as part of the same investigation was released unconditionally over the weekend. Police, who described the device as ""potentially lethal,"" said it had been recovered during a large-scale police operation. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said: ""We are relieved and delighted to have taken an extremely dangerous explosive device out of circulation. ""Our experience of these devices in Northern Ireland has been that they have been used to try to kill police officers."" ACC Kerr said the device had been located in a derelict house in a residential area close to people's homes. ""Those responsible have absolutely no regard for the local community, or indeed any community,"" he said. ""I would also like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding during the disruption of search activity in recent days. Our primary aim has been community safety.""",1,755
"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. ""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. ""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. ""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want... Nuer. They don't want them."" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said. ""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed."" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. ""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. ""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides."" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. ""War, war, war,"" she began, ""who are you and where do you come from?"" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. ""You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan."" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Serena, 35, won 6-4 6-4 to pass Steffi Graf in the all-time list of major winners since the Grand Slams accepted professional players in 1968. The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber. Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles. ""Congratulations Serena on number 23,"" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. ""I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win. ""I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love."" Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: ""There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration. ""She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too."" Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation. She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2. It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting. The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve. In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances. She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3. The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically. There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide. Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals. Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009. ""No, because I guess I've been here before, ""she said. ""I really enjoy seeing the name'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing."" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne. The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court. Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could ""shatter"" before her playing days are done. Billie Jean King on Twitter: Congrats serenawilliams on your 23rd major title and return to the top of the WTA rankings. You are a history maker and a trailblazer. Martina Navratilova on Twitter: unbelievable - Serena does it again - what an amazing record! Angelique Kerber on Twitter: Congrats to serenawilliams for this amazing achievement!!! What a historic final- both are true champions Venuseswilliams Pat Cash on Twitter: Serena Williams continues to make history with her 23 GS. Just amazing!

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 52 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 31. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened."" Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist. Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner. The shortlisted authors each receive PS2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. Coverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall. will be on the BBC News Channel from 2130 BST and on BBC Arts.",1,760
"As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: ""He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist."" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a ""mass-casualty"" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet cafe near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the ""Hi Buddy"" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: ""I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates."" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as ""hostile reconnaissance."" He said: ""That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed... that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches."" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: ""It would have potentially been bigger than the 77 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets."" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. Det Supt Smith said the relief he felt at the time of the arrests continued today. ""Every day since that time I've thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn't detain him. ""I've always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester.""",1,761
"Jimmy Carlson, 64, from Islington, north London, has been appointed OBE for helping to improve services. The former alcoholic became homeless after he was discharged from the Army. Doctor Daniel Moynihan, who runs 13 academies across London, has been knighted, while Emma Colyer has been appointed MBE for charity work. Mr Carlson served with the Royal Pioneer Corps (RPC) - which later became part of the Royal Logistic Corps - for five years. When he was discharged in 1973, he became an alcoholic and lived rough on the streets and in hostels until 1996 when he stopped drinking. Since then he has worked with Groundswell, a self-help organisation for the homeless, and has also helped to bring homeless people together with government ministers. Mr Carlson has also raised PS100,000 for The Haven, a club where people in recovery from substance misuse can meet in an alcohol and drug-free environment. He said he was humbled to receive the honour. ""I have been to the very bottom and never would have imagined this day then. ""Lots of people have helped me on the way and I can only hope that my story can inspire others - the same way I have been helped."" He added: ""My message is,'never give up on anyone'. You would have walked over me in the street 15 years ago and thought I was a lost cause, just another drunk. ""However, I picked myself up and turned my life around and I have gone on to make a decent contribution to my community."" Metropolitan Police PC Mark Edwards, who helped raise more than PS350,000 for terminally ill children, has been appointed an MBE. PC Edwards ran a series of marathons in New York and took on other challenges to help raise money for Jack Brown, the seven-year-old son of two of his colleagues, who needed specialist treatment in New York. Jack, who suffered from neuroblastoma, died in 2009, but the officer has continued to raise funds for children with cancer. He said: ""When my wife told me I'd got an MBE I nearly fell off my chair. This award is for the whole team who has helped raise the money - not just me."" A 74-year-old woman, Jane Warwick, also received an MBE for what the Met described as her ""tireless work alongside police"" in Lambeth to help set up a firearms and knives amnesty in 1995, which was ""incredibly successful."" Others honoured include Ruth Owen, from the Victoria-based charity Whizz Kidz, who has been appointed OBE; Paul Elliot MBE now becomes a CBE for services to equality and diversity in football while Maxine Room, principal of Lewisham College, is appointed CBE for her work in education.",1,762
"Angus Carpenter, of Liverpool, who has played in the city centre for more than 30 years, denied three counts of fraud. The 62-year-old was found guilty of one count when he played with a Hillsborough Justice Campaign banner draped on his bagpipes in April 2015. He was cleared of the two other counts by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court. Sgt Chris Gaynor told the court during the two day trial that Carpenter, from Woolton, gave the impression he was collecting cash for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. In his defence, Carpenter - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking. Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice. But he said he had made it clear he was not use it to collect funds for the charity. Carpenter told the court the banner was a tribute to the victims, not an attempt to deceive anyone. He also told the court he was a familiar face on match days at Anfield and known as a busker to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. He will be sentenced in January.",1,763
"The leak happened at the Worthy Farm site in Somerset in June 2014 and damaged water quality and killed fish. Founder Michael Eavis, who was at Yeovil Magistrates' Court, said the sewage was in a PS100,000 slurry tank. The Glastonbury Festival is one of the UK's biggest music events, with some 175,000 people attending each year. During the hearing, the judge was told that 42 fish were killed by the sewage after a ""large quantity"" of sewage filtered into Whitelake River. Sensors in the stream alerted the Environment Agency to increased ammonia levels. The court was told fish - including protected brown trout - died as a result. Glastonbury Festival 2014 admitted the single charge against it. Prosecuting, Kieran Martyn said: ""The impact was extensive.... It extended for at least 4km downstream."" Representing the festival, Kerry Gwyther, said the leak in the tank was a ""freak incident"" and not as serious as was being made out. ""We don't accept that it was a major incident as described by the agency,"" he said. ""The leak period was eight hours. We do accept that there was a significant effect on water quality and the fish health. ""Significant costs were not incurred in terms of a clean up."" The case has now been adjourned while both parties put together more detailed background reports. Outside court Michael Eavis said: ""Of course, I'm exceedingly sorry for what's happened. ""We had a problem obviously - there were 200,000 people and we were storing slurry. ""It was a tank for holding farm slurry, but on this occasion we were using it for the festival sewage and it was starting to leak. ""It was a brand new build, it cost me PS100,000, so that's my defence."" Another issue yet to be decided is the seriousness of the breach. If it is a category one offence, the festival would be in line for a fine of between PS55,000 to PS300,000 or, if it is deemed a category two the fine would be PS20,000. The defence team told the court any fine should be in line with the company's finances. They said the festival's net profit was PS84,000 a year before tax. But the prosecution said turnover was about PS37m. Mr Gwyther said the site donated PS2m in 2015 to a number of charities, including the Somerset Wildlife Trust and WaterAid. District Judge David Taylor said there was ""significant differences between one account to another"" and said there would be a four-day hearing to decide the facts before sentencing. Kasabian, Dolly Parton and Metallica headlined the festival in 2014.",1,764
"But when the last Labour government tried to bring them in the plan faced robust opposition, and the reintroduction of ID cards is not currently being considered by this government. Everyone, even children, had to carry an ID card during World War Two. Introduced in 1939 the idea was to enable the government to keep track of a transient population, displaced by bombs or evacuated from their homes. The wartime ID card system remained in place after 1945, eventually going out of use in the early 1950s. Labour revived the idea of a national identity card scheme at the start of the new century. David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary, outlined the plans in 2002. At the time the project had an estimated cost of up to PS3bn. He said the cards would ensure people did not work if they were not entitled to and did not ""draw on services which are free in this country, unless they are entitled to."" In March 2006 and after several defeats in the House of Lords, the Identity Cards Act became law and in November 2008 the roll-out of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals began. The scheme remained controversial and in 2009 a new Home Secretary, Alan Johnson said the cards would not be compulsory for UK citizens, however pilot schemes continued and at the end of 2009 people in Greater Manchester became the first in the UK to be able to buy a biometric ID card - at a cost of PS30. By the time of the 2010 General Election around 15,000 were thought to be in circulation, but Labour lost the election and the new coalition government scrapped the project. The cards were no longer valid and the national identity register, which held the personal details of everyone issued with an identity card, including photographs and fingerprint biometrics was destroyed in 2011. Various arguments have been put forward for and against the use of ID cards. Those in favour say they provide clarity for employers, are the only way to properly deal with illegal immigration and tackle both identity and benefit fraud. It has also been suggested they could help in the fight against terrorism. Those against ID cards point to the expense of bringing in any scheme, Labour's project is said to have cost PS5bn. Opponents also highlight the civil liberties concerns and what they believe is unnecessary data collection and intrusion by the state. In response to the recent scenes of thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK after crossing from North Africa and travelling through Europe, the deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet has said the UK should introduce ID cards (and employment controls). But there's still strong opposition to the idea here. The anti-ID cards pressure group NO2ID remains in existence and is withering about the deputy mayor's suggestion. NO2ID's General Secretary Guy Herbert disagrees with the deputy mayor: ""France has had ID cards for decades, but they have not stopped migrants coming to his town. ""In fact though coalition rhetoric was against the Blair government's centralised scheme, the UK makes lots of demands on people to produce ID in various forms in everyday life. This is getting steadily worse, but does not seem to have made much difference to people with strong motivations to come here."" And the deputy mayor of Calais is likely to be disappointed by the response from Britain's politicians too. The Shadow Immigration Minister David Hanson was in the Home Office when Labour introduced its scheme. When asked what he thought now about identity cards, he said: "" I felt they were a way in which we can at least track and identify individuals but that debate has moved on.... we're not going to introduce them in the near future given the capital and financial cost of doing that - what we need to do is to ensure that we have proper enforcement."" The Home Office also rejected the idea, a spokesperson said: ""The government has no plans to introduce ID cards in the UK."" Read more: Would Calais migrants really be better off in the UK?",1,765

"He died in a Dublin Hospital at 06:40 GMT on Friday. Fr Reid, 82, a member of the Redemptorist order, secretly acted as a conduit between the republican movement and the SDLP. He was one of the witnesses who confirmed the decommissioning of IRA weapons. In recent years, he was involved in talks with Basque nationalists seeking independence from Spain. In 1988, Fr Reid was pictured praying over the bodies of Army corporals Derek Wood and David Howes who had been dragged from their car, beaten and shot by the IRA. The corporals had inadvertently driven into the midst of a republican funeral in Belfast. The photograph of the bloodstained priest crouched praying over one of the soldiers was one of the starkest images of the Northern Ireland Troubles. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Fr Alec Reid's intervention to administer last rites epitomised his enormous faith and strength of conviction. ""His comfort was given amidst the enormous fears and tension on that terrible day in March 1988."" Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said Clonard monastery, Fr Reid's base in west Belfast during the Troubles, was ""the cradle of the peace process."" He told RTE Radio he was with Fr Reid on Thursday night in St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and had been due to visit him again on Friday. ""What Alec Reid did was, he lived the gospel message. He developed a view which was contrary to the official view, that there had to be dialogue, and he was tenacious."" Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, said: ""I heard with sadness of the death of Fr Reid. ""We all owe a debt of gratitude to him for the role he played in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland."" Former SDLP leader John Hume said Fr Reid was ""not simply a go between"" in the early days of negotiating for peace. ""He was an active player in fighting for an end to violence,"" Mr Hume said. ""Without his courage, determination and utter selflessness, the road to peace in our region would have been much longer and much more difficult to traverse. ""While we mourn the loss of a great man, we must also celebrate the legacy of peace and an opportunity to reconcile our people that he gave to us. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to waste."" Michael D Higgins, the president of Ireland, said: ""His ministering of the last rites to the two British corporals brutally killed in 1988 offered us an image of decency struggling to assert itself amidst brutality."" There were tears and tributes in west Belfast as news broke of the death of Fr Alec Reid. ""He should have got a Nobel Peace Prize,"" said one man. ""But maybe he turned it down. The only prize he wanted was peace."" One elderly woman, tears streaming down her face, said: ""He should be remembered with respect. ""He was someone who children should aspire to be like."" Fr Reid's funeral will take place at 12:00 GMT on Wednesday after requiem Mass in Clonard church in west Belfast.",1,767
"He said he hoped the treaty would help prevent the transfer of weapons to ""warlords, human rights abusers, terrorists and criminal organisations."" The deal also bans arms supplies if this promotes war crimes or genocide. So far 60 nations have ratified the accord, but not the US - the world's top arms exporter. Washington signed the agreement in 2013, but now it requires approval by the Senate, where opposition is believed to be strong. Other major weapons traders - like China, Russia, India and Pakistan - are yet to put their signatures under the deal. In a statement, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the treaty ""marks the opening of a new chapter in our collective efforts to bring responsibility, accountability and transparency to the global arms trade."" ""Ultimately, it attests to our collective determination to reduce human suffering by preventing the transfer or diversion of weapons to areas afflicted by armed conflict and violence."" Mr Ban also called on all countries to join the agreement ""without delay."" Other leading campaigners for a tighter regulation of the arms trade - such Amnesty International and the Control Arms Coalition - urged world governments to strictly adhere to the treaty's principles. The accord has been signed by nearly 130 nations, and five of the world's top 10 arms producers - Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain - have already ratified it. The accord regulates cross-border transfers of conventional weapons ranging from small firearms to tanks and artillery. The global business is estimated to generate up to 85bn (PS55bn) every year, although some analysts say the figure is even higher.",1,768
"Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on. Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. ""There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,"" he says. ""The chat room is like the foyer of a church."" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. ""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker. ""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity."" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says. ""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. ""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible.... and those stories help to light up the world."" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious."" After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. ""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly."" ""Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,"" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. ""He was a great communicator."" Sounds like a seal of approval to me.",1,769
"US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings. In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology. In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings. The so-called ""golden triangle"" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations. Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10. Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of ""excellent universities."" Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia. 1. California Institute of Technology 2. Harvard University 2. University of Oxford 4. Stanford University 5. Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6. Princeton University 7. University of Cambridge 8. University of California, Berkeley 9. University of Chicago 10. Imperial College London 11. Yale University 12. University of California, Los Angeles 13. Columbia University 14.

University of Toronto Source: Times Higher Education World University Rankings But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away. Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals. However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the ""Richard III effect,"" after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king. This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that ""power is draining from the UK regions."" The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology. The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20. ""No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily,"" said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place. ""There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures."" ""It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate."" Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had ""the second-strongest university system in the world after the US."" ""What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness.""",1,770
"The X-47B jet is being designed by weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman for the US Navy. It was in the air for 29 minutes during its maiden flight and reached an altitude of 5,000 feet. Officials say it will help form part of a new generation of unmanned drones and works like a smaller version of the B-2 Stealth Bomber. As such it would be very different from the current fleet of remote controlled military planes like the Predator and Reaper. Instead the X-47B would be virtually invisible to radar and fly at much faster speeds than those older, propeller driven machines. In a statement Captain Jaime Engdahl, a programme manager for the warplane, said: ""Today we got a glimpse towards the future as the Navy's first-ever tailless, jet-powered unmanned aircraft took to the skies."" The flight was primarily designed to test the jet's guidance and navigation systems and the aerodynamic control of the tailless design. It was controlled from the ground by a joint team of the company's engineers and Navy specialists. Northrop is building the bomber as part of a PS395 million contract signed in 2007. Janis Pamiljans is vice-president of Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems sector. ""Designing a tailless, fighter-sized unmanned aircraft from a clean sheet is no small feat. ""Commitment, collaboration and uncompromising technical excellence among the Navy [and] Northrop Grumman made today's flight a reality. ""We are indeed honoured to have given wings to the Navy's vision for exploring unmanned carrier aviation."" Although it will be several years before the X-47B is ready for operations officials say it should have its first test flight from an aircraft carrier in 2013.

"About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with the French consulate in London. Marie Brousseau-Navarro, the Honorary Consul of France in Cardiff, said messages of support had been touching. She said: ""We are united in shock and united in sorrow.... And united with all the people who have marched across the world."" Saleem Kidwai, chairman of the Muslim Council of Wales was applauded by the crowd as he told them to ""stand together shoulder to shoulder."" ""My condemnation is absolute,"" he said. ""We will eventually win and truth wins over falsehood and light over darkness."" First Minister Carwyn Jones was among the many to hold up a candle for the silence, while others held up pencils. The silence was marked at the end by an applause. Earlier, he said: ""The vigil in Cardiff Bay tonight is an opportunity for the people of Wales to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the truly abhorrent attack in Paris. ""It is also a chance to show solidarity with the people of France and all those who believe in upholding our democratic values and freedoms that are threatened by such senseless acts of terror.""

"Ken Dickie, 64, died in hospital on 14 May, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole. Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother. He shouted ""yes"" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court. The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a ""down phase"" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May. In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got ""tanked up"" on alcohol. The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public. Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight. He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events. The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back. But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a ""tragic accident."" The pair will be sentenced on 6 February.",1,774
"The case had been brought by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which formerly owned the transfer rights to the 24-year-old forward. The company claimed it was short-changed when Neymar transferred from Brazilian club Santos to Barcelona in 2013. Neymar and his father, who acts as his agent, have both denied any wrongdoing. In a separate case, Barcelona was forced to pay a fine of 5.5m euros (6.1m; PS4.7m) last month because of tax irregularities in Neymar's transfer from Santos. Since moving to the Nou Camp, he has won two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, the Champions League, the European Super Cup, the Spanish Super Cup and the Club World Cup.

"But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over? Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe. He said: ""We are an unknown entity, and the bigger teams are definitely underestimating us like the big fish did in the Premier League last season. ""Getting to the semis would be remarkable. However, the drastic difference between the Champions League and Premier League form is unacceptable."" But even if the Foxes are not quite living up to expectations on the pitch, Richard III has helped keep the city buzzing. Amy Gray, head of tourism affairs at VisitBritain, said: ""Money can't buy the publicity - the sort of publicity Leicester has got. ""We saw a 17 increase in international visitors to the East Midlands for April to June. ""What we've seen in Leicester is a fantastic heritage story and a fantastic sports story - and we know both are a fantastic draw to international visitors."" Source: Leicester Cathedral Eloic Montagnier, general manager of Leicester's Belmont Hotel, believes interest in other Leicester destinations - such as the National Space Centre after Tim Peake's expedition - has also contributed to the city's success. He said: ""We have done over 80 [occupancy] for the last year. ""It was fantastic in November, with 85 occupancy for the month - it was 65 two years ago. ""I think this is a great opportunity to grow the city and I think it will keep going - I don't see the success dropping off any time soon. ""Football has brought a lot of people in who may never have even considered coming to Leicester."" But others aren't quite so bullish about the future. Vito Ferro's San Carlo restaurant has become something of a tourist hotspot after it held a celebratory meal for the Leicester City players the day after the title was won. Despite an initial surge in bookings, Mr Ferro believes it will wear off eventually. ""It is too soon to say [whether things will quieten down] because they are in the Champions League,"" he said. ""But I would say, yes, things are eventually going to quieten down unless something else happens."" So, as Leicester looks ahead to 2017, will good things come in threes with Champions League glory for the Foxes? Or will the city simply have to accept that ""two out of three ain't bad""?

"Media playback is not supported on this device The 30-year-old London 2012 gold medallist recorded 8.18m in his final jump to win ahead of Uruguay's Emiliano Lasa (7.96m). Holly Bradshaw set a new British women's pole vault record of 4.80m. There was a minute's silence before the event for the victims of Monday's attack in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and another 116 were injured by a suicide bomber as the crowd left a performance by US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The Great City Games, which is staged in the city centre, was given the go-ahead by council and police on Tuesday. The Great Manchester Run will also go ahead this Sunday and will be covered on BBC One from 12:30-14:30 BST. Friday's competition was the first major event in Manchester since the attack and drew thousands to a sunny Deansgate and Albert Square. The latter, which three days ago hosted a vigil for those who lost their lives in the attack, was the scene for a stellar display from Rutherford. His jump of 8.08m in his second attempt had already ensured victory before his final effort, which saw him extend his lead further. ""It's been absolutely amazing to get you all out here in support of us,"" said Rutherford afterwards. ""It's been an incredibly difficult week for everybody and I'm so pleased we can come here and give you something to smile about and enjoy. ""Manchester is one of my favourite cities in the world to go to. I love it for the football and I love it for all you guys getting behind us in sport. ""It truly is a special place."" Media playback is not supported on this device It was a superb evening for Bradshaw, who beat her own personal best before going on to surpass her own British record in the pole vault. Starting at 4.50m, the 25-year-old from Preston cleared at the third attempt to ensure victory over her rivals, with fellow Britons Rachel Gibbons and Sally Peake and Belgium's Chloe Henry all failing to go higher than 4m. She then went on to surpass the mark of 4.71m she set in 2012 before also clearing 4.80m at the first attempt. ""It was a bit nerve-wracking at the start,"" Bradshaw, who was sixth at London 2012 and fifth four years later in Rio, told BBC Sport. ""But there were great conditions. Once I got in the zone, to jump 4.72 and then 4.80 I am really chuffed. ""Training has been going great. I am in the best shape I have ever been in. I just need to stay healthy, keep sharp and build momentum going into the majors.""

""We had a massive shift on technical aspects last year and had just six months to get them right before the Olympics but we improved a lot,"" Peacock told BBC Sport. ""I still have a lot to improve.

Sophie Kamlish made it a British double in the event with victory in the T44 women's 100m, beating Dutch three-time Paralympic gold medallist Marlou van Rhijn by 0.02secs in a time of 13.24. On the specially laid track on Deansgate, Asha Philip pipped Australian Sally Pearson to the win the women's 100m in a time of 11.48secs. Pearson made up for that disappointment by winning the final race of the evening - the 100m hurdles - in 12.81secs. Another Briton, James Dasaolu, clocked 10.25 to take the men's 100m after 41-year-old Kim Collins, who claimed gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, pulled up with cramp. American Johnny Dutch, who was coaxed out of retirement last year, impressed in the men's 200m hurdles with a time of 22.48secs, comfortably beating a British trio led by Sebastian Rodger (22.89). There was a surprise result in the men's 150m as Greece's Lykourgos-Stefanos Tsakonas claimed a personal best of 15.04secs to see off the challenge of Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who also ran a PB of 15.22.

"The Dundee-based company said shareholders had wanted changes to be made to improve performance. Chief financial officer Alan Trotter is to leave Alliance Trust, while chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox is to step down from the board. The financial services company's share price rose when trading opened following the announcement. Alliance Trust had been facing demands for a change in governance from US-based activist investor Elliott Advisers. The firm aims to simplify its structures and reduce costs by PS6m per year by the end of 2016, although details of staff cuts or other efficiency measures have not been announced. Ms Garrett-Cox leaving the board means it now consists solely of non-executive directors, making it fully independent. In a letter to shareholders, chairman Karin Forseke said the changes would take effect ""as soon as practicable,"" and no later than March 2016. She said: ""The actions we have announced represent some of the biggest changes in our history, and are designed to further improve shareholder value. ""Implementation will require considerable further work by the team, but we believe that as a result Alliance Trust will be significantly better positioned for the future."" Managers at Alliance Trust, the venerable Dundee finance house, have been under siege for years. Having had to sue for peace earlier this year, the terms are now clearer, and they mean a radical change of direction. A cut in costs of 20 will feel painful at the Tayside headquarters. Non-core assets are being sold, and new benchmarks are being set, with regular overviews to check how management of the fund performs against the market. They've been ahead of their benchmark since last year, but if they don't perform adequately in future, the board members brought on by activist investors will re-consider the decision not to contract out fund management to another company. The scale of the change to the Trust's strategy, and the clipping of senior executives' influence, by removing them from the board, is such that you might expect the resignations of chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox andor chairwoman Karin Forseke. However, this follows consultation with the full range of shareholders, and the long-term smaller ones may see the current bosses as their best protection against short-term profit-taking. With lead activist investor Elliot Advisers upping its stake recently, this is an uneasy-looking settlement.",1,778
"Melissa Reid, 22, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, was arrested with Michaella McCollum, of Co Tyrone, after being caught with 24lb (11kg) of cocaine at Lima airport in 2013. They struck a plea deal for a reduced sentence of six years and eight months. Reid, who was expelled from Peru under an early release scheme, arrived at Glasgow Airport on Wednesday evening. She touched down in Glasgow at 21:44 after travelling from Lima, via Amsterdam, with her father William. She did not appear before waiting media at the international arrivals area, and is thought to have accepted an airside transfer. It is understood that Reid will not have a criminal record in the UK as a result of her Peruvian conviction. Any offences she committed in the UK before she became a drugs mule would remain. McCollum, 23, was released at the end of March under parole conditions which mean that she has to remain in Peru for an undisclosed period of time. Reid has served about a third of her sentence and under Peruvian law was eligible to be deported according to the early release scheme for foreign prisoners. She has also paid a fine of 10,000 Peruvian soles, just over PS2,000. A spokeswoman for Peru's prison service, Janeth Sanchez, said Reid ""served her time in prison according to the law and can now go to her country, free."" A Scottish Prison Service spokeswoman confirmed it was not involved with Reid's case. Both Reid and McCollum were caught with an estimated PS1.5m-worth of cocaine at Lima airport on 6 August 2013 while attempting to board a flight to Madrid, in Spain. The cocaine was discovered in food packets hidden inside their luggage. They had initially claimed they were forced to carry the drugs, but pleaded guilty to charges later that year. They had faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind closed doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence. Following her release, McCollum told the Irish broadcaster RTE she had been ""very naive, so young and very insecure."" Reid's father William has previously said the impact of his daughter's imprisonment on his family had been ""horrendous."" A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: ""We continue to provide assistance to Melissa Reid and remain in contact with her family and local authorities.""",1,779
"Under anti-tax avoidance rules, if someone's tax arrangements are found to be ""abusive"" they must pay back the tax they have avoided. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged a ""genuine deterrent"" by making them liable to pay the same amount again. A Tory spokesman said it was ""feeble stuff"" and Labour had no economic plan. Tax avoidance, unlike tax evasion, is not illegal. Ministers have said it involves ""compliance with the letter but not the spirit of the law."" In recent years it emerged that companies and individuals had been greatly reducing their liabilities by making use of legal tax shelter schemes. Meanwhile the ""tax gap"" - the difference between the amount of tax owed and collected - rose to PS34bn in the year to April 2013. The government's so-called general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) came into force in July 2013, after Chancellor George Osborne described aggressive tax avoidance - as well as illegal tax evasion - as ""morally repugnant."" It aimed to ""deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements, and to deter would-be promoters from promoting such arrangements."" The rule is a broad set of principles designed to prevent tax avoidance, to avoid having constantly to introduce new legislation to tackle individual loopholes. Labour has previously said it would increase transparency in the tax system and prevent dormant companies from trading without paying tax. It has pledged to use some of the money raised from a tax avoidance crackdown for its PS2.5bn NHS funding pledge. Mr Balls said Labour had supported the introduction of the anti-abuse rule, but said it was ""without teeth."" He said: ""Those who are caught have to repay the tax they tried to avoid, but they do not face a penalty. There is still no disincentive to try and game the system. That is why Labour will bring in a tough penalty regime.... with fines of up to 100 of the value of the tax which was avoided. ""For the first time this will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax."" The shadow chancellor said aggressive tax avoiders should be treated the same as people who cheat the welfare system. He added: ""Through measures such as this we can ensure that no-one pays zero tax at the top so we can get the deficit down fairly, invest in our NHS, and maintain public support for the dynamic open economy we need."" The proposals were backed by leading chartered accountant and tax-reform campaigner Richard Murphy, who was a member of the panel which helped draw up the anti-abuse rules. ""Without such a regime, the GAAR is a toothless tiger providing, at best, Revenue and Customs with the chance to ask those found in default to play by the rules in future,"" Mr Murphy, who is an adviser to the Trades Union Congress and the Unite union - Labour's largest financial backer - said. ""With significant penalties attached, the GAAR becomes a more potent threat and, regrettably, in the face of ongoing tax abuse, Revenue and Customs needs as many of those as it can get."" However, a Conservative spokesman said Labour leader Ed Miliband had been at the heart of former prime minister Gordon Brown's Treasury as ""year after year"" they broke promises to deal with tax avoidance. ""If Ed thinks empty promises like this will get him into Downing Street, it's no wonder his own party are lining up to criticise his weak and ineffective leadership,"" the spokesman added.",1,780
"Researchers followed nearly 240,000 Swedish men for 35 years. The analysis, published in the journal Gut, showed overweight teenagers went on to have twice the risk of bowel cancer. The figures were even higher in obese teens. The World Cancer Research Fund said the link between obesity and cancer was ""strong."" Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, with nearly 1.4 million new cases each year. Processed red meat and abdominal fat have been linked to the disease. The participants in the study were aged between 16 and 20 at the start. The overwhelming majority were a normal weight, but 6.5 were overweight and 1 were obese. There were 855 cases of colorectal cancer in the study. However, the results showed not all weights were affected equally. Those who were obese were 2.38 times more likely to have developed a bowel tumour. The study, led by Orebro University Hospital in Sweden and Harvard University, said: ""Late adolescence marks the transition from childhood to adulthood and is a period of accelerated growth, especially among men, thus this period may represent a critical window."" ""It is important that we understand the role of exposures in childhood and adolescence in the development of colorectal cancer. ""In fact, the strong association observed between adolescent obesity and early-to-mid-life colorectal cancer, coupled with the increasing prevalence of adolescent obesity, may shed light on the increase in colorectal cancer incidence among young adults,"" he added. Rachel Thompson, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said the evidence suggested that obesity was a risk factor for bowel cancer. ""This finding is interesting because it gives an indication that bowel cancer risk might be affected by our lifestyle habits throughout the life course,"" she said. ""In some ways, research into the relationship between factors like obesity and cancer risk is still in its infancy. ""It will be interesting to see if further research emerges in the future to back up the apparent relationship between body fatness in youth and later-life cancer risk.""",1,781

"Government limits to teachers' pay and ""real terms cuts"" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. ""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB), which sets their pay. The government said it was attracting ""the best and brightest"" to teaching. Teachers' pay increases have been limited to 1 or less for the past five years, and the government aims to keep to this limit for the next four years. With long, hard working hours and a relatively low starting salary for a graduate, it is hardly surprising that teacher recruitment is struggling. Qualified teachers in England can expect to start on PS22,000 outside London or PS27,000 in inner London. In most cases, this is after post-graduate training, a year's school placement and a degree course. And although there is room for growth and progression - based on performance of course - many newly-qualified teachers find the pressures of the job too much and leave soon after taking their first post. Teachers in England have some of the longest hours and largest classes in the developed world, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Teaching unions have complained that although their staff were promised a 1 pay rise, this has had to be found from within existing school budgets. Head teachers say school budgets are already at breaking point as they struggle to deal with other inflationary pressures. But the DfE maintains new trainees can benefit from financial support, a good salary, enviable job security and a generous pension. In October, England's education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wrote to the STRB to remind them of this policy. But the joint statement warns that ""as pay and prospects improve in comparable occupations,"" further pressure will be placed on teacher recruitment and retention. This means more children will be taught by teachers who are not specialist in the subjects they teach, it adds. With budgets ""at breaking point,"" schools will struggle to maintain current spending - ""let alone afford pay increases,"" it continues. ""The government must fully fund the necessary pay increases for teachers and school leaders in both England and Wales."" The six unions are: Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, described four more years of pay austerity as a ""false economy."" Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers ""are already leaving in droves and new graduates looking elsewhere for a career."" Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, claimed 160,000 more teachers would be needed over three years to cope with a rapid increase in pupil numbers. But she warned unless the picture improved the government would have little chance of meeting this target. ""Schools will have to start increasing class sizes or shutting courses and cutting the subject options available to pupils."" And Elaine Edwards, UCAC's general secretary urged the government to reconsider its pay policies ""for the sake of our children and young people and the education system as a whole."" The STRB is expected to make its recommendations on teachers' pay in April. A Department for Education spokeswoman said it had worked with the profession to ""raise the status of teaching,"" adding that that a record number of highly-qualified graduates and ""experienced career changers"" were now teaching. She added: ""But we are determined to go further, and recognise that some schools find it harder to recruit the teachers they need, which is why we are expanding the great Teach First and Schools Direct programmes and we are launching the National Teaching Service, which will mean more great teachers in schools in every corner of the country.""",1,783
"The PS1.471bn spent shooting movies like Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2014 represents a 35 increase on 2013. Money spent on homegrown UK films also increased, with PS188m spent making films budgeted at PS500,000 and above. Box office takings, though, were down 2 on the previous year. Overall, 157.5 million tickets were sold, representing a 5 dip in attendances compared with 2013. Yet the BFI's figures show an increased market share for UK independent films, thanks in part to the box office success of Paddington and The Inbetweeners 2.

"Dave Walsh, president of Liverpool Trades Council, said the council should not be afraid of setting an illegal budget. He said: ""There's an old saying in the Labour movement,'better to break the law than the poor'. Vulnerable people in this city are going to be left without care."" But Mayor Joe Anderson said the council would set a legal budget. He said: ""This city was set back 30 years ago by people setting an illegal budget. There's two options, either set a legal budget or an illegal budget. ""I'm on the side of setting a legal budget - as tough as that is."" The council has rejected calls for the authority to ignore government spending targets and set an illegal budget. In the 1980s, Liverpool's Labour-controlled council set an illegal budget which led to the banning of and surcharge of 47 councillors. The council has to save PS156m over the next three years, on top of PS173m worth of cuts over the last three years. The latest financial position shows that Liverpool City Council will have to save PS45m in 2014-15, PS63m in 2015-16 and PS48m in 2016-17.

"Ryan Morse, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, died on 8 December 2012 from undiagnosed Addison's disease. Dr Leonard Peter told Cardiff Crown Court Dr Joanne Rudling, of Cardiff, did not ask enough questions about Ryan's condition hours before he died. She and Dr Lindsey Thomas, 42, of Tredegar, deny manslaughter. Dr Peter, who has worked as a GP for 41 years, told the court 46-year-old Dr Rudling, one of his GPs, should have shown more curiosity about Ryan's state. Zoe Johnson, defending Dr Rudling, put it to Dr Peter that medical notes suggested Ryan was ""feeling a bit better from a temperature point of view"" the day before he died, but still suffering from sickness and diarrhoea. She said Dr Rudling had offered him the chance to see a male doctor on Monday after she was told of a change in the colour of Ryan's genitalia, something she felt was a symptom of puberty.

"Australia's foreign minister said these were ""not the actions of a friend."" The UK took similar action in March, after concluding that Israel was responsible for the use of forged UK passports in the plot. The Israeli foreign ministry said Australia's decision was disappointing. Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said it was ""not in line with the importance and the quality of the relationship between our countries."" At least four forged Australian passports were used in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January. The originals belonged to Australians living in Israel. The Australian government said a police investigation had left it in no doubt that the Israeli authorities were behind ""the abuse and counterfeiting of the passports."" As a result Foreign Minister Stephen Smith asked Israel to withdraw a diplomat, whom he did not identify ""The decision to ask Israel to remove from Australia one of its officers at the Israeli embassy in Canberra is not something which fills the Australian government with any joy,"" he said. ""On the contrary, the decision was made much more in sorrow than in anger."" Passports from France, Ireland, Germany and Britain were used in the operation, and in March, the British government expelled an Israeli diplomat from London. The Israeli government has said there is no proof that it was behind the killing, although Dubai officials have said they are 99.9 sure that agents from Mossad were responsible.",1,790
"The unmanned cargo ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday, but contact was lost with it soon afterwards. Russia's space agency says Progress M-27M is now orbiting in an uncontrolled spin. It cannot reach the ISS and is likely to break up on re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The craft carried on to a higher orbit after contact was lost. Igor Komarov, the head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said: ""The craft's continued flight and its docking with the ISS is not possible."" Two astronauts spending a year on the ISS, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, told the Associated Press news agency that flight controllers had given up hope of controlling Progress again. Progress is likely to re-enter Earth's atmosphere some time between 5 and 7 May. Other capsules - including one Progress craft last year - have burned up and disintegrated on re-entering Earth's atmosphere without posing a threat to the planet's population. Cathleen Lewis, a specialist in Russian space programmes at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said it was not yet known where debris will fall - but that it was highly unlikely to hit urban areas. ""I always remind people that two-thirds of Earth's surface is water,"" she said. ""The likelihood of it coming down and hitting someone is so remote as to be minuscule."" The problem with the loss of the Progress is that it puts further pressure on the volume of stores held on the space station. ISS managers like to keep a good six months' supply of food, water, fuel and other resources in reserve at all times. Currently, however, this volume is somewhat depleted - in part because of the explosion on launch last year of the American Cygnus freighter. The responsibility for keeping the stores topped up leans heavily on Progress and the second American freighter, Dragon. The latter is due to make its next supply run in June. As long as it keeps working well, ISS officials in Houston and Moscow will not be unduly concerned. If, for some reason, supplies did become marginal, the space agencies would simply reduce the size of the normal six-person crew until matters could be improved. Progress was to deliver food, water, fuel, oxygen and clothing to the crew of six people on the space station that orbits about 420km (250 miles) above Earth. Even after Progress' loss, the astronauts have enough supplies to keep them going until the next expected delivery on 19 June. A Roscosmos spokesman told Reuters that the loss was valued at 2.59 billion roubles (50.7m, PS32.9m).",1,791

"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday. It aims to address a potential funding gap of PS908m in the area by 2021. Councillor Andy Moorhead said Liverpool City Region ""will not support"" the plan, which was ""completed in secrecy."" Louise Shepherd, who is chief executive of Alder Hey Children's Hospital and led the work, said the hospitals have been ""talking together for over three years about what they can do better together."" The hospitals ""said their intention would be to try and bring the two organisations together,"" Ms Shepherd said, but ""what that actually means for services is still to be determined."" The plan suggests merging the Royal, Aintree and Liverpool Women's Hospital into one new trust by April 2018 - but also ""reconfiguring"" the women's hospital by 2021. ""New models of AE,"" which could mean reduced opening hours, are also being considered at Southport and Ormskirk Trust, which runs Southport and Formby Hospital AE - rated inadequate on Tuesday by the health watchdog. Mr Moorhead, in charge of health, wellbeing and social care for the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, said ""any decisions by the NHS to reconfigure hospitals"" should ""be the subject of transparent and open debate"" and ""have the support of local communities and NHS staff.... this has just not happened."" Shadow health minister and Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston Justin Madders said the process has been ""completely lacking in transparency and accountability"" and ""mired in confusion.""

Merseyside and Cheshire is the second largest, incorporating Knowsley, Sefton, Liverpool, Halton, St Helens, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Warrington, Wirral. Labour MP for Wallasey Angela Eagle said Wirral seems to be ""particularly hard hit"" and the plan ""seems to be more about meeting the deficit than actually looking at what kind of health services we need.""

"Doctors realised Maia Collingswood needed the transplant after her father Dan revealed he also had the procedure in 1997. Maia, from Barmouth, Gwynedd, had the transplant at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital in August after a three-month wait for a new heart. She has now been welcomed back to her school, Ysgol y Traeth. Maia, a year five pupil, fell ill at Easter while visiting her grandparents in Telford, Shropshire. ""Maia was out of breath and could not move,"" explained her mother, Hannah Carter. ""She was taken to the local hospital and then transferred to the Birmingham Children's Hospital where a heart problem was diagnosed."" But Maia's father said when he questioned doctors and revealed he had undergone a heart transplant, the medical team realised her condition was serious. She was transferred to the London Children's Hospital, where surgeons confirmed she also needed a heart transplant. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the next three months, until she finally received the donor heart she needed on 15 August. It was three months of desperate worry for her parents, who are are separated, but remain friends. The local community rallied around to ensure they could spend as much time as possible with their daughter in London. ""Dan's family, my family, the school, friends and indeed the whole community here in Barmouth and in Telford have been magnificent and supported us throughout the summer after Maia was taken ill,"" said Mrs Carter, who works for the Gwynedd home care team. Mr Collingswood, who works at a private care establishment near Dolgellau, added: ""I am with the local lifeboat here in Barmouth and the RNLI helped us out financially when we had to visit Maia in hospital in London. ""The community has been great, there were collection tins everywhere for Maia and it helped us out. We could not have managed without the support of the community."" On Tuesday, Maia was greeted by pupils and the head teacher as she returned to class, seven weeks ahead of schedule. ""Maia would have liked to have gone back to school last week but we had to travel to Great Ormond Street for check-ups,"" said her mother. ""She asked if she could go back to school after returning home from London and the expert medical team said that it was OK. Maia was delighted."" The long wait for the transplant meant Hannah's mother had to give up her flat in Barmouth to be with her daughter, but she has now moved into a new home with Maia after being rehoused by housing organisation Cartrefi Cymunedol Gwynedd. Mrs Carter added: ""I started back to work this week, Maia has started school, we have a new flat, it is all coming together. ""It has been a long and traumatic summer and without the support of family, friends and the community and the medical team, I don't know how I got through it."" Maia herself said she was delighted to be back in the classroom, and revealed how she had coped with her long stay in hospital. ""I used to talk to my school friends on Skype when I was in hospital in London and the headmaster visited me a couple of times."" She also had a number of special visitors while on the hospital wards. ""When I was in hospital I met the singer Adele, racing driver Lewis Hamilton, Alexandra Burke from the X Factor and two American astronauts, "" she said.",1,794
"Emmerson Whittel may need surgery on his jaw, while the club alleges player Josh Lynam was also bitten on the ear. The RFL's match review panel will look at official video on Thursday, as it does for all on-field incidents. Keighley have gathered additional video from spectators following an appeal. Footage already online, shot from the stands, shows a number of fights breaking out on the field between the two sets of players. Following the incident, Whittel posted on Twitter that brackets and bands had been used to try to re-align his jaw and that he faces at least three months out. Keighley Cougars of League One, England's third-tier competition, progressed to the Challenge Cup fourth round with a 50-32 win over Fryston Warriors - a side from the second tier of England's amateur game. The match, a ""home"" game for Fryston, was played at nearby Featherstone in West Yorkshire after the tie was at risk of being reversed and played at Keighley instead. Keighley have also complained to the RFL about their off-field treatment before kick-off, as they allege players and members of staff were refused entry to the ground without a valid matchday ticket. A statement on Keighley's website said: ""The players' allocation of'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground.

"Surprise frontrunner Francois Fillon said his project was ""more radical,"" and vowed to implement sweeping changes in the first three months of his term. Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were ""deep and credible"" but lacked the ""brutality"" of Mr Fillon's plans. It was the final Republicans party debate before Sunday's concluding vote. The Republicans candidate is widely expected to face far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote in the presidential election next May. Self-declared supporters of the centre-right values are choosing between the two former prime ministers. It is the party's first such primary vote, modelled on the US system. Seven candidates were whittled down to two last Sunday, with Mr Fillon taking an unexpectedly decisive lead of 44.1 to Mr Juppe's 28.5. Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France's conservatives Press review: France's'Mr Nobody' Francois Fillon Fillon under fire over women's rights The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon's social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when he questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71 of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57 of viewers of all political stripes. ""It is true that my project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,"" said Mr Fillon. His controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35-hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least a'!100bn (PS85bn; 106bn). ""I've got a plan for the reforms I want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and I'm convinced if we don't get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, they'll turn away from politics, and then there'll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,"" Mr Fillon said. The country was ""on the brink of revolt,"" which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate ""eased tensions on the right"" and showed the two contenders ""have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects"" - in particular the need to end the ""vicious cycle of spending and debt."" They have ""some differences on security, education and migration, but they are minor,"" concludes its political editor. But centre-left Le Monde's political correspondent disagrees, seeing ""significant differences"" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to ""respect the sovereignty"" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a ""powerful EU as a future world power."" On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France ""back in play"" by ""opening a channel to Damascus,"" whereas Mr Juppe wants to ""boost transatlantic co-operation"" and takes a firm line against President Bashar al-Assad, Le Monde says. Left-wing Liberation writes that the debate between ""Fillon the radical and Juppe the reconciler"" was ""knotty, often tense, but not aggressive."" It thought Mr Juppe managed to score points over his opponent on some issues, but ""not enough to trouble the winner of the first round.""

"The man, named by state media as Ji Zhongxing, 34, from central Shandong province, was injured and taken to hospital. No-one else was hurt in the blast, which filled part of the Terminal 3 arrivals hall with smoke. An online microblog attributed to the man says the explosion was to protest at his ill-treatment by Chinese police. The blog suggests his lower body was paralyzed after he was alleged to have been heavily beaten by security agents in southern China in 2005. Mr Ji, who is alleged to have been operating an unlicensed motorbike taxi service, was also apparently dissatisfied with the way his complaints against the authorities had been dealt with. State news agency Xinhua said he detonated the device - a package of gunpowder taken from fireworks - after being prevented from distributing leaflets. Photos posted on China's Weibo microblogging site showed a dark-haired man waving a white package in the air before the explosion. Later images from the airport showed the wheelchair on its side with officials treating him on the floor. Smoke drifted through the terminal after the blast, which occurred shortly before 18:30 (10:30 GMT) near one of the arrival gates. Xinhua showed several medical workers providing emergency treatment, with police officers also at the scene. Officials say order has been restored at the airport and there is no disruption to flights.",1,797
"Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common practice of having a single leader running the company. Crisp then tried changing its chief executive annually, based on a staff vote, but eventually decided collectively that no boss was needed. Yassal Sundman, a developer at the firm, explains: ""We said,'what if we had nobody as our next CEO - what would that look like?' And then we went through an exercise and listed down the things that the CEO does."" The staff decided that many of the chief executive's responsibilities overlapped with those of the board, while other roles could be shared among other employees. ""When we looked at it we had nothing left in the CEO column, and we said,'all right, why don't we try it out? says Ms Sundman. Crisp holds four-day meetings for all staff two to three times a year. They are used to making decisions on issues that affect everyone, such as an office move, but workers are encouraged to make decisions themselves at other times. It also still has a board - a legal requirement - and this can be used as a last resort to resolve issues if something is not working. Henrik Kniberg, an organisational coach at the firm, argues that not having to ask a boss for decisions on projects or budgets means the firm can respond faster. ""If you want to get something done, you stand up and start driving that,"" he says. Yet Mr Kniberg stresses that not having to ask permission does not remove the need for staff to discuss issues or bounce ideas off each other. Because they are all in charge, workers are more motivated, he argues. Crisp regularly measures staff satisfaction, and the average is about 4.1 out of five. The company is set up like a family, says Mr Kniberg. While nobody tells anyone exactly what to do, the unspoken understanding is that you don't mess up the house. But what if the rest of the staff feel that one worker has made a terrible decision? Ms Sundman says that is okay. ""At least you did the thing that was right in the moment - and then we can have a discussion about it. You can explain why it is that you thought this was a good way, and actually you might get everybody else to think the same way."" Ultimately, the firm hopes that its way of working could inspire other companies to emulate the ""Crisp DNA."" Although Crisp's move may seem radical, plenty of companies have trialled a similar arrangement. One of the best-known is online shoe and clothing retailer Zappos, which is owned by Amazon. In 2013 the firm adopted a new management structure called ""holacracy,"" which was intended to eliminate workplace hierarchy and foster collaboration. However, almost a fifth of Zappos staff subsequently departed, with chief executive Tony Hsieh admitting that ""self-management is not for everyone."" While there is a growing trend for flatter organisational structures - meaning fewer middle managers and bosses - most of the more radical experiments are taking place in small start-ups. As well as employing fewer people, such firms do not have the long corporate history that can make major changes much more difficult to implement. Drew Houston, founder of online file-sharing service Dropbox, does not believe a leaderless structure can work in larger firms because it would be too chaotic. The main risk, he says, is that staff will encroach into each other's areas of responsibility, making them less efficient. ""Often infinite freedom like that can be pretty disorientating. It doesn't always feel good, because you no longer know what you're supposed to do, what's important and you're bumping up against other people,"" Mr Houston says. Similarly, Meg Whitman, chief executive of technology giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), firmly believes that companies need a leader. ""You've got to have the accountability, because if people in your organisation don't know what they're doing and how it affects the customers, then you've got a disconnect problem,"" she says. However, HPE has tackled one problem that hinders many big companies: the time it takes to make decisions. ""We tended to let decisions sit for way too long a time,"" Ms Whitman says. ""So we now have a little saying at Hewlett Packard Enterprise: you've got to escalate a decision or a challenge and you have to resolve it in 48 hours."" CEO coach and author Steve Tappin says even if firms are sceptical of companies that don't have a single boss, it is worth paying attention to the likes of Crisp. ""Many businesses may not want to go as far as getting rid of their chief executive, but there are valid lessons to be learnt from radical companies like Crisp,"" he says. This feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin, and by series producer Neil Koenig, for the BBC's CEO Guru series.",1,798
"The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 as it tried to ensure the stability of the UK's banking system in the aftermath of the June Brexit referendum vote. That was the first rate cut since 2009. But the Bank said again that it might cut rates further in the coming months, even though the immediate economic after-shock of the Brexit vote now appears to be weaker than first thought. ""A number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected,"" the Bank said in the minutes of its latest MPC meeting. It added that if its economic forecasts in November were similar to those it had formulated in August, then ""a majority of members expected to support a further cut in bank rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC's forthcoming meetings during the course of the year."" The Bank noted that a variety of economic indicators have suggested that the UK economy has shrugged off the post-referendum surprise in the short-term. As a result, the Bank is not as gloomy about the short-term state of the economy as it was a month ago. But it said that it still expects the pace of economic activity in the July-September period to have halved from the growth rate recorded earlier in the year. The Bank's internal judgement is that growth in Q3 (that's July to September) will now be between 0.2 and 0.3, a pretty chunky upgrade on its August forecast of 0.1. It's not an official forecast, but given the Q3 growth figure will be announced before the next meeting of the MPC in November, it is as close as we are going to get. Looking at 2017, the MPC says it is harder to make a judgement, but if the present economic momentum continues, then expect an upgrade in growth forecasts for next year and 2018 after brutal downgrades last month. It still says that is considering cutting interest rates again - to 0.1 - but the chances of that must be lower given the better economic news. Read Kamal's full analysis here Under a new timetable which replaces the long-standing practice of monthly meetings, the next MPC meeting will take place in November. It is at that point that some City economists expect a further cut in bank rate to just 0.1. The latest vote of MPC members, who include the governor Mark Carney, was unanimous - at 9-0. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""The Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates on hold was unsurprising. ""Although the post-referendum economic data has been decidedly mixed, we expect growth to slow sharply in 2017. ""We anticipate the MPC will move again to cut interest rates before the end of the year,"" he added. The MPC also voted to stick with the expansion of its quantitative easing (QE) policy, which it announced in August. That means the bank will now buy an extra PS60bn of government bonds - taking the total to PS435bn - along with a further PS10bn of corporate bonds, as part of its continuing attempts to keep the economy from sliding into recession.",1,799
"Based on a true story, Pride shows how gay rights campaigners from London raised thousands of pounds for miners in the Dulais Valley, after the NUM had spurned their support. Despite initial scepticism on both sides, the characters break down preconceptions and strike an enduring friendship. Starring Bill Nighy, Dominic West and Imelda Staunton, the movie played to critical acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival this summer. But, according to writer Stephen Beresford, it's a tale which had almost been airbrushed out of collective gay history. ""It was in the early 1990s, during the second round of pit closures, when I first heard about it,"" he said. ""As a naive 21-year-old, I asked the question: Why should we support the miners? They don't support us. ""Someone took me aside and said:'Let me tell you a little story'. ""I suppose the film's been in the making ever since."" The film opens with gay activist Mike Jackson at the Pride march in 1984, looking for a cause to support. He persuades his friends that ""The miners are hated by Thatcher, the police, and the tabloid press...who does that remind you of?,"" adding ""The only thing we have to worry about which they don't is Mary Whitehouse, and that's only a matter of time"" Indeed, in real life it wasn't long until The Sun turned its moral indignation on the unlikely alliance as they branded a joint fundraising concert'Pits and Perverts'. But Mike quickly discovers that, in the beginning at least, not all the miners are entirely comfortable with the solidarity offered by'Lesbians and Gays Support Miners'. Christine Powell was treasurer of The Neath and District Miners Support Group, and recalls the first time LGSM visited Wales. ""Well we were nervous, not about them, but about ourselves. We didn't know anything about gay people, none of us had ever knowingly met one, and we were just desperate not to say or do anything which was going to offend them - especially after they'd been so kind and supportive to us. ""But from the first minute they had us in stitches, and we soon realised that we had far more things in common than there were which separated us. ""Before that I suppose we'd been quite prejudiced, through ignorance. ""One of the good things to come out of the strike was that it forced us to be less judgemental about things we didn't understand, and realise that there are friends everywhere if you're happy to accept them.""

"The University of Wisconsin successfully claimed that Apple used its microchip technology without permission in some iPhones and iPads. The patent, filed in 1998, is said to improve the power efficiency of microchips. The case relates to use of the technology in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus - but an additional lawsuit making the same claim against Apple's newest models, the 6S and 6S Plus, has also been filed. The University of Wisconsin sued Intel over the same patent in 2008. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. In court papers, the university claimed Apple ignored its offers to license the patent, which would mean paying a fee for its continued use. Therefore the university said Apple was wilfully infringing the patent, something which, if the court agrees, could carry a heavier fine. The precise amount Apple may have to pay will be decided at a later stage in the court proceedings.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Governing body the UCI introduced the ban in 2011, but a whistleblower said Team Sky continued to inject riders. One of the substances said to have been injected is Fluimucil, at the heart of the controversy over a mystery package delivered to Bradley Wiggins in 2011. Team Sky had been renowned for their robust no-needle stance. In March, British cyclist Josh Edmondson told the BBC he broke the sport's rules by secretly injecting himself with a cocktail of vitamins when riding for Team Sky. The substances are not illegal under World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules but there are concerns about the ethics of administering them intravenously. Ukad and the UCU are investigating claims by Edmondson that Team Sky covered up his use of banned injections. Team Sky deny doing so, insisting that Edmondson did not confess at the time, and that they did not report the case because of concerns about his mental wellbeing. PA's source, who sent the information to the House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and Ukad, is understood to have worked for Team Sky. The source said some Team Sky doctors were using intravenous recovery methods towards the end of the team's difficult first season in 2010 and continued to do so despite the UCI ban, which Team Sky publicly supported. The source has claimed Team Sky hired Dr Fabio Bartalucci in late 2010 as he was believed to have expertise in IV recovery. The Italian, who was picked up by police in an anti-doping raid at the 2001 Giro d'Italia but not charged, left in 2011. Ukad said it ""does not discuss or disclose information in relation to its investigations."" Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee chairman Damian Collins said: ""This raises further concerns about how Team Sky policed the use of medication for riders outside of competition, and how hard they were prepared to press up against the line of what was allowed or acceptable."" BBC Sport attempted to contact Team Sky. However, a spokesperson earlier told PA: ""It is right that any concerns are reported to and dealt with by the appropriate authorities, and we will continue to co-operate with them.""",1,803

It is understood part of the charge concerns a player not informing the club of his new home address, while another part relates to members of the Under-21 squad training with the first-team at short notice.",1,805
"Human Rights Watch believes Nato air strikes killed at least 72 civilians and says the organisation needs to bear responsibility where appropriate. ""We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,"" HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News. Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties. It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths. Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. In March, another human rights organisation, Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes. It described Nato's failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as ""deeply disappointing."" The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports. In its report published on Monday, HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes. In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims. What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation. ""Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,"" he said. Source: Nato ""They refuse to give information about how they died and they refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling. ""I think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections."" Nato says it is ready to co-operate with the new Libyan authorities in assessing what further action is appropriate. But so far the task force being set up in Tripoli seems to have made little headway, our diplomatic correspondent adds.",1,806
"It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain clumps of a protein called tau that is closely linked to the disease. Alzheimer's Research UK said it was promising work. Alzheimer's disease is a problem for researchers trying to come up with a cure. The brain starts to die years before any symptoms are detected, which means drugs are probably given too late. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's cannot be made with absolute certainty until a patient has died and their brain is examined. It is also not 100 clear what is the cause of the dementia and what are just symptoms. One protein, called tau, is very closely linked to the disease, with tangles of tau thought to be one way in which brain cells are killed. The team, lead by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, used positron emission tomography to build a 3D picture of tau in the brain. They developed a chemical that could bind to tau and then be detected during a brain scan. Tests on mice and people with suspected Alzheimer's showed the technology could detect tau. Dr Makoto Higuchi, from the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, said: ""Positron emission tomography images of tau accumulation.... provide robust information on brain regions developing or at risk for tau-induced neuronal death."" The research is at an early stage, but it could eventually lead to an actual test for Alzheimer's disease. It might also allow researchers to closely follow the impact drugs that affect tau have on the brain. Another protein - beta amyloid - is also linked to Alzheimer's and can be detected in similar tests. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain. ""With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target. ""If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression.""",1,807
"The Sky Blues currently play in Coventry's Ricoh Arena but had a long dispute with the stadium's previous owners. The council said the club wanted to meet to understand how it would deal with a planning application. The club said it was not commenting ""at this stage."" The club's owners, Sisu, have been involved in a long-running stand off with the previous operators of the Ricoh that saw the Sky Blues play the 201314 season in Northampton. The arena is now owned by Premiership rugby team Wasps. In a statement, Rugby Borough Council said its leader and the council's executive director and head of planning had met with Coventry City in March. ""The club requested the meeting to understand how the council would deal with any planning application for potential stadium sites in the borough of Rugby,"" it said. It said the plans would need to be finalised by September to be included in the council's local plan, but added that a site had yet to be identified. Peter Ward, from Sky Blues Supporters' Consultative Group, said he was pleased to hear that things were ""moving"" with the club's search for a new home. ""It's good that finally there is some evidence things are happening,"" he said. ""As we've heard from the club's directors, there is a need to take control of and have access to all the revenue streams."" However, he said that fans could find a move out of Coventry difficult - particularly as they only moved from their previous home, Highfield Road, to the Ricoh in 2005. ""The move from Highfield Road to the Ricoh was a big emotional move for the fans,"" he said. ""This would be another big change.""",1,808
"Joanna Michael, 25, from St Mellons, Cardiff, rang 999 twice before Cyron Williams stabbed her to death in 2009. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ruled she was failed by South Wales and Gwent Police. The Supreme Court said Ms Michael's family would not be able to proceed with claims against the two forces. Ms Michael's parents and children won the right to try to bring a claim for damages against both police forces in 2011, but it was thrown out by the Court of Appeal because police officers have immunity from negligence claims. The family had hoped the Supreme Court would overrule the ruling, but were left disappointed on Wednesday when the justices sitting decided by a 5-2 majority to dismiss the family's appeal. Speaking on the steps of the court Ms Michael's mother Angela said: ""I have lost a wonderful daughter. The children have lost a loving mother and provider. ""I brought this case to secure damages for the children and also to make the police answerable for their failures to deal effectively with serious domestic violence cases."" She added: ""I take some comfort that the appeal may bring this problem to the attention of the nation. It is unacceptable in modern Britain that a doctor can kill a patient through a negligent act or omission and be liable to pay compensation, but where the police fail and someone dies, they are immune in negligence."" The seven justices also unanimously dismissed a cross-appeal by the chief constables of South Wales and Gwent Police. The forces wanted to block the appeal court judges' linked ruling that the family should be allowed to go ahead with a claim that their Article 2 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights were breached by a police failure to protect Joanna's life. Reading out the judgement, Lord Neuberger passed on his ""considerable sympathy"" for Ms Michael's family. On the night of the murder on 5 August 2009, Williams, 19 at the time, broke into Ms Michael's home and found her with another man. She called 999 at 02:29 BST and told the Gwent Police operator that Williams was at the house and had threatened to kill her. The call went through to Gwent Police but was passed to South Wales, the force covering the area of Ms Michael's address. Once transferred, the call should have been graded as requiring an immediate response, but was instead graded at a lower level. When officers had still not arrived, Ms Michael called 999 again at 02:43 BST and was heard screaming before the line went dead. Police arrived at 02:51 BST but in the 22 minutes it took them to respond to her first call, the mother of two had been stabbed 72 times. Her children were in the house at the time. Williams was jailed for life in March 2010, after admitting murder at Cardiff Crown Court.",1,809
"Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told a BBC Radio Wales election phone-in he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests, but still wanted him to become prime minister. ""I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not,"" he said. ""The alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want."" Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Gething rejected listeners' suggestions that Welsh Labour was failing to support the party's UK leader. ""I want a Labour prime minister - and that means Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister,"" he said. ""I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not - it matters whether I think he can do the job in running the country. ""It matters whether I think this country will be better off having a Labour prime minister than a Tory."" Mr Gething admitted he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two Labour leadership contests, but accepted the party had voted ""decisively"" for him to be its leader and candidate for prime minister. He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs ""being returned from Wales in large numbers."" ""We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales,"" he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. ""I don't think we will be wiped out here,"" he said. ""We've got a good record in government.... we're directly engaged in our local communities,"" he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was ""appalled"" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the ""triple lock"" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a ""more open relationship"" with the EU than a ""hard"" Brexit, calling for ""full and unfettered"" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was ""economically beneficial."" ""There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment,"" he said. ""I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants."" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: ""A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves.""",1,810
"McBryde leads Wales against Samoa and Tonga this summer in the absence of Warren Gatland and Rob Howley, who coach the Lions in New Zealand.

Cardiff Blues face the Ospreys at the Principality Stadium on Saturday before the Newport Gwent Dragons play the Scarlets in the double header with Gatland naming his Lions squad on 19 April. ""I can only speculate in regards to the selection on the 19th [of April] for the Lions,"" said McBryde. ""We are just expecting there to be a few players from the teams that are playing this weekend to be selected.

""But this game is a big one from a selection point of view. We are looking to name the squad on the 24th to allow the players to prepare both physical and mentally prepare for the tour ahead.

"Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Metrobus admits public subsidies might now have to be used to entice firms on board. The first of the new bus routes are due to be completed in the next few months. David Redgewell, from passenger group Bus Users UK, said the lack of a current operator was a worry. ""We need to be realistic about what the bus industry can deliver in hard times,"" he said. ""The buses have to make money, so there's really going to have to be realism amongst the public authorities that unless they are prepared to put public subsidy in then they [buses] need to be commercial."" In March 2015, Bristol City Council was required to spend more than PS1m removing protestors from Stapleton allotments, part of the new Metrobus route. Former secretary of Stapleton Allotments Association, Jane Ghosh, said she was ""absolutely shocked but not the least bit surprised."" ""It's cost PS200 million plus, it's a lot more than that because of the delays. They only have PS34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,"" she said. ""We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us."" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were ""actively negotiating"" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: ""We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. ""Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. ""This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time."" First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract.",1,812
"The team of scientists hope the information will help shift the focus away from the way trees look towards on the focus on biodiversity. Over the next decade, the urban environment is expected to increase by nearly 30. Details have been published in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal. ""We wanted to place the focus on city and urban locations when choosing trees, but not on the aesthetic aspects,"" said co-author Juliane Vogt from the Institute of Forest Growth and Forest Computer Science at Techische Universitat Dresden, Germany. She told BBC News that the goal of the database was to ""find the right tree for the right place."" ""City planner tend to like 10 to 15 species of tree, and they like to plant them again and again - that's not really biodiversity,"" Dr Vogt observed. ""This is why we put in 390 trees and shrubs into the database so there was a huge range of different species and varieties. Dr Vogt added that she hoped that professionals, such as city planners and landscape architects, would use the database, adding ""but we also think it will be of interest for homeowners if they have a garden and want to find out what sort of tree would be suitable."" She said that there were numerous benefits associated with city trees, such as shading and reducing the urban heat island effect, which make towns and cities several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas. This is a particular problem during heatwaves. ""Trees also provide habitat for other animals that have made their home within cities,"" She added. The long term survival and evolutionary development of species populations are shaped by the surrounding habitat. For some species, urban life has presented an opportunity for a new beginning. The BBC Natural History Unit's Planet Earth II looks at the lure of the urban jungle for wildlife in its final episode of the series. The programme, set to be broadcast on Sunday, 11 December, looks at peregrine falcons in New York, which are booming, thanks to another urban success story - the pigeon, or rock dove. Langurs, a species of monkey in India, are also thriving. Revered as a mortal connection with a god, the animals are fed. Numbers are booming. However, the growing biodiversity of urban life is not universally welcomed. Some species - racoons, rats, pigeons - are widely regarded as pests. Plants, such as the Japanese knotweed - once prized - are unwelcomed opportunists. ""Trees also interact with humans and the surrounding city, so one point of the database is to take account of some of the risks, such as having poisonous trees, or trees that have brittle wood that can break,"" said Dr Vogt. ""Some residents really dislike trees because, for example, they are too big. ""In the street near where I live, there are pear trees and now, in the autumn, the pears are falling and leaving a mess on the pavement below. People are now calling for them to be cut down, even though they are healthy."" Follow Mark on Twitter.",1,813
"It effectively completes the four-year-old software's transformation from a ""lightweight"" chat app, spun off from the main Facebook site, into a fully-fledged ""platform"" of its own. More than 40 new add-on apps have already been developed so far. But one expert said there was a risk Messenger would become bloated. Messenger has already proved controversial with some users of the social network, who have complained about having to switch between two apps to stay in touch with their Facebook friends. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the move at his firm's F8 developers conference in San Francisco. He said more than 600 million people already used Messenger at least once a month to express themselves, and that allowing other social networks and services to directly post to it would make ""conversations better."" Among the new apps unveiled are ways to post: It builds on a move to allow US-based users to send money to and from each other via Messenger, which Facebook announced last week, and the earlier inclusion of Voip (voice over internet protocol) calls and stickers. Mr Zuckerberg also revealed plans to launch an associated service called Businesses on Messenger. Using the app instead of email, the public will be able to hold conversations with companies from which they buy goods, or have other interactions with. Facebook suggested this could include receiving delivery status updates, organising the return of an order and asking follow-up questions. The company is far from the first to attempt to turn a messaging app into a wider platform. China's WeChat service has gone even further by allowing its users to book taxis, pick cinema seats and find nearby restaurants among other actions. But one expert suggested Facebook should be cautious about the rate at which it adds further facilities to Messenger. ""There's a potential risk that they are going to overload Messenger with too many functions and none of them become that important - it really depends on how extensive they get with the features that they add over time,"" said Brian Blau from the Gartner tech consultancy. ""We have seen something like that happen with Facebook's Timeline, where you have all these different people competing for your attention. ""So, Facebook won't want to over-bloat, but it could enable all kinds of interesting scenarios where you can integrate messaging with other apps and services."" Right now many of the Messenger apps look fun, if a bit gimmicky. But over time these new interactions will give Facebook another source of rich information about a user's interests - and thereby the potential to attract more ad revenue. Facebook would have taken inspiration from companies like China's WeChat and Japan's Line, which have proven successful in building both content and business services atop their core messenger offerings. But Messenger for Business is an ambitious plan. It is asking users to supplant more tried-and-tested means like email. Other communications behemoths like Skype tried - unsuccessfully - to become places to reinvent communications between businesses and their customers. Will users be happy to shift their business interactions over to Facebook - a platform where, until now, they have been used to dealing primarily with friends? Other announcements made at F8 included:",1,814
"She is the first non-white female cabinet-level official appointed to the incoming Trump administration. Mrs Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump on the campaign trail. A rising star in the Republican party, the 44-year-old is the youngest governor in the US. Mr Trump said in a press release: ""Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country. ""She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage."" The Republican-controlled Senate will need to confirm her appointment before she officially takes office. In a statement, Mrs Haley said she was ""moved"" to accept the assignment and would remain the South Carolina governor, pending her congressional confirmation. She had endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio during the Republican primaries, later throwing her support behind Senator Ted Cruz - Mr Trump's final rival before he became the party's nominee. Although Mrs Haley eventually voted for Mr Trump, the governor said she was ""not a fan"" of either him or the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Eye-catching though her political career has been, little is known about Nikki Haley's views on the foreign affairs and the United Nations. Diplomats here have been Googling her to find out more. When her nomination was announced I was with a senior diplomat, who had expected President-elect Trump to downgrade the job of UN ambassador so that it was no longer a cabinet-level position. He was heartened that Mr Trump had selected a ""political heavyweight,"" and viewed it as an early indication than the incoming administration will take the UN more seriously than he'd supposed. Certainly, she's no John Bolton, the US ambassador during the Bush administration who famously remarked that it would not make much of a difference if the UN headquarters in New York lost its top 10 floors - where the organisation's most senior figures, including the secretary general, have their offices. Many UN diplomats fear a Trump presidency and there's relief here that he hasn't appointed an outspoken UN-basher. She also sharply attacked Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, calling it ""un-American,"" as well as his refusal to release his tax records. For his part, Mr Trump had called her ""very weak on illegal immigration"" and said South Carolinians were ""embarrassed"" by her. But the newly minted president-elect, who will be inaugurated in January, invited her for a meeting last week at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mrs Haley has little previous foreign policy experience, though the Charleston Post and Courier reports she has taken at least eight trips abroad since becoming governor in 2011, mostly in support of economic development deals for her state. During a trade mission to Europe in 2011, she was criticised by the newspaper for staying at expensive hotels and attending parties, costing the taxpayer 127,000 (PS103,000). Born Nimrata ""Nikki"" Randhawa, Mrs Haley was raised in a Sikh household and now identifies as a Christian. She is the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial strife. She was praised by members of both parties in 2015 when she ordered the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the grounds of the state capitol after a racially motivated shooting at an African-American church in Charleston. Mrs Haley, who is in her second and final term as governor, was elected in 2010, riding a wave of the Republican Tea Party. She is married to Army National Guard Captain Michael Haley, and the couple have two teenage children. Read full profile here The job of the ""permanent representative"" to the UN is to represent US interests.

"Dubbed ""carbon farming,"" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. ""The results are overwhelming,"" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. ""There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,"" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. ""I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing."" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. ""Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,"" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. ""When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,"" she said. ""But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal."" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. ""It is still somebody else's land. Why go in and grow these massive plantations to deal with a problem these people didn't actually cause?"" Follow Matt on Twitter.",1,817
"A YouGov survey suggested low name recognition of councillors across the UK, with 79 of East Midlands residents unable to name a single representative. Satisfaction with the work of councils is highest in North East England - but still less than one in three are happy. People have rated councils better than national government in past studies. Voters will go to the polls on 5 May to elect more than 9,500 councillors in nearly 280 councils across England. Research by polling firm YouGov, designed to coincide with the election campaign, has suggested that the majority of voters casting their ballots next month will do so not knowing any of the candidates. It asked more than 2,000 people aged over 18 across the UK whether they could name any of their local councillors. Recognition was highest in Scotland, where 47 of those canvassed were able to identify one of their local representatives. In Northern Ireland, the figure was 46, while in Wales, the figure was 44. Across the English regions, recognition was highest in the North East of England - at 43. But in six regions - the East Midlands, the East of England, the West Midlands, London, the south west of England and the south east - less than one in three of those asked could identify the person representing them. Asked whether the local authority addressed the needs of their local communities, only 20 of people living in the North West of England said it did. Approval levels were highest in the North East (31), the West Midlands (28) and Wales (27). Social networking site Streetlife, which commissioned the research, suggested it demonstrated there was a ""real disconnection"" between residents of local communities and those representing them. The findings contrast with those of the Hansard Society, whose recent audit of political engagement concluded that awareness and satisfaction with local politics had increased since last year's general election. It found that more than two out of three people were interested in how local services were provided and nearly half believed they were being delivered well - much higher than at a national level. The Hansard Society also found name recognition was also a problem for national politicians, with only 38 of people able to name their own MP. But its research suggested that interest in local politics did not translate into a wish to become involved - with only one in ten people saying their were likely to volunteer in their communities over the next couple of years. Elections are taking place next month in 36 metropolitan boroughs, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds and Sheffield, as well as 49 unitary authorities and 194 district councils - the biggest test of popular opinion since last year's general election.

"Arthur Cave, 15, was found with multiple injuries on the underpass of Ovingdean Gap in July. He died later at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. Sussex Police said his death was not suspicious, and the coroner ruled it was ""accidental."" Nick Cave, 58, is an Australian songwriter and is best known as lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Mr Cave and his wife Susie Bick are at the hearing which is being held in front of Brighton senior coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley at Woodvale Crematorium. The inquest heard Arthur had taken LSD with a friend and he was seen ""staggering"" on his own before he fell off the cliff. Members of the public tried to resuscitate him after he was found lying on the ground without any shoes or socks on. During evidence given by pathologist Dr Simi George, Ms Hamilton-Deeley asked: ""The history you had was that LSD was used?"" Dr George replied: ""Yes."" The cause of death was given as ""multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height."" Recording a conclusion of accidental death, Ms Hamilton-Deeley, said: ""I expect the decision and planning to take LSD, or a hallucinogenic drug likely to be LSD, was made on the spur of the moment. ""It's clear he could not know what was real and what was not real. ""It's completely impossible to know what was in Arthur's mind and what he was seeing."" In a statement issued after the inquest, the Cave family said they had been ""overwhelmed"" by the messages of support from people ""in Brighton and beyond."" It read: ""Arthur was a wonderfully unruly, creative and free-spirited young man with an infectious, happy, funny daredevil nature. ""He loved his friends and family, idolised his twin brother Earl and was never far from his side.""",1,821
"Wilson was airlifted to hospital from the Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania after Sage Karam's car spun and crashed in front of him on lap 179 of 200. Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a ""monumentally sad day."" Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman Co, said: ""Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. ""As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time."" A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a ""loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers."" His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: ""Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now. He was my brother, my best friend, my role model and mentor. He was a champion. ""He lived for this sport, he loved it. The only comfort I feel is that he lived a life he loved."" An Andretti Autosport team statement said: ""He was a tremendous racer, a valuable member of the team and respected representative to our sport. While Justin was only part of the Andretti line-up for a short time, it only took a second for him to forever become part of the Andretti family. ""His life and racing career is a story of class and passion surpassed by none."" Wilson was making his 174th IndyCar start in Sunday's race, but his major motorsport breakthrough came in F1. He won the Formula 3000 series in 2001, and two years later raised PS1.2m to finance his F1 entry after setting up a company in his own name. Standing at 6ft 4in, Wilson was unusually tall for F1 - drivers over six feet are a rarity - and he scored his only point from 16 races with Minardi and Jaguar during 2003 at the United States Grand Prix. He moved to the United States in 2004 and enjoyed greater success in Champ Car, finishing as series runner-up in 2006 and 2007 before switching to IndyCar racing in 2008, after Champ Car merged with the Indy Racing League. He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. ""I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious,"" he tweeted. ""The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver. My thoughts are with his family."" World champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: ""I am so devastated to hear of another passing of a great man and driver. I'd met Justin Wilson a few times growing up and he was the ultimate gentleman. Whilst I only knew him a little, I will miss him. We will miss him."" Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart, who gave Wilson his first start in F1,said: ""Motorsport has lost not just a fantastic driver but one of the true gentleman of the sport. ""Justin wasn't just a very fast and capable driver but a true gentleman and one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet in the paddock."" Scotland's four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti said: ""Rest in peace Justin, it was a real privilege to know you and call you a friend."" Nine-time F1 winner Mark Webber, who competed alongside Wilson at Minardi in 2003, tweeted: ""Last night a very good man left us. So sorry. RIP Justin. My thoughts are with your loved ones."" Sage Karam, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, has been released from hospital after treatment for heel and wrist injuries. ""I can't find the proper words to describe the pain and sympathy I feel for Justin and his family,"" he said on social media.",1,822
"Both blasts went off on Thika road, a busy highway north-east of the city. The buses were crowded at the time of the explosions, which police said were caused by improvised devices. Sunday's attack was the second in Kenya in as many days. Recent violence has been blamed by the government on Somali Islamist group al-Shabab. According to reports, the two explosions went off outside a hotel and at an underpass not far from Kasarani, north-east of the capital. Kenya's National Disaster Operations Centre said 20 of those wounded were in a critical condition. The buses were badly damaged by the explosions. Television footage showed a gaping hole in one, while the doors and windows were blown out of the other. On Saturday, a grenade was thrown in a bus in the coastal city of Mombasa leaving four people dead and another 15 wounded. The bus had just travelled from Nairobi. There was a second blast near a beach-front hotel, but no-one was hurt. The al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab has launched a series of attacks against Kenyan targets in recent years in retaliation for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia since 2011. In September, at least 67 people were killed when al-Shabab fighters seized the upmarket Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi for four days. Kenya has vowed to halt attacks by militant Islamists and arrested some 2,000 people in the capital last month.",1,823
"Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side. Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst. In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game. In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor. Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of. Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them. An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind. Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of. Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better. Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat. Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that. Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor. Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything. Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down. Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit. Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout. Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example. Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position. Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did. Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be. Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well. Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield. Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic. Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong. Pat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.",1,824
"Morton are well placed to secure a Championship play-off spot after Tuesday's 1-0 win at Raith Rovers. They were one of only two sides to earn a point at Ibrox in the league last season, and Duffy insists they will make it ""as uncomfortable as possible."" A Morton win] would be a monumental upset,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""Rangers are a different proposition at Ibrox. Even though they drew last weekend [1-1 v Ross County], their home form has been very good over the last couple of years under Mark Warburton. ""The pitch, the expanse at Ibrox certainly suits the style they play. But we will certainly go there with a bit more heart after last night [the win at Raith]. ""The heavy pitch took its toll so we have to make sure we recover right and prepare tactically as well. ""We will go there and try to make it as uncomfortable a day as we possibly can for Rangers. If we play well, manage to stifle Rangers a little bit and keep the ball, we can frustrate them."" With last season's Championship winners Rangers 27 points behind Celtic in the Premiership, Duffy believes Warburton's side will place extra emphasis on Sunday's fifth-round tie. ""The nature of being a big club like Rangers is the expectations are huge,"" noted the former Dundee centre-back and manager. ""They know it is their only chance of silverware this season. Celtic have already got the League Cup, and have all but wrapped up the league, so the only trophy available to Rangers and their supporters is the Scottish Cup. ""That will be the main objective and target now which will make it doubly difficult for us because all their focus will be on that. ""But we have got a job to do - to stay in the game and be difficult to beat. If Rangers get a little bit nervous, and their fans get frustrated, then you never know. But we have to be good enough to take advantage of those situations."" Media playback is not supported on this device Morton's victory at Stark's Park lifted them to within two points of second-placed Dundee United and nine off Championship leaders Hibernian, but crucially, nine points clear of fifth-placed Queen of the South in the battle for a play-off place. Duffy believes a prospect of a tilt at the title is unrealistic, insisting a play-off spot will be a significant achievement for the Greenock outfit. ""If we get into the play-offs, we will be singing and dancing, there is no doubt about that,"" he added. ""But it is still a long way away. A lot of clubs will be challenging for that. There will be clubs that can find a run of form and you can have a dip. ""But the players showed terrific character to bounce back from a disappointing weekend [losing to Queen of the South] and it sets us up nicely for the Scottish Cup tie against Rangers.""",1,825
"Its reach has also expanded across the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert, attracting members from Mauritania, Morocco, Niger and Senegal as well as from within Mali where, in alliance with other Islamists, it is fighting French troops on the ground. During the Mali crisis, its fighters have dramatically increased their profile, allowing them to further their aim of spreading Islamic law and jihad across West Africa. AQIM's influence over other nascent Islamist cells comes from its wealth: it is one of the region's best-armed groups thanks to the money it makes from kidnapping Westerners and drug and cigarette trafficking across the Sahara. It emerged in early 2007, after a feared militant group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), aligned itself with Osama Bin Laden's international network. Back in the 1990s, against a background of Islamist political groups testing their strength across North Africa, the military-backed authorities in Algeria at first permitted the Islamists to play a full part in the nation's political life. But then, when the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to sweep the board in a 1992 general election, they annulled the whole process and took power back. The political ferment immediately moved into violence. Armed Islamists mounted attacks across Algeria, the security forces fought back; and sometimes it was hard to tell which group had carried out which atrocity. Other states in the region - Tunisia and Morocco, Mauritania to the west and Libya to the east - also battled against Islamists. But the conflict in Algeria was particularly brutal, killing perhaps 150,000 people. It peaked in the 1990s, until an amnesty offer to Islamists in 1999 led to gradual improvements. Violence fell and the country's economy recovered during the early years of the 21st Century. However, the most feared of the militant organisations, the Armed Islamic Group or GIA, rejected the promised amnesty and continued a violent campaign to establish an Islamic state. By then it had split, with the most extreme faction calling itself the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat - a name which echoed an Islamist group in Morocco. The Arabic word ""Salafist"" means fundamentalist, in the sense of going back to the original texts of Islam. In September 2006 the GSPC said it had joined forces with al-Qaeda, and in January 2007 it announced that it had changed its name to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb to reflect its new allegiance. At the time there had been much debate in intelligence circles about the significance of the move. Some officials dismissed it as an act of desperation by a group on its last legs, seeking to attract new recruits by aligning itself with Osama Bin Laden. Others, who saw it as far more worrying development, proved correct, as al-Qaeda has succeeded in persuading North Africa's Islamist extremists to take a more global view. In fact, the head of the US Africa Command said he believed that in 2012 AQIM, Nigeria's Boko Haram and the Somali Islamist group al-Shabab were co-ordinating their efforts. The merger announcement delighted al-Qaeda's then deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who described it at the time as ""a source of chagrin, frustration and sadness"" for Algeria's authorities. Shortly afterwards, seven bombs exploded in Algeria's eastern Kabylia region, killing six people, and in April 2007 at least 30 people were killed in bomb attacks on official buildings in Algiers. AQIM said it had planted the bombs. More attacks followed: on buses carrying foreign oil workers; on American diplomats; on soldiers; and in September 2007, a suicide bomb attack in Batna, aimed at the motorcade of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The president was not injured, but 20 people were killed. Two days later, a car bomb killed more than 30 people at a coastguard barracks in the town of Dellys. In December, twin car bombs claimed by AQIM killed at least 37 people in Algiers, including 17 UN staff. The death toll continued to mount in 2008. Back-to-back attacks on 19 and 20 August killed dozens of people. The first was a suicide car bombing at a police college in Issers, east of Algiers, killing 48 people. A day later, two more car bombings struck in quick succession in Bouira, south-east of Algiers. The second explosion in Bouira killed 12 Algerian employees of the Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. The attacks continued into 2009, when suspected al-Qaeda militants in February killed nine security guards who were working for the state-owned gas and electricity distributor Sonelgaz at a camp near Jijel, east of Algiers. Algerian Islamists represent the largest national grouping in al-Qaeda, according to Jill Carroll's 2007 briefing paper How Did Al-Qaeda Emerge in North Africa? Abdelaziz Belkhadem, Algeria's prime minister in 2007, warned that the bombers wanted to take the North African country back to ""the years of hardship."" But other incidents across the Maghreb pointed to the group's regional ambitions. In January that year, 12 people were shot dead by the security forces in Tunisia near the small town of Solimane, south of the capital, Tunis. The authorities initially described their adversaries as criminals but later admitted that the men were Islamist militants with connections to the GSPC. Meanwhile, Morocco's security forces clamped down on several militant cells - arresting, trying and jailing their leaders - after four incidents blamed on al-Qaeda-inspired groups in 2007. The security forces were said to be on the lookout for militants who were believed to be crossing into Morocco from Algeria. And of course the Madrid train bombs, which killed almost 200 people in 2004, were the work of a Moroccan gang. In December 2008, AQIM militants abducted the United Nations special envoy, Robert Fowler, and his assistant, Louis Guay, near Niger's capital, Niamey. They were released in April 2009. The group also seized four European tourists who disappeared in January 2009 along the Mali-Niger border. Two were freed in April. The group threatened to kill one of the remaining pair - a Briton - unless a radical Islamic cleric convicted of terrorism in Jordan, Abu Qatada, was released from jail in the UK. And in June 2009 the British government said it believed AQIM's claims on an Islamist website that the death threat had been carried out against the British captive, Edwin Dyer. In July 2010 AQIM said it had killed French hostage Michel Germaneau - kidnapped in northern Niger three months earlier and transferred to Mali - in revenge for the killing of seven comrades in a failed rescue raid. In November 2011 a German was killed and three other foreigners kidnapped by AQIM in the ancient tourist city of Timbuktu in northern Mali. The group is thought to have between 600 and 800 fighters spread throughout Algeria and Europe - and according to the independent think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, most of its major commanders trained in Afghanistan. Since 2004, the leader of the militants is thought to be Abou Mossab Abdelwadoud, a former university science student and infamous bomb-maker. In 2005, deputy GSPC leader Amari Saifi was sentenced to life in prison by an Algiers court for kidnapping 32 European tourists in 2003. The former paratrooper was captured by Chadian rebels in mysterious circumstances and passed on to Libya before standing trial in Algeria. Another leading member was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, known as ""The One-Eyed,"" a former soldier and infamous cigarette smuggler at the centre of the 2013 hostage drama in Algeria. He left AQIM in late 2012 after falling out with some leaders and has been involved in operations in Mali. He organised the importation of arms for the underground network from Niger and Mali. He is wanted in Algeria on terrorism charges.",1,826
"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service recorded the acreage of several of the most serious of the 73 heath and grass fires its crews have tackled. The 332-acre total includes 100 acres burnt in Locaber on 1 May, but does not take into account all land affected. Landowners contributed more than PS1m towards the cost of the fire fighting. The Scottish Rural Property and Business Association (SRPBA), which has provided the figure, said private landowners and estates supplied staff, specialist equipment and paid for helicopters to water-bomb flames. Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service (HIFRS) said the majority of wild fires in its area were now out. Parts of Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Fife were also affected during a dry and windy spell of weather. Crews tackled flames on the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire, while smoke from a fire near Tyndrum temporarily closed the A82 in Argyll. The north-west Highlands was the worst hit. Since the start of the month, 150 acres of burning heath were tackled by crews from Fort William, Newtonmore and Kilchoan. Acharacle and Mallaig dealt with a 100-acre heath fire, while crews from Stornoway and South Lochs extinguished a 24-acre grass fire on Lewis. Dunvegan, Portree and Uig crews extinguished a wild fire that burnt 40 acres on Skye. Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland's national stadium, sits in 33 acres bought in 1903. HIFRS has praised firefighters and the public for their help in dealing with the incidents. SRPBA Highlands and Islands regional manager, Drew McFarlane-Slack, said private landowners and their employees had played their part. He said: ""Many of our members have made a huge effort over the last week investing significant time and resources supporting and working with the fire and rescue service and their neighbouring landowners like the National Trust for Scotland and the RSPB to fight the fires. ""This is despite the majority of affected land falling outwith our members' own estates.""",1,827

"Police said Alexander Protopopov, acting deputy chief of Russia's prison service, oversaw the dismantling of the road in the far-northern Komi region. He then sold off its 7,000 reinforced concrete slabs for personal profit, they added. Officials believe the scheme cost the government more than 6m roubles (79,000; PS54,000). The road was ""dismantled and driven away"" over the period of more than a year, between 2014 and 2015, the Investigative Committee said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. The concrete slabs were then used by a commercial company which also sold them on for a profit, it added. Mr Protopopov was the head of Komi region's prison service from 2010 to 2015, and won awards such as a medal for creating ""spiritual unity,"" AFP reports. He was arrested on Wednesday and faces charges of misappropriating of state property while using his official position, which could lead to 10 years in jail, the agency adds. Another prison service official, the head of a penal colony and a businessman are also under investigation. Komi Republic is a huge region in Russia's far north, much of it forested. It has significant natural resources, including oil, gas and timber. Road construction is one of the most corrupt sectors in Russia, with costs much higher than on comparable projects in other countries, AFP reports. The construction of a mountain highway for the Sochi Winter Olympic Games cost about 8bn (PS5.6bn), with Russian media claiming it would cost the same to slather the 48km road with black caviar.",1,829

"Former five-weight world champion Mayweather faced UFC lightweight title-holder McGregor in Canada in front of 16,000 fans in Toronto. McGregor, 28, danced around the stage as he criticised 40-year-old Mayweather and his promoters. The pair will meet over 12 rounds under boxing rules on 26 August. In a series of expletive-laden outbursts, mixed martial arts star McGregor insulted Mayweather over his outfit and even suggested he couldn't read. ""How do I look?"" McGregor asked the crowd, before pointing at Mayweather's bag. ""He's 40! Dress your age, carrying a school bag on stage. ""What are you doing with a school bag on stage? You can't even read."" Mayweather, dressed in a T-shirt and cap while McGregor wore a suit, replied: ""I'm the one that can't read? I do numbers, I make money,"" ""You owe money,"" McGregor responded, referring to reports that Mayweather asked the IRS earlier this month for more time to pay his 2015 tax bill. Undefeated Mayweather took an Irish flag from the crowd and paraded it in front of McGregor, before the Irishman threw it back in the boxer's face. Their head-to-head meeting was the second in a four-day international tour to four cities to promote the bout taking place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The first publicity event took place in Los Angeles, where McGregor promised to knock out Mayweather inside four rounds, with the final two events taking place in New York and London. McGregor has never boxed as an amateur or professional. But his UFC coach John Kavanagh says the Irishman's boxing skills are improving all the time. Kavanagh said: ""We have gone through one training cycle and we had some good sparring partners in - and, as we expected, his skills transcended. ""He is not trying to win Wimbledon. It's not that different. ""His understanding of range, his understanding of how to move around is excellent."" He added: ""The first half has gone very well and I am heading out to Vegas for the second half on Monday, and I am expecting him to peak at the right time.""",1,832

A psychiatric report is to be prepared on Langdell who was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 18 April. Ann Evans, for the prosecution, said: ""What needs to be established are the circumstances of Katie's death. There was a no comment interview with the police."" Benjamin Aina QC, defending, said Langdell admitted deliberately and intentionally killing Katie in a hotel room. He said his client had been seeking psychiatric help after being convicted of making threats to kill in Bristol. Miss Locke's family were in court for the hearing. In a statement released by police at the time of her death, they said: ""As a family we are distraught, in shock and totally devastated. There was not a bad bone in Katie's body. ""Katie worked hard and loved her job as a teacher. In what little spare time she had she enjoyed sports. ""We now feel like our future has been stolen from us.""",1,834
"The government has ""called in"" proposals to shut St Joseph's Primary in Milngavie near Glasgow. The council plans to build a new denominational primary in nearby Bearsden - replacing both St Joseph's and the school on the site at present. Parents at St Joseph's and the Catholic Church have been fighting the plan. East Dunbartonshire Council plans to merge St Joseph's Primary with St Andrew's Primary in neighbouring Bearsden. The merged school would be sited in a new building on the current St Andrew's Primary School site. When the Scottish government calls in any proposal to close a school, it examines the process followed by the council and the information used to reach the decision. But it cannot simply overturn a decision because it disagrees with it. A letter informing the council of the government's decision said ministers were concerned by allegations the council's consultation document contained inaccurate information. It also said concerns raised by Education Scotland may not have been fully addressed by the council in the consultation. A spokesman for the parents at St Joseph's said: ""Parents are delighted that the Scottish government has decided to call this process in. ""It is now clear that the way East Dunbartonshire Council has conducted this process has more holes than a colander. ""We believe and ministers appear to agree that our children will receive the best possible education in their own community."" Council leader Rhonda Gheekie said: ""This is a complex process and it's understandable that the Scottish government wants to investigate the proposal further. ""We welcome the same opportunity to explain in greater detail the educational benefits that we believe will come from our proposal to build a new PS9m denominational primary school for Bearsden and Milngavie. ""We understand the significance of any new school build for the local community and what we all have in common is that we want to get it right to ensure the best possible future education for the young people in the area."" The council said its proposals were part of its Primary School Improvement Programme to modernise the primary school estate. This aims to deliver state of the art primary schools which are better for pupils and cheaper to run and maintain. Ms Geekie added: ""The council must save a further PS20m from its budget over the next three years. On top of the PS40m we have already saved, doing nothing in terms of our school estate to help address this was never an option. ""We have to ensure that our school buildings are as cost-effective as they can possibly be to ensure that we are getting value for money from our budget spending."" Meanwhile, the council's plan to close two primary schools in Kirkintilloch and establish a new PS7m school to replace them are to go ahead. The new school there is expected to open in 2016 or 2017.",1,835
"Frenchman Christophe Borgye's remains were found at a property in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, in 2013 - four years after he was reported missing. Manuel Wagner, 29, has been found guilty of murder and sentenced to a minimum jail term of 16 years following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Two other men were convicted in 2014. Mr Borgye, 36, was killed in May 2009 and buried in the outbuilding of the house he shared with German national Wagner and fellow Frenchmen Sebastian Bendou and Dominik Kocher. Bendou contacted Cheshire Police in May 2013 and led officers to Mr Borgye's body, which was wrapped in tarpaulin and encased in thick concrete. Officers said a low brick wall had been built inside the outhouse with three layers of concrete placed over the body. A post-mortem examination found My Borgye died from hammer blows to the head. He had been reported missing by a work colleague, but after launching an investigation police said they believed he had left the country. Det Sgt Steve Currie said the case had been ""complicated"" and ""devastating"" for Mr Borgye's family, but added ""the final jigsaw piece in this shocking crime is now in place."" Wagner was previously found not guilty of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial. However, was re-arrested in 2015 when new evidence came to light. Bendou, now 39, and Kocher, now 38, were given life sentences for murder with minimum terms of 14 and 23 years respectively in 2014.",1,836
"Demand for its drinks in Europe weakened, and a strong dollar ate into revenue from other markets outside the US, including Latin America. The company reported a 4 decline in profits to 1.89bn in the first quarter from 1.98bn in 2015. However, global sales volumes rose 2 in the first quarter. Its performance was helped by brands including Fanta and strength in still drinks such as bottled water and sports drinks. But the world's biggest drinks maker said that sales volume for drinks like Diet Coke and Cherry Coke declined in North America, Europe and the Middle East and Africa. ""Our operating results are driven by our commitment to sustainable growth, and we are confident that we have the right strategies in place to achieve our full-year outlook and drive long-term value for our system and shareowners,"" said chief executive officer Muhtar Kent. Coke's sales in Europe, its third biggest market, declined 1 in the quarter ended 1 April, while Latin America sales plunged 12.2. Sales in Asia Pacific, including China, dropped 4, but volumes increased after the company sharply cut prices. In Asia, pricing is expected to be a ""little volatile and bumpy"" in the coming quarters chief operating officer James Quincey said. Coke is banking on new marketing initiatives, such as the ""One Brand"" programme rolled out on Wednesday, to boost sales. All cans and bottles of Coca-Cola branded drinks will have a similar appearance, prominently featuring the red colour associated with regular Coke, but with a band of the colour for brands Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Coke Life.",1,837

"It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned. Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save rainforest from the interests of wealthy landlords. She had tried to block Moura's attempts to seize land and was shot six times. Moura, who was convicted in 2007 and 2010 in verdicts that were subsequently overturned, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In the latest trial, the judge said Moura had acted in a cold-blooded and cowardly manner. Prosecutors earlier said Moura and another rancher had hired gunmen to kill Ms Stang. Moura's lawyers argued there wasn't enough evidence linking him to the crime. The death of Ms Stang in the northern state of Para became a symbol of the violent conflict for natural resources in Brazil's Amazon region. In the past 30 years, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land disputes in Brazil, with some two-thirds of the murders happening in Para. Ahead of the latest verdict, Ms Stang's sister, Barbara Richardson, said the repeated trials had been upsetting but had helped maintain a spotlight on the issues. ""That keeps the injustice of the system before the people's eyes,"" she told AP. ""Dorothy is ever prominent. The people understand what happened to her and what this means.""",1,839
"Simmons, 52, was suspended in September for questioning the continued omissions of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard. He issued a public apology to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB).

"The couple, from Halstead, suffered ""life-changing"" injuries during ""two hours of torture"" on 26 April. Kent Police said the woman remains in a critical condition and the man is still being treated for his injuries. The couple were told family members would be killed if they did not give the gang what they wanted. The computer-generated image was created with the help of one of the victims.

"New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed vast numbers of the world's bees. Scientists at Paignton Zoo are researching how the breed has survived the mite. The zoo hopes its findings will help protect colonies and encourage more bee keepers to take on the Cornish breed. Colonies of the bees have been moved to the zoo to monitor their health over the summer. The mites act as tiny incubators of one deadly form of the disease, and inject it directly into the bees' blood. Michael Bungard from the zoo said: ""It's important that zoos look in our own backyard. ""Our bee project is predominantly education, so we can get the message across about the Cornish black bees and the varroa mite.""",1,844

"He said it ""makes sense"" for pay to be handled by AMs and Welsh ministers as education is already devolved. The Welsh Government described the move - part of planned changes to the Wales Bill which sets out the next steps for Welsh devolution - as ""encouraging."" But two major teaching unions say they are opposed to the idea, fearing lower pay than in England. The move is one of several improvements demanded by First Minister Carwyn Jones for the bill, which the Welsh Government says it is not yet ready to support. The announcement was made as the much-criticised bill, which makes significant changes to the way power is shared between Wales and Westminster, returned to the House of Lords for debate on Monday. ""Education is a devolved matter, and it makes sense for the assembly and Welsh ministers to decide the pay and conditions of teachers' in Wales,"" Mr Cairns said. The amendment to the bill on teachers' pay will be debated next Monday. Powers over the community infrastructure levy - which allows councils to raise cash for local improvements - will also be devolved, Mr Cairns added, with further changes promised in the coming weeks. ""I want a clear and lasting devolution settlement that works for Wales and for the UK as a whole,"" he said, adding he was happy to consider devolving further powers ""where there's a clear purpose for doing so."" However Geraint Davies, Wales official for the NASUWT union, said teachers in Wales were ""best served by a continuous link with Westminster."" He said: ""We strongly believe that if pay and conditions were devolved there is every danger that teachers here could end up being paid less than across the border for doing the same job."" Mr Davies added if wages were higher in England there was also a risk of teachers leaving Wales to further their careers. Owen Hathway, policy officer for NUT Cymru, also said his members were opposed to the move. ""We are fearful that we will have terms and conditions that are depressed and will lead to lower wages,"" he said. ""When you think there is a teaching shortage in England, if you pay them more in England it could lead to a brain drain of teachers going across the border. ""But the political will is there for it to happen."" Earlier in October, Mr Jones told Mr Cairns the UK government's approach to the legislation would ""heavily"" influence whether his government recommends the bill to the assembly - saying he was not yet ready to do so. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""As the first minister's recent letter to the Secretary of State (Alun Cairns) made clear, we are not currently in a position to support the bill and there are a number of obstacles still to overcome. ""However, these are encouraging amendments from the UK Government, and we note with interest the promise of further changes in the coming weeks."" During the debate concerns were also raised about a lack of power Wales has over it courts and prisons. Lord Wigley said it was not acceptable there was no crown court west of Swansea, or between Swansea and Caernarfon, and no crown court between Merthyr and Mold. He added: ""Wales is able to decide on the siting of its schools and hospitals, but not on its courts and prisons."" Baroness Morgan, shadow minister for Wales in the House of Lords, said it was premature to talk about establishing a separate legal jurisdiction for Wales, but said the issue did need to be addressed. Lord Wigley withdrew his amendment on legal jurisdiction, but said he hoped the focus would remain on such issues.",1,846
"Media playback is not supported on this device Set 136 to win, Pakistan reached their target inside 15 overs, with Sharjeel Khan (59) and Khalid Latif (59 not out) sharing an opening stand of 107. It is England's joint-second biggest T20 defeat in terms of balls remaining and the third time they have lost by nine wickets. The home side earlier limped to 135-7, losing six wickets for 54 runs, and at one stage went more than seven overs without finding the boundary. This was a disappointing night at the end of an otherwise successful limited-overs summer for England, one in which they have won one-day series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, as well as the only T20 against the former. Here, on an ideal batting surface, they could not get on top of a Pakistan attack whose four pace bowlers cleverly varied their length and pace, along with left-arm spinner Imad Wasim, who did not concede a boundary. Then the dazzling strokeplay of Sharjeel and Latif delighted a packed, partisan and deafening Old Trafford, ending Pakistan's tour on a considerable high. Defending a modest total, England needed everything to go their way in the field. Instead they were hit by a storm of boundaries from Sharjeel and Latif. Whereas England struggled to find the fence - they hit only 10 fours and one six - Pakistan's first 36 runs came exclusively in fours, in the space of four overs. Left-hander Sharjeel and his right-handed partner Latif took advantage as England too often dropped short, with captain Eoin Morgan forced to turn to Joe Root's occasional off-spin inside the powerplay. When Morgan called on his frontline spinners, Sharjeel twice lofted Adil Rashid over the mid-wicket fence to reach a 30-ball half-century. Rashid at least had Sharjeel sky to Moeen Ali at cover, then had a stumping chance missed by Jos Buttler to reprieve Babar Azam. But by then, the result was not in doubt, Latif clubbing Moeen over cow corner to complete his half-century in 36 balls and Babar hitting Liam Plunkett for four to seal the win. England's problems began long before then, in a batting effort that was stifled by the accuracy, variation and execution of Pakistan's five bowlers. Alex Hales and Jason Roy added 56 for the first wicket but, after Roy was given lbw reverse-sweeping the brilliant Imad for 21, England slipped to 110-6. Hales was bowled by Imad for 37 before the quartet of pacemen, three of whom are left-armers, took over. Using changes of pace, Hasan Ali had Joe Root and Ben Stokes caught at third man and deep square leg respectively, while the excellent Wahab Riaz had Morgan edge behind and Buttler slap to deep point. In all of this, England went from the end of the 10th over to midway through the 18th without finding the rope. When David Willey finally hit Sohail Tanvir to the mid-wicket fence, it was the only boundary England hit in the second half of their innings. England captain Eoin Morgan on BBC Test Match Special: ""Probably the last two overs of our innings and the first three of Pakistan's, the conditions really did change. We got it wrong with the toss. ""Pakistan bowled really well and we were about 15 short on the wicket we batted on. On the wicket we bowled on, we would have needed 185."" England coach Trevor Bayliss on Sky Sports: ""The game was all about momentum. The way we were going allowed Pakistan to get on top. We didn't show urgency with our running. We played like pretty boys at one stage. ""It is a concern if we do lose the last game of a series. We want to win every game. You can coach all you want but it's got to come from within."" Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed on BBC Test Match Special: ""First of all, credit must go to the players, who have responded really well. The bowlers bowled really well and then so did Sharjeel and Khalid. ""The crowd was really good. It was like playing a home game.""",1,847
"The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices. But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech industry chief told the Commons science and technology committee. Antony Walker, of techUK, said anything that connected to the internet could ""in theory"" be hacked into. In the future, this could include driverless cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so-called Internet of Things - said Mr Walker. He said the Home Office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls ""equipment interference,"" highlighting recent concerns about ""smart toys"" that connect to the internet and have microphones and cameras built-in. ""A range of devices that have been in the news recently, in relation to a hack, are children's toys, that children can interact with,"" he told the committee. ""These are devices that may sit in a child's bedroom but are accessible. ""In theory, the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices. ""So the potential extent, I think, is something that needs to be carefully considered."" In November, electronic toy company Vtech had its app store database hacked, allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children's names, dates of birth and gender. Talking dolls, such as Hello Barbie and My Friend Cayla, have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months. Barbie manufacturer Mattel reportedly made modifications to Hello Barbie, which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection, after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it. The police, security services, HM Revenue and Customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant. This allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphones, track locations, listen to calls, or even switch on microphones and cameras, allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby. The Home Office says these powers, the existence of which were revealed earlier this year following a court case, have ""made a vital contribution to counter the increased threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism and have also enabled the disruption of paedophile-related crime,"" according to a Home Office fact sheet. The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would put ""equipment interference"" warrants on a firmer legal footing and make sure they are ""only used when necessary and proportionate for a legitimate purpose."" A revised bill will be introduced to Parliament in the New Year, following consultation and scrutiny by the industry and other interested parties. Mr Walker, whose organisation represents 850 UK technology firms, told MPs it needed to be more forward-looking and less vague about the limits of surveillance. ""When we start to think, not just about the world today, but the world in five, 10 years' time as the Internet of Things becomes more real, and more pervasive. ""I think it requires careful thought in terms of where the limits should be.""",1,848

"Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge. Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected over charges relating to the footage sent to relatives. Mr Weatherhogg, 43, was jailed last May after being found guilty by a jury. It is understood he will now be released from prison. Sheriff George Way had remitted the case from Dundee Sheriff Court to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers. Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: ""We are satisfied the concession is well made."" Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration. Lady Dorrian said the appeal judges were also satisfied that misdirections given to jurors by Sheriff Way over the charges relating to the footage sent to relatives were ""material and constituted a miscarriage of justice."" Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet.

"Ward was on loan with the Terriers from Liverpool in the Championship and does not want to leave after his penalty shoot-out heroics helped take them up. The 23-year-old's saves helped them beat Sheffield in the semi-final and Reading in the play-off final. ""On a selfish point, yes, I would like to stay at Huddersfield,"" said Ward. ""I am only young for a goalkeeper and to have a chance of playing week-in week-out in the Premier League would be good experience for someone of my age.""

"He wanted a tribunal to approve a move to a Scottish prison, but Ashworth Hospital said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the Merseyside top-security facility. Brady, now 75, and Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, tortured and murdered five children. He was jailed for three murders in 1966 and has been at Ashworth since 1985. He and Hindley later confessed to another two murders. Judge Robert Atherton, who headed the three-person mental health tribunal at Ashworth, said: ""The tribunal has concluded that Mr Ian Stewart Brady continues to suffer from a mental disorder which is of a nature and degree which makes it appropriate for him to continue to receive medical treatment, and that it is necessary for his health and safety and for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment in hospital, and that appropriate medical treatment is available for him."" The reasons for the tribunal's decision will be released later. By Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent Ashworth Hospital argued that Brady was after ""a win"" over the authorities. This decision, which denies him that victory, comes down to the very narrow legal remit that had to be fulfilled by his mental health tribunal. The panel had one simple duty: to assess the patient's health and what would be clinically right for him. So although we have not yet seen the full reasons, the tribunal's decision means it has decided that Brady is still suffering from paranoid schizophrenia or another treatable disorder. Once it had come to that conclusion, it could further rule that it would be appropriate to keep Brady at Ashworth, either to receive treatment or because it would be necessary for his own safety or those of others. It's going to be very difficult for him to challenge the decision because he can only launch an appeal if he can show that the tribunal got the law wrong. Brady has the right to challenge the decision. Dr David Fearnley, medical director at Ashworth, said: ""We appreciate the time and effort the mental health tribunal has given to this case and its judgment is consistent with the expert opinions of our clinicians. ""Mr Brady suffers from a severe personality disorder and a mental illness which still require high-quality care. ""It is a testament to the staff of Ashworth Hospital that we have been able to stabilise his schizophrenia to the degree we have. However, his condition is chronic and will require this support for the foreseeable future."" Asked if the tribunal, which was held in public at Brady's request, may have exacerbated the illness, Dr Fearnley said: ""I think the difficulty with an individual such as Ian Brady is that he has a complex mental disorder and for many years has been able to publicise his concerns. ""However, we see this as part of an overall problem which our experts are looking into and will continue to provide expert care."" Brady has been on a hunger strike since 1999, and appeared at the tribunal with his feeding tube in place. The tribunal heard that he also eats some food on ""most days."" Dr Fearnley said his treatment was under review by the specialist team, including the issue of feeding. Brady and Hindley's crimes of sexual abuse, torture and murder of children shocked the nation. Lesley Ann Downey, 10, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, and Pauline Reade, 16, were all sexually assaulted before their deaths at the hands of the couple. Their bodies were buried on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester, although Keith Bennett's body was never found. Their final victim, Edward Evans, 17, was murdered in front of Hindley's 17-year-old brother-in-law, who alerted the police. Keith's mother, Winnie Johnson, made repeated calls for Brady to reveal the location of his grave. She died last year, aged 78, without knowing where her son's remains are. Her solicitor John Ainley said he thought she would have been ""satisfied"" by the tribunal's decision. ""She always felt that Ian Brady did not give the children any choice and consequently he should not have the choice to leave the hospital environment."" Terry Kilbride, the brother of John, said Brady should stay in hospital. ""I don't believe he's going to kill himself, that's just a ploy, just another wind-up. ""I think to be honest he should go back to hospital, I think that's where he belongs, in the hospital, and keep him alive as long as possible because it's only him that knows where Keith Bennett is."" Brady gave evidence for more than four hours at the tribunal, which sat at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Maghull. It was the first time he had spoken in public for 47 years. Brady had told the tribunal he used ""method acting"" to trick doctors into classing him as insane so he could be transferred from prison to hospital. But he said he now wanted to leave Ashworth because he hated it and ""the regime has changed to a penal warehouse."" The tribunal heard from Brady's lawyer that Brady had a severe personality disorder but was not mentally ill and could be treated in prison rather than hospital. During his evidence, Brady refused to answer a question from his own lawyer about whether he intended to take his own life if he was declared fit to return to prison.

"Seven people have denied conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth PS144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011. Matthew Davies, 33, of Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he suffered injuries in a ""genuine"" crash. A guitar worth PS1,850 was also damaged, he said. On Monday, the court heard Mr Davies, who runs a valeting business, expressed his disapproval of personal injury claims during an interview about his own. ""It's not something I agree with,"" he said at the time. ""I understand the reflection that personal injuries and claims have on the price of people's insurance policies."" The prosecution said he was also recorded as having stated everyone else ""is doing it, so I'm going to put one (a claim) in."" Mr Davies told the court he and fellow defendant, Adam Fear, 27, also of Pontypridd, played together in a band called Heroes and Outlaws. They went for a jam session at a home on Shelley Walk in Rhydyfelin, Pontypridd, on 15 October 2010, Mr Davies said. He told the court the pair were later driving out of the area when Mr Fear's car collided with a BMW at the junction of Dyffryn Road and Cardiff Road. When asked whether he was telling the truth and the crash was genuine he said: ""Yes, it was."" The court heard Mr Davies attended his GP a week later. ""Initially, I was fine but on the Sunday and Monday evening I could not sleep very well. I had numbness in my fingers and ringing in my ears,"" he said. He also told medics he was suffering with neck and back pain after the alleged accident. Mr Davies visited Caerphilly Miners' Hospital on 3 November 2010, having consulted with a firm of injury specialist lawyers. When quizzed by prosecutor Christopher Clee, Mr Davies said he had ""no idea"" why details about his injuries and the accident appeared to differ in the various medical notes. Mr Davies told the court he discovered his Gibson Les Paul Custom electric guitar was damaged only when collecting it from the wrecked vehicle after the crash. He said it only later occurred to him that he might make an insurance claim on it but, as he had failed to find a receipt, he ended up having to ""cut his losses"" and accept an offer of PS300 for the damaged instrument. His fellow band mate Mr Fear has already told the court he is innocent of conspiracy to defraud. The case continues.",1,855
"The Mercian Regiment said Private Derby XXXI was officially selected by the Duke of Devonshire from his flock at the Chatsworth Estate, Derbyshire.

Private Derby XXXI, who will be based at RHQ Mercian, Lichfield, Staffordshire, is set to begin training for tasks including leading soldiers out on parade and marching out the players at Derby County. The animal's first public appearance will at an Aviva Premiership rugby union match between Worcester Warriors and Sale Sharks at Sixways Stadium, Worcester. The ram is the 31st mascot going back to the Indian Mutiny War in the mid-19th Century. The first Private Derby was acquired in 1858 by the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot and became the mascot of the Mercian Regiment when it formed in 2007.

The trust, which runs sites in Northumberland, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland, said it had written to the shop and removed the takeaway from its list of approved suppliers until the matter is resolved.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The Reds drew 2-2 at the Stadium of Light, less than 44 hours after beating title rivals Manchester City. ""I told the players if nobody wanted to play I would never speak about it and not tell anyone, but nobody came. That was a good thing,"" said Klopp. Match of the Day pundit Martin Keown said: ""Klopp looked tired himself."" The draw left Liverpool five points behind leaders Chelsea, who visit Tottenham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). Former Arsenal defender Keown said: ""The high-intensity game has taken it out of them but it has been a good half of the season for them."" Klopp said he ""does not know exactly what I saw"" during the draw at the Stadium of Light. Daniel Sturridge and Sadio Mane twice put the Reds ahead, but two Jermain Defoe penalties pegged them back. ""I'm not able to explain it,"" said Klopp. ""We can play better football but I'm not sure if you can play better with that break."" Klopp made just one change to his starting XI, with forward Sturridge coming in for injured midfielder Jordan Henderson in an altered formation. Liverpool covered a total of 118.63km as a team, outrunning Sunderland, who clocked up 115.89km. That is in keeping with their performances over the rest of the festive period, during which they ran 116.87km in beating Manchester City and 118.94km in their 4-1 win over Stoke on 27 December. Media playback is not supported on this device Sunderland manager David Moyes suggested Klopp would have been widely praised had he been responsible for the home side's tactics. Klopp described the Black Cats as ""the most defensive team I ever saw"" after his side won the reverse fixture at Anfield 2-0 in November. ""Maybe if I was a German manager, you might praise that, actually,"" said Moyes. ""If I had been German, you might have been saying,'great, you're doing something different'."" England striker Sturridge was forced off 10 minutes from full-time on his first Premier League start since October. However, Klopp is hopeful the 27-year-old, who has scored six goals in 14 club appearances this season, will be back sooner rather than later. ""He got a knock on his right ankle. I don't think it's too bad,"" said Klopp. Sturridge has had a series of injuries since signing from Chelsea in January 2013, including hip and thigh problems.",1,858
"Lara Clarke, from Brownhills, has previously made near-life-sized cakes of Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lawrence. Her latest creation, baked to celebrate the Defender model, fed 2,000 people at an event at the factory in Solihull on Monday. The half-scale replica weighed 600kg and featured working headlights. Comprising 32 sponge cakes, 50kg (110 lbs) of butter cream, 20kg (44 lbs) of ganache and 50kg icing, it took her 150 hours to produce. Ms Clarke said the bake was so heavy it had to be delivered by fork lift truck. ""We arrived by van and everyone was coming round to have a look,"" she said. ""They couldn't believe it was a cake. There was plenty to go round and everyone on the factory floor got a piece."" It was baked to celebrate the two millionth Defender rolling off the production line - the figure includes its predecessors the Series I, II and III models. Ms Clarke said it started after she tagged JLR in a tweet about a small Land Rover birthday cake. ""They got in touch and asked if I could make a cake in the shape of an engine to mark the opening of their new engine plant. ""A woman then asked me if I could make a Land Rover cake. ""It was originally meant to be quite small, but I asked them if they wanted something that would really impress people."" Ms Clarke said she was getting married in October, a week before the Cake International competition at Birmingham's NEC. Rather than enter this year, she said she planned to bake ""the best wedding cake that's ever been seen.""",1,859

Members of the public told police the shot was fired at a dark coloured car by a white man in a grey hooded top who was on foot. A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said local hospitals had been checked and ""no-one has sought medical attention for injuries caused by a firearm."" She said officers were making house-to-house inquiries and studying CCTV footage of the area. Ch Supt Harrison said the attack ""appears to be targeted"" and was particularly worrying as ""a child could have been seriously injured or worse."" He said police wanted to hear from those inside the car ""so we know they are safe.""

Pogba, who re-signed for United for a world-record PS89m in August, referred to his performance against the Reds with a Facebook post on Monday, saying: ""I'd like to thank the supporters who are always there and keep believing in me. At least we did not lose."" Former Sweden striker Ibrahimovic, 35, has 4.3m followers on Twitter, which is 1.24m more than Pogba.

""If you want to play at the top, the pressure is 24 hours and if you play well the pressure becomes even greater."" Ibrahimovic said pressure from the press and fans has little impact on top players, adding that he personally puts more pressure on himself. ""I want to be more than perfect, in every game and even in training,"" he added. Ibrahimovic's equaliser on Sunday was his 14th Premier League goal of the season. It puts the former Barcelona and Inter Milan forward level with Chelsea's Diego Costa and Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League Golden Boot standings. ""Me winning something and not my team-mates is not the way I want it,"" he added.

"It's known as a technique called ""cupping"" where heated cups are placed on the skin. Cupping is done by lighting flammable liquid in a small glass cup. Once the flame goes out, the drop in temperature creates suction, making the cups stick to the body. The suction pulls the skin away from the body and is thought to improve blood flow and leaves the red marks, which usually last for a few days. The most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, Michael Phelps, has been seen with the circles on his skin, as have various other athletes. It's not only athletes who use cupping, lots of celebrities have been spotted with what look like cupping marks. Athletes say they are using it to help with aches and pains, and to help them recover from constant training and competing. The British Acupuncture Council say cupping is not painful but they warn that the hot cups can cause mild burns on rare occasions. It has rules of practice for cupping, and advises people only to visit properly-trained people who are members of their organisation. So make sure you don't attempt this yourself.",1,863

"Some 1,500 officers have been deployed to the Olympic Stadium area, authorities have said. Officials are in high alert following Tuesday's attacks in Brussels. Last year, a friendly between Germany and the Netherlands in Hannover was called off two hours before its start due to a security threat, four days after the Paris attacks. One of the targets in Paris was the Stade de France, where Germany were playing France in a friendly match. Some 72,000 people are expected to attend Saturday's match in Berlin between two of the favourites for June's Euro 2016. In the hours ahead of the game, fans gathered around the stadium amid a heavy security presence. They face security checks and bag searches before entering the arena.

"From April 2016, those in England and Wales will have to pay a 3 surcharge on each stamp duty band. George Osborne said the new surcharge would raise PS1bn extra for the Treasury by 2021. Landlords reacted angrily to the change, saying it would ""choke off"" investment in rented properties. Other changes announced by the chancellor included an extended Help to Buy scheme in London, and more money for the Starter Homes programme. The stamp duty surcharge will lift each band by 3. That means that for properties worth between PS125,000 and PS250,000, where the stamp duty is 2, buy-to-let landlords will pay 5. For the average buy-to-let purchase of PS184,000, that means they will pay an extra PS5,520 from April 2016. Commercial property investors, with more than 15 properties, are expected to be exempt from the new charges. Buy-to-let landlords will also be hit by a change to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rules. From April 2019, they will have to pay any CGT due within 30 days of selling a property, rather than waiting till the end of the tax year, as at present. Landlords are already due to get a lower rate of tax relief on mortgage payments. In his summer Budget, the chancellor said that landlords would only receive the basic rate of tax relief - 20 - on mortgage payments, a change being phased in from 2017. Responding to the latest changes, Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association said: ""The chancellor's political intention is crystal clear; he wants to choke off future investment in private properties to rent. ""If it's the chancellor's intention to completely eradicate buy-to-let in the UK then it's a mystery to us why he doesn't just come out and say so."" Up to PS60m of the money raised from the stamp duty surcharge will go to help home-buyers in England in places where holiday homes have forced up local prices. The Help to Buy (equity loan) scheme in England will also be extended to 2021, one year longer than planned. An extension to the scheme in London will see buyers who can find a 5 deposit given a loan worth up to 40 of the property. The loan will be interest free for five years. Elsewhere the existing maximum loan is for 20 of the property's value. In total, the government will put an extra PS6.9bn into housing. This includes an extra PS2.3bn in loans for the government's starter homes programme, and PS4bn lent to housing associations and local authorities to build more homes for shared ownership. Another PS200m will be used to build homes for rent, which will allow tenants to save for a deposit. There will also be a pilot scheme to trial the government's Right to Buy programme for housing association tenants. Five housing associations will take part, to help design the final scheme.

"Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90 of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38 of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5 of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself ""Northern Irish."" That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as ""Northern Irish"" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72 to just 7. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97 Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99 Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99 Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92 Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51 Protestant backing and 36 Catholic support. Alliance's support for a ""designated days"" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44 backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35 wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10 told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2 opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73 of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64 of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45 of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.",1,867
"""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving around nimbly on crutches, putting everything into the training and drills. There are shouts for the ball, plenty of laughter but lots of hard work. After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. ""I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,"" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as ""brilliant."" ""That's what I want to give to youngsters,"" he says. ""Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it."" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then ""it doesn't matter what age you are."" Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. ""Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,"" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). ""The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football."" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. ""All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,"" Rebecca Sellar explains. ""So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it."" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: ""Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.""",1,868
"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had identified 33 local areas where pubs would not face sufficient competition after the deal. Heineken, which already owns 1,100 pubs, must submit plans to the CMA by 20 June or face an in-depth inquiry. However, the brewing giant said it would address the CMA's concerns. ""This decision by the CMA acknowledges that there are only a small number of local areas where competition may be diminished due to our acquisition of the pubs,"" said David Forde, managing director for Heineken UK. ""We are confident we can offer the CMA suitable undertakings to satisfy their concerns."" The preliminary CMA investigation concluded that the deal would not damage the chances of Heineken's competitors selling their own products, as the pubs being bought only make up 4 of the market. It also felt that it was unlikely Heineken would reduce the choice of beer and cider available in the Punch pubs, as this could lead it to lose business.",1,869

"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had ""ironclad information"" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and ""pushed hard"" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was ""just not true,"" but he hoped the resolution would ""serve as a wake-up call"" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements ""has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace."" Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. ""It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,"" he said. ""We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families.... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict."" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as ""misleading critiques"" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution ""paves the way"" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. ""We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,"" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",1,871
"Five Give Up the Booze, Five Go Gluten Free, Five Go On A Strategy Away Day and Five Go Parenting will catch up with the sleuthing children as adults. The series, written by Bruno Vincent, follows on from the success of the recent Ladybird book spoofs for adults. The original 21 books featured Julian, George, Dick, Anne and their dog Timmy. Their escapades, set during the'40s and'50s, saw the children having virtually adult-free outdoor holidays where they solved mysteries while drinking lashings of ginger beer. Famous titles include Five on a Treasure Island and Five Go to Smuggler's Top. A film parody, Five Go Mad in Dorset, was also made by the Comic Strip team for Channel 4 and featured Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French and Adrian Edmondson. They went on to make another film called Five Go Mad on Mescalin. The books have also been made into films, TV series and cartoons, as well as audiobooks, comics and video games. Publisher Quercus said the five's grown-up adventures will ""remind older readers of the unbreakable bond"" between the children and ""introduce newer readers to the spiffing time you can have with a few friends and a dog."" It added the series brings characters - who are ""posher than us and holidayed more than us"" into our ""baffling adult world."" Their adult adventures will involve trying to give up alcohol, finding themselves on a puzzling ""strategy away day,"" hunting for a good gluten-free cream tea and, ""most perilous of all,"" preparing for parenthood. Anne McNeil of Enid Blyton Entertainment added they were ""thrilled"" with the new books, adding: ""We are certain Enid Blyton would have delighted in the gentle parody of her characters - characters which have helped to create a multi-million-selling global brand."" The books will be released in hardback on 3 November. The Famous Five series is among some of Blyton's most famous books, which also include Noddy and The Faraway Tree. In all, she produced more than 700 books, writing one a week at the peak of her powers. The British writer, who was born in 1897 and died in 1968, has sold more than 600 million books in total, which have been translated into 90 languages. In 2008, a survey by the Costa Book Awards saw Blyton voted the ""most-loved author,"" beating Roald Dahl, JK Rowling and Jane Austen.

Murray is as relaxed about that as he has been this week at the ATP event in Indian Wells, where he has progressed to the quarter-finals. He loosened up in more ways than one as he chatted to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller and BBC Scotland's Kheredine Idessane in the commentary box... ""It is three weeks on Saturday, that's all I know. Tennis players aren't normally very good with dates. ""We just know it is the Indian Wells week or the Monte Carlo week or whatever. So I know it is the weekend before Monte Carlo and the weekend after Miami. ""We will probably do the honeymoon later in the year, probably in the off-season. I am not sure where we're going to go yet, but there's a few ideas. ""I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. ""So I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. ""I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way."" ""My brother Jamie's one. Ross Hutchins is also going to be a best man and hopefully a good friend in Barcelona [Peruvian Carlos Mier, who was Murray's room-mate at the Sanchez-Casal Academy]. ""But I'm not sure yet if he [Mier] is going to be able to come. He's in Singapore just now and I'm going to try to get him over. ""Kim has four bridesmaids and no maid of honour and I was saying,'imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends you've had since you were at school'. ""It is very, very difficult to choose one. She was like'go on, pick one', but I said no. ""I didn't spend a lot of time with my brother when we were 15 to 20 really, because he was training in France and I was training in Spain. ""Carlos, he was my best friend during that time, which were very important years in my life, when I moved away from my family and friends. ""He was the guy who was always there for me. I feel like he knows me extremely well. ""My brother obviously knows me from a child - and Ross over the last six or seven years. We've become extremely close and been through a lot together as well. ""Picking one was a very difficult thing to do because I had three guys that were clearly my three best friends and I would like all them to be involved in some way."" ""It looks a lot easier from up here, that's for sure. It's extremely simple. Every shot looks easy when you're watching from the commentary box, but it certainly isn't. ""The one thing I think I would do as a commentator is give more credit to the players, because I have a good idea how tricky the conditions are here. But I don't think I have the voice to be a good broadcaster.""",1,874

The Whites travel to the Madejski Stadium six points behind Reading and five points off the play-off places. The fixture has been rearranged after the original meeting on 30 December was abandoned because of fog at half-time, with the score 0-0. Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire: ""Sometimes you lose a couple of games in succession, that's football. But it's about the mentality in the team. Are you mentally strong to turn it around and start winning games again? ""Fulham have got a great team, play very good possession football as well and we know that and everyone else is aware of it. ""We need to make sure we play well and try and make it difficult for them. ""There's a lot of games coming up at the moment, but after a loss, it's good to play again quickly as you have a chance to redeem yourself."" Fulham goalkeeper David Button told BBC Radio London: ""The abandonment was a bit strange. It was lucky the game was level because otherwise I'm sure it would have been a bit controversial. ""We have to show Reading respect because they are ahead of us in the table. They play a similar passing style to us, so we are wary of them. ""We are hopeful we can get in the play-offs. They are in our way to achieving what we want. We want their play-off spot and are not afraid of talking about it."" BBC Radio Berkshire's Tim Dellor Reading's meetings with Fulham over the last couple of years have never been dull. Last year the two sides drew 2-2 at the Madejski Stadium. Reading's most recent trips to Craven Cottage have ended in heavy defeats. Expect goals. According to the BBC Weather forecast, we should also expect mist. Reading go into the game having lost two consecutive Championship games for the first time since August. Jaap Stam will want to avert any slide quickly. Defensively, Reading have looked particularly vulnerable lately. Fulham have a play-off spot in their sights and will move to seventh with a win. The stats and the history point to this being a huge game in the context of both sides' seasons.",1,875
"28 June 2016 Last updated at 08:03 BST On 1 July 1916, British soldiers started fighting in the Battle of the Somme. The people in charge said that the battle had to happen to win the war.

Martin has been to the trenches in northern France to find out what happened.",1,876
"During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK. He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees. Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge. Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London. His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton. They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised. In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics. He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin. In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London. His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees. He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France. British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home. He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home. Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories. Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy. ""The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,"" he said. ""It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help. ""I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had."" In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden. The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two. ""Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,"" Winton later recalled. ""None of the 250 children on board was seen again. ""We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through."" Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned. He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children. In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend. Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them. Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport. In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. A train dubbed ""The Winton Train"" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital. In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion. In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: ""In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today."" It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis: ""In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed. ""The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care.""",1,877
"Another 130 people were wounded in what authorities said was a ""premeditated, violent terrorist attack."" Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought Xinhua said. City officials said evidence implicated militants from the western region of Xinjiang, but this was not verified. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have sent condolences to the victims and their families. President Xi urged ""all-out efforts"" to investigate the attack. ""Severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance,"" Xinhua quoted the president as saying. Witnesses said that the men, who were mostly dressed in black, attacked people at random. A survivor named Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the back and chest, told Xinhua he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers rushed into the station. ""I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,"" he said. He added that those too slow to flee were cut down. Some who escaped were desperately looking for missing loved ones. Yang Ziqing told Xinhua she and her husband had been waiting for a train to Shanghai ""when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them."" ""I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,"" she said. Social media users in China posted pictures of the attack on the internet, but correspondents say they are being taken down. Images seen by the BBC show men and women lying on the floor in pools of blood following the attack. Kunming officials, quoted by Xinhua, later said that evidence at the scene showed it was ""a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces."" Xinjiang is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group which has a long history of discord with Chinese authorities. State broadcaster CCTV said top security official Meng Jianzhu would travel to Kunming to oversee the handling of the investigation.",1,878
"Boyle struck the only goal in the 18th minute after lobbing over Graham Doyle following a moment of hesitancy in the Wexford defence. Derry needed fine saves from Gerard Doherty to stay ahead as the keeper denied Conor O'Keeffe and Paul Murphy. Josh Daniels also headed a Gary Delaney effort off the line in the second half as Derry endured some nervous moments. Derry did go close to adding to their lead in the final five minutes of the game as Aaron McEneff clipped the Wexford crossbar with a long-range shot and substitute Jordan Allan fired just wide. Kenny Shiels' side suffered a blow in the second half as goalscorer Boyle was forced off by an apparent hamstring injury.

"He was chairman for 16 years, during which time the club enjoyed an 11-year stint in the Premier League and two Uefa Cup campaigns. ""This is a very sad day for everyone,"" said Brett Warburton, vice-chairman of the Championship club. ""Phil has been a personal friend for more than 30 years. We send our deepest condolences to all Phil's family."" In November, Gartside handed responsibility for Bolton's takeover negotiations to football finance executive Trevor Birch. Birch has been trying to to find a buyer as owner Eddie Davies wants to sell, with the club PS172.9m in debt. Former Bolton player and assistant manager Phil Brown recalled Gartside taking part in a training session, with a suit on, before the Sherpa Van Trophy final in 1989. ""He just wanted to be part and parcel of a successful club, a successful team,"" Brown, now Southend manager, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""To go from that to become chairman of the club in 1999 and obviously the most successful period the club has ever had, culminating in two great years in Europe.... it was just fantastic for Phil and his family. Today is a very, very sad day for the club."" Former Trotters captain Kevin Davies, who retired last year, said Gartside was ""really ambitious"" for the club. He said: ""Everyone enjoyed the journey. To be around, he was kind and looked to put his arm around the players."" Davies said people may have differing opinion about Gartside's legacy but said he and former manager Sam Allardyce had certainly changed ""the direction the club was going in."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Born in Leigh, Gartside was at the helm for one of the most amazing periods in Bolton's long and colourful history. With Eddie Davies providing the funds and Allardyce the managerial expertise, Gartside helped take Bolton into the Premier League in 2001, to the League Cup final in 2004 and Europe twice in three seasons after that. A sixth-place finish in 2004-05 - with a squad that included Jay-Jay Okocha, Ivan Campo and Fernando Hierro - was an incredible effort for a club that could not rely on crowds of 25,000 even when things were going that well. Allardyce's resignation in 2007 proved to be the beginning of the end of the good times for Bolton. Though they retained top-flight status for another four seasons, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 2011, they never finished in the top half again. By 2012, they had gone down, relegated at the end of a desperate season. Allardyce's replacement, Sammy Lee, lasted 14 games. Gary Megson and Owen Coyle could not halt the slide. Dougie Freedman could not secure a play-off berth in Bolton's first season as a Championship club and was replaced by Neil Lennon in October 2014. Despite Davies agreeing to write off the club's debts as he looks for a way out, Bolton's financial situation has been described by Birch as ""critical."" That is the legacy Gartside has left. Sadly for him, it will be some time before Bolton fans can look past the current mess and remember the glorious nights against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid that he helped create. Had Gartside got his way, British football could have looked very different. He was a Premier League representative on the Football Association executive board in 2009, when he put forward a proposal for Celtic and Rangers to be allowed to join the English league. The plan was to form a'Premier League Two' as a buffer for clubs - such as Bolton - who were unable to retain their top-flight status. It was never formally discussed because of opposition from Uefa and many other Premier League clubs.",1,881
"Slovakia is launching a legal challenge to mandatory quotas that were passed in a majority vote on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister has proposed a radical budgetary revamp to raise funds. The summit will focus on tightening EU borders and aiding neighbours of Syria, from where many migrants come. The talks were continuing well into the night, having started just after 19:00 Brussels time (17:00 GMT). Draft proposals seen by the BBC, that are being discussed at the summit, include: European Council President Donald Tusk called for ""a concrete plan"" to secure the EU's external borders, ""in place of the arguments and the chaos we have witnessed in the past weeks."" As she arrived at the summit, Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite said it was ""not a lack of European unity, but a lack of European wisdom"" that had led to this point. On arriving, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would be giving another PS100m (152m) to help Syrian refugees, including PS40m towards the World Food Programme. ""We need to do more to stabilise the countries and the regions from which these people are coming,"" he said. The UK has opted against taking part in the relocation scheme and has its own plan to resettle migrants directly from Syrian refugee camps. The scale of the problem was highlighted again on Wednesday when Croatia revealed that 44,000 migrants - including 8,750 on Tuesday - had arrived there since Hungary completed a fence along its border with Serbia last week. Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC Europe correspondent As thousands of people continue to arrive on European shores, EU leaders are trying to focus on longer term solutions, to try to stem the flow. The EU can't ignore the divisions and disagreements that have emerged in the last few weeks between member states that have different ideas about how this crisis should be confronted. One EU official said there was a need to clean up the bad blood around the table. Progress may be made this evening, but it will take years of political engagement to make a significant difference. And there will be more bumps in the road. Relocation deal explained Hungary proposes its own deal Why central Europe says'No' One young Syrian's story On Tuesday, in a rare move for an issue involving national sovereignty, EU interior ministers approved the resettlement scheme by majority vote rather than unanimous approval. The deal will see thousands of migrants moved from Italy and Greece to other EU countries. A proposal to take 54,000 migrants from Hungary was dropped. The plan's opponents have lashed out. However, Czech PM Bohuslav Sobotka said on Wednesday it would not launch a court challenge, adding: ""Europe must not fall apart on the migration crisis."" Romania said it could manage its allocation but President Klaus Iohannis insisted mandatory quotas were not the answer. The UN has warned that the relocation alone would not be enough to stabilise the situation. Close to 480,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea this year, and are now reaching European shores at a rate of nearly 6,000 a day. Austrian police told the BBC at least 7,000 people arrived from Hungary on Wednesday. Source: European Commission How is migrant crisis dividing EU? EU migration: Crisis in graphics A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",1,882

The union is against plans for a new grade of on-board supervisor and proposals for drivers to operate doors. Govia Thameslink said there would be no job losses or cuts in salary and the changes would make staff more visible. Members of the union were 306 in favour of walkouts and 14 against. A total of 320 votes to one backed other forms of industrial action. The RMT said it was fighting to keep the conductor grade and the changes were ""nothing short of bullying and harassment."" RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the ""reward"" for the ""loyal and professional service"" of members was having their ""role and responsibility reduced and their hard-earned terms and conditions attacked."" ""These trains are desperately over-crowded and the conductors are the eyes and ears preventing a major tragedy on the platforms and carriages,"" he said. He added the company had already axed catering services, ""threatened"" ticket offices and delivered ""appalling levels of customer service in their drive to milk these routes for every penny they can."" A spokesman for Southern, which is run by Govia Thameslink, described any possible strike action as ""unnecessary and damaging."" He added: ""The changes we are making to the conductor role mean there will be no job losses and no reduction in salary for any staff, whilst passengers will benefit from having more visible staff on trains.

"That phrase hinted both at an ideal flexible arrangement in the future and an ideal shared approach from both the UK and Irish governments, together stressing to the EU the paramount importance of doing nothing that might constitute any kind of risk to the political progress made over recent decades. But is that seamless approach unravelling and could Brexit become a source of greater friction between the two governments? Both the Brexit Secretary David Davis and DUP leader Arlene Foster have been fond of talking about technology as the answer to Ireland's post-Brexit problems. Yes, they acknowledge, putting old-style customs checkpoints right on the border would be unacceptable for both political and security reasons. However, they then go on to suggest that provided businesses co-operate with computerised trusted trader schemes, and cameras with number plate recognition capability are installed some distance away from the frontier, all will be well. By contrast, the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has now warned that technology isn't the answer. Instead, he argues there is a need for a wider political agreement. What does that mean? On the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond hinted that the Irish favour moving customs controls to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border. This might sound geographically sensible, but the political implications should not be underestimated. Arlene Foster has previously said that putting a border down the middle of the Irish Sea, creating a divide between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, is something her party will not tolerate. So long as the DUP-Conservative parliamentary arrangement survives, that is a concern David Davis and Theresa May will have to take very seriously. But, if the DUP has the ear of the British government, then similarly as a loyal EU member state, Dublin has the ear of Michel Barnier's negotiating team. Since becoming foreign minister, Simon Coveney has not been shy about making his differences with the UK clear. He voiced his concern for Northern Ireland having special EU status, which contrasted with the position of his predecessor Charlie Flanagan. Some surmised this might only have been a slip of the tongue. However Mr Coveney's decision to let it be known he favoured a bespoke Irish Language Act (Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance's preference) over a hybrid bill (the DUP's suggestion) was a clear move to distance Dublin from the Northern Ireland Office's studied neutrality on the issue. If the border after Brexit becomes a more open source of arm wrestling between the two governments, that could have consequences - not just for the continuing UKEU negotiations, but also for the Stormont talks when they resume in earnest in the autumn.",1,884
"After no play was possible on the first day, Stevens led Kent to 389-7 after Essex's decision to bowl first. They had slipped to 208-6 with Essex seamer Matt Dixon taking two wickets in two balls with figures of 4-89. But Stevens shared a partnership of 108 with James Tredwell (39) and completed his 31st first-class ton in the final over of the day at Canterbury. It was an unflappable display from the 40-year-old, who was patient at first but then showed all his attacking prowess, at one point adding 26 in the space of nine balls faced. When Tredwell was lbw to Dixon, Stevens added an unbroken 73 with Matt Coles, giving Kent four bonus points and leaving them only two short of guaranteeing second place. The score at stumps was probably a fair reflection on the way Essex bowled - a one-paced attack short of a front-line spinner. Joe Denly (74) and Sam Northeast (56) shared 109 for the third wicket, taking advantage as Essex often over-pitched. Dixon, on his return to the first team, was the pick of the attack as he swung the ball at decent pace, removing Denly and Will Gidman in successive deliveries after Ravi Bopara trapped Sam Billings lbw. The mini-collapse from 204-3 to 208-6 had Essex in the game, only for Stevens to take it away from them. But what is now a three-day match will be difficult for either side to win.",1,885
"The mayor of London has been criticised for pedalling his barrister wife Marina Wheeler through the capital on Thursday on a bicycle designed for one person. Giving a backie is illegal under the terms of the 1998 Road and Traffic Act. Offenders can be fined up to PS200. The mayor has apologised, saying he did not know he was breaking the law. Sam Jones, from cycling charity CTC, said his actions were ""very naughty."" Mr Jones said: ""We wouldn't encourage other cyclists to carry passengers in such a fashion. We would never encourage cyclists to break the law."" The footage of Mr Johnson and his wife, obtained by the Sun newspaper, was shot by passengers in a passing car as the couple cycled along a road in North Kensington. It shows Ms Wheeler sitting on the saddle, without a helmet, holding her handbag as her husband stands on the pedals. After the passengers informed the mayor he was breaking the law, Mr Johnson stepped off the bike and said: ""Night, night,"" to them. They can be heard in the video asking the mayor: ""Mate, you all right? Saddling, that's a good one, eh?"" Another says: ""You're not allowed to do that, mate."" Section 24 of the Road and Traffic Act states: ""Not more than one person may be carried on a road on a bicycle not propelled by mechanical power unless it is constructed or adapted for the carriage of more than one person."" The mayor, whose responsibilities include London transport, is a keen cyclist and cycles available for public hire in London have gained the nickname ""Boris bikes."" Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The mayor wishes to apologise for offering his wife a short-lived lift on the back of his bike! ""He was unaware that he was apparently in contravention of the Road and Traffic Act. He wasn't intending to ride all the way home from North Kensington to North London with Marina on the back; rather he was attempting to transport his wife to a main road, from where they hailed a black cab for her. ""As everyone knows the mayor is a huge supporter of cycling, and an even bigger fan of the black cab trade, hence his desire to combine the two!""",1,886

"Media playback is not supported on this device City, who shocked Chelsea en route to last season's quarter-final, went ahead from Kyel Reid's 18-yard finish before James Hanson's angled strike. Sam Youngs went close for Chesham, who play in the seventh tier and were 104 places below League One Bradford. Despite a cameo from Chesham's Barry Hayles, 43, Gary Liddle and Devante Cole scored in injury time. Chesham reached the second round after claiming their first ever Football League club scalp by defeating League Two Bristol Rovers, one of Hayles' former teams. But once Reid fired the home side ahead after latching on to Hanson's knock-down, Chesham faced a long afternoon. Hanson fired in a second after racing on to Lee Evans' long pass to make it 2-0 just before the break. Second-half substitutes Liddle and Cole flicked in from close range to complete a straightforward afternoon for the Bantams. Bradford manager Phil Parkinson: ""We spoke to the lads about the experience of playing non-league teams last year and and what had to be done to get through. ""We enjoyed the fantastic ties against Chelsea and Sunderland last year, but a lot of hard work had to be done to earn those, and we've done it here. ""If we went back down to Chelsea we wouldn't argue with that. The lads involved and the fans around town are still talking about that cup run. ""They are fantastic memories and they are the reason why we are all professional footballers. Everyone at Bradford is delighted to be back in the hat."" Chesham manager Andy Leese: ""We started okay and the manner in which we let in those (first) two goals was a shame because they were so predictable. ""But there are over 100 places between the two sides and that was probably reflected in the score line. ""It was a huge positive for us to reach this round and make history and the finances are incredible, season-changing stuff. ""The excitement of the build-up to this game has been huge and there's a real sense of deflation in the dressing room. We have got a real pick-up job to do.""

"The world's number one aeroplane manufacturer made sales of 94.6bn, down 2, and net earnings of 4.9bn, 5 lower. It said revenues were likely to slip further in 2017, to between 90.5bn and 92.5bn. But the US company also expects to deliver more commercial aircraft and to improve its earnings per share. ""Looking forward, our team is intent on accelerating productivity and programme execution,"" said chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. In the period, Boeing made 748 commercial aircraft deliveries, down from 762 in 2015, claiming to have led the market for ""the fifth consecutive year."" It also delivered fewer military planes - in particular, its new CH-47 Chinook helicopter and its FA-18 fighter jet - while sales in the division slipped 7. Revenue also fell in the firm's space and services divisions because of weaker demand for satellites and aircraft modernisation. However, overall group earnings surged 59 in the fourth quarter of the year as demand for the company's commercial planes ticked up. Boeing also projected higher commercial deliveries this year of between 760 and 765 aircraft. The company's shares were up by more than 2 in early trading in New York.",1,891
"Mr Jepson, who died in August, began his affiliation with the club in the 1960s and was named president in 2004. The service took place at Headingley Stadium earlier. Rhinos chief executive Gary Hetherington said: ""Harry had a wonderful life and touched the lives of so many others."" Mr Jepson's love of the sport dated back to the 1920s when he first watched Hunslet at their Parkside Stadium. Leeds players past and present were amongst those to pay tribute to Mr Jepson during the service. Among those who spoke during the ceremony were Jamie Jones-Buchanan and Tony Currie, while former Leeds Rhinos and England captain Kevin Sinfield read Rudyard Kipling's poem'If'. The service was brought to a close by Lizzie Jones singing the Challenge Cup anthem'Abide With Me' as the hearse carrying Mr Jepson's coffin left the ground for a family service. Mr Hetherington said: ""He knew people who had been involved in the formation of the game in 1895, and his death coincides with the 121st anniversary of the game he loved so much. ""He was a Rugby League legend, despite never playing the game and his passing is so sad."" A book of remembrance has been opened for fans in the club shop.",1,892
"Greg Dyke has invited Astle's widow Laraine and his daughters, Claire and Dawn, to Wembley Stadium on 10 August. The ex-West Bromwich Albion and England forward died in 2002. A neurosurgeon said last month that he died from a brain condition linked to boxers rather than Alzheimer's disease as previously thought. Dawn Astle said: ""We want to stress the immediate message in dealing with head injuries and concussions, to discuss the FA's medical policies on this and work on player education. The issue] has to be taken seriously because it's about lives. ""It's not like a back or knee injury, because once the brain is damaged it doesn't repair itself and Dad is proof of that."" Ms Astle said Dr Willie Stewart, who carried out a new examination of Mr Astle's brain, would also be at the meeting. Astle's family have campaigned for the FA to carry out research into the risks of heading footballs and players suffering concussion. The Justice for Jeff group has also held protests at West Brom games. The FA previously apologised to the family for not keeping them informed about its work and said its rules on concussion were due to be changed ahead of the 201415 season. A spokesman for the FA said Mr Dyke ""had been keen to meet the Astle family for a long time"" to hear their concerns. It was initially believed Astle died from Alzheimer's disease, but the coroner at his inquest ruled his brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather balls. He played for West Bromwich Albion from scoring 137 goals in 292 league appearances.",1,893

"The report found that although alcohol consumption has dropped since 2008, those in poorer communities are more likely to suffer or die from alcohol-related disease. The coalition government rejected a minimum price for alcohol in 2013. Health ministers said they would look at the evidence carefully. The public health review says that alcohol is now more affordable and people are drinking more than they did 40 years ago, making it the leading risk factor for ill health, early death and disability in those aged 15 to 49 in England. More adults are non-drinkers but there are still more than 10 million people in England drinking at levels that could damage their health. The report suggests there were 167,000 years of working life lost to alcohol in 2015 - mainly among the young and middle-aged. It concludes that reducing the affordability of alcohol is the most cost-effective way of reducing alcohol harm. But a plan to introduce a minimum price of 45p per unit of alcohol was shelved by the coalition government three years ago. In 2014, a ban on the sale of alcohol below cost price, defined as alcohol duty plus VAT, came into force in England and Wales. Public Health England (PHE) says implementing a minimum unit price (Mup) is the answer because it ""is a highly targeted measure which ensures tax increases are passed on to the consumer and improves the health of the heaviest drinkers."" It also adds that combing Mup with an increase in taxation would lead to ""substantial reductions in harm and increases in government revenue."" The report also says there is little evidence to suggest that putting more information on labels on alcoholic drinks would lead to a reduction in alcohol-related harm. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ""While no one would want to interfere with the right of adults to enjoy a drink responsibly, this report shows clearly that the abuse of alcohol can cause significant health problems."" And it added that new official guidance on alcohol limits, which say that men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, allowed people to make informed choices. Prof Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said alcohol damaged more than just individuals. ""Excessive alcohol consumption can harm children, wreck families, impact on workplace colleagues and can be a burden and drain on the NHS and economy. ""This evidence review will help local and national government and public services like the police and NHS to develop policies designed to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol."" Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said she was hopeful that the evidence would be taken on board by government. ""The health harms of alcohol affect all sectors of society, but are felt most by the poorest and most vulnerable. ""All the evidence now points to Mup as one of the most effective potential ways to tackle these inequalities in harm."" In Scotland, laws for the minimum pricing for alcohol were passed in 2012 but have not yet been introduced because of a series of legal challenges. The Welsh Government has said it wants to set a minimum 50p charge per unit of drink but UK ministers say alcohol law should be controlled by Westminster.",1,896
"The 335ft (100m) Victorian structure, which closed last year, is one of the UK's shortest piers.

"Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA from ancient remains in the Caucasus has now revealed a fourth population that fed into the mix. Details are published in Nature Communications. Scientific advances in recent years have allowed researchers to retrieve and analyse genomes from ancient burials. The genome is the genetic blueprint for a human, contained within the nucleus of every cell. This deluge of data has transformed our understanding of the modern human genetic landscape. It has also shown that present-day genetic patterns are poor guides to ancient ones. The first layer of European ancestry, the indigenous hunter-gatherers, entered Europe before the Ice Age 40,000 years ago. But 7,000 years ago, they were swept up in a migration of people from the Middle East, who introduced farming to Europe. About 5,000 years ago, herders called the Yamnaya entered Europe from the eastern Steppe region - in present day Ukraine and Russia. These horse riding metal workers may have brought Indo-European languages with them; today this language family comprises most of the tongues spoken in Europe. The discovery of plague DNA in Yamnaya burials and a population decline in Europe around the same time has led some researchers to wonder if their passage west was facilitated by the spread of disease. The Yamnaya transformed the gene pools of northern and central Europe, such that some populations, like Norwegians, owe around 50 of their ancestry to these Steppe pastoralists. But the Yamnaya were themselves a mixed population. Around half of their ancestry came from a sister group to the hunter-gatherers who inhabited Europe before farming, while the other half appears to be from a population related to - but noticeably different from - the Middle Eastern migrants who introduced farming. Researchers have now analysed genomes from two hunter-gatherers from Georgia that are 13,300 and 9,700 years old. The results show that these Caucasus hunters were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamnaya. The Caucasus hunter-gatherer genomes show a continued mixture with their Middle Eastern cousins to the south, who would go on to invent farming 10,000 years ago. However, this mixing ended about 25,000 years ago - just before the time of the last glacial maximum, or peak of the Ice Age. At this point, populations shrank - as shown by their genes homogenising, a sign of breeding between those with increasingly similar DNA. Once the ice retreated, the Caucasus groups came into contact with a different group of hunter-gatherers living on the Steppe and mixed with them, laying the genetic foundations of the Yamnaya people. ""The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now,"" said co-author Dr Andrea Manica, from the University of Cambridge. ""We can now answer that as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation."" The researchers also suggest that the Caucasus hunter-gatherers influenced populations further east, particularly in South Asia. They suggest that this strand of ancestry may also have been associated with the spread of Indo-European languages to the region.",1,898
"A referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is to be held later this year. The survey indicates that only 11 of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland support a British exit (Brexit). That compares to 30 of those surveyed in the rest of the UK. The Chamber of Commerce has about 1,200 members in Northern Ireland. About 250 of those responded to the poll. More than half of the respondents (60) said that Prime Minister David Cameron's renegotiated EU deal is unlikely to change how they will vote. The results come on the eve of crunch Brussels talks, which are expected to result in a deal. Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed in Northern Ireland also say that there has been no impact on their sales and orders as of yet, due to the uncertainty of Britain's future within the EU. Commenting on the results, President of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce Stephen McCully said the findings suggest that ""the renegotiation is having little impact on day-to-day business - or the vote of the business community."" He said that this was because many made up their minds before knowing the outcome of negotiations, effectively discounting them as irrelevant. ""For businesspeople, this is a question of in or out,"" he said. ""Those within Northern Ireland who are firmly wedded to the EU have said that Brexit will leave us stranded outside the EU, and coping with the re-emergence of a land border with the Republic of Ireland. ""Emotion has a part in all decision making and it will do so here, but there is a duty to ensure decisions are as well informed as they can be.""

"Media playback is not supported on this device ""You're not wanted any more"" rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on Gerrard's decision to decline a new Liverpool contract and move to the United States next summer. Liverpool's followers were only too happy to offer the conflicting view - and no wonder after their 34-year-old captain once again dragged them out of hazardous terrain to safety almost single-handed with both goals in this 2-1 FA Cup third round win. If Gerrard needed - not that he does - to build a monument to what Liverpool will miss when he goes, this was the perfect template and left the questions hanging in the air. Gerrard's departure next May has been presented by Liverpool and the player himself as the right time for the parting of the ways. This iconic captain's future would have been carefully managed had he stayed another year, with his number of performances inevitably reduced. It seems Gerrard does not want, or indeed deserve, to close out his magnificent career with a lengthy spell of bench-warming. It is tempting to use every significant Gerrard intervention as part of the case for the prosecution to accuse Liverpool of failing to do enough to keep him - and even this superb performance should be placed in the context that it was with a middling League Two team in opposition. And would he be able to sustain this level of performance and energy, especially in a more advanced role, on a weekly basis in the Premier League into next season? Valid questions but questions Liverpool's fans were prepared to set to one side on Monday. Even now, with the credits rolling on his Liverpool career, they still have no-one like Gerrard who can give them hope when it seems lost, such as against FC Basel with his late free-kick on the night they went out of the Champions League, or here against AFC Wimbledon, when he produced yet again when matters were starting to look extremely difficult. Jordan Henderson is Gerrard's successor-in-waiting as Liverpool captain but does not yet come within light years of the impact the current incumbent has either on the field or off. He is still a developing player and personality so it is actually a tough comparison, but how can he, or indeed anyone else, follow Gerrard as a leader in battle, a figure afforded total respect (perhaps even fear when it comes to opponents) off the field or as a symbol for the fans? Whether Liverpool like it or not, this debate will run and run until the day Gerrard walks out of Anfield for the final time and perhaps even beyond - it was certainly raging on Monday night. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher, who feels aggrieved that the midfielder has somehow been allowed to drift away from Anfield, tweeted on his Carra23 account: ""If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak."" Carragher had earlier tweeted: ""Liverpool struggled for goals this season. Their top scorer is going to the MLS next season!"" Even QPR striker Charlie Austin tweeted: ""How can Liverpool let this man go?"" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was the subject of lavish praise in Gerrard's abdication speech, with the player saying he wished he had worked under the manager a decade ago, but there is no doubt there will be questions for the club's owners and executive staff every time he affects events as he did against AFC Wimbledon. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate and room-mate Danny Murphy told BBC Sport on Match of the Day: ""Liverpool are very fortunate they've got Steven Gerrard as his two bits of quality have been the difference between the sides and not much else."" And Alan Shearer added: ""There was one guy who dragged Liverpool through by the scruff of the neck. How many times have we said this over the years? It was his performance, his goals, his work-rate, his effort."" Shearer also drew the parallel with Chelsea's decision to let Frank Lampard go, only to see him turn up at Manchester City as a danger to his old club's Premier League title chances. Gerrard has made it clear he will never play against Liverpool but Shearer added: ""I just wonder whether Chelsea look at the Frank Lampard situation and just wish that they hadn't let him go. I wonder if Liverpool will do the same."" The bottom line is that no matter how much Liverpool look to the future, the player and inspiration they still rely on is Steven Gerrard. For that overall impact on games, his colleagues and his club, he will be impossible to replace. Liverpool's debt to Gerrard was placed in even sharper relief by the fact it allowed them to secure an FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Bolton Wanderers despite seeing the usual fault lines exposed by AFC Wimbledon. After Gerrard put Liverpool ahead in the 12th minute, there was a period of relative calm as Neil Ardley's side were subdued and the Premier League giants looked in control. It did not last long as Liverpool's defence came under pressure and, as it has done so often this season, almost instantly looked incapable of coping. Sean Rigg had already missed one good chance before he forced a save from Simon Mignolet and it was alarming to see how a routine kick from AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea created various degrees of panic and a chance that Matt Tubbs wasted. Wimbledon's equaliser from Adebayo Akinfenwa was Liverpool's defence in microcosm. Mignolet flapped hopelessly at George Francomb's corner under pressure, Mamadou Sakho bundled the ball against his own bar and amid the carnage Akinfenwa reacted first. Mignolet, only restored in goal because of an injury to his journeyman deputy Brad Jones, was taunted throughout by AFC Wimbledon fans well-versed in his problems with the ball at his feet. If Liverpool could get their hands on a goalkeeper of quality as a long-term replacement for Mignolet this month surely they will, although it could prove easier said than done. Mignolet may have to do for this season but not beyond. Rodgers works on defensive organisation and is certainly too skilled and confident a coach to bring in an outsider to assist with defence, but that vulnerability must remain a concern. As he pointed out when Arsenal scored at Anfield recently, it is not a matter of coaching or organisation when three one-on-one headers are lost in Liverpool's own penalty area. The current players simply need to be better - or replaced by better players. Much was made of the memories of the original Wimbledon FC's FA Cup Final win against Liverpool at Wembley in 1988 as the sub-plot to this occasion - and it was right that two of the real heroes of that day and the old ""Crazy Gang"" were on hand for this tie in the shape of goalkeeper and captain Dave Beasant and goalscorer Lawrie Sanchez. This, though, is a different time and a different era - as well as a different club for the fans who have helped the rebirth of AFC Wimbledon after they started the long road back in the Combined Counties League in 2002 before going through five promotions and a return to the Football League in 2011. And this FA Cup night was a credit to the way this club has been reshaped and the passion of those loyal fans. Neil Ardley's team were honest, committed and did themselves and AFC Wimbledon proud on their big night. There are still further steps for AFC Wimbledon to take, perhaps even back to their old Plough Lane home, but for now this is a good news story for everyone involved. The FA Cup provides tales to tell for all involved - not just for clubs but for the media following the progress of this wonderful competition. Sunday's tie between Yeovil Town and Manchester United involved a temporary home in the front row of The Screwfix Community Stand, where you could almost reach out and touch the action at ground level. Cut to Cherry Red Records Stadium a short walk from Norbiton Station 24 hours later and home was a specially built overflow press box in a corner of the stadium, access gained by climbing a rather shaky ladder. All good fun - especially for the unsporting AFC Wimbledon fans who subjected Her Majesty's Media to (to put it politely) to catcalls as they made an inelegant exit down the ladder before leaving to hear from Neal Ardley and Brendan Rodgers. The chants of'You don't know what you're doing"" were not entirely inaccurate but given (and taken) in good part. The FA Cup third round is still one of the great dates in English football's calendar - and anyone wishing to argue against that could not have been present at Yeovil or AFC Wimbledon.",1,900

"The Anglo-Dutch giant's chief executive Ben van Beurden accepted that Arctic drilling ""divides society,"" but said the world needs new sources of oil.

The cut in investment - spread over three years - comes after a fall in the oil price.

Shell also said profits for the last three months of 2014 had risen to 4.2bn compared with 2.2bn in the same period a year earlier. The numbers were below analysts' forecasts, prompting a big sell-off of Shell's shares, which were down by 4.3 at the end of Thursday. Shell put its Arctic plans on hold two years ago after a drilling vessel ran aground and legal wrangles in the US. The company has already spent 1bn on preparing its drilling work in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It was costing Shell several hundred millions of dollars a year to keep the existing operations ticking over, the company said. Mr van Beurden said there were still issues to resolve before drilling began, such as over operating permits and getting further facilities in place. But he hoped to see work begin in the summer. ""We will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly,"" Mr van Beurden told the BBC. ""I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks."" He also pointed out that there are already other energy companies operating in the Arctic. Mr van Beurden said that the world needs new sources of oil and gas to meet demand and that the Arctic offered potentially the biggest resource base ever found. Estimates have put the estimates at some 24bn barrels in Alaska. Environmentalists have campaigned against Shell for years. Greenpeace's Charlie Kronick, said: ""Despite announcing cuts [in global investment], Shell hasn't taken the opportunity to cut its most high-cost high-risk project. ""Shell is taking a massive risk doggedly chasing oil in the Arctic, not just with shareholder value, but with the pristine Arctic environment. ""A spill there will be environmentally and financially catastrophic. It's time for investors to recognise that it's impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oil."" As the first of the major oil companies to report its figures for last year, Shell plays the role of the canary in the coal mine - or on the oil rig. After a rather sickly 2013, profits are actually up. But the impact of the low oil price is clearly biting. The company announced that it would be cutting investment over the next three years in new exploration and the development of oil and gas fields, a move that will raise fresh concerns about its business in the North Sea. Last summer Shell announced the loss of 250 jobs in Aberdeen. The chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, said that the company would not ""over-react"" to the oil price which has fallen by 60 since last June. And of course a low oil price means lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumers. He said though that Shell would look at further cuts if necessary. As well as the North Sea, the company's operations in Nigeria, where it recently paid a PS55m bill to clean up pollution after a major oil spill, and the Arctic will also come under increased scrutiny. Meanwhile, Shell's profits for the quarter after stripping out one-off items, such as asset sales and accounting changes, were 3.26bn. That is a 12 rise on the same period a year earlier but down from the 5.85bn in the June to September quarter. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ""As expected, fourth quarter performance has been impacted by the lower oil price, although downstream refining operations have provided some counterbalance. ""More broadly, the numbers are below forecast, with the news providing a difficult start to the oil majors' results season. ""In all, and despite the disappointing numbers, the dividend payment remains core, with the payment being left unchanged."" Shell said it was spending 12bn on dividends to shareholders in 2014, and also repurchased 3.3bn of its own shares. The group said it had slowed the pace of share buybacks to conserve cash and that near-term oil prices would dictate how it progressed. Oil prices have fallen by almost 60 since June because of weak global demand and a boom in US shale production. Shell's main rivals, BP and Total, have also announced large cutbacks in capital expenditure in recent weeks.",1,904
"Kohli made 107 and shared century stands with both Shikhar Dhawan (73) and Suresh Raina (74) at the Adelaide Oval. When Kohli fell as part of Sohail Khan's 5-55, Pakistan looked to have dragged themselves back into the game by restricting India to a reachable 300-7. But a chase that never gained momentum was wrecked by a collapse of three wickets for one run and they eventually stumbled to 224 all out, Mohammed Shami claiming 4-35. In isolation, India's win earns national pride in what was billed as the most watched cricket match of all time, with an estimated television audience of one billion, and extends their World Cup record against Pakistan to six wins from as many matches. It was also an emphatic way to begin the defence of a trophy they won on home soil in 2011 and represents their first competitive win since arriving for a tour of Australia in November. Pakistan, winners when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand 23 years ago, can take heart from the way they stuck to the task with the ball, but their limp chase was poor. After all the hype, the action was intriguing, rather than exciting. Making first use of an excellent pitch on a baking hot day, India's innings was underpinned by Kohli's calm accumulation all around the wicket, his 126-ball stay containing only eight fours. The right-hander made Pakistan pay for dropping him twice, the first a tough chance in the deep to Yasir Shah when on only three, the second a more straightforward edge behind to Umar Akmal from the spin of Haris Sohail on 76. When the 26-year-old punched Shahid Afridi to long-on for a 22nd ODI hundred - only Sachin Tendulkar has more for India - he became the first man to score a century in his opening match of a World Cup tournament on two occasions. Support came from Dhawan, who curbed his attacking instincts, and Raina, who repeatedly heaved through the leg side in his 56-ball knock. However, after Kohli edged Sohail to Umar, Pakistan fought back through fast bowler Sohail, who demonstrated consistency of length and canny changes of pace. India scored just 27 runs in their final five overs as five wickets fell, four of them to Sohail. A chase of 301 looked within Pakistan's grasp at the interval, but they never threatened to keep up with the six-an-over run-rate. Younus Khan, promoted to open, gloved a Shami bouncer behind early on and, though Ahmed Shahzad and Haris shared 68, Ravichandran Ashwin found turn with a beautiful off-break to have the latter caught at slip. And, when Umesh Yadav removed Shahzad and Saqaib Mahsood in the space of three balls followed by Umar controversially being given out, caught behind off Ravi Jadeja on review, the contest was effectively over. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq did his best to delay the inevitable with some clean striking in his 76, but he was the ninth wicket to fall, to the lively Shami, before Mohit Sharma had Sohail caught at long-on to seal India's victory.

"Royal Mail predicts that on what it calls Take-back Tuesday there will be a rise of more than 50 in returns against December's daily average. Clothing and footwear are the most likely items to be returned. People are also expected to flock to shops at lunchtime to give back gifts, but may face issues getting a refund. Catherine Shuttleworth, from consumer analysts Savvy Marketing, told the BBC: ""The problem for many people will be that without a gift receipt they will not be able to get a return at the retail price at which an item was originally purchased. ""Prices have been slashed in the Boxing Day and January sales, and there is also likely to be very mixed stock available if shoppers are wanting to return and replace an item, as it is unlikely a product will be available on the shelf."" It is not only shoppers who could have problems - there are also issues for the companies themselves. ""It poses challenges for retailers in terms of additional staffing for returns and ensuring that returns policies are adhered to,"" Ms Shuttleworth said. ""This year, returns are complicated by the high level of discounting before Christmas when many gifts were purchased - so retailers have the challenge of managing their [profit] margin on returns. ""You can also expect to see long queues in retailers at exchange points, which are never a desirable position for the retailer or shopper."" Find out more about your rights Most online clothes shoppers send something back Royal Mail's figures for the expected surge in returns is based on the number of parcels handled by its Tracked Returns service, which is used by more than 1,000 e-retailers. A Royal Mail survey of 1,517 UK online shoppers, looking at the number of items sent back, discovered that 30 of them returned women's clothes, 17 men's clothes, 16 footwear and 7 children's clothes. And in a separate survey of 1,505 online shoppers in the UK, 38 said that a free returns policy was likely to make them do more shopping in this way. The highest volume of returns through Royal Mail in the last financial year took place in January 2016.",1,906
"Collymore, 46, expressed an interest in the role at a meeting with Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi on Tuesday. But after ""time to reflect"" on the meeting and feedback from fans, he has now ""withdrawn from any involvement."" He had said: ""I'm not convinced change will happen quickly or thoroughly enough under Fawaz's ownership."" But following his decision to withdraw his interest, he explained: ""As for fans which questioned my motive, I want the club to be in safe hands, competitive and in the top division. ""My current business, career and health are way more important to me than pushing against a tide of doubt, spite and rabble rousing, so I'll stick to the odd QA in Nottingham now and again to say hello to those who supported me back in the day."" Collymore was involved in a protest against Al Hasawi on 21 January, which followed the collapse of a proposed takeover of the club by a US-based consortium led by John Jay Moores. ""I believe Fawaz will stay in the shortmedium term,"" Collymore wrote on his blog. ""Unless JJM [Moores] meet the asking price of PS50m or as Fawaz said ""the Chinese offer silly money,"" it is my belief that he feels he has the resources, passion and plan to move the club forward."" Forest are currently 19th in the Championship, just five points above the relegation zone. They sacked manager Philippe Montanier on 14 January, making the Frenchman the seventh to leave the City Ground since the Al Hasawi family took over in July 2012. Meanwhile, the Nottingham Forest Supporters' Trust have been given an assurance by the city council that the land on which the City Ground is built will never be sold. The stadium is owned by the club, but the land still belongs to the council. The Supporters' Trust have also applied to register the City Ground as an Asset of Community Value, meaning they would have first refusal to purchase the stadium if it were ever to be sold, with six months to raise the required funds.

"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that."" He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. ""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. ""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled."" However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. ""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said. ""And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. ""Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies."" But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. ""We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. ""And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too."" Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it ""plans to more aggressively encourage people"" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. ""When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,"" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. ""I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.""",1,910
"""I'm 64,"" he said of his fascination with the 1836 battle. ""When I was five or six years old, this thing began."" Collins' collection includes a fringed leather pouch used by Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie's legendary knife.

The legendary battle, named after a former mission in San Antonio, saw 1,500 Mexican troops lay siege to 200 Texans fighting for Texas independence.

"Barcelona said it paid EUR57m (PS43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to EUR83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received EUR40m and his former club, Santos, was paid EUR17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40 of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received EUR6.8m of Santos's EUR17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: ""They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice."" The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated EUR13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus.

""I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,"" Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ. He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football. He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month. ""So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,"" he added. The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East. Media playback is not supported on this device Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax. He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title. Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey. His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986.

Officer Oliver has been fired violating several department policies, a police statement said, adding that the department ""cannot give further details on which policies have been violated since Roy Oliver can appeal the termination."" Officer Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left a party on Saturday night, Chief Haber said after reviewing the body-cam video. The car was actually driving forward - away from police - and not reversing toward them when the shots were fired, he explained. ""I was unintentionally incorrect yesterday when I said that the victim's vehicle was backing down the road,"" Mr Haber said on Monday. ""In fact, according to the video that I viewed, the vehicle was moving forward as the officers approached."" The officer's behaviour ""did not meet our core values,"" the police chief said. Jordan, who was in the front passenger seat, died after being shot in the back of the head. His 16-year-old brother and three friends were detained at the scene and taken to the Dallas County Sheriff's Department, where they were interviewed as witnesses. Jordan's cause of death has been ruled a homicide, however, that does not necessarily mean charges will be filed against the officer. The Dallas County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas County District Attorney's Office are conducting a criminal investigation. The incident occurred on Saturday night when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party where around 100 kids had gathered, neighbours said. Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots, causing panic at the home as people fled. After going outside, the police officer fired several shots which killed Jordan, a first-year American football player at Mesquite High School. His coach, Jeff Fleener, told the Dallas Morning News that he was ""crushed and heartbroken"" to learn that Jordan had been killed. ""You create a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend, and Jordan had all that. He was that kid,"" he said.

"Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who has a golden opportunity to close the title race deficit, was 0.107secs slower. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was second fastest, followed by Sebastian Vettel. Mercedes have so far not shown their true pace on an unusual weekend that has been dominated by Hamilton's engine penalties - which amount to 55 places following three engine changes, meaning he will start right at the back - and problems with tyre choices caused by the unexpected heat. Spa-Francorchamps is more usually associated with unpredictable and often wet weather, even in August, but this weekend has been baking, with temperatures in the low 30Cs. That means the tyres are suffering - a problem exacerbated by the fact that greater freedom for the teams in tyre choices than previously this year has meant they have leaned towards softer tyres. The super-soft tyre has never been brought to Spa before, because of the demands of its many long, high-speed corners. But Ferrari picked seven sets of the tyre out of their available 13, and only one of the more durable medium. Mercedes have gone the other way, splitting their choices much more evenly between the super-soft, soft and medium. That meant, with only four sets of the super-soft available, Mercedes did not use it at all until the final minutes of the session. It was not immediately clear why Rosberg was 0.768secs off Raikkonen's pace, but Hamilton had a lift in the fast double-left hander at Pouhon and then made mistakes at flat-out Blanchimont and on the entry to the final chicane. Mercedes executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe told BBC Sport that the team were likely to give Hamilton only the least possible running in qualifying - probably meaning only one run in the first session - because of his penalties. ""We'll probably just run the minimum necessary in qualifying,"" Lowe said. ""We want to give Lewis the strongest possible race from the back and with the maximum number of tyres."" Rosberg, despite his lack of headline pace in the final practice session, is expected to take pole, and there will be a tight battle between Red Bull and Ferrari for best of the rest. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen, who was fastest on Friday afternoon, did only two laps on Saturday before being hit by a gearbox problem. Hamilton is not the only driver with engine penalties. McLaren's Fernando Alonso, who was 11th fastest and two places ahead of team-mate Jenson Button in the session, has a 35-place penalty and Sauber's Marcus Ericsson 10 places.

"The group were convicted of Tuesday of assaulting social worker and activist Ken Tsang as he took part in the 2014 pro-democracy rallies. TV cameras caught the officers removing Mr Tsang from the protest area to a nearby park and kicking and punching him as he lay on the ground. The incident, at the height of the protests, caused public outrage. Police in Hong Kong are generally well-respected and incidents of police violence are rare, though there were accusations of heavy-handedness during the protests. The 2014 protests saw 79 days of student-led demonstrations and street occupations by protesters seeking freedom from mainland Chinese intervention in elections for the territory's leader. Defence lawyer Lawrence Lok had argued that the protests had affected police morale, saying that one of the officers who watched the violence had been physically and verbally abused by protesters. But in sentencing, Judge David Dufton noted the men had been working under ""immense stress"" but that there was ""no justification"" for their actions. The ""vicious assault"" had ""brought damage to Hong Kong in the international community,"" he said. Tuesday's ruling said Mr Tsang suffered injuries to his face, neck and body, but that these did not amount to the original charge of ""grievous bodily harm."" Last year Mr Tsang was himself found guilty of assaulting and resisting officers on the same evening. He splashed an unknown liquid on police and was handed a five-week sentence. Hong Kong has been part of China since 1997 but enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a principle of ""one country, two systems."" But many Hong Kong locals are concerned about what they see as growing Chinese influence in the city's affairs, with some activists even calling for independence from China.",1,922

"The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. Prosecutors say he has claimed responsibility for the attack and spent more than a year in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve told Europe 1 radio on Monday: ""There are people who recruit jihadists. There are as I'm speaking arrests being made."" ""We are acting everywhere. There will be no respite in the fight against terrorists."" There is no suggestion of a link between the four arrests on Monday and the detention of Mr Nemmouche during a random check on a coach arriving from Amsterdam in southern France on Friday. But Mr Nemmouche is said to have had links with radical Islamists and served five years in jail in France for robbery before being released in December 2012. When he was arrested, he had with him a Kalashnikov rifle and a handgun believed to have been used in the attack, the Paris prosecutor said. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He feared ""they would become 700 time bombs when they return,"" referring to the estimated number of French-born jihadists in Syria. Belgium has requested Mr Nemmouche's extradition from France and police have to decide whether to extend his detention until Thursday. Three people died when a gunman opened fire at the museum in the busy Sablon area of the Belgian capital on 24 May. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer.

"Police said he was armed with a stolen gun and they had been tracking him. They blamed the violence on a small group of people. Four officers have been placed on administrative leave. The wounded man's name and age have not been released by police. But the St Louis Post-Dispatch identified him as 18-year-old Tyrone Harris, having spoken to his father, the paper said. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States. Although Mr Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and by the US Department of Justice, the teenager's death fuelled a national protest movement against the use of excessive force by police officers. A justice department investigation also found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police force. What happened in Ferguson in 2014? US Dept of Justice report on Ferguson racism Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of people stood silent for four-and-a-half minutes at the spot where Michael Brown was killed, representing the number of hours that his body lay in the street unattended. The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, who is in Ferguson, says most people at Sunday's gathering felt little had changed since Michael Brown was shot dead a year ago. At the end of a sombre, peaceful day of commemorations, shots were heard at about 23:15 local time on Sunday (04:15 Monday GMT) as a large crowd gathered on West Florissant Avenue, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters that after ""an exchange of gunfire between two groups"" the suspect, believed by police to be armed, left and encountered officers in an unmarked SUV. He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle. The gunmen ""were criminals; they weren't protesters,"" he said, adding that the officers were not wearing body cameras. Photos from the scene showed a young black man lying bloodied on the ground. He was face down and handcuffed. President Barack Obama announced a federal programme to help pay for lapel-mounted cameras for US police to record their interactions in the wake of the nationwide protests on perceived policing injustices. There have been a number of high profile shootings of unarmed black men in US cities in recent months. The most recent case involved 19-year-old Christian Taylor who was shot dead by a white police officer after he was spotted on surveillance footage vandalising cars in Arlington, Texas, on Friday.",1,925
"Ackerman was initially banned in October last year after being found guilty of corruption. He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win. Ackerman was granted a stay of implementation in November, but his disqualification has been reactivated with immediate effect until 11 June. However, his fine of PS5,000 was quashed upon appeal, at the invitation of the British Horseracing Authority. Ackerman was banned after an investigation into six races featuring Ad Vitam at Kempton and Wolverhampton between 2 November, 2011 and 8 March, 2012. He was found to have breached the rules of racing alongside jockey Michael Stainton, registered owner Kenneth Mackay and former owner David Greenwood. Stainton was banned for two years, Mackay for six months and fined PS5,000, with Greenwood, who had already been warned off for a separate offence, banned for eight years. All three also failed in their appeals, although, a separate appeal by Stainton against the penalty imposed ""will be considered in due course.""

"Four US tourists and an Australian pilot died after their light plane came down on a shopping centre on Tuesday. It had just taken off from the small Essendon Airport, which reopened on Thursday. The nearby shopping centre remains closed ""until further notice."" Safety officials said they would investigate with ""an open mind"" and make a preliminary report next month. The victims were pilot Max Quartermain and passengers Greg Reynolds De Haven, Russell Munsch, Glenn Garland and John Washburn, four men from Austin, Texas, who were on their way to Tasmania's King Island for a golfing trip. Greg Hood, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), said four investigators would examine the scene for several days. ""We're very much in the gathering of evidence phase,"" he said. Police said the flight appeared to have had a ""catastrophic engine failure"" before Mr Quartermain gave two mayday calls. However, Mr Hood said investigators would make no assumptions. ""We'll look at maintenance records, the history of pilot, the history of aircraft... at this very early stage, we're not going to speculate in relation to any specific part of the investigation,"" he said. The West Australian newspaper reported the Beechcraft B200 King Air plane recently passed a safety check. The inspection by industry regulator Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) found no issues with the plane or pilot, the newspaper said.

"Energy will travel via the world's longest sub-sea electricity interconnector. The a'!2bn (PS1.4bn) project has been rubber stamped between National Grid and its Norwegian equivalent Statnett. The UK aims to import enough hydro-power from Norway to provide 14 of yearly household electricity needs. Alan Foster, director of European business development for National Grid, said: ""Access to low-carbon energy from Norway hydro-power stations will help us meet the challenge of greener, affordable energy. ""It also adds to the diversity of energy sources for UK and potentially can reduce peak prices, with benefits for consumers and businesses."" Statnett chief executive Auke Lont said: ""Not only is this a technically impressive project where we will set a new world record, it is also an important contribution to the increase of renewable energy production on both sides."" The North Sea Network (NSN) interconnector is due to be completed in 2021 and will have a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts (GW). The sub-sea electricity cable will connect the two countries' electricity markets directly for the first time. Energy secretary Ed Davey said: ""Britain will benefit from Norwegian green hydropower, at the flick of a switch, providing green back-up power when the wind's not blowing, and this will actually save people money."" The new NSN interconnector will be more than 730km long and will carry enough power for 750,000 homes at peak demand, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said. For average usage by households, it could power up to four million homes, she added. Most electricity in Norway is generated from hydropower, and water from Norwegian lakes will generate the electricity that will be connected into the UK network. The NSN cable will connect to the Norwegian network at Kvilldal, next to the Kvilldal power station, which at 1,240 megawatts (MW) is the largest power station in Norway in terms of capacity. The Kvilldal plant is powered by the waters in the Blasjo reservoir, the country's biggest artificial lake. The sub-sea cable will connect to the UK network at Blyth in Northumberland. Crucially, the UK will be able to call on the power at short notice. The energy will be used to manage the growing levels of intermittent wind power on the network. It will also be a two-way link. Norway will be able to import power from the UK during dry periods when hydroelectric power is less widely available. According to the government, the link will help the UK benefit from Norway's cheaper electricity prices. It estimates that the interconnector will deliver consumer benefits of up to PS3.5bn through to 2040. By reducing the need for new gas-fired power plants, the government insists the link will also reduce the UK's green house gas emissions. Interconnectors are transmission cables that allow electricity to flow from one country to another. Energy regulator Ofgem says that they can lower consumer bills by accessing cheaper power and boosting UK energy supplies. The UK mainland currently has four interconnectors that link to France, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Together they provide around 4 GW of electricity capacity. This represents about 4 of Britain's electricity supply. The energy regulator is currently examining the need for two further interconnectors to France and one to Denmark. Last month, National Grid signed a joint venture agreement with the Belgian electricity transmission operator, Elia, to develop Nemo, the first electricity interconnector between the two countries.",1,930
"Adrian Simut, 35, travelled to Newport train station, where he thought he was meeting a 14-year-old girl called Sam. But he was confronted by so-called ""paedophile hunters"" and later arrested, Newport Crown Court was told. He admitted attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and meeting a child after online grooming. He also pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to attempting to cause a child to watch a sexual act. The court heard Simut started messaging the teenager in an online chat room in June, saying she looked ""cute and beautiful."" But she was in fact an adult belonging to a group called Petronus. The operation was captured on film by the BBC Wales Week In Week Out programme, which investigated the role of paedophile hunters in Wales. The court heard that Romanian national Simut arranged to meet ""Sam"" in Newport and suggested she bring a friend for sexual activity. Sentencing him, Judge Michael Fitton QC said: ""You were the subject of an exchange conducted by those who are looking to attract paedophiles."" He was also made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order. Paedophile hunting groups have drawn criticism from both the Home Office and police, who have said it was inappropriate for the public to conduct undercover work.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Saturday's loss to Liverpool was the Swans' third in succession, leaving them a point above the bottom three and increasing the pressure on Guidolin. Although they are alarmed by the club's predicament, Swansea's owners are understood to have no immediate plans to sack the 60-year-old Italian. ""I am sure in the future this team can turn this situation,"" said Guidolin. ""The relationship between my players and me is perfect. The best thing in these nine months is to meet my players. I am sure they have good qualities, good character. ""I am worried for the table, not my position. It is not good. We need more points."" Swansea's American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, were at the Liberty Stadium for the Liverpool game, but have yet to decide on Guidolin's future. However, they are compiling a shortlist of potential successors should they sack the Italian. Chairman Huw Jenkins has met former United States coach Bob Bradley, while former Wales and Manchester United captain Ryan Giggs would be interested in the manager's role if it was to become vacant. Bradley and Giggs are not the only options, with Swansea's hierarchy thought to be considering several other possible candidates in the event of Guidolin's departure. It is likely the nature of Swansea's performances will have as much bearing on Guidolin's job prospects as the results, and the Swans were much improved against Liverpool. Guidolin, however, is in the dark about his future. ""I don't know what happens tomorrow, or next week,"" he said. ""My job is to work with the players and prepare the team for games. This is my job.

"Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) aims to reduce radiation leaks in three months and to cool the reactors within nine months. The firm said it also planned to cover the reactor building. Nearly 14,000 people died and another 14,000 are still unaccounted for after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. Tepco unveiled its roadmap as Hillary Clinton briefly visited Tokyo to pledge America's ""steadfast support"" for Japan's reconstruction. Radiation levels in the sea near reactor 2 rose to 6,500 times the legal limit on Friday, up from 1,100 times a day earlier, Tepco has said, raising fears of fresh radiation leaks. Tsunehisa Katsumata, the chairman of Tepco, Asia's largest utility, told a news conference in Tokyo on Sunday they would need up to nine months to bring the power plant to""cold shutdown."" He said the plan would allow the tens of thousands of families evacuated from the area around the facility to return home as soon as possible. ""We sincerely apologise for causing troubles,"" Mr Katsumata said. ""We are doing our utmost to prevent the crisis from further worsening."" Tepco said after cold shutdown it would focus on encasing the reactor buildings, cleaning up contaminated soil and removing nuclear fuel. Japan's government had ordered Tepco to come up with a timetable to end the crisis, now rated on a par with the world's worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. But the BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo says it is still not certain that the nine-month deadline can be achieved. He says the immediate priority for Tepco is to stop radioactive water leaking into the Pacific Ocean. The utility said it was sending remote-controlled robots into one of the reactors on Sunday to gauge radiation and temperature levels. UK defence contractor QinetiQ said it had provided the machines, which are directed by controllers usually supplied with games consoles. The robots can carry out tasks such as rubble clearance, demolition and radiation testing. Japan is a world leader in such technology, but its robots are not adapted for dirty work such as meltdowns at nuclear plants, experts say. Emergency workers have been unable to enter any reactor building since the disaster. Our correspondent says Japan's recovery bill has been estimated at 300bn (PS184bn) - already the most expensive disaster in history. But the government said last week that figure might be an underestimate. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Clinton said in Japan she believed the country would emerge stronger from its worst crisis since World War II. She met Prime Minister Naoto Kan and had tea with Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace, said to be a rare privilege for a non-head of state on a Sunday. America has won Japanese admiration for sending scores of US ships and aircraft as well as 20,000 troops to help the relief effort. Operation Tomodachi, or Friend, was the biggest humanitarian mission the US has conducted in Japan. Before the quake, the two nations' ties had been strained by a dispute over US military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.

"The new plan is for training to be split across three different sites. There would be some joint training, but the three services would each have their own facilities. The big winner would be the fire and rescue service - it would get a PS44m purpose-built complex at Desertcreat, near Cookstown in County Tyrone. Timeline: Ten years of stop and start for NI's public services college The BBC revealed in March that a programme board in charge of the Desertcreat project had concluded it was no longer economically viable. It said the joint college as originally planned was no longer needed because of reduction in the number of training days required by each of the three services. The Office of First and deputy First Minister then asked for a revised business case, setting out preferred options for future training needs. That review has now been completed and the BBC has obtained a copy of a draft report setting out the board's recommendations. It says the preferred option is for the fire service to have a training facility at Desertcreat at an estimated cost of PS44m. If the plan is approved by the Northern Ireland Executive, it is understood the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) would also be allocated about PS20m to refurbish its existing training facilities at Garnerville police station in east Belfast. The Northern Ireland Prison Service would be given funding for training at Maghaberry and Magilligan prisons as its training centre in Millisle, County Down, has been closed. The proposed new complex for the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) would be built on the site bought 10 years ago for a new policing college at Desertcreat. That plan was later changed to include the fire and prison services, but has now been revised. It would include what is called a'hot house'. This is a building that can be set on fire in a controlled fashion, or heated to extremely high temperatures, to give firefighters realistic training. Northern Ireland does not currently have such a facility. The NIFRS would like it to have different sections to replicate the different conditions and challenges involved when tackling a blaze in domestic homes, commercial premises and high-rise buildings. The money for all of the training facilities would have to be provided by the executive. That is because a PS53m funding package from the Treasury was withdrawn earlier this year due to a failure to build the proposed joint college within a stipulated timeframe. The programme board's report will be sent to Justice Minister David Ford and Health Minister Simon Hamilton for their approval as their departments are responsible for the project. In a statement to the BBC, a project steering group said the draft business case ""has yet to be finalised or formally signed-off"" by the accounting officers for the fire and prison services and the PSNI. But senior officials from the departments of justice and health sit on the programme board and were heavily involved in producing the draft report. If Mr Ford and Mr Hamilton endorse the preferred option, they will make a joint recommendation to the executive by the end of November.",1,936

"Culture Secretary Maria Miller said ""decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table"" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay. In 2012 about 155,000 were convicted and fined for not paying the PS145.50 fee. In total 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device - accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecutions that year. In October 2013 Huffington Post reported that in response to a Freedom of Information Request the Ministry of Justice had revealed that 107 people were jailed between January 2011 and March 2013 for failing to pay fines related to not having a TV licence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now told the Daily Telegraph ""serious work"" would be done on the proposal to make non-payment a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts. He said: ""The culture secretary and I both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system. ""Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal."" Ms Miller said: ""This is an interesting idea but timing is crucial and decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table during charter review, not separate to the process."" The BBC's current Royal Charter, which expires in 2016, sets out how it should be funded, what it does and how it is managed. A spokesman for the culture secretary added: ""Maria will put decriminalisation of the licence fee on the table during charter review discussions, but to do it before makes no sense. ""She has made clear that the BBC needs to get its house in order, particularly when it comes to governance and transparency, having decriminalisation on the table during the negotiations will focus the BBC's minds."" But Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is seeking to introduce the change through an amendment to the government's Deregulation Bill. It would make non-payment of the licence fee a civil matter, with a fine for offenders set by the government. He told the Daily Telegraph: ""It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means. ""I believe that non-payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are. ""It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence."" The newspaper reported that the amendment had been backed by 101 cross-party MPs. A BBC spokesman said: ""Legislation is a matter for the government, however changing the law could lead to higher evasion. ""Just a 1 increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around PS35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations.""",1,938
"A judge said there was a basis for concluding the officers, known as M and Q, may have perverted the course of justice and committed perjury while giving evidence. Pearse Jordan was shot in the back by an RUC officer as he ran from a stolen car he had been driving on the Falls Road in 1982. Judge Horner told Belfast High Court that although he was not duty bound to report the matter, he intended to exercise his discretion. ""I do not consider that I am bound to report Officers M and Q to the Director (of prosecutions),"" he said. ""However, in the present case I intend to exercise my discretion and report Officers M and Q to the Director because I consider that their behaviour sought to conceal the role played by DP2 in the events of November 25, 1992. ""This attempted concealment could have seriously impacted on this hearing."" The judge rejected an application to lift the anonymity order preventing either officer being named. Mr Jordan, 22, had been driving a stolen car suspected of ferrying IRA munitions when he was shot. He failed to stop when ordered by police and sped away from a patrol car. Earlier this month, Justice Horner delivered findings in what was the third inquest into the highly contentious death. The coroner said he was not convinced either by family claims Mr Jordan was gunned down in cold blood or by police insistence the RUC sergeant acted in self-defence. Testimony from Officers M and Q, who were not directly involved in the shooting, was singled out for specific criticism. The judge concluded that one or both of the officers had edited the original logbook and that they had been untruthful when asked about the identity of the driver of the stolen car. Following the judgment, lawyers for the Jordan family called for M and Q to be investigated for allegedly perverting the course of justice and perjury. They also requested both officers be identified. The court was also told the granting of anonymity to officers M and Q was made on the basis of an objectively verified risk to life. The threat to officer M was assessed as moderate, namely that an attack is possible but not likely, but that in the event an appearance at the inquest without anonymity and screening the threat was likely to rise. The threat to officer Q was deemed to be low but could rise to moderate or beyond if identified through court proceedings. The judge said the measure was ""necessary and proportionate"" given the risk to life. The investigation into Mr Jordan's shooting has been beset by controversy and delay. In 2014, his family were awarded compensation for the lengthy hold-ups in concluding an inquest. An original inquest was adjourned in 1995 after being only part heard. Another probe was held in 2012, but the jury failed to reach consensus on a number of crucial issues - including whether the RUC used reasonable force. Those findings were later quashed after the High Court identified a number of failings in how the probe was run. In his findings, Justice Horner said it was impossible to determine with certainty what happened.",1,939
"The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans ""wrong"" information, including disputed international borders. The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law. The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography. Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (PS10.4m). It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it. It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India ""which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity"" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India. The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering ""value added"" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber. It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months. There is an exemption for government agencies and departments. Google already offers slightly altered versions of its maps inside India, eliminating the Line of Control that divides Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and locating the whole disputed region within India's borders. Both Google and Uber declined to comment. The laws extend beyond large international companies. Anyone creating, distributing, or owning unsanctioned maps must apply to a government agency for a licence, and submit the material for inspection. The geospatial data will then be considered by a security vetting committee, which will decide if the applicant is granted a licence. Once the material is cleared, it must be watermarked with the insignia of the vetting authority. ""It's only a draft proposal before the country,"" the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said in a tweet. ""I would appeal not to pass hasty judgment, but put up your suggestions."" Speaking to the Economic Times, he said: ""It is a general concern being raised that India as a responsible country must have provisions to secure its boundary and territory. ""That is why the bill is necessary. ""It is not a question of sending a message to any firm or company - but it is a question of addressing our own security concern."" In a country where the number of people owning a mobile phone is rocketing, providing online maps is a big and growing business. If this bill goes through, no-one, from Google to the smallest business, will be able to run their map services in India without a licence. The government will control how anyone uses online maps. When I want to book a cab using a taxi app service, I'm sharing my location with the service to find a cab. The driver uses a map to navigate. When I take a picture and upload it with metadata, I'm creating mapping information that would require a licence. A growing protest online, with the hashtag ""savethemap,"" claims the bill won't just hurt individuals, but also small businesses. Campaigner Sumandro Chattapadhyay says companies such as Uber and Google will survive by getting all their maps vetted by the government. ""But smaller companies have no means to know what kind of geospatial information they can store and what they cannot,"" she says. ""Moreover, if a start-up requires three months to get approvals for your data before you can use it, it'll be as good as dead."" The bill also bans the publication of such material outside the country, and is designed to apply to citizens of India living and working in other countries, explicitly stating offenders outside India will be subject to the same penalties. ""This act needs to be dropped,"" said managing editor Arup Dasgupta, in a post on Geospatial World magazine's website. ""This act does not, in fact cannot, even begin to comprehend the paradigm shift in geospatial technologies which makes it a non-starter. ""India does need a geospatial information act, but it has to be an enabling and encouraging act that makes for faster and better implementation of programmes, not a regressive and punitive act as the proposed one,"" he said. The bill is still in the draft stage, and government is inviting submissions on it until 4 June.",1,940
"The Northern Ireland international, 28, was charged on 29 July with breaching FA rule E8, which bars professional players from betting on football-related matters. The offence took place on 20 February. Lafferty made one league appearance for Norwich last season, and played six times for Birmingham City on loan. He was an unused substitute as Norwich started their Championship season with a 4-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday. Rule E8 prevents professional players not only from betting on matches in which they are involved or have an influence, but also on any other football-related matter anywhere in the world - including matches, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.",1,941
"Vikki Thompson, 21, died at HMP Leeds on 13 November. She had been awaiting sentencing for robbery. Her partner Bob Steele said the letter should have alerted officials to her apparent distress, and added he had been ""robbed of the love of my life."" A Prison Service spokesman said an inquiry into her death is ongoing. In the letter, seen by BBC Look North, Ms Thompson said: ""I just feel like I don't want to be here no more."" She signed off the letter saying: ""I'm going now because I can't stop crying."" A post-mortem examination found the cause of Ms Thompson's death was thought to be hanging. At the opening of an inquest into her death it was revealed Ms Thompson was considered to be ""at risk of self-harm"" and was being monitored regularly. Mr Steele said: ""She didn't like being in there. She hated it, people saying things to her. ""She was moved onto a wing with people who were sex offenders, and she had been abused as a child. ""She's wrote this letter and numerous other letters implying she's going to harm herself. She's told them she's going to harm herself. Why did they allow it to happen? ""I think the prison have robbed me of the love of my life."" Following Ms Thompson's death, Minister for Prisons Andrew Selous said a review of the policy relating to the care of transgender prisoners had begun earlier this year. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""There is an investigation under way by the independent prison and probation ombudsman as well as an inquest into her death. ""It would be inappropriate to comment further while these are ongoing.""",1,942
"US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that can kill and eat harmful bugs. The study, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to a ""major change in treatment,"" a UK expert said. B3 was tested on Staphylococcal infections, such as the potentially fatal MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Such infections are found in hospitals and nursing homes, but are also on the rise in prisons, the military and among athletes. The scientists used extremely high doses of B3 - far higher than that obtained from dietary sources - in their tests, carried out both on animals and on human blood. And the researchers say there is as yet no evidence that dietary B3 or supplements could prevent or treat bacterial infections. The researchers say B3 appears to be able to ""turn on"" certain antimicrobial genes, boosting the immune cells' killing power. Prof Adrian Gombart, of Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute, who worked on the research, said: ""This is potentially very significant, although we still need to do human studies. ""Antibiotics are wonder drugs, but they face increasing problems with resistance by various types of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus. ""This could give us a new way to treat Staph infections that can be deadly, and might be used in combination with current antibiotics. ""It's a way to tap into the power of the innate immune system and stimulate it to provide a more powerful and natural immune response."" Prof Mark Enright, of the University of Bath, said: ""Neutrophils are really the front line against infections in the blood and the use of nicotinamide seems safe at this dose to use in patients as it is already licensed for use. ""This could cause a major change in treatment for infections alongside conventional antibiotics to help bolster patients immune system. ""I would like to see in patient clinical trials but cannot see why this couldn't be used straight away in infected patients.""",1,943
"The star whisked through 23 songs in 90 minutes, in a blur of pyrotechnics, lasers and multiple costume changes. She donned silken butterfly wings for a piano-led version of...Baby One More Time, and dressed as a ringmaster during a Circus-themed segment. Spears even made a passable attempt at a London accent while chatting to the audience between songs. ""Do you wanna get norr-tee?"" she teased, doing her best Sid James impersonation before launching into Freakshow - during which she dragged a (slightly over-enthusiastic) member of the audience around the stage on a leash. It was all great fun but, without the elaborate set pieces of her Vegas production, Spears' shortcomings were left exposed. Her vocals rarely seemed to be coming from the microphone, while her dancing lacked attitude and bite. The choreography was over-reliant on hand gestures; and Spears showed a tendency to slip in and out of time, like a clockwork doll whose mechanism had worn out. Her biggest blunder came during the song Touch of My Hand, as she leant over a dancer's arm to initiate a backflip, but teetered on her heels and aborted the move. Frustratingly, Spears showed glimpses of her former glories - pulling off a series of impressive lifts, as well as a punchy dance breakdown during Womanizer - but the routines more often felt like they were stuck in the rehearsal room. Tabloids will undoubtedly criticise the star for miming (the producers insist she sings over a pre-recorded backing track) but, at this point, expecting Spears to sing live is like turning up at Nando's and ordering truffles: The only person you're disappointing is yourself. In the end, Spears has always played second fiddle to her songs - especially in the second half of her career, following a much-documented breakdown in 2007 that means her life is still controlled by a court-approved conservatorship - and those songs provided an unshakeable foundation to her act. By now, the 34-year-old has accumulated enough hits to be able to dispense with...Baby One More Time and Oops!...I Did It Again at the top of her show, without worrying about the consequences. Later highlights included an energised version of Gimme More and a pounding, gothic revamp of the early single Stronger. The star only played one new song - the ethereal, beatific Make Me - which may count as a missed opportunity to reinvigorate sales of her album, Glory, which tumbled down the charts to number 94 last Friday, after just three weeks on sale. But it was the 2004 hit Toxic that received the most enthusiastic reception from the audience, whose singing almost drowned out the loudspeakers at London's Roundhouse. Among the fans joining in with the Britney karaoke were Sam Smith, Rita Ora, Nicholas Hoult and All Saints singer Melanie Blatt; while thousands more were able to watch at home, as the gig was streamed as part of the Apple Music Festival. Spears seemed overwhelmed by the reaction, clasping her hand to her mouth and blurting out, ""You guys have been amazing,"" as she left the stage. Fans may have a long wait before she repeats the show in the UK, however, with her Las Vegas residency already booking into 2017. The Apple Music festival continues until the end of the week, with performances from Michael Buble and Chance The Rapper.

"Natalia Wilkanowska, 50, disappeared in 2003 after travelling to visit her ex-husband Gerald Doherty in Luton. Her body was found in December 2015, Luton Crown Court was told. Mr Doherty's brothers, Joseph and Daniel, are on trial accused of helping conceal her remains and lying to police. The court heard Natalia was last seen by her children in April 2003 when she left her Eastbourne home to travel to Luton. Prosecutor Neil King said her ex-husband was responsible for her death. The couple had separated in 2001 after 23 years of marriage. Mr Doherty took his own life at a flat in Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, on their wedding anniversary in July 2003. He had been receiving psychiatric care. His two brothers, who both wore hearing loops in the dock, face a total of seven charges. Natalia's death came to light in 2014 when Joseph Doherty revealed Gerald had murdered her, but that her remains had been ""chopped up."" Mr King told the court Natalia's body was found a year later - intact - under rubble in the garden of Daniel Doherty's house in Icknield Way, Luton. She had suffered ""a blunt force trauma"" inflicted by a third party, but the cause of death could not be established.

"It seems in Northern Ireland we call it Tuesday. Politics dominates the front pages of the papers again today as the clock which was supposed to stop yesterday at 16:00 keeps on ticking. The Belfast Telegraph seems to have run out of patience and says of stalemate MLAs who failed to secure an agreement: ""Give them three months then stop their pay."" It quotes a member of the panel that sets MLAs' salaries who says their wages cost the taxpayer PS13.5m per year - about the same as the botched Renewable Heating Incentive scheme that brought down the power-sharing executive. Former Ass Chief Const Alan McQuillan says there would be public fury if MLAs were able to ""sit back and collect pay cheques in the absence of a working executive."" ""The political vacuum means that jobs and public services are under threat in the wider community,"" he says. ""For MLAs to continue merrily on full pay and expenses would anger people who were feeling the pain of the failure to reach a deal.""

He says if Mr Brokenshire makes the wrong decision, he could ""leave this place even more divided.""

Jack Glenn went missing on 2 February after he failed to return home from a night out. The News Letter leads with its editorial'Morning View' on the front page, where it is clear on its position with a headline that asserts: ""Sinn Fein holding us all to ransom."" It asks when London ""will dismiss pressure from Dublin and realise the Sinn Fein, which is not the first choice of 72 of voters, cannot hold Northern Ireland to ransom just because the party doesn't care if the Province fails?"" ""London is naturally afraid of a return to violence.... but there is only so long you can act timidly due to such fears,"" it reads. The editorial concludes with a plea to readers not to take its stance as sectarian. ""The News Letter has shown its independence from unionist parties in our relentless scrutiny of RHI,"" it argues. ""Now Northern Ireland faces another governance scandal. ""Regrettably, direct rule is looking to be the best way forward, so that hard decisions can be made free of a Sinn Fein veto."" News Letter reporter Stephen Gamble took to the streets of Coleraine where he says the people share the paper's view that direct rule is the best option for a way forward.

"The beach where Seifeddine Rezgui stood on Friday, pulled a Kalashnikov from his parasol and unleashed Tunisia's worst ever terror attack, has already reopened. Camera crews capture the spot; passers-by pause for a moment. But the emotional scars of the tragedy that took place will live on for a generation. For 57-year-old Sabi, they're still raw. He runs the boat club on the beach, used principally by customers of the Hotel Imperial, targeted that day. He points to the spot where the gunman opened fire, appearing first to make a phone call, before throwing his mobile into the sea and beginning his killing spree. ""People all around me were falling,"" he recalls, ""and I just grabbed as many customers as I could and ran."" They went through a staff gate to a basement of the hotel - but Sabi returned to bring more to safety. ""I saw six of our loyal customers die, people who always came to this hotel. They were like brothers to me. This beach should be full of life now. But it's deserted."" Sabi pauses, looking at the rows of empty sunbeds. ""We will fight,"" he says, his lip quivering, tears welling up. ""At least we can still smile."" Tunisia is a nation in shock - and its tourism lifeline is under serious threat. Thousands of holidaymakers have already left on emergency flights laid on by tour operators. I watched as another busload from the Hotel Imperial arrived at the local Enfidha airport on Saturday night, heading for Manchester. Among them was one man whose fiancee had died in front of him. Most were too traumatised to talk. But in the hotels beside the Imperial, dozens are staying put. ""I wanted to leave early,"" says Isabelle Campbell from Gateshead, ""but my husband said: if we go, they win. I'm not relaxed though, I'm nervous about going to the beach."" Her husband, Bob Taylor, says they ventured down earlier and saw a speed-boat manoeuvring in the water, revving its engines towards them. ""For a moment, we thought: Oh God, something is going to happen again. We used to go to Egypt but changed to Tunisia because of the security threat there,"" he adds. ""Now we don't know what'll happen here."" One in ten Tunisians works in the tourism industry. It took a hit after the attack on the Bardo museum in March - and is now widely expected to plummet. The fear of that has only added to Tunisians' anguish over a worrying rise in Islamist attacks. The birthplace of the Arab Spring, which was widely praised for its largely peaceful transition to democracy, now has more people fighting in Syria and Iraq than any other country: an estimated 3,000 Tunisians are thought to be there, many feared to have joined so-called Islamic State (IS). A once peaceful Arab democracy has been shaken by the chaos and civil conflict of neighbouring Libya, where IS has taken root and is thought to train increasing numbers of Tunisians crossing a porous border. It is all a vast challenge for Tunisia's new coalition government, which has scrambled to announce a security clampdown, including the closure of 80 mosques suspected of being breeding grounds for radical Islam. Critics say the reaction has been too late. ""These people want to destroy Tunisia,"" says Dorra Brahem, a local student, walking on the beach with her sister Aisha and friend Fatma. ""They have misunderstood Islam. Something serious is happening here."" Has the joy of Tunisia's revolution died, I ask? ""Yes,"" says Dorra.

"Thieves broke into the house in Intake, Doncaster on Thursday, a week after Paris Mulholland's 11th birthday. In the letter, she tells the burglars ""how much they hurt me,"" that she cries for two hours each night, and they had made her ""scared of the dark again."" Paris wrote the letter after speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield. More on this and other stories from BBC South Yorkshire Gemma Mulholland said the letter helped her daughter tell the thieves ""how she feels, and how it's affected her."" She said: ""I really am super proud of her."" Paris' new iPhone, a laptop she got for Christmas, and birthday money was taken from her bedroom, as well as her grandmother's gold watch. Cash, jewellery and other items were taken in the robbery, along with Paris' and her younger brother Thomas' belongings. Ms Mulholland said Paris was too upset to sleep in her bedroom after seeing it ransacked. Lego models were broken and photos taken on Paris' phone during a recent trip to Disneyland may have been lost forever. Paris wrote: ""To my burgler [sic].

"Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, ""Hello Earth! Can you hear me?"" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. ""Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,"" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: ""It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment."" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. ""I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,"" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and ""these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,"" she said. ""What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets."" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt. This process will throw out a huge shroud of gas and dust, and if Philae can continue to keep working it will provide scientists with an extraordinary view of what is happening right at the surface of 67P.",1,952
"All 42 of its member clubs are expected to take strict disciplinary measures against fans who indulge in anti-social behaviour during matches. The updated guidance, which comes into force immediately, states that home clubs are responsible for ""good order and security."" Clubs are also urged to step up efforts to identify culprits. Under the previous rules, clubs could argue that they had taken all practical steps to deter misbehaviour inside their stadiums. Now they must been seen to actively pursue cases and take ""appropriate"" action against the perpetrators. In June, following disorder at the Scottish Cup final, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson called for ""a transparent and robust scheme"" to prevent and deal with unacceptable conduct. He went on to warn: ""The Scottish government is prepared to act if Scottish football isn't."" On the rule changes, SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: ""The SPFL and its member clubs are committed to preventing and to addressing unacceptable conduct where it arises, to ensure our stadiums are friendly, welcoming and safe environments where all supporters can enjoy Scottish football. ""This ongoing work includes this updated guidance for clubs which sets out the reasonably practicable measures that member clubs can take to address this issue and to identify and sanction those who engage in unacceptable conduct. ""It has been fully consulted on with all 42 clubs, the Scottish FA and the Scottish Government and, indeed, dialogue continues with the Government on a number of further measures which will be discussed early this year.""",1,953
"Andreu was denied from the spot by a brilliant save from Raith keeper Kevin Cuthbert 15 minutes from time. United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was sent off in 55 minutes after collecting a second yellow card. Rudi Skacel struck the bar for Raith but neither side could find the net. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon is desperate to add more of a goal threat to his team and Dutch trialist striker Felitciano Zschusschen watched from the stands. The Tangerines struggled to make clear cut chances but with 15 minutes to go Scott Fraser went down in the box as he tried to go between Jean Yves M'Voto and Kyle Benedictus. Cuthbert produced an impressive save to deny Norwich City's on-loan striker Andreu to ensure the points were shared. Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: ""It was a great save from Kevin but he shouldn't have had to make it. It was a poor decision. ""I'm not one that likes to go about these things as the referees have got a hard job and it's not something I want to talk about too much but it was a soft, soft decision.

Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: ""I'm so proud of the players today as I thought we were the better team for the entire 90 minutes and even when we were down to ten men we were excellent. ""We created a few chances but there will be twists and turns in this league all season and we have lots of positives to take forward.

"It has been hailed as the most comprehensive list to date. About 9,000 names - nearly all German - are on the Auschwitz garrison list, some with photographs attached. The INR hopes the list will prove that Auschwitz was not a Polish-run camp. More than a million people died there. The victims were overwhelmingly Jewish - but Poles, Roma and political prisoners were also murdered. INR head Jaroslaw Szarek said that the creation of the database, the only one of its kind in the world, marked a historic day. It includes information about SS commanders and guards who worked at Auschwitz-Birkenau, their names, place and date of birth, nationality, military service and where possible, a photograph. The information was gathered from Poland, Germany, Austria and the US. Mr Szarek said it would help combat the wholly incorrect practice of referring to Auschwitz as a Polish-run camp. He said the institute hoped to compile similar lists for other Nazi camps in occupied Poland. In cases where a person has stood trial, judicial documents relating to the case are included with the documents.

The new database is being made accessible in five languages and ""is a tool to fight lies,"" Mr Szarek said. ""We're not expressing an opinion, we're presenting the cold, hard facts.""

"Princess Anne spoke to well-wishers outside the church after attending the service with her father Prince Philip, brother Prince Edward and other royals. Buckingham Palace said the Queen is ""still recuperating"" from a heavy cold. Missing church was a ""precautionary measure"" in cold and wet weather and there was ""no sense of undue concern."" Twelve days ago the palace said both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had heavy colds and had cancelled their plans to travel to Sandringham on 21 December. They left for their Christmas break a day late, travelling by helicopter instead of train. Prince Philip has since made a full recovery. The Queen did not attend the Christmas Day service at her Norfolk estate, the first time she has missed the service in many years. The New Year's Day service at Sandringham was led by the Bishop of Norwich. Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, who accompanied her to the service, added that the Queen was feeling ""not too bad."" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also absent from the service, after they, Prince George and Princess Charlotte spent Christmas with Kate's family at Bucklebury in Berkshire. By Royal Correspondent Peter Hunt For a second time, during the holiday season, senior royals have attended church. For a second time, the Queen has been a notable absentee. Given her deep personal faith, it's a decision the Supreme Governor of the Church of England will not have taken lightly. But at 90 - and on the advice of her doctor - she is exercising caution as she recovers from a heavy cold which she's had for at least 12 days, and which is bound to have left her feeling pretty miserable. Officials insist the head of state is up and about; she has not been to hospital or had tests; and she continues to deal with the documents she receives in her government red box. As well as missing church, the under-the-weather monarch has become a voluntary prisoner inside her own Sandringham home.

"Five justices in the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge for an inquiry into the shootings at Batang Kali in 1948 by a four to one majority. The families, who say the men were ""massacred,"" had their case rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last year. British forces at the time of the killings said the men were insurgents. In the Supreme Court panel's judgement, one of the justices, Lord Kerr, described the case as ""shocking"" and said the ""overwhelming preponderance of currently available evidence"" showed ""wholly innocent men were mercilessly murdered."" He said it was ""with regret"" that he dismissed the appeal. ""This is an instance where the law has proved itself unable to respond positively to the demand that there be redress for the historical wrong that the appellants so passionately believe has been perpetrated on them and their relatives,"" Lord Kerr said. ""That may reflect a deficiency in our system of law. It certainly does not represent any discredit on the honourable crusade that the appellants have pursued."" Another of the justices, Lady Hale, said she would have allowed the appeal and said the UK government ""did not seriously consider the most cost-effective form which such an inquiry might take."" ""They did not seriously consider the ""bigger picture"": the public interest in properly inquiring into an event of this magnitude; the private interests of the relatives and survivors in knowing the truth and seeing the reputations of their deceased relatives vindicated,"" she said. The appellants in the case - Chong Nyok Keyu, Loh Ah Choi, Lim Kok and Wooi Kum Thai, two of whom were at Batang Kali as children - were supported by the action group Condemning The Batang Kali Massacre, a campaign in Malaysia that includes 568 civil society organisations. Michael Fordham QC, representing the appellants, told the court that the families wished to ""vindicate the legitimate interests of the deceased, in order to achieve justice, before they die themselves."" Relatives argued that Article 2 - the right to life - of the European Convention on Human Rights imposes a duty on the UK to commission an independent inquiry, despite the killings occurring before the convention was drafted and signed. It was argued on behalf of the government that the Human Rights Act ""does not have retrospective effect and does not impose an obligation to hold an inquiry into deaths occurring several decades before it came into force."" The account of the British authorities at the time was that the deceased were justifiably shot while they were attempting to escape from the patrol. An official explanation was contained in a written parliamentary answer in Hansard, published on 26 January 1949. On 11 and 12 December 1948 - when Malaya was still a British colony - 24 villagers were killed by a platoon of Scots Guards during a raid at Batang Kali. The men were Chinese migrant workers suspected by the British of helping rebels during the Malayan Emergency - a conflict between communist guerrillas and British and Commonwealth forces, which lasted 12 years. An investigation at the time cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing, but in 1970 some of the soldiers said the villagers had been executed. In the 1990s, authorities in Malaysia opened an investigation, but it was halted before a conclusion was reached. There have been numerous calls for a public inquiry - all of which have been rejected by the UK.",1,959

"The self-styled Islamic State group said two days ago that Abu-Zakariya al-Britani detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul. He is believed to have been originally known as Ronald Fiddler. Fiddler, 50 and from Manchester, was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002. IS has now published a photograph of Fiddler, who was also known as Jamul-Uddin al-Harith before taking the nom-du-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani. He had been seized by US forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo. US interrogators found he provided useful information to them about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. The Daily Mail reported Fiddler received a million pounds in compensation from the government when he came back to the UK. The BBC has seen IS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014 when he crossed into Syria from Turkey. He volunteered to be a fighter, saying his knowledge of Islam was basic. His wife told the Daily Mirror that she and their five children went to Syria try to persuade him to come back, but failed, and they ended up having to flee for their lives from IS territory. Afzal Ashraf, a former counter-terrorism adviser to the United States in Iraq, told the BBC this incident demonstrated that ""some of the people in Guantanamo Bay were up to no good."" ""It also throws into question some of the organisations that were supporting him, that brought him back [from Guantanamo]. ""Some of them were associated a little too closely with this radical ideology, and they use the legal system - freedoms of speech, the importance of the rule of law - in order to subvert some of our systems in the UK and elsewhere."" BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the ""pipeline"" of British and European jihadists who once crossed the Turkish border into Syria, into IS-controlled territory, has now ""pretty much dried up."" He added: ""Guantanamo Bay was incredibly bad in the ideological fight against extremism. It makes it very difficult for America, Britain and other countries whose nationals are there to maintain any kind of moral high ground, because they [detainees] were imprisoned without trial. ""And what do you do about the estimated 400 British jihadists who are still out there? If they don't die on the battlefield, are they going to try and come back? How do you monitor them? Do you believe the people who say'I've turned my back on all of that'. ""Most people will probably want to do exactly that. Some, though, may have other ideas."" According to figures published by the UK government last year, about 850 people regarded as a national security concern have gone to become fighters in the Middle East. Of those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15 are dead. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. ""As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas.""",1,961
"He crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race - a gesture made by Ethiopia's Oromo people who have suffered brutal police crackdowns. He says he may be killed if he goes home but Ethiopia's government says he will be welcomed as a hero. However, state media is not showing photos of him crossing the line. There has been a wave of protests in Ethiopia in recent months over a series of frustrations, including attempts by the governments to reallocate land in the Oromo and Amhara regions. US-based Human Rights Watch says security forces have killed more than 400 Oromo protesters, a figure the government disputes. Rule 50 of the Olympic charter bans political displays or protests and the IOC say they are gathering information about the case. The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in neighbouring Kenya says Mr Feyisa is being described by some as the bravest Olympian at the Rio Games for his anti-government protest, but he now faces the prospect of a life in exile. Within hours of his protest, a crowd-funding page was set up, saying the runner had displayed ""extraordinary heroism"" and that he had become an ""international symbol"" for the Oromo protests. The California-based organiser had initially set a target of 10,000 but it was exceeded within an hour. ""We raised the bar to 25,000 and that too was exceeded in a few hours,"" Solomon Ungashe wrote on Facebook. After the race, Mr Feyisa explained why, as an Oromo, he supported the protests about land and resources. ""The Ethiopian government is killing my people so I stand with all protests anywhere as Oromo is my tribe. My relatives are in prison and if they talk about democratic rights they are killed,"" he said. A legal team hired by Ethiopians in US is headed to Rio to try and help Mr Feyisa, who has a wife and two children in Ethiopia, with a request to seek asylum in the US. But Information Minister Getachew Reda told the BBC the government had no reason to arrest him and it respected his political opinion. He also said none of Mr Feyisa's relatives had been jailed over the Oromo protests. Ethiopian state-owned television station EBC Channel 3 covered the race live, including the finish, but did not repeat the clip in subsequent bulletins - focussing instead on the winner Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge.",1,962
"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was supposed to open the way to aid deliveries in Syria, followed by the rolling out of a co-ordinated military campaign by Moscow and Washington against so-called Islamic State (IS) targets and other groups linked to al-Qaeda. In practice the latest attacks on the aid convoy and hospital seem to have taken things back to square one. Indeed the cynicism of the attack on the convoy in particular is remarkable. The Russians have shown drone footage of their monitoring of the convoy, the route and location of which were pre-announced. But what happened next is disputed. The Americans are hinting strongly that the convoy was attacked from the air by a pair of Sukhoi Su-24 jets - either Russian or Syrian. It makes little difference to Washington, which holds Moscow responsible either way. In contrast, the Russians deny any culpability; they say their aircraft were not in the area and that the destruction of the convoy was the result of action on the ground - the implication is from rebel forces. Quite what purpose anyone had in destroying the convoy is unclear, other than to jeopardise the ceasefire. But the seeds of its collapse were there from the outset. Firstly, the ceasefire was negotiated not between the warring parties on the ground but by two of their patrons - the US and Russia - who are both engaged in the conflict, in different ways and with very different goals. The Syrian Government and the various rebel factions were not involved. Secondly, neither the Russians nor the Americans were able to convince their allies to accept the deal. Moscow had the easier job, to convince the Assad regime, which is hugely dependent upon Russia. The Americans were able to convince some of the rebel groups to back the deal - but many others did not. Indeed many of them have no particular relationship with the Americans. Furthermore, the complex and untidy nature of the Syrian battlefield with multiple localised conflicts going on across the country, prosecuted by a variety of actors, made the idea of any ceasefire difficult from the outset. The idea that the guns should fall silent in one war - between the Assad government and a variety of rebel groups - while the US and Russia put their foot on the accelerator in another battle against IS is a little bizarre. Any hammering of IS would create local vacuums into which one or other actor, the government or the rebels, might step. In any case many at the Pentagon (and probably one would imagine some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS. If there was insufficient trust at the outset, then the attack on the aid convoy and the recriminations between Washington and Moscow now, have only made matters worse. The conflict seems to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues. The Assad regime is too weak to retake all the areas of the country it has lost. The rebel opposition too weak to seriously challenge it beyond the areas it already holds. The Kurds as well as the Turkish incursion into Syria add an additional level of complexity to the problem. And as mentioned above the continued assault on IS will change the strategic map in Syria whatever happens elsewhere.",1,963
"In the corner of a busy hospital ward, tucked behind a curtain for our arrival, lies Joshua Davies. His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down the bed and you can see both his feet and his left hand in casts. A month ago, Joshua fell from a bridge near his home in Pontypridd, fracturing his spine in four places. The reason for the fall? According to Joshua, it was to get away from bullies. He told Newsbeat: ""I can remember speaking on the phone to the ambulance telling them'I can't move my legs'. ""They put me on a spinal board, and that's all I can remember from it."" Joshua's family said police had been contacted 15 times about attacks on the teenager, who has Asperger's syndrome. South Wales Police said it had carried out ""a thorough investigation"" into assault complaints and had arrested and bailed three teenagers. The family claims the teenager has been bullied for the last five years, targeted because of his disability, which is a form of autism. ""Josh has never really had an identity as such, he's a good lad, he's a pleaser, he would do anything for anyone,"" said his mother Cheryl Davies. ""Because of the Asperger's Joshua struggles with social cues. ""When people confront him, if they're nice to him, Joshua thinks they want to be his friend. Which isn't always the case."" ""He's slowly getting there, and it is giving him a few setbacks when he has those reality checks, although he's trying to stay positive."" During his time in hospital, Joshua has had lots of visitors but said it's still hard to take his mind off what happened. ""I've got family to come up and see me and friends, and I've got things to entertain me. ""But when I am on my own I'm just thinking'I am lucky to have survived and carry on with my life'.""

"It's not that surprising that even an experienced gardener like him looks a bit awkward. I'm not sure that many of us would quite know what to do when handed a giant vegetable in front of a pack of photographers. But it won't be surprising to see it all over the newspapers and stuck in people's memories. And it was a reminder that before Mr Corbyn even tries to win the battles he will certainly face this week - over nuclear weapons, over how to balance the country's books, or over the way Labour makes its decisions - his team's priority must be, get through the week without mishap. For party conferences are strange, intense, microclimates where the what is said on the stage, however carefully crafted or considered, can be subsumed by our old friends, ""events,"" however silly. And sometimes those are the moments that shift opinion, or express a truth political parties don't want to contemplate. And occasionally, they are the moments senior politicians lose control. In 2003 I remember seeing Conservative aides grimace during the then leader Iain Duncan Smith's speech, as he promised the ""quiet man"" was ""turning up the volume."" That week, everywhere Conservatives had been huddled in corners wondering how to unseat him. His strangely delivered speech contributed to his ultimate exit. In 2006 I remember Cherie Blair's unguarded, and then denied remark, whizzed round the conference centre in 2006, when she cried out ""it's a lie"" when Gordon Brown heaped praise on her husband. Nothing expressed the levels of bitterness between the two camps so well. In 2008, it wasn't just the rather silly picture of him clutching a banana that put David Miliband onto the front pages, but that he'd been overheard talking of avoiding a ""Heseltine moment."" His leadership ambitions were what made the conference banana moment worth printing. The year before, when Sir Menzies Campbell was already under attack for lacklustre leadership of the Liberal Democrats, I recall the uncomfortable press visit to an environmentally friendly house outside Bournemouth, where aides allowed him to be photographed while inspecting an organic toilet. Awkward didn't begin to cover it. Unfair perhaps, but that moment suggested all that what was wrong with his party machine, and weeks later he was gone. There is so much at stake for the Labour Party this week, that Jeremy Corbyn's ""marrow moment"" may be quickly forgotten. The point is, to have a hope of sticking to his agenda, the first priority for Team Corbyn may be avoiding mishaps. In the frantic environment of conference, much more experienced political teams have lost complete control of events. One senior Labour figure suggested to me that with Mr Corbyn's first Prime Minister's Questions, ""expectations were low, so when it wasn't a disaster it was a relief,"" and that conference might be the same. With disagreements all around, and the extraordinary divisions between Labour's supporters and members and their MPs, a silly photograph on the eve of the event may prove the least of Mr Corbyn's concerns. What his team will hope tonight is that its awkwardness, his visible discomfort, doesn't in fact set the tone.",1,965

"Leicester's Matty James and Villa's Ciaran Clark were sent off in the game. Both clubs admitted an FA charge of ""failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion andor refrained from provocative behaviour."" Villa's case will be heard by an Independent Regulatory Commission. Players clashed on the pitch during Leicester's 1-0 win following a tackle by James on Jores Okore. There was then a confrontation between the benches as the players walked off at full time. It is the third time Villa have been found guilty of the offence this season. They were fined PS20,000 and PS30,000 for failing to control their players in games against Tottenham and Manchester United respectively.",1,969
"The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts. The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they added. Lenovo faces questions about why and for how long it was pre-installed on machines - and what data was collected. The company told the BBC in a statement: ""Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015. At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in the market from activating Superfish. ""Superfish was preloaded on to a select number of consumer models only. Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish."" Users began complaining about Superfish in Lenovo's forums in the autumn, and the firm told the BBC that it was shipped ""in a short window from October to December to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping."" User feedback, it acknowledged, ""was not positive."" Last month, forum administrator Mark Hopkins told users that ""due to some issues (browser pop up behaviour, for example),"" the company had ""temporarily removed Superfish from our consumer systems until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues."" He added it had requested that Superfish issue an auto-update for ""units already in market."" Superfish was designed to help users find products by visually analysing images on the web to find the cheapest ones. Such adware is widely regarded in the industry as a form of malware because of the way it interacts with a person's laptop or PC. Security expert from Surrey University Prof Alan Woodward said: ""It is annoying. It is not acceptable. It pops up adverts that you never asked for. It is like Google on steroids. ""This bit of software is particularly naughty. People have shown that it can basically intercept everything and it could be really misused."" According to security experts, it appears that Lenovo had given Superfish permission to issue its own certificates, allowing it to collect data over secure web connections, known in malware parlance as a man-in-the-middle attack. ""If someone went to, say, the Bank of America then Superfish would issue its own certificate pretending to be the Bank of America and intercept whatever you are sending back and forth,"" said Prof Woodward. Ken Westin, senior analyst at security company Tripwire, agreed: ""If the findings are true and Lenovo is installing their own self-signed certificates, they have not only betrayed their customers' trust, but also put them at increased risk."" Although Lenovo has said that it has removed Superfish from new machines and disabled it from others, it was unclear what the situation would be for machines where it had already been activated. Prof Woodward said: ""Lenovo is being very coy about this but it needs to explain how long it has been doing this, what the scale is and where all the data it has collected is being stored. ""There will be remnants of it left on machines and Lenovo does not ship the disks that allow people to do a clean install."" It raises wider questions about the deals that computer manufacturers do with third parties and the amount of software that comes pre-installed on machines. Mr Westin said: ""With increasingly security and privacy-conscious buyers, laptop and mobile phone manufacturers may well be doing themselves a disservice by seeking outdated advertising based monetisation strategies."" Users were particularly angry that they had not been told about the adware. One Lenovo forum user said: ""It's not like they stuck it on the flier saying.... we install adware on our computers so we can profit from our customers by using hidden software. ""However, I now know this. I now will not buy any Lenovo laptop again."" The problem also caused a storm on Twitter, where both Lenovo and Superfish were among the most popular discussion topics.",1,970

"As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunky laptop - this was Dr Craig Wright. He carried on working, apparently unaware that we had entered the room. Once we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the cryptographic keys used by Satoshi when he made the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009. We had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of Bitcoin was at last stepping out of the shadows. What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain. But Jon Matonis, a senior figure in the Bitcoin world, was in the room watching, having had his own demonstration some time before. And the news that Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, was also convinced provided more reassurance. Now Craig Wright has published his evidence on his blog, it will be examined in minute detail for any chink in his case. But put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he didn't care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating, if somewhat prickly Dr Wright. Why keep his secret so long? Why come out now? What about that run-in with the Australian tax authorities? And is he fabulously rich, with a huge stock of Bitcoin? At our first meeting - without a television camera - we roamed freely over all sorts of territory. We learned that he ran a substantial business in London, employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin trading and consultancy operation. We challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an ""audit"" underway in Australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding Bitcoin. We asked where the pseudonym had come from - he mentioned a 17th century libertarian philosopher called Nakamoto but said he'd keep the Satoshi bit to himself. He talked of the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose statement refusing the Nobel Prize is used in the Satoshi-signed file given as evidence in the blog published today. His politics were very far from the ""lefty"" Sartre, he explained, but like him he did not want his identity to be defined by one thing - he refused to be Craig ""Satoshi"" just as Sartre did not want to be Jean-Paul Nobel. What he wouldn't say is how many Bitcoins he has - ""that would be telling"" - though he indicated that he would not be spending any of them in a hurry. He told us that he had a ""nice big house and a nice fast car"" in London, went on holidays to Paris, and didn't feel the need to acquire vast riches. The second time we met, to film a television interview, the mood changed. It was immediately clear that he hated the whole process, refusing to move from behind his laptop to a more spacious room where the shot would have been much better. At first, he insisted that he would give an answer to just one question - why he had decided to go public after all these years. Once we started filming he opened up a little, but mainly because he wanted to express his anger at, as he sees it, being forced into the public eye. ""I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration, I just want to be left alone,"" he said with some venom. He accused journalists of threatening to make up stories about him if he did not cooperate and said lies had been told that would affect his family and his staff. It seems his main grievance surrounds the stories that spread last December when he was first identified as a potential Satoshi, then dismissed by some as a hoaxer. At that time, questions were asked about his academic and business career, and there were some who said he just did not have the intellectual capacity to be the man behind Bitcoin. Throughout the demonstrations he showed us he kept on stressing the complexity of the process - ""obviously everyone said I have no idea about this stuff so I'm going to do it in the most convoluted way possible."" We were then supplied with a series of documents providing evidence that Dr Craig Stephen Wright was a Master of Statistics, IT Management, and Law, and a long list of peer-reviewed articles. Now he says he intends to continue his research into improving the technology behind Bitcoin, and plans to publish several papers over the coming months. With the community around the currency in some turmoil right now over how it develops, you might think that Craig Wright could provide some leadership. After all, he could be said to be to Bitcoin what Tim Berners-Lee is to the web. But he bridled at my suggestion that he could be a figurehead for the currency, making clear that this was the first and last television interview he would do. Having emerged from the shadows, Craig Satoshi Wright now wants to return to them as quickly as possible.",1,972
"This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist: Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family. Joseph Clark came from a large family. He had five brothers and one sister. He was the third eldest and always loved spending time with his extended family when he was growing up. 'Oey' was quite a shy lad who enjoyed playing football and going out with his mates and brothers. He was very close to his siblings, as well as his Mum and Dad. Profiles of all those who died He loved it when his extended family had large gatherings. He got to meet those relatives he hadn't seen for a while. Even his aunts and uncles loved him. Joseph, who was also known as Oey, played football for two local teams and was known for being a speedy winger. One of the teams he played for was the Woodpecker Bar FC. People always commented on how good a player he was, even if he was just kicking a ball about with his mates. Oey and I met in 1978. I was 16 years old and Oey was 18. We lived around the corner from each other. 'Fell in love' We met in a club and from then fell in love. We loved each other to bits, and then, four and a half years after we met, we had our first son Joseph, who was born on 31 August, 1982. Sadly, we lost Joseph on 15 October when he was just six-and-a-half weeks old. Oey was heartbroken. Stephen was born two years later, on 22 March, 1984. Oey was over the moon and was so excited that he had a son. He nicknamed him BB. They were always playing football together and going on days out on boats up the Mersey. In 1989, we gave birth to a little girl Jennifer. She was tiny. Oey was scared to pick her up. The morning of 15 April, 1989, that horrible day, was one of the times that he did pick her up before he left the house. He had been playing football with Stephen outside while holding Jennifer in his arms and swinging her in the air. His mates arrived in the car to go to the match, so he gave us all a kiss and said'See you later' and off he went. That was the last thing that he said to us because he never came back from the match. He was only 29 years old with his whole life in front of him. 'Happy-go-lucky' Oey was employed by IBL in Liverpool and enjoyed his time working there. We all miss Oey very, very much. Life has never been the same since he died that horrible day. Our whole lives changed and I never really got over it and we're in still life. I am still the same from that day. Oey would have been proud of his children now that they are grown up. Stephen remembers lots about him, going to matches with his father and enjoying the time that they spent together. He loved Liverpool Football Club and I know that he was very proud to be able to take his own son to the matches at Anfield. Oey has three beautiful grandchildren, who he never had the chance to meet. The eldest, Joseph, was born on New Year's Eve,2005. Lee was born in 2008 and his grand-daughter, Daisy, was born on 27 July, 2012 but unfortunately Daisy only lived 12 days before she passed away. Joseph loved life to the full. He was always happy-go-lucky and forever with a smile on his face. He is missed by all of us who were lucky enough to have known him.",1,973

"Just over 46,000 vehicles were registered north of the border - a year-on-year increase of more than 2.7. However, UK sales increased by 5.3 to almost 519,000 - the strongest month recorded since 1999. March is typically the biggest month, accounting for about a fifth of the year's car registrations. Last month saw Vauxhall retain its position as market leader in Scotland, with more than 10,000 units sold. The Vauxhall Corsa remained the most popular new car, while the Ford Fiesta had a strong month and moved into the number two spot for the year to date. The figures were compiled by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Top Scottish sellers in March 1. Vauxhall Corsa 2,575 2. Ford Fiesta 1,772 3. Vauxhall Astra 1,249 4. Ford Focus 1,126 5.

""We have been aware of some dealers who were experiencing new vehicle delivery issues towards the end of the month, and this may well have had a small but noticeable negative effect. ""The rest of the UK continues to show stronger growth but as we have mentioned previously this may not all be down to sales with specific manufacturers and dealers taking tactical decisions on registrations.""",1,975
"Media playback is not supported on this device Real took the lead in the ninth minute through Karim Benzema, but Gaku Shibasaki scored either side of half-time to put Kashima in front. Ronaldo levelled from the penalty spot on the hour mark after Lucas Vazquez was fouled by Shuto Yamamoto. The Ballon d'Or winner put his side ahead in extra time after being played through by Benzema, and completed his hat-trick seven minutes later. Listen: 2016 - the year of Ronaldo? Victory gave Real their second Club World Cup and extended their unbeaten run to 37 games in all competitions. It also means nine of the past 10 winners of the competition have come from Europe. The Champions League winners looked set for a comfortable afternoon when Benzema put them ahead, and they dominated possession in the opening stages. But Kashima - the first Japanese team to reach a Club World Cup final - impressed in an entertaining game, and Shibasaki took both goals well. Indeed, after Ronaldo's equalising penalty, Kashima had the better chances late in normal time. First Keylor Navas saved a long-range strike from Fabricio, then Yasushi Endo shot wide at the back post with the final kick of the 90 minutes. At 3-2 down, Yuma Suzuki hit the bar with a header. The Japanese side also felt Real captain Sergio Ramos should have been sent off in normal time when he appeared to body-check an opponent when on a yellow card. Referees used video replays to review several decisions during the competition, but Janny Sikazwe chose not take a second look at this incident. ""The referee lacked courage, which was regrettable,"" said Kashima coach Masatada Ishii. Victory for Ronaldo capped an impressive year for the forward, coming six days after he won the Ballon d'Or, awarded to the world's best player. He scored the winning penalty in Real's Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid in May, before captaining Portugal to Euro 2016 success in the summer. His hat-trick in Yokohama was the first in a Club World Cup final, and he is now the joint-top scorer in the competition's history with five goals. ""What a game,"" said Ronaldo. ""We had to suffer, but that's what finals are about. It's a trophy we really wanted to win and we end the year in the best way possible so I'm very happy."" Ronaldo has now won the Club World Cup three times, having done so previously with Manchester United in 2008 and Real in 2014. He was already the only player to win the competition with two different clubs. Having taken over as Real coach from Rafael Benitez in January, Zinedine Zidane's first year in management has been remarkable. The Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup have all been won during an unbeaten run stretching back to April. That adds to the former France international's achievements as a player, when he won the World Cup, European Championship, La Liga, Serie A, Champions League, Intertoto Cup, Intercontinental Cup and Uefa Super Cup. Zidane's side, whose last defeat was 2-0 to Wolfsburg in the Champions League, lead La Liga by four points. Match ends, Real Madrid 4, Kashima Antlers 2.

The cathedral has said it is standing by its decision. St Mary's invited local Muslims, who also revere Jesus as a prophet, to join the service. A student, Madinah Javed, read from the lectern in Arabic from the chapter of Maryam, or Mary. The chapter tells the story of the birth of Christ to the virgin Mary, and includes the Islamic teaching that Jesus is not the son of God and should not be worshipped. Mr Ashenden told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: ""The problem with what happened in Glasgow was that, although it was presented as a way of building bridges and a way of educating people, it was done badly, in the wrong way, in the wrong place, in the wrong context. ""There are a number of members of the congregation who have written open letters complaining of the profound upset they experienced as people who are part of the Eucharistic community who had come to worship Christ."" The cathedral's provost, the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, has said readings of the Koran in the cathedral were part of efforts to build relationships between Christians and Muslims in Glasgow. He said: ""Such readings have happened a number of times in the past in this and in other churches and have led to deepening friendships locally, to greater awareness of the things we hold in common and to dialogue about the ways in which we differ."" Asked if he had known what the Koran verse specifically said about Jesus, Mr Holdsworth declined to comment further.",1,977
"The party secured about 19 of the vote, unofficial tallies show. But it is not clear if it will meet the 25 voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo in the 9 July presidential election by itself. The official election results will be announced in May. Some 19,000 seats were contested across Indonesia in Wednesday's polls, including the 560 seats in the national parliament. A poll by Jakarta think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), put the opposition Golkar party in second place with 14 of the vote, followed by the Great Indonesia Movement Party with 12. Islamic parties also appeared to have performed better than expected, together grabbing about a third of the national vote. Support for the ruling Democratic Party of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono - who cannot serve a third term as president - fell by half. His party came in fourth with 10 of the vote. Mr Yudhoyono told reporters that he respected the early results. ""Let's honour the result of this election and be ready to accept new national leadership that will lead the nation to be better,"" the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. CSIS political analyst Philips Vermonte told Reuters news agency: ""Parliament is likely to be very fragmented because many parties have gotten a relatively big share of votes."" The parliamentary polls are key to deciding which parties can field presidential candidates. Parties must either secure 25 of the total vote or 20 of the seats in parliament. Candidates whose parties fail to meet these thresholds must form or enter a coalition before they can run for president. Indonesian stocks fell over 3 on Thursday, after expectations PDI-P would secure enough votes to put Mr Widodo, the Jakarta governor, straight through to presidential polls were dashed. ""We see the possible formation of a weak government with limited ability to push through necessary reforms and policies ahead,"" Bahana Securities research head Harry Su told Reuters news agency. Mr Widodo is seen by many as Indonesia's next president. He told reporters on Wednesday that his party was ""widely open"" to a coalition. ""It is not possible for PDI-P to work alone. We have to co-operate with those having the same platform,"" he said.",1,978

"The Lord Chief Justice said a failure to do so could frustrate the rule of law. Sir Declan Morgan added that the government and Stormont Executive must address the issue urgently. There are 56 so-called legacy inquests involving 98 deaths. Earlier this year, the LCJ announced a plan he said would result in all of those inquests being heard within five years. First Minister Arlene Foster blocked a request for funding for the initiative. ""I hoped that it would receive a sympathetic hearing, I was disappointed that there was no immediate response,"" said Sir Declan. ""I hoped that in due course that the parties would be able to find a way forward, both those here within Northern Ireland and the secretary of state's office, but unfortunately so far that hasn't occurred."" Secretary of State James Brokenshire could unilaterally provide funding for the initiative, but to date has chosen not to do so. Earlier this week he was asked several times by the BBC if he accepted that the British government was in breach of its legal obligations to ensure the inquests take place. He did not acknowledge that was the case. After meeting Mr Brokenshire on Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinnness accused the British government of not being ""serious about dealing with the legacy of the past."" ""The Lord Chief Justice has asked for funds for legacy inquests to be released immediately and the British government has a responsibility to do that,"" he said. The Lord Chief Justice was clear that ""the state is under a legal obligation"" to act as quickly as possible. ""If the various agencies who are involved in examining this from a political point of view cannot reach an agreement then the danger is that the political process will end up frustrating the rule of law,"" he said. ""The parties, it seems to me, who are involved in these discussions need to take into account that there is a need for reasonable expedition, so it is up to them, it seems to me, to address this matter urgently so as to ensure that they comply with the legal obligations that all of us face in this area. ""This is not just a matter of policy, there is actually a legal obligation in relation to the legacy inquests."" He said the legal obligation to act also includes the Northern Ireland Executive. On Monday, Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly told the BBC it was ""appalling"" that the families of those involved in the legacy inquests had not had their cases heard. In response, Sir Declan said: ""I'm not surprised that the families feel incredibly frustrated by the process. ""I may be disappointed that the work that we have done has not yet come to fruition, but for the families their degree of frustration having lived with these issues for so long must be all the greater and I recognise that."" The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said the party is not prepared to move forward on legacy issues on ""a partial basis,"" where a a small number of victims had what he called ""a privileged position."" The Lord Chief Justice rejected any suggestion that he is seeking special treatment for those cases. ""I think what I would say to that is that the legacy inquests are the only element of this arrangement for which I have direct responsibility and I saw it as my responsibility to find a way forward in relation to that,"" he explained. ""Others who have direct responsibility in relation to other areas, similarly it seems to me, have to find a way forward."" The Secretary of State has made it clear he wants legacy inquests to be part of a wider political agreement on how to deal with the past. He told the BBC on Monday that a planned consultation on the issue will now not take place until he has ""broad political consensus."" Sir Declan Morgan is eager for an agreement on legacy issues as quickly as possible. ""I don't see why the wider political agreement should not be addressed now. All the victims and survivors need this issue to be grasped,"" he said. ""This is the opportunity to do something about it. As the victims commissioner has said, there is a window of opportunity now, and we should not miss it.""",1,980
"EDF boss Jean-Bernard Levy joined officials from the UK, France and China at the behind-closed-doors ceremony in London on Thursday. Earlier this month, the government gave the go-ahead for the plant which will power nearly six million homes. It will be the UK's first new nuclear plant in a generation. The meeting was a second attempt at finalising the deal after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly announced in July that she wanted time to scrutinise it. With her approval now granted and the contracts updated, the formal signing took place at a ceremony attended by Business Secretary Greg Clark and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. China's National Energy Administration director, Nur Bekri, and the chairman of Chinese firm CGN, He Yu, also attended. Mr Clark said that signing the contract was a ""crucial moment"" and that Hinkley played ""an important part in ensuring our future low-carbon energy security."" Mr Ayrault said he was pleased that the UK government had decided to go ahead with the project. QA: What is Hinkley Point and why is it important? How much would Hinkley C cost bill payers? What does China get out of Hinkley? Dozens of contracts running to thousands of pages for the huge project in Somerset are believed to have been prepared ahead of the event. The key document is the Contract for Difference, or CfD, which gives a guaranteed price for the electricity Hinkley will generate for 35 years. In return EDF, along with CGN, will finance the project and shoulder the risk of any delays. Critics say the guaranteed ""strike price"" - which is more than twice the current wholesale cost of electricity - will provide a windfall for EDF for decades to come. The formal go-ahead for Hinkley also cements China's foothold in Britain's nuclear industry. The last government signed a series of co-operation agreements in civil nuclear power with Beijing which opened the UK's market to Chinese firms. CGN will pay about a third of the cost of Hinkley. Under its agreement with EDF, it will also have a stake in a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. The Chinese will then be allowed to develop their own reactor technology at Bradwell in Essex, subject to planning and regulatory approvals. The government is now expected to publish some of the key documents linked to the deal. These will include the Contract for Difference and the waste transfer agreement that covers nuclear waste generated by the plant. After numerous delays, EDF's board agreed to proceed with the controversial project back in July. But just weeks after taking office, Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a review of the deal, leading to questions over the UK's openness to foreign investment. Her government gave its approval two weeks ago on condition that it could prevent EDF from selling its controlling stake before completion of the project. EDF's board approved the new terms on Tuesday, paving the way for the formal signing of the deal. You can follow John on Twitter at JohnMoylanBBC",1,981

They were there to discuss a report by the Head of Internal Audit at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of Education. Ms Ni Chuilin said she advised the remaining members at the meeting ""of my deep concerns at the issues raised by their staff"" with the internal auditor. On Friday, the minister called for the meeting to consider the findings of the report into ""serious allegations"" about the ""leadership, management and the overall culture"" of the organisation. After Monday's meeting, she said she had accepted the board members' resignations, and thanked them ""for their efforts in promoting and fostering sport during their time in office.""

"His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: ""I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one."" On bird flu: ""I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama."" On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: ""After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine."" Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: ""Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem."" On being sacked: ""If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later."" On Chelsea's pitch: ""Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed."" On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: ""If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message,"" Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: ""If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood."" Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: ""My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?"" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: ""When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer."" Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: ""I find Jose's'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. ""It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation."" Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: ""Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him."" Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: ""It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football."" February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined PS8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an ""enemy of football"" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined PS5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of ""fault and fault and cheat and cheat"" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined PS200,000, which is reduced to PS75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation. December 2010: Mourinho is banned for one Champions League match after being found guilty of improper conduct. It follows the dismissal of Real Madrid players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during a Champions League game against Ajax. August 2011: Mourinho, now in charge of Real Madrid, pokes Barcelona's then-assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye during touchline exchanges after a stormy Spanish Super Cup tie. January 2013: After dropping club captain Iker Casillas before the mid-winter break, reports emerge in the Spanish press of disagreements between Mourinho and some of his senior players. Stories continue to appear throughout the rest of the season about disharmony in the squad, with centre-back Pepe the latest to fall foul of Mourinho last month. May 2013: In a bad-tempered Copa del Rey final defeat by neighbours Atletico Madrid, Mourinho is sent from the bench for furiously protesting a decision from the referee.

"Mark McCarroll, a father-of-one, was working as a fork lift driver at Hayes Fuels depot in Belfast's Harbour estate when the accident happened. Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk manager Stanley Gibson both pleaded guilty at Belfast Crown Court Mr Gibson pleaded guilty to two charges, while Mr Hayes, on behalf of his company, pleaded guilty to charges of failing to ensure the safety of its employees and failing to ensure the safe storage of materials and objects. The family of Mr McCarroll, a 49-year-old grand-father, was present in court when details of the events surrounding his death were outlined to the court. A prosecution lawyer told the judge that on the day of the accident on 27 March 2013, heavy goods vehicle driver Brian Wilshaw was at the yard where his lorry was being loaded with mixed coals and briquettes. ""Mr Wilshaw flagged down Mr McCarroll in his forklift truck and he put two of three full pallets of coal on the lorry,"" the prosecution lawyer said. ""Mr McCarroll and Mr Wilshaw were in shed two on the premises calculating the number of briquettes on a slack pallet which had been already been picked up from the ground. ""The full pallets needed by Mr Wilshaw were still in the shed and while he was engaged in gathering loose briquettes from this area, Mr McCarroll was standing on the slack pallet counting the bales. ""Mr McCarroll pulled a bale out and had time to set this on the ground, at which stage, two pallet stacks fell on top of him. ""Mr Wilshaw shouted a warning but Mr McCarroll was unable to avoid being hit."" The court heard that medical assistance was called to the yard but Mr McCarroll died two days later on 29 March from chest and pelvic injuries. The judge was told that the Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland (HSENI) found a number of breaches by Hayes Fuels, including: HSENI said that Hayes Fuels should have used an overlapping or'staircase' system to store pallets. The court was told that in September 2012, Hayes Fuels hired Stanley Gibson Partnership to advise them on health and safety issues and his company subsequently carried out an audit of the premises. The Stanley Gibson Partnership provided ""numerous risk assessments"" to Hayes Fuels and lignite materials (briquettes) was intended to be included in the risk for solid fuels. ""However, there is no account mentioned to matters such as the size of pallets how the pallet and load base varied or how the lignite pallets are to be stacked,"" the prosecution lawyer said. ""It considered that the risk assessments and safety audit completed by Stanley Gibson Partnership were neither adequate nor sufficient."" The court heard that Mr McCarroll's partner, Barbara Thompson, had ""suffered both emotionally and financially from the loss of her long-term partner."" The prosecution lawyer added that his only son Christopher had suffered ""disruption to his employment and sleep patterns in the wake of his father's untimely death."" The court heard the maximum penalty that could be imposed was an unlimited fine andor two years in prison. However, the judge heard that fines in previous similar cases of a death of an employee at a workplace has ranged from PS20,000 to PS60,000. A lawyer for Mr Gibson told the judge: ""I have read the victim impact statement and I want to publicly state just how devastated my client is that he has been in any way associated with or responsible for the tragic accident. ""You cannot read those statements without recognising the impact this has had on his family. ""He identified the problem on the premises but accepts he did not take the next step and complete his audit."" A lawyer for Hayes Fuels said that on behalf of the company and Allister Hayes he wanted to ""express their sincere apologies to the McCarroll family."" The judge adjourned sentencing for a month, and told the court: ""This is a very tragic case and there is a great deal for me consider.""",1,986

Leicester flanker Will Evans and Harlequins back Joe Marchant, part of the Under-20s team who won the Junior World Championship in June, are included, while Gloucester wing Jonny May is named after recovering from a serious knee injury. England play South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia later in the year, with Jones confirming his final 45-man squad at the end of September.

"The visitors took the lead when a clever dummy from the impressive Oscar Dorley set up Maksim Maksimov to net. Defender Joe Shaughnessy headed home Liam Craig's corner to level but Trakai responded with a stunning long-range strike from Vaidotas Silenas. Craig and Graham Cummins wasted chances as Saints failed to find an equaliser. Trakai finished with 10 men as Silenas picked up a second yellow card with eight minutes left, but the visitors held on. St Johnstone made a positive start but Trakai carved out the first opening in the seventh minute. A cross found Aliaksandr Bychanok, but his diving header went wide. The Lithuanian side looked technically accomplished with 18-year-old Liberian Dorley causing Saints plenty of problems, and the visitors took the lead with a fine move in the 14th minute. A low cross into the box found Maksimov, who fired smartly past Zander Clark. The hosts should have equalised when Blair Alston broke through the centre of the FK Trakai defence but he fired straight at the keeper. The rebound fell to Cummins, who had his first shot blocked before blazing his second over the bar. Richard Foster's shot was diverted wide by Arunas Klimavicius, and from the resultant corner St Johnstone equalised, Shaughnessy heading home from close range into the corner. But the joy for the home fans was short-lived as FK Trakai took the lead for a second time. A fantastic strike from Silenas from range flashed past Clark. The noise levels inside McDiarmid Park dipped once more. At the start of the second half Dorley played in Alma Wakili down the left hand side but he fired his shot well wide of the post. Saints manager Tommy Wright brought on new signing Stefan Scougall in the hope of improving the levels of creativity from the home side. His ball from the flank presented Craig with a great chance to equalise, but the midfielder volleyed his shot high over the crossbar. Then an even better chance. From a poor Saints corner the ball fell fortuitously to the feet of Scougall. He lashed in a low shot which beat the keeper, but struck the post. FK Trakai remained a danger, Clark saving well from Maksimov, but St Johnstone had further opportunities. Alston burst through from midfield and engineered a chance at the edge of the box, but his shot was deflected wide. From the resultant corner Saints had the ball in the net from another Shaughnessy header, but the referee blew his whistle for a foul on the keeper. Silenas was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the home side could not capitalise. Alston again created an opening and as the ball flashed across goal, it fell straight to Cummins, but from five yards out the striker's shot was too close to Trakai keeper Ignas Plukas, who blocked the ball with his trailing foot. St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: ""Obviously, the result is disappointing. The second goal is criminal from us. It was a great finish but the ball should never get to him. ""We were sloppy at times in possession but I thought we created enough chances to get back in the game. But we probably didn't do enough over the 90 minutes. ""Every one of the teams in this competition are all probably technically better than us, that's why we can't allow them time on the ball. We didn't get in about them enough in the first half. ""We will have to be better in the second leg and I think we will be better. The two away goals is a huge advantage for them but I wouldn't rule us out.""",1,989

However, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match. England manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge. In the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season. The 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role. Another England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on. Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: ""It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1. ""It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances. We took the risks, the spirit of the team was good but it was not enough."" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: ""I think that it was a game that was very important. You could feel it was not a normal game and a real test for us; for that we feel very pleased for the players. ""The mentality was good and a perfect performance against a team with a lot of quality players who are top class. Full credit to my players. ""From my point of view, I did not see the penalty incident. Sometimes in football it happens, it goes for you and against you in the season.""

"Six members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg blocked the entrance to the building at Llandudno Junction at about 06:30 GMT. North Wales Police were called to the protest, which ended at midday. The Welsh government said it was taking action to promote the language. The protestors said the action was part of a general Cymdeithas campaign to put pressure on the Labour administration in Wales to act urgently for the Welsh language. They want the Welsh government to adopt six basic policy changes, including making Welsh-medium education available for all and what they call ""fair funding"" for the language. Robin Farrar, chairman of the society, said: ""We're here to speak out for the present generation, and those to come, who should be able to live in Welsh. ""There's a real crisis facing the language, but the Welsh government is not acting seriously. ""We're certain that our unique national language can thrive over the years to come with positive campaigning and political will."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are very disappointed that Cymdeithas yr Iaith has decided to take this course of action, especially as we've held regular, and constructive, dialogue with the group. ""Over the past year we have taken positive action to promote the Welsh language, including significant measures such as publishing proposed standards to improve Welsh language services to citizens.""",1,992
"Joshua Bwalya, who was 16, was found dead in the street when officers were called to Movers Lane, Barking, at about 01:00 BST on Wednesday. Det Ch Insp Gary Holmes of the Met Police said the attack was ""a senseless act of violence"" that ""was not only cowardly, but brutal."" A boy, 16, and a man, 20, suspected of involvement were also injured. Both were taken to different hospitals in the capital before they were arrested on suspicion of murder, police said. The teenager has since been discharged and released on bail while inquiries continue. The 20-year-old has also been discharged from hospital and is being held at a London police station. A post-mortem examination of Joshua's body found multiple stab wounds were the cause of death. Mr Holmes said: ""I urge anyone who has information that can help our investigation to come forward and help us to bring Joshua's murderers to justice.""",1,993
"Around 155 countries are expected to formally sign the deal at the UN, setting in motion events that could see the treaty operational within a year. The UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a ""distraction."" Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters, including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratification. For some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries, including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April 22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55 of global emissions to complete all the steps. While this is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible. Firstly President Obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational before his successor takes office next January. If the next President wants to take the US out of an established treaty they will have to wait for four years - by which time they may no longer be in charge. Many of the least developed countries are pushing forward as well because a clerical error in the drafting of the new agreement means it becomes operational as soon at it hits the 5555 mark, and not in 2020 as many people had supposed. Poorer countries fear that if the threshold is reached they could be left out in the cold if they haven't ratified, meaning they would not be able to influence the rules and organisation of the new deal. ""There was a little buzz a few weeks back with someone suggesting that some of the smaller counties should refrain from signing, in order to get a better deal,"" explained Reid Detchon from the United Nations Foundation. ""The fact that there is this large number of developing [countries] that are coming to the table here says that argument hasn't taken root and they really saw how deeply their own national self interest was bound up in success here."" Scientists and analysts are also keen on a speedy implementation of the agreement for different reasons. According to a new study by researchers at Chatham House, leaving any increase in the level of carbon cutting ambition until 2025 as detailed in the Paris deal would make it nigh on impossible to keep temperatures below 2 degrees C, never mind 1.5. ""For the Paris agreement to have any credibility we can't afford to wait ten years in order to increase ambition,"" said Shane Tomlinson, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. ""Estimates suggest that the gap between where emissions will be and where they need to be, will be around 11 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2025. That's more than the annual emissions of China,"" he added. Reid Detchon agreed on the need for urgency and increased ambition. But he was worried that global leaders didn't quite understand that getting agreement in Paris was, in some ways, the easy bit. ""My biggest concern really is that we are only on the first step of a ladder of increased ambition. It is going to become clear to the world over the next 3 -5 years how much more we need to do to stabilise the climate."" Some environmentalists and indigenous leaders believe the whole process is not worth the paper it is written on. According to the International Alliance of Frontline Communities, the Paris Agreement is a ""dangerous distraction"" from the real issues. ""I started attending the UN climate meetings in 1999. Over the last 17 years I've witnessed corporate, Wall Street and other financial influence gut any real solutions coming out of the negotiations,"" said Tom Goldtooth, of the Indigenous Environmental Network, in a statement. ""As a result, the Paris Agreement goal of stopping global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees C is not real because the pledges each country is making will allow emission levels that will increase global temperature 3 - 4 degrees. This will be catastrophic to the ecosystem of the world."" Follow Matt on Twitter MattMcGrathBBC and on Facebook.",1,994
"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria."" He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria."" The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region. Turkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this.",1,995

"Mobile measurement firm RootMetrics conducted over 840,000 checks, ranking operators for reliability and speed of voice, data and text services. While EE dominated for speed, Three was a close second in terms of reliability during last year's six-month study. Vodafone said it could not ""take the results of this report seriously and neither should our customers."" Evidence suggested some tests were ""carried out in an inconsistent manner,"" it added in a statement. O2 ranked second in the speed index, but its reliability score was lower than that of EE or Three in the tests. Each operator was rated out of 100 in a range of categories - overall performance, call performance, mobile internet, text, network reliability and network speed. EE performed best across all categories, with Three second in terms of mobile internet, text services and network reliability. Source: RootMetrics O2 came second in the call performance and network speed categories. Vodafone was last in all categories other than network speed, where it beat Three. Average speeds for networks were not given because they ranged so vastly from area to area, RootMetrics said. Neither did the study offer details about network coverage and mobile hotspots, although consumers can look at individual network performance at street level via its coverage map. EE said the results showed it gave ""customers everywhere in the UK the best mobile experience,"" partly because of its investment in new 4G services, greater 3G capacity and upgrades to 2G networks. Three said the study was ""carried out prior to our launch of 4G at no extra cost, so is not up to speed with our current performance."" Rootmetric's tests saw data scientists cover a 23,000-mile area of the UK, including urban and rural locations, with 1,000 indoor tests. They used off-the-shelf Android devices, which had the testing software installed on them. Rootmetric's Bill Moore said the aim of the testing was to get as close to a consumer experience as possible, across a range of metrics. ""It is all very well to test speeds, but if you can't get on the network then the speed becomes irrelevant,"" he told the BBC. Futhermore, he said that while all networks faced the issue of dropped calls, it was a much bigger problem in the UK than in the US, where the firm has also been conducting tests. ""Networks here have a 2 failure rate compared to 0.5 in the US,"" he said. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum, said that EE's win in this particular study represented a return on huge recent investments in coverage. ""Clearly, EE scores very well and this reflects both their strategy of wanting to continue to be one step ahead with their network and the money they have put behind it,"" he said. ""While Vodafone doesn't score so well in comparison, they shouldn't be written off. ""They too have ambitious plans for network upgrades which are being delivered through'Project Spring'. However, for the rest of the industry to close the gap on EE in terms of network speeds and availability, it is not going to be without a struggle."" Mr Howett added that consumers may want more detailed information from future surveys. ""I suspect many will be looking for this specifically broken out for 4G network performance as they are being enticed to upgrade by their operators,"" he said. Communications regulator Ofcom is planning its own UK-wide mobile survey and will shortly publish quality of service information to help consumers compare the performance of mobile networks and to encourage providers to improve.",1,997
"Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles date from the period of the Second Temple, during the time of King Herod about 2,000 years ago. The temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD during a Jewish rebellion. Some 600 segments of coloured stone floor have been found since archaeologists began examining the debris from the hilltop site in 2004. The plateau where the temples stood is the most sacred site in Judaism. It is joined by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound. Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam. The archaeologists say the tiles probably came from porticos in the temple's courtyards. Piecing the fragments together ""enables us to get an idea of the Temple's incredible splendour,"" said Dr Gabriel Barkay of the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Experts say they managed to assemble seven potential designs of how the flooring could have looked like. The type of flooring is known as opus sectile, Latin for ""cut work,"" and ""considered to be far more prestigious than mosaic tiles floors,"" according to Frankie Snyder, from the project's team. ""The tile segments were perfectly inlaid such that one could not even insert a sharp blade between them,"" she said. The Temple Mount Sifting Project was established by Israeli archaeologists in 2004 to examine debris dumped by Islamic authorities following expansion work at an underground mosque on the compound. The project attracts thousands of visitors each year who participate in finger-tip searches of the earth and has so far turned up hundreds of ancient relics, including coins, animal bones and pieces of pottery.",1,998

"Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing, but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely competitive cricket league. ""This league actually boasts about 99 of the Nigerian national team,"" says Femi Solebo, who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club. Watching a game from the welcome shade of the pavilion, he occasionally shouts out instructions to his batsmen taking on Government College Ibadan in a 50-over game. ""Over the last three or four years Nigerian cricket has stepped up quite a lot and has allowed these guys here to show their stuff at an international level,"" he says. ""Recently the national team got promoted to division five in the World Cricket League, which is a huge achievement for us - we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket."" Mr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million ""there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily."" However, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse. Besides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box. Some of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone. Femi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair: I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me ""In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,"" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos. He says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university. It is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority. And Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch. The ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season. The game is also expensive for players given the kit needed. ""With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,"" says the 45-year-old. But he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are ""from the streets."" The Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches. Kunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain: Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football ""Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,"" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity. ""I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me. ""Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now."" A few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola. The towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day. When the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past. He says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket. ""Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,"" he says. But the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit. So far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league. ""But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,"" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket. He says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating. Ibeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing. But the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too. ""If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket."" For Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters. ""It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.""",1,1001
