"This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, has given the Rohingya hope that their plight will be addressed. The Commission is tasked with finding practical solutions to complex issues, such as protecting the human rights of all people in the state, and providing access to health care and education for the Rohingya. The Commission has also called for an end to restrictions on movement and freedom of religion. While these efforts have yet to bear fruit, the Rohingya have welcomed the Commission's work as a step in the right direction.",0,0
"Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related components were almost always sent by mail, while ammunition and other related accessories were usually posted. The report found that most of the illegal arms were sold through underground networks of gun dealers and smugglers who used chat rooms and websites to advertise and sell their wares. These networks often operated in secret, making them difficult to track down and apprehend. In addition, the report found that many of the weapons were sold for profit, with sellers often using inflated prices to increase their profits. The researchers also noted that some sellers may have engaged in money laundering activities, as well as selling counterfeit goods. Finally, the report concluded that the illegal arms trade was a significant source of income for organized crime groups.",0,1

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action , saying that it has failed to do enough to secure her release. He has also accused Iran of using her as a ""bargaining chip"" in negotiations with the West. The UK government has repeatedly called for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's immediate and unconditional release, both publicly and through diplomatic channels. It has raised her case with the Iranian authorities on numerous occasions and lobbied other world leaders to do the same. The UK has offered consular assistance and provided her with financial support while she is in prison, and has made clear its commitment to securing her release. However, it is difficult to predict when or if Zaghari-Ratcliffe will be released. The Iranian judicial system operates independently from the government, and decisions about her case are ultimately out of the UK government's hands. Ratcliffe has expressed frustration at the lack of progress and has urged the government to do more to bring his wife home.",0,10

"The state newspaper says the ""suave"" liquor will spare you wincing when you wake, despite boasting 30-40 alcohol. The brew is reportedly made from a type of indigenous ginseng called ""Ginseng Sap"" and is said to be a mix of sweet, sour, and bitter flavors. The newspaper claims that the drink has been around for centuries in China, but has recently gained popularity as a health-promoting beverage. It is believed that the Ginseng Sap helps to reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and promote relaxation. The taste of the liquor has been described as a unique combination of the sweet, sour, and bitter. The newspaper recommends consuming the drink responsibly and advises that it should not be taken in excessive quantities. They also suggest that it should be paired with food such as dried fruit or nuts.

"Transactions carried out in European markets were previously recorded in Luxembourg, with which Amazon had a low-tax agreement. Now sales made through subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy are all booked in their respective countries. This shift will help Amazon better reflect the economic activity occurring in each of those markets and pay corporation tax accordingly. The change could have a significant impact on the amount of taxes Amazon pays across Europe, as the company has been accused of exploiting loopholes to avoid taxes. It is estimated that Amazon paid just 200m in corporate taxes in 2018, despite recording net sales of 21.6bn in the same year. The move has been welcomed by European governments, who have long criticised Amazon for its aggressive tax avoidance practices. It will likely lead to an increase in the amount of taxes collected from the company, providing a much-needed boost to public finances. Additionally, the shift may encourage other large companies to follow suit and ensure they are paying their fair share of taxes.",0,15

The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides further evidence that lifestyle changes can lead to improved brain health. The participants in the study were split into two groups. The first group was assigned to walk around a track for 40 minutes, three times a week, while the second group was instructed to stretch and perform balance exercises. At the end of the trial, MRI results showed that the hippocampus of those who had walked had grown by 2, compared to no growth in the stretching group. Researchers believe that physical exercise may be able to combat age-related decline in the hippocampus, which is associated with memory loss and dementia. The findings suggest that moderate aerobic exercise can improve cognitive function in humans and may even help protect against age-related diseases.",0,48

Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to the station close to one of the most dangerous areas in the city. The area around is known for its high levels of gang activity and drug dealing, but Mr Hassan has seen first-hand how it can be transformed by the right approach.

"Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed in the car park, reducing the area for parking. The changes followed a report from the Welsh Ambulance Service which revealed that the UHW site had been consistently missing its target of ensuring 75 of ambulances reach the emergency unit within 15 minutes. The new barriers were designed to help improve the flow of traffic and reduce congestion, but they have caused frustration amongst visitors and staff who are used to having more available parking spaces. Hospital bosses say they are working to address these concerns. They claim that the number of ambulances reaching the hospital within the 15-minute target has increased since the changes were made and that they are continuing to monitor the situation.",0,62
"Nashat Melhem was tracked down to a mosque in his home town of Arara and killed in a gun battle, police said. The attacks sparked a huge hunt and security crackdown in the city of Tel Aviv and surrounding areas. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Palestinian militants. He said Melhem had been ""radicalized"" by Islamic State's ideology and was influenced by the group's propaganda. The attack itself was carried out with a 9mm Carl Gustav submachine gun, which is a common weapon used by both militants and criminals. The gun was purchased illegally in the West Bank, according to police. Melhem was known to have had contacts with radical Islamists prior to the attack, but it is unclear if he had direct ties to any particular group. It is also not clear if he had any specific target in mind. However, the incident has raised security concerns in Israel, prompting the government to announce a series of new measures to combat terrorism. These include a crackdown on illegal weapons and increased security at public places.",0,63

He said: ""It's a start, but I feel it doesn't go far enough as it only looks at children in care up to the age of 18. There needs to be recognition that there are people who were abused as adults and that these cases should be investigated as well."" Mr Findlay argued that the inquiry should cover all forms of abuse in care settings, regardless of the victim's age. He added that he was concerned that cases prior to the 1960s would not be fully investigated due to a lack of records. The inquiry is being chaired by Lady Smith and will look into cases between 1945 and 1995. It is expected to report its findings and make recommendations for change by February 2017.",0,64

"Instead of fees rising to PS9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's a bold and ambitious move, one that is sure to draw a lot of attention and discussion. Corbyn's proposal would mean that universities could no longer charge tuition fees for undergraduate courses and that all students would be able to attend university free of charge. It could also mean the end of student loans and the associated debt. This would have an enormous impact on the UK education system, as well as the wider economy. It would likely require an increase in government funding, but it could also lead to more people studying at higher levels and potentially more graduates entering the workforce with better qualifications. It could also reduce inequality, as those from poorer backgrounds may now find it easier to access higher education. Ultimately, it would be up to the government to decide whether this proposal is feasible or not.",0,67

"So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's entire existence is no easy feat. But that is the challenge that awaits the next man in the role and it will be a huge one, with expectations high after such a long period of success under Robinson. The new manager will need to find a way to bring a fresh approach to the team, while also maintaining the traditions and values that made MK Dons such an attractive proposition in the first place. A difficult balance to strike, but certainly one that can be achieved. First and foremost, the new man in charge will need to focus on building a new squad capable of challenging for promotion from League One. This means making sure that the club has enough depth and quality to compete at this level, as well as building a team spirit and mentality that will help them succeed. Tactically, the new boss will need to make sure he is able to get the best out of his players and be willing to adapt and change depending on the opposition. They will also need to be able to work with the squad they have in order to get the most out of it, rather than relying on big name signings. Finally, the new manager will need to be able to build relationships with the fans and local community, something that Robinson was very good at. With a passionate fanbase, getting them on side could be key to the team's success going forward. Ultimately, replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager won't be an easy task, but it is certainly one that can be achieved with the right kind of planning and preparation.",0,70
"A new programme, known as Drive, will be aimed at the most dangerous offenders, BBC News has been told. Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be launched in November. Drive will provide intensive support for up to two years for the most violent and repeat offenders, who often have multiple victims. It will be tailored to the individual and combine therapeutic treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy with practical help like finding employment. The programme is funded by 8 million from the Home Office and will be managed by a consortium led by the non-profit organisation Turning Point. The consortium will also include domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, as well as the College of Policing and other criminal justice organisations. The scheme will focus on the highest risk individuals, who are arrested the most often and are responsible for the most serious offences against partners and family members. Offenders can expect to receive one-to-one support, while victims will be offered practical help such as counselling and refuge services. The aim is to reduce reoffending by cutting off the cycle of violence, as well as providing victims with the help they need to break away from their abusers. It is hoped that Drive will help to create safer communities and reduce the impact of domestic abuse on society.",0,71

"The head of football's governing body outlined his vision for an expanded tournament comprising 16 groups of three teams earlier this month. The top two teams in each group would advance to the knockout stage of a tournament that would be held every two years. FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated that the new format would create more opportunities for smaller nations to participate and compete in international tournaments, as well as providing teams with more matches against opponents of similar ability. It is believed that this will lead to better quality football and an increase in fan engagement. The new format could also generate more revenue for FIFA through increased broadcast and sponsorship deals. The proposed changes have been met with some criticism from the football world. Some argue that the 16 groups of three teams will still favour the traditional powerhouses of the game, who are likely to qualify for the knockout stages. Others have criticised the lack of consideration given to the current competitive structures that exist in many regions, such as the CONCACAF Nations League and CONMEBOL's Copa America. It has also been argued that the expanded tournament will reduce the importance of other tournaments, such as the European Championships and the African Cup of Nations, which could limit the chances of smaller nations to achieve success. Overall, the proposed changes by FIFA have the potential to revolutionise international football. However, it is clear that further discussion needs to take place in order to ensure that all stakeholders are satisfied with the outcome.",0,73

"13 July 2016 Last updated at 14:42 BST The game has not been officially released in the UK, but keen gamers have found ways around the app's country restrictions to get their hands on it. The augmented reality game Pokemon Go has become an overnight sensation since its launch in the US and Australia last week. Designed for smartphones, it allows players to catch virtual creatures known as Pokemon in the real world, using GPS and the camera on their phone. But while it has been officially released in those two countries, the game has not yet been officially released in the UK. However, some gamers are finding ways around this. Pokemon Go is available as a free download from the Apple App Store and Google Play, but users are only able to download it if their device is connected to one of the two countries in which it has been officially released. Some keen gamers have found ways around this, though, by setting up a new account registered in either the US or Australia, or by downloading the app directly from third-party websites like APK Mirror. It is worth noting that these methods can be risky and could potentially expose your device to malicious software. However, it appears that the app's developer Niantic Labs is working on making the game available in other countries, including the UK. In the meantime, those who do manage to get their hands on the game should remember that it comes with many safety warnings, such as not playing in dangerous locations, always being aware of your surroundings, and following local laws.",0,77

"The new charge will be imposed from April 2017 and help ensure that big business shoulders the cost of training workers, George Osborne said. But business groups have described the charge as ""disappointing"" and a ""tax on jobs."" The levy, which is expected to raise 3bn by 2020, will be paid by employers with a pay bill of more than 3m. The government says these businesses are the most able to pay and that every penny raised will go directly into training apprentices.

The British Chambers of Commerce said the proposal was ""too much too soon"" and called for a more gradual implementation. The Federation of Small Businesses said the levy would leave small firms facing an additional burden at a time when they were already struggling. It added that the government should focus on helping employers take on more staff and not impose a tax on jobs.

However, there were signs that the market was beginning to cool, with annual growth slowing for the fourth consecutive month. This may be due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit, as well as affordability issues for some potential buyers.",0,88

The newly discovered body, called 2015 TG387, has an orbit that takes it on a spectacularly wide loop around the solar system. At its closest approach, it passes about 65 times further from the Sun than Neptune. On its most distant point, it gets about two and a half times farther away than the most remote known Solar System object. The new object's orbital period is estimated to be about 40,000 years. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that the outer reaches of our Solar System may be teeming with objects like 2015 TG387. The fact that it was found close to the predicted location of the inner Oort Cloud suggests that this region could be more densely populated than astronomers previously thought. Its discovery also helps scientists better understand how objects in the outer Solar System interact with each other and with their environment.",0,93
"Saints' 3-0 reverse at Everton on Monday completed a difficult Christmas period for Claude Puel's side. But Stephens, who made his Premier League debut at Goodison Park, believes a change of system could work wonders for the South Coast club. ""We played a different system at Everton,"" Stephens told reporters. ""It was a bit more of a defensive system and I think it worked well, but we just didn't get that result we wanted. We had some good chances and we just need to take them. ""But if we can keep playing this way and keep improving like we are, then I'm sure the results will come. We just have to keep working hard and hopefully the luck will turn our way."" Stephens has been a regular fixture in Puel's matchday squad since arriving from Plymouth Argyle in July, making 11 Premier League appearances so far this season. The 21-year-old admits he is still getting used to the demands of top-flight football, but has been encouraged by his recent performances. ""It has been an amazing experience so far,"" he said. ""Obviously it's a lot harder than the Championship, but I think I have coped quite well with it. I've been playing quite well recently, so I'm happy with that.

"6 December 2016 Last updated at 09:59 GMT The app can now identify up to 70,000 public figures by looking at images, video or an actual person. The BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones has been testing the software. The new app, developed by Microsoft's AI team, is called Who? and it can recognize up to 70,000 public figures by looking at images, video or an actual person. It works by using facial recognition technology to compare a face with thousands of faces in its database. The app can identify celebrities, politicians, athletes, musicians and other public figures from past and present. It can also tell you how old a person is and what country they come from. To test the accuracy of the app, I tested it on photos of well-known people such as Barack Obama, Taylor Swift and David Beckham. In each case, it correctly identified the individual in less than three seconds. The app also worked with images of lesser-known people, including my colleagues at the BBC. It was able to accurately identify them all in less than five seconds. Overall, the app worked very well and was surprisingly accurate. It could be particularly useful for news organisations who need to quickly identify people in videos or photos. The only downside is that it only recognises celebrities and public figures, so it won't help you with your friends or family. However, it's great for quickly identifying people in the public domain.",0,99

Business activity and new orders both fell in April, while businesses reported a fall in employment for the first time since August 2016.

"The 48-year-old took had been in charge of Posh since replacing Dave Robertson in September and lifted the club as high as the play-off places in January. But they have since slipped back, losing their last five games. The club released a statement on Sunday morning confirming the news that Ferguson had left the club, with first-team coach Grant McCann taking temporary charge. Ferguson's departure came after a 3-2 home defeat by Sheffield United on Saturday in which Posh twice came from behind to level.

It is important to track because it can provide insight into the overall cost of living, as well as the health of the economy. When food prices rise, there is less money available to purchase other goods and services, which can lead to slower economic growth.

"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, only to have it crumble when the next education minister comes along. This struggle is likely due to a lack of political will and long-term planning. Vocational education can have many benefits, but these benefits may take a while to become apparent. Politicians may not be willing to invest in vocational education if they are only looking for short-term gains. Furthermore, there is often a bias towards university degrees over vocational qualifications, which can make it difficult for vocational education to compete for resources and recognition. It is also possible that policymakers may lack an understanding of the value of vocational education, leading them to prioritize other areas.",0,123

"A report commissioned by Food Standards Scotland found that in-store promotions were heavily weighted in favour of food with high levels of salt or sugar. The Stirling University academics behind the study said that almost three-quarters of in-store promotions were for food with high levels of sugar, salt and saturated fat. They found that only one in four of the products promoted met the nutritional criteria for a healthy diet. The report also highlighted that children are particularly vulnerable to these promotions as they are more likely to be attracted by food with high levels of sugar, salt or saturated fat due to their sweet and salty taste. The academics noted that there is an urgent need to reduce the number of unhealthy promotions in stores and to encourage the promotion of healthier options instead. This report highlights the need for supermarkets to promote healthier options in order to help consumers make healthier choices when shopping. It also demonstrates why legislation and regulation is necessary to ensure that supermarkets do not exploit consumer loyalty and manipulate them into buying unhealthy food.",0,129

"The IFG says legislation will be needed to establish new policies on areas such as customs and immigration. The extra measures will place ""a huge burden"" on Parliament and government , requiring a ""significant increase in resources."" The IFG recommends that the government set up an independent body with legal and policy expertise to help it develop and implement the legislation. This body can also provide advice on other areas, such as trade, taxation, and labour rights. The IFG also suggests that the government should create an online platform to allow businesses to access the relevant information and guidance they need to comply with the new policies. This would make it easier for companies to understand the requirements and ensure compliance. Finally, the IFG recommends that the government should create an oversight body to monitor and enforce the new policies. This body should be independent and have the power to take action against those who fail to comply.",0,137

"Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Herbert Diess, head of the VW brand, said the company would have a fix in the coming weeks or months. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says the company must come up with a fix by the end of January. The emissions scandal, which was first revealed in 2015, has seen VW pay out billions of dollars in fines and compensation to customers. The company has also been forced to recall millions of cars worldwide. At CES, Diess said that the company would be introducing a software update for some of its diesel vehicles in the US market. He added that the update should help reduce emissions from the affected vehicles. VW has previously said that it is ""working hard"" to resolve the issue, but has not provided a timeline for when the fix will be available.

"Prime Minister David Cameron announced the deal as he started a Jamaica visit. The project has been agreed to break the deadlock in negotiations over a prisoner transfer deal between the two countries. The deal is expected to cost around 25 million and will see prisoners serving sentences in Britain being allowed to serve their sentences in Jamaica. Under the deal, hundreds of Jamaican prisoners currently held in British jails will be able to serve out their sentences in Jamaica, while those sentenced in Jamaica will be able to return home to do the same. It is hoped that the deal will help reduce overcrowding in British jails and free up prison places for other inmates.

"It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about relative gains and losses, and in the end Netanyahu emerged victorious, with a larger party than he had before. The election result was a surprise to many. While all polls showed that Netanyahu's right-wing bloc had a clear lead, few predicted that the prime minister would win an outright majority. This was largely due to the fact that Netanyahu's Likud party had been polling slightly lower than its main rivals on the left. Nevertheless, the prime minister was able to secure enough support from smaller parties to form a coalition government. The victory was especially sweet for Netanyahu, who had been under fire from multiple corruption scandals and had become increasingly unpopular in recent months. The election results provided him with a much needed boost of confidence, allowing him to remain in office and continue his agenda. Looking ahead, Netanyahu will face many challenges in his next term, both domestically and internationally. He will have to navigate the delicate balance between his right-wing allies and more centrist members of his coalition. At the same time, he will likely have to confront a growing wave of international criticism over Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. Regardless, Netanyahu has once again proven his political resilience and ability to overcome adversity. With another term as prime minister, he is now firmly established as one of the most influential figures in Israeli politics.",0,158

In addition, it is seen as a way for Samsung to further diversify its businesses and increase its market power. However, Samsung CT's shareholders argue that the merger would significantly reduce their ownership stakes and therefore their ability to influence the company's decisions. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to approve the merger will be made by Samsung CT's shareholders after the meeting in February.

"The US-owned retail firm, which processes hundreds of thousands of online orders each week, could have put millions of transactions at risk, security expert Paul Moore estimates. He first noticed the issue on April 26 and reported it to the company, which then took action to fix the problem.

This means that anyone who had access to the server could have obtained the personal information of millions of customers. The retailer has since taken steps to protect customer data by implementing robust security protocols and encryption measures. It is also working with third-party cyber security firms to investigate the issue and enhance its defenses against future attacks. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining secure systems, particularly those dealing with sensitive customer information. Companies should ensure their systems are regularly updated and monitored for any potential vulnerabilities. They should also take steps to educate staff about cyber security risks and how to mitigate them.",0,207

"At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims. It has called on the government to increase its ambition in tackling the housing crisis, warning that the UK is facing a ""major shortage"" of properties for rent. Rics said the number of households in the private rented sector (PRS) could reach 5.93 million by 2025, representing around 25 of all homes in England and Wales. This figure is up from 4.1 million currently and 3.6 million in 2010. Rics said the growth was partly driven by an ageing population, which is increasingly opting to rent rather than buy. However, it warned that the lack of housebuilding meant there were not enough homes being built to meet demand. It said that the majority of new-builds were for sale, meaning that people who wanted to rent had fewer options. The report called for the government to introduce measures such as rent controls and tax incentives to encourage more landlords to provide homes for rent. It also suggested that local authorities should be able to borrow money to build their own PRS stock. Rics chief executive Sean Tompkins said: ""The UK's housing market is fundamentally broken. We are facing a major shortage in the number of homes available to rent, and rising rental costs are pricing many people out of the market. Unless we take action now to address this growing problem, more and more people will be left without access to secure, affordable accommodation.""",0,225

So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most pressing issues and challenges facing the web, this was certainly one of them. The most pressing issues and challenges facing the web in 2015 include: 1. Cybersecurity: With hackers becoming increasingly sophisticated and cyber-attacks becoming more frequent and dangerous, it is essential that steps are taken to protect our data, identities, and networks from malicious actors. 2. Data Privacy: As the amount of personal data stored online continues to grow, protecting our privacy becomes increasingly important. Governments and businesses must work together to ensure that individuals' data is kept secure and that appropriate permissions and restrictions are applied. 3. Net Neutrality: The concept of net neutrality has come under fire recently, as some governments seek to limit access to certain types of content or websites. It is essential that the open nature of the internet is preserved and that users have equal access to all content. 4. Online Hate Speech: From racism to sexism, online hate speech is becoming an increasingly common issue. It is important that we create a safe, respectful environment for everyone online, and take steps to prevent bullying and harassment. 5. Fake News: With the proliferation of news sources on the web, it can be difficult to determine which sources are reliable and which are not. It is important that users are able to differentiate between real news and fake news, and that they are aware of the potential dangers of relying on false information.",0,237

"The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to ""reduce significantly"" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the proposal has not yet been approved. Theresa May wrote to other cabinet ministers on 12 December, asking for permission to reduce the use of section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. This type of stop and search is used in areas where there is a risk of serious violence, but it does not require officers to have reasonable suspicion that someone is carrying a weapon. In her letter, Mrs May said she wanted to make sure that the use of section 60 was ""targeted and effective.""

"The concerns came amid Sportscotland plans to reduce sport funding in Scotland by 20. Scottish Athletics, which runs the initiative to encourage non-club runners to take exercise, said it was ""extremely disappointed."" The news of sport funding cuts in Scotland has been met with dismay by many organizations and individuals. Scottish Athletics, which runs the non-club running initiative, said that it was ""extremely disappointed"" to hear about the proposed 20 reduction in sport funding. Without the necessary financial support, the organization fears that its program will suffer, as well as other grassroots sporting initiatives across Scotland. The move is particularly concerning for those involved in the sport, who believe that without sufficient investment, the development of young athletes will be hindered and the future success of Scottish sport itself could be at risk. The lack of funds could have a knock-on effect on physical health and wellbeing, too, meaning that fewer people may benefit from the physical and social benefits of taking part in regular exercise. Sportscotland's decision to reduce sport funding in Scotland is an unfortunate one, as it not only puts pressure on the sport's governing bodies, but also risks damaging the development of sport in Scotland. It is essential that the Scottish Government finds a way to bridge the gap and help ensure that sport remains accessible to all.",0,241

"Councils are relying on agency workers to cover nearly 4,000 out of 5,500 otherwise empty posts. Social workers say they are under constant pressure because of media coverage and criticism of the service, with some councils turning to agency workers to cover the gaps. Councils are using agency workers to fill the gaps because it is often more cost-effective than recruiting and training new social workers, or hiring permanent staff in times of financial difficulty. Agency workers can also provide additional capacity when necessary, such as during periods of high demand. However, agency workers may not have the same level of training or experience as permanent staff, and they often lack the same understanding of a particular council's systems and culture.

"23 December 2016 Last updated at 01:13 GMT But much of India's milk is collected from small farms across the country, and by the time it reaches consumers it's impure , with water and detergent added to increase the volume. This is a huge problem for India's dairy industry. The government has taken steps to crack down on the adulteration of milk but it has not been able to stop the practice altogether. In response, some companies are now using technology to ensure that the milk they collect is pure. For example, some companies are using sensors to detect any water or detergent added to the milk. They are also using DNA testing to ensure that the milk is from cows rather than buffaloes. By using technology, these companies are able to guarantee that the milk they sell is pure and safe for consumers.",0,276

They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with some sending their children to school only to collect them hours later. The government's decision to resume classes was widely seen as a symbolic move to show that life was slowly returning to normal in the capital after months of violence and political crisis but security remains a major concern. In Tripoli, the government said it had deployed extra police around schools to protect pupils and staff. Many parents were still reluctant to send their children to class.

"The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while in the care of the Northern Ireland Department for Health. The review found that most of the young people had been placed in unsuitable homes, with some of them being moved between multiple locations over a short period of time. In addition, there was inadequate oversight and monitoring of their placements. Furthermore, the review noted that there were insufficient safeguards to protect these vulnerable children from harm. The report concluded that the Department for Health failed to provide an appropriate level of support and care to the young people. It also highlighted the need for improved inter-agency working, better governance arrangements and increased accountability. In response to the findings, the Department for Children and Young People committed to implementing all of the recommendations from the review. This includes more robust assessment of potential foster carers and improved communication between agencies. The Department has also launched a new helpline for vulnerable children and young people so that they can access immediate help and advice.",0,283

In 2018, the UK's National Trust launched a campaign to save the White Cliffs of Dover from potential development, after a local council proposed building a marina and holiday village on the site. The campaign was successful, with the plans rejected by the government.

"Confessions had been forced from the Muslim men after they were beaten up in custody, a rights activist said. They were among a group of people arrested late last year. The men have since been released, but their testimonies have sparked outrage among activists and human rights advocates, who say the confessions are a result of torture. The police have denied any wrongdoing and said the men confessed willingly. However, some of the men reportedly told their families they were beaten in custody. The incident is part of a larger pattern of police brutality in the region. Last year, Human Rights Watch documented numerous cases in which police detained people without warrants and subjected them to beatings, threats, and humiliation. In some cases, detainees were held for months without charges or access to legal assistance. Activists are calling on authorities to take action against those responsible for the torture and mistreatment of the Muslim men, as well as to investigate all allegations of abuse by police officers. They also urge that the government ensure that procedures are in place to protect individuals from such abuses.",0,285

"Severe storms in December 2013 caused damage to an existing dune system to the east of Barkby Beach in Prestatyn. A report, to be considered by Denbighshire councillors, says there is a need to replace the dunes to protect the beach from further damage. The report recommends creating a new dune system, which would involve the planting of more than 1,000 sand-loving plants, such as Marram Grass and Sea Purslane. The dunes would also be reinforced with rocks and boulders to provide additional protection against future storms. The cost of the project is estimated to be around 60,000. The report also suggests that the new dune system could be beneficial in other ways, such as enhancing the biodiversity of the area and providing a habitat for local wildlife. It is hoped that the project would help to attract more visitors to the beach, boosting the local economy. Denbighshire councillors will now need to decide whether or not to approve the project.

"Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and has requested that the inquest into their deaths, which began in February 2019, be concluded before he leaves. The inquest is expected to conclude in the coming months, and it is anticipated that the coroner will deliver his findings by the end of the year. The families of the victims are hoping for justice for their loved ones and for the truth about what happened at Kingsmill to finally be revealed. The coroner's findings could lead to prosecutions if there is sufficient evidence that links the murders to any individuals or organisations.",0,320

"Three open-top buses took the first team, youth team and family members on a parade from Stamford Bridge towards the King's Road in west London. Chelsea ended their campaign eight points clear of Manchester United. The parade started with the team bus, followed by the youth team and family members, who were all waving flags, banners and singing songs to show their appreciation for the season's achievements. The route went from Stamford Bridge to King's Road and then on to Sloane Square, where the team stopped briefly to acknowledge the thousands of fans who had gathered to cheer them on. The parade then continued towards the Natural History Museum, before finishing at Kensington Palace Gardens, where the players disembarked and mingled with the crowd, signing autographs and taking photos.",0,322

The government has not yet taken a decision as to whether an inquiry into the Iraq War will be held. However, the House of Lords heard that launching one now could prejudice the on-going investigations into the Iraq war by various organisations, including the police.

"Trapped by disadvantage are more than 730,000 youngsters, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). It laments a ""national shame,"" and its research suggests about 13 of the country's poorest households with children suffer ""persistent poverty,"" meaning that incomes remain below 50 percent of the median for three or more years. The causes of this phenomenon are complex, but there is a clear link to generational disadvantage and cycles of poverty. Many of these children come from Indigenous backgrounds, and their families have been living in poverty for generations. These children often face barriers to education, employment and social inclusion. In addition, many of these children experience an array of challenges such as homelessness, substance abuse, mental health issues, and family violence. ACOSS notes that these challenges can be compounded by inadequate access to essential services, such as housing, education, and health care, which further entrenches poverty. There is no quick fix to solving the issue of intergenerational disadvantage and poverty among Australian youth, but there are steps that can be taken to help protect vulnerable young people. For example, governments should provide increased funding for social and educational programs that target this group, including income support measures, training and employment services, and targeted health and mental health services. Governments should also prioritize initiatives that seek to increase participation in school, reduce the rates of early school leaving, and support those who do leave school early to gain the skills they need to enter the workforce. Finally, it is important to ensure that all children have access to adequate housing and nutrition to ensure they have the best chance of succeeding in life.",0,324
"The former world champion will target the time trial and may also support Lizzie Armitstead in the road race. Pooley, 33, retired from cycling after winning two silver medals at London 2012 but returned to the sport in April. In a statement, Pooley said: ""I'm really excited to be back racing with the GB Cycling Team. It's an honour to be selected for the World Championships and I'm looking forward to helping the team in whichever way I can.

Protesters also threw stones at officers during a demonstration in Belfast. The violence broke out during an Irish nationalist march in the city centre. The police said two petrol bombs were thrown and water cannon was used to disperse the crowd. At least three people were arrested in connection with the disturbances. The protest was organised by dissident republicans who oppose the peace process in Northern Ireland. Police had urged the organisers to call off the event but they refused. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was disappointed that the parade had gone ahead, despite advice from its officers. It said the decision to use water cannon was taken to protect officers and the public and to prevent further disruption to the city centre.",0,326

"The Labour leader told the New Statesman his party opposed government plans to lower the overall household cap, introduced in the last Parliament. And his spokesman confirmed he was ""very clear"" Labour was opposed to the plans. Mr Corbyn said he supported a cap on the overall amount of welfare spending, but said it should be set in accordance with ""what people need."" He added: ""We have raised concerns and we are absolutely opposed to the government's plans to cut the total household cap."" The government has proposed cutting the cap from 26,000 a year to 23,000 for couples with children or 15,410 for single people without children. The cap was introduced by the coalition government in 2013 and limits the total amount of benefits that can be claimed by an individual or family.",0,328
"Funding given to the charity, which collapsed in August, included at least PS28m from the Department for Education, the National Audit Office said. It received the money despite warnings about its financial health and failure to meet safeguarding standards. The charity, Kids Company, was set up in 1996 to provide support for disadvantaged young people in London. It received more than 45m from the government between 2011 and 2015, with a further 3m being sought just before its closure. The NAO said that ""the Department did not always exercise due diligence or obtain value for money"" when it gave repeated funding to the charity, despite warnings about its financial sustainability. The NAO also said that there were ""significant weaknesses"" in the charity's governance and financial management which had been identified but not addressed. The collapse of Kids Company has prompted calls for the government to review its procedures for disbursing grants and conducting checks on the performance and financial health of organisations it is funding. The government has said that it will strengthen its processes for assessing grant applications and ensure greater oversight of charities.",0,329

"Footage secretly filmed by France 2 TV shows Francoise Olcay selling dinghies and life jackets to migrants hoping to reach the Greek islands. The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores in July alone. The footage shows Olcay, who is of Turkish origin, taking cash from the migrants for rubber dinghies and life jackets. She then helps them carry the equipment to the nearby beach in Turkey's western province of Canakkale. In an interview with France 2, Olcay said she was motivated by compassion for the migrants' plight. She said she had decided that if no one else was helping them, it was up to her to do so. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that nearly half a million people have made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with more than 2,600 dying in the attempt. Olcay told France 2 she was aware of the dangers but that she felt compelled to help. ""I know what I'm doing is illegal, but I'm doing it because I want to help these people,"" she said. ""I don't think I should be judged for helping people in need."" UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said he was encouraged by such acts of kindness but added that they would not solve the crisis. He said the only way to ensure safety and dignity for migrants was through a comprehensive system of legal pathways to Europe.",0,331

"The court in Novorossiysk gave two of the dancers 10 days in jail each, a third 15 days and two others received fines on charges of petty hooliganism. Prosecutors had asked for up to 15 days in jail for each of the women. The five dancers were arrested in late August after performing a dance routine on a Novorossiysk beach wearing nothing but body paint and underwear. The performance was part of a campaign to raise awareness about the risks posed by global warming. The court found that the performance had caused ""public disorder"" and issued fines and jail sentences for the dancers. The judge noted that the incident had ""provoked laughter, whistling, and an indecent reaction from those present"" at the beach, which disrupted public order. The dancers' lawyers argued that the performance was a form of art and was not intended to cause public disorder. They also pointed out that there were no complaints filed against the performance. Nevertheless, the court found that the dancers had violated public order and sentenced them accordingly. The case has sparked a debate in Russia over freedom of expression. Critics have argued that the court's decision was overly harsh and infringed upon the dancers' right to express themselves through art. Supporters of the ruling, on the other hand, have argued that the performance was inappropriate and disruptive, and thus deserved punishment.",0,335

Aldershot then grabbed the lead just before the break when Jake Gallagher fired home from close range, and they doubled their advantage on the hour mark when Mensah found the bottom corner with a curling effort. Harrogate pulled one back 10 minutes later through Ryan Fallowfield's header, but the Shots held on to secure all three points.",0,336

Four lorry loads of illegal cigarettes and tobacco were discovered at the factory on Wednesday. HMRC said it was investigating the premises and that criminal proceedings may follow. The plant was set up to manufacture counterfeit cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco, with a capacity of more than two million cigarettes and three tonnes of tobacco per week. HMRC said the illegal factory was ""sophisticated"" and had been equipped with specialist machinery and tools.

Williams said it was now more important than ever to focus on economic prosperity and education, as well as tackling poverty, inequality and social exclusion. She urged political parties to set aside their differences and focus on working together in order to deliver better outcomes for Wales. She also highlighted the need to ensure Wales is heard at the international level, and that Wales is represented in decision-making processes at the highest levels of government.

"Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease. But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), this practice is no longer allowed. Instead, inspectors must rely on X-ray technology to detect signs of disease. The new regulations are intended to reduce the suffering of animals and improve food safety by making it easier to identify diseased carcasses. The FSA also said that the X-ray technology is more accurate than manual inspection and is less intrusive to the animal. In addition, it reduces the risk of spreading diseases between animals and speeds up the process of identifying suspect carcasses.",0,340
"The pages from a 13th Century text of the holy book of Islam were purchased by the council in 1951. Conservator Richard Hawkes said: ""This is the earliest example of the Qur'an we have ever seen in the UK. It is a wonderful and rare example of Islamic calligraphy and is likely to become an important part of our national heritage."" The pages, which are written on vellum, each measure around 10cm by 7cm and feature verses from the 114 suras that make up the holy book. The text is written in Kufic script, a style of Arabic calligraphy developed in Iraq in the 8th century. It is believed that the manuscript was produced in Iran, possibly in the 13th century. The council said that the purchase was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to acquire such a significant item. The pages will be kept at the British Library where they will be preserved, conserved and studied. They will also be available to view as part of the Library's permanent collections.",0,341

The Clwyd North division is committed to ensuring that local communities have access to the best possible care in their area. We understand that changes are needed to ensure that hospitals are able to cope with increasing pressures and meet modern standards. However, we believe that decisions such as these should be made in consultation with patients and the public, taking into account any potential impacts on patient care and local services.

"The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days. Plans for Green Park Station were put forward in 2004, but the project has stalled as of 2020 due to a lack of funding. The proposed station would have provided better access to both Oxford city centre and the business park, as well as improving traffic flow. The local authority is now exploring alternative ways to improve the area's transport links, such as private investment and public-private partnerships. These are being considered in order to reduce the congestion and delays caused by the current infrastructure. In addition, the council has been looking at ways to encourage more cycling and walking in the area, through initiatives such as bike hire schemes and building dedicated cycle lanes. Finally, the council is also looking into ways to make public transport more efficient, such as running buses on demand or providing more frequent services between Green Park and the city centre. This would help to reduce the need for cars and therefore alleviate some of the traffic issues.",0,343
"Sales volumes increased by 1.7 in November from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared with the same month last year, sales were up by 5. However, the monthly increase was smaller than analysts had expected, and the year-on-year increase was lower than the 6.3 rise seen in October. The data suggests that while consumer spending has picked up slightly since the start of the winter season, it is still below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said that despite the slight uptick in sales volumes, prices were still falling on an annual basis, down 0.7 in November compared with a year earlier. This could indicate that retailers are using discounts to attract shoppers. ""While the month-on-month numbers look a bit better, this should be taken in the context of the sharp fall we saw in October due to the end of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme,"" said Jonathan Athow, Deputy National Statistician for Economic Statistics at the ONS. ""Looking back over the three months as a whole, we can see that there has been a modest gain in retail sales compared with the previous quarter. This reflects a gradual recovery from the pandemic-induced lows of April and May."" The ONS data also showed that online sales made up 33.9 of total retail sales in November, up from 32.7 the month before. This suggests that the shift to online shopping that began during the pandemic is continuing.",0,344

"A health tribunal has found Peter Sutcliffe no longer needs any treatment for any mental disorder. In 1981 he was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders and given 20 life sentences. The Mental Health Tribunal for England and Wales concluded that Peter Sutcliffe no longer requires treatment for a mental disorder, ruling that he is not a danger to the public. The tribunal noted that the opinion of multiple psychiatrists was that Sutcliffe should remain insecure detention in hospital for the rest of his life. Sutcliffe was initially detained in Broadmoor Hospital, but was moved to HMP Frankland in 2016 after being deemed fit enough to move back into the prison system. In order for the tribunal to make their decision, they considered evidence from psychiatrists, psychologists, and other medical professionals. The tribunal also heard from victims' families and the police who investigated his crimes, as well as personal statements from Sutcliffe himself. The findings of the tribunal do not mean that Sutcliffe will be released; however, it could potentially reduce his sentence or lead to more favourable conditions in prison.",0,346
"In a letter to all party leaders, the Equality and Human Rights Commission expresses concern about hate attacks that have taken place since the UK voted to leave the EU . The Commission calls on party leaders to act swiftly and decisively to ensure that such attacks are dealt with robustly and effectively. The Commission also reminds party leaders of their responsibility to speak out against any language or behaviour which could be interpreted as hate speech or inciting violence. The letter states that political leaders have a duty to set an example by condemning any incidents of hate and making it clear that this type of behaviour is not acceptable in our society. The Commission calls on party leaders to take action to ensure that the police and other relevant bodies are equipped and supported to deal with hate crime, and that appropriate measures are taken to prevent further incidents from occurring. It also urges them to work together to build a culture of respect for diversity and to promote a positive message about the value of immigration to the UK. The Commission concludes by stressing the need for party leaders to collaborate and make clear to everyone that hatred and discrimination will not be tolerated.",0,347

"Prison inspectors discovered the average period of stay at the facility near Gatwick Airport had risen from 28 to 48 days. Twenty-three people were held for more than a year. The prison inspection report also revealed that overcrowding had worsened, with prisoners often having to share cells designed for just one person. Inspectors found that the number of people held in overcrowded conditions had increased from 11 per cent to 16 per cent since the previous inspection. The inspectors also raised concerns about the mental health of many of those held and said some prisoners were subject to ""unacceptable delays"" when requesting medical attention from staff. They highlighted a lack of appropriate case management and recommended that more work should be done to ensure prisoners were released on time. The prison director has apologised to those affected and said steps have been taken to ease overcrowding, including hiring more staff and improving case management procedures.

Oldham continued to threaten in attack and they were two up after 26 minutes. Klok crossed from the right again, this time finding Filipe Morais, who got in front of his marker to head home. Barnsley had a good spell of pressure before half-time and Scotland's powerful strike was parried away at full stretch by Alex Cisak. But Oldham scored their third of the game on 42 minutes. The ball was worked out to Jose Baxter on the right, he cut inside and fired past Steele into the corner of the net. Barnsley pulled a goal back just after the break when substitute David Perkins headed in from close range from Craig Davies' cross.

"It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia , and the debate can go on forever. That being said, there are some qualities that can help guide the discussion. Generally speaking, the greatest players of all time have had a combination of individual talent, team success, overall skill, and longevity. Players who have been dominant in their era, won championships, set records, and had an impact on the game for an extended period of time are usually considered to be among the best of all-time. Players like Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Wilt Chamberlain are all widely considered to be some of the greatest players ever. It is difficult to definitively say which one is the greatest of all time, but most people would agree that these players are at least in the conversation.",0,363

"On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of 282m (PS195m) up from 154m last year. The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it had achieved significant cost savings, which included a 20 percent cut in operating expenses, was welcomed. However, Tesla's shares fell 3 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement. Investors were concerned about the company's outlook for the upcoming quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Tesla said that while its deliveries in China had been strong in Q1, it expected them to be lower in Q2 due to the current economic environment. The company also warned that tariffs on Chinese imports could result in higher costs to customers, which could impact future demand. Despite these concerns, investors remain confident in Tesla's long-term prospects. CEO Elon Musk has committed to continuing to invest in the company's infrastructure and technology, and the company is expected to launch several new models in the coming years.

"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must be regulated in the same way as boxing. The researchers suggest that rugby should be treated in the same way as boxing, with a compulsory medical check-up before each match and regular neurological scans. They also recommend that players must wear protective headgear, and that contact drills and tackling should be limited during practice sessions. The team argues that the current rules of the game are not sufficient to protect players from head injuries, and that further investigation is needed. They point out that there have been a number of high-profile cases of players suffering serious brain injuries as a result of playing rugby. Prof Pollock said: ""We must act now to protect players and prevent long-term damage to their health. We believe that a thorough review of the game is essential if we are to ensure the safety of players at all levels.""",0,421

"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that their behaviour probably evolved as a way to watch out for predators. The team studied the perching behaviours of three species of birds - Red-shouldered Hawks, Cooper's Hawks, and American Kestrels - in Arizona and New Mexico. They observed that all three species opted to perch on one limb rather than two, and that they positioned themselves so that they had an optimal view of their surroundings. The researchers then carried out experiments in which they hung stuffed predators and other objects around perches to see how it affected the birds' behaviour. They found that the presence of potential threats caused the birds to perch on one limb more often and from a higher vantage point. The findings suggest that the birds' single-limb perching behaviour is an adaptation to reduce the risk of predation. Perching on one foot may allow the birds to maintain a better lookout for danger, and by positioning themselves higher up, they can also be more aware of any potential threats from above.",0,425

Osi: The first step is to get everyone in the same room. Make sure you have enough space to move around and run plays. You'll also need a football, cones, and some sort of goal line marker. Justin: Once you have everything ready, it's time to get organized. Divide your group into two teams and assign each person their position. Get your team into formation and make sure everyone knows what they're supposed to do. The basic formations are offense (the team with the ball) and defense (the team without). Osi: Now you can start running plays. Have one team go on offense while the other team takes up positions as defenders. Call out a play, then watch it unfold. It's important to remember that football is a game of strategy and that each play should be well planned out. Justin: After each play, evaluate the results and adjust accordingly. Did the play work? Was there any confusion? Did someone miss an assignment? Make adjustments as needed, and keep playing until you feel comfortable with the plays. Osi: Finally, have fun!

"It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos. But there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home after a show, lead singer Sarah told me that this enforced anonymity had been an incredible opportunity: It gave people time to discover the music without being distracted by the band members' physical appearances. She said it also allowed them to create a mythos around the band, which generated even more interest in their music. The band's strategy of remaining anonymous paid off in the long run. They soon began to develop a cult following and fans were eager to learn more about the mysterious group. As the band's popularity grew, they slowly began to reveal more information about themselves, culminating with the release of their debut album.

"The private CaixinMarkit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in July from 49.4 in the previous month. It is worse than a preliminary reading of 48.2 and is the lowest level since February 2009. The PMI is a key indicator of China's manufacturing sector health, and a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The July reading shows that the country's manufacturing sector is continuing to contract at a faster pace compared to the previous month. The decline in the index was due to the weakening demand and falling output, as well as increased downward pressure on the labor market. The data also showed that new orders and new export orders both declined sharply in July, while the employment sub-index hit a record low. This suggests that the Chinese economy is still facing significant downward pressure, as businesses struggle to cope with the slowdown in global economic growth and the ongoing trade war between the US and China.",0,440

The move has been seen as a way for Ivanka to play a more active role in her father's presidency, but some have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Ivanka has already taken a formal leave of absence from her businesses and her husband, Jared Kushner, has stepped down as CEO of his own business.",0,452
"One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, who in the aftermath of World War Two are struggling to rebuild their lives in the face of a shared secret that threatens to tear them apart. Talawa director Michael Buffong has re-imagined this classic play for today's audiences, with an all-black cast. ""There is something really special about seeing black people telling stories that aren't just about our own experience,"" he says. ""These stories can have universal resonance and offer a unique perspective on classic texts."" The production stars Paterson Joseph as Joe Keller, debutant actress Ati Edo-Ekong as Kate Keller and Don Gilet as George Deever. It will be touring to five venues across the UK from April to June. Elsewhere, Chichester presents a brand new adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's classic play Mourning Becomes Electra at The Minerva Theatre. Directed by Blanche McIntyre and starring Kathryn Hunter, the production brings together elements of Greek tragedy, Shakespearean grandeur and 20th century melodrama to tell the story of an American family cursed by its dark past. At the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, Director Sarah Frankcom is presenting a bold new vision of Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin In The Sun. Set in 1950s Chicago, the play follows the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty, as they strive to make a better life for themselves. Frankcom has assembled an all-star cast including Lucian Msamati, Sharon D Clarke, Shvorne Marks and Martina Laird. The play runs until May 11th. Finally, Theatr Clwyd in Wales is staging a new version of Arthur Miller's The Crucible, directed by Tamara Harvey.

"Two employees of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) were initially quarantined in the office. A note reading ""die a painful death, Muslims,"" was in the envelope with the package. The CAIR employees were deeply disturbed and horrified by the message, and CAIR released a statement about the incident. The organization condemned the hate-filled message and noted that such attacks would not be tolerated. They urged law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the perpetrator of the crime and called on all Americans to reject Islamophobia and bigotry in all its forms.",0,455
"Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city. Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died in Tuesday's attack. Syrian state media did not identify the type of gas used in the shelling, but it said there were symptoms of ""asphyxiation."" The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks Syria's civil war, says eight people died in the shelling and that more than 20 were injured. It said two of those killed were children. The Observatory said the shells landed in the government-held area of Sheikh Maqsoud in Aleppo. The Observatory said it was not immediately clear what type of gas was used in the attack. The attack comes as a humanitarian crisis has been deepening in Aleppo, with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped by fighting between government forces and rebels.",0,456
"The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) follows a 2013 investigation by BBC Panorama into the Military Research Force, or MRF. Daniel Rooney was 18 when he joined the MRF. The MRF was set up in the late 1990s to gather intelligence about dissident Republican activity in Northern Ireland. The unit was disbanded in 2004 following the Good Friday Agreement. Rooney is alleged to have used physical force on suspects and was accused of failing to follow proper procedures when dealing with detainees. He has denied the allegations. The PSNI said it had received a complaint from Rooney that he was subject to ""unlawful or improper treatment"" while serving in the MRF. It said that it was treating the complaint seriously and would be conducting an investigation into the allegations. The PSNI added that it was committed to ensuring that any potential criminal offences were investigated thoroughly and impartially. It said it had taken the necessary steps to protect any potential victims and witnesses, and that its investigation would be conducted in a ""transparent and fair manner.""",0,457
"Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a ""very, very strange year at Uber."" In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day of work, and that she reported the harassment to HR, only to be told that because he was a ""high performer,"" they wouldn't do anything about it. She also describes a culture of sexism and sexual harassment at Uber, where women were treated unfairly and given fewer opportunities than their male counterparts. Finally, she talks about how the company brushed off complaints from female employees, even when the allegations were backed up with evidence. Fowler's blog post sparked intense media coverage, and led to an internal investigation into the allegations. The investigation ultimately resulted in the firing of over 20 Uber employees for various forms of misconduct, including sexual harassment. It also led to the resignation of CEO Travis Kalanick, who had been accused of not taking the allegations seriously enough. Ultimately, Fowler's blog post helped to spotlight the issue of sexual harassment in the tech industry and forced companies to take a closer look at their culture and policies.",0,458
"Some dairy farmers have said they face going out of business if prices they receive for their products do not rise. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their anger at the low prices they receive for their produce, and to highlight their plight. They have also called for government support in the form of subsidies and other measures to help ensure their businesses remain viable. In the face of rising production costs, many dairy farmers are struggling to stay afloat, and some are facing bankruptcy. The government has responded to these concerns with a package of measures designed to make the dairy industry more sustainable in the long-term. These include grants to help farmers transition to new farming practices, such as organic farming; funding to improve farm infrastructure; and reform of the dairy supply chain to ensure better prices for farmers. The government has also committed to increasing monitoring and enforcement of anti-competitive practices in the dairy industry, and is providing financial assistance to farmers who want to switch to producing plant-based alternatives to dairy products. However, there are still concerns that the measures announced may not be enough to save some dairy farms. Many farmers feel that the government must do more to support them and to ensure that their businesses remain viable. There is a need for a comprehensive, long-term plan to secure the future of the dairy industry and protect the livelihoods of those who depend on it.",0,459

"Even though Cuba is less than 100 miles away from the US, the two counties fell out in 1959, and no American president has visited since then. The fall out was due to the Cuban Revolution, which saw Fidel Castro take control of the country and turn it into a socialist state. The US responded by imposing an economic embargo on Cuba, which is still in place today. Since then, diplomatic relations between the two countries have been strained, but in recent years they have improved. In 2014, the Obama administration re-established diplomatic ties with Cuba and eased some of the travel restrictions that had been in place for over 50 years.",0,463

"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013. There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the UK, as they can take hundreds of years to decompose. The government has introduced a 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England, with the money going towards good causes. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also had similar charges for some time. This is one of several measures that have been taken to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the UK. Other steps include introducing laws banning microbeads from cosmetics, encouraging producers to use less packaging, and promoting reusable alternatives to single-use plastics. In addition, the government has invested 61.4 million since 2015 to improve recycling facilities, increase awareness of plastic waste, and fund research into new technologies to help tackle the problem. Overall, these measures have had a positive impact and the amount of plastic carrier bags used in the UK has gone down considerably since 2013.",0,465
"It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was going to leave the Boleyn Ground with any doubts as to the outcome of West Ham United's final match here. The current generation of players did justice to the occasion and their predecessors, past and present, with a suitably emphatic 3-2 victory over Manchester United - a team who, ironically, will be their new landlords when they move across London in the summer. It was a fitting end to an era for the club and its supporters and it was perhaps fitting that, after so many years of ups and downs, the Hammers finished on a high. The atmosphere was electric all night, with the home fans in full voice from start to finish and even the away fans getting in on the act. The game itself was an entertaining affair, with the Hammers taking the lead early on through a Cheikhou Kouyate goal before Anthony Martial equalised for United. Michail Antonio then put West Ham back in front before Mark Noble made it 3-1 with a penalty. A late Wayne Rooney goal gave United some hope but it wasn't enough as the hosts held on for a deserved win. There were emotional scenes at the final whistle, with the players, staff and fans all paying tribute to the ground they called home for over a century. It was a bittersweet ending but one that will live long in the memory of those who were there to witness it.",0,466

He is also seeking grants from organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Historic England to help fund the project. Tavernor is also exploring ways to make the gardens more resilient to extreme weather events in the future. This could involve installing drainage systems, raising pathways, and using more natural materials such as woodchip and gravel to reinforce walls and paths. The Plas Cadnant Hidden Gardens have been a popular tourist attraction for many years, but due to the pandemic, 2020 was a difficult year for the gardens. Despite the setback of the storm damage, Tavernor remains determined to restore the gardens to their former glory.",0,469

"Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired. People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the outskirts of Bangalore, as the police charged in.

"All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of fossil evidence has revealed that some archosaurs, like theropods, did give birth to live young. Other examples of Archosauromorpha include crocodiles, birds, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs. All of these animals lay eggs, but some paleontologists suggest that some of the extinct species of dinosaurs may have given live birth. For example, the Maiasaura is believed to have been a dinosaur that gave birth to live young. Additionally, the fossilized remains of the dinosaur Protoceratops have been found in association with eggshell fragments, suggesting that it may have laid eggs and given live birth. Overall, while most members of the Archosauromorpha group lay eggs, there is evidence that some species may have given live birth.",0,479

"Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun. Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, the most massive single star known. The newly discovered behemoths boast masses ranging from 150 to 300 times that of the Sun. Some are members of tight clusters, while others appear to be completely isolated in space. All of the stars belong to a special class of objects called Wolf-Rayet stars, which have extremely hot surface temperatures and strong stellar winds. By comparing the stars' locations in the sky with their distances from Earth, the team was able to measure the stars' absolute magnitudes - an indication of their intrinsic brightness. This allowed them to compare the stars' luminosities and determine the size of their respective masses. The study also revealed that the stars are all relatively young, at between 1 and 3 million years old. This suggests that these massive stars form more easily than previously thought. Overall, the findings shed new light on the nature of the most massive stars in our galaxy and provide important clues about how they form and evolve.",0,486

"Figures from the university admissions service, Ucas, show it was the highest number for five years. Students placed through clearing tend to be those who did not get the grades they were expecting, or who made a late decision to apply. The number of applicants placed through clearing rose by 5 compared with last year and was the highest since 2013. A total of 9,860 students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were accepted into higher education courses through the process this year, up from 9,410 in 2018. This includes students from outside the European Union (EU), who are not eligible for clearing. The rise comes as universities have become increasingly competitive with their offers and have been more likely to fill their places before clearing begins. It also follows a record high for the number of applications overall, with 690,930 people applying for university in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2019 - up 3 on 2018. However, the number of UK students accepted through clearing was down slightly, from 8,830 in 2018 to 8,780 this year. Ucas said the decrease in UK students accepted through clearing was due to the number of applicants falling by 1, while the overall acceptance rate remained much the same at 81. Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant said: ""Clearing continues to provide an important route into higher education for those who may have changed their minds about what or where to study or whose results weren't quite what they expected. ""There are still courses available in a wide range of subjects, so I'd urge anyone considering their options to look at all their choices, speak to advisers and make sure they understand the implications of their decisions.""",0,492

"That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation is that Amazon has managed to establish a monopoly in the UK book market, controlling more than 90 of the e-book market. It is not clear how this has been achieved, as Amazon does not disclose sales figures for its Kindle devices or its e-book titles. However, some reports suggest that Amazon's aggressive pricing policy and tight control over the supply chain have helped it to dominate the market. In addition, Amazon's ability to offer vast discounts on books makes it difficult for other retailers to compete. Amazon has also been accused of using its vast customer base to unfairly influence publishers and authors into signing exclusive deals with them. This has allowed Amazon to further entrench its position in the market. It is unclear if Amazon's dominance of the UK book market is legal under anti-trust laws. If it is found to be in violation of anti-trust laws, regulators may impose fines, or even force Amazon to break up its business to allow competition.",0,494

"To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on. It is a concern for the England team and they will need to find a way to rectify this problem if they are to have any success in the upcoming Tests. The first step in fixing this issue is to identify what went wrong. Was the batting too aggressive? Were bowlers too defensive? Was there a lack of discipline with either the bat or ball? Once you have identified the problem, then you can start to look at solutions. For instance, the batsmen may need to take a more measured approach when facing spin and be prepared to play for long periods. The bowlers could also look to build pressure by bowling more accurately and varying their lines and lengths. It is also important for the captain to be aware of the state of the pitch and adjust his tactics accordingly. This may mean bowling spinners early, setting attacking fields and placing an emphasis on taking wickets rather than runs. Finally, it is essential that the team keeps its composure throughout the run chase and focuses on each ball as it comes, rather than getting ahead of themselves. With determination, discipline and a sound game-plan, the England team should be able to turn this result around and come out victorious in the remaining Tests.",0,521
"Revised growth estimates now suggest the construction industry shrank in the first quarter of 2012, but by less than previously thought. Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean the industry avoided a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that construction output fell 0.2 in the first three months of 2012, compared with an earlier estimate of a 2.5 decline. This was still weaker than the 0.8 rise seen in the fourth quarter of 2011, but the ONS said the first-quarter figure was much better than expected and ""a sign that the sector may not have entered a technical recession."" The industry has been particularly hard hit by government spending cuts, and the latest figures are likely to be welcomed by ministers, who had feared the sector would contract for two successive quarters. However, despite the more positive news, the construction industry is still facing tough times, as the ONS said its revisions merely meant the first quarter's contraction was less pronounced than initially thought. Analysts said the sector was still weak, pointing to other indicators such as housebuilding which have declined significantly. Overall, the UK economy shrank 0.3 in the first quarter, marking the third successive quarter of contraction, raising fears that the country could be heading for a double-dip recession.",0,522

"Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death of the country's Prime Minister in mysterious circumstances has been a cause for deep concern, and with his successor yet to be named, there is a fear that political competition could destabilise the fragile nation. The potential for violence and civil unrest is a key worry, as any unrest could result in a refugee crisis, which would put immense strain on Ethiopia's neighbouring countries. The death of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has left a power vacuum in a region already destabilised by pandemic-induced economic turmoil, and the threat of a power struggle is looming large. To prevent an escalation of violence, the international community must act quickly to ensure that a stable transition of power takes place. This should include mediation efforts, direct diplomatic support and increased funding for peacekeeping operations, if necessary. The African Union has already called for peaceful negotiations between all parties involved, and has promised to provide additional financial support to ensure security and stability during the transition. Furthermore, the United Nations has committed to supporting Ethiopia's democratic process, and has urged all sides to refrain from violence. In order to ensure that a peaceful transition of power takes place, it is essential that the international community comes together and provides the necessary support to safeguard democracy in Ethiopia. It is also crucial that all parties involved remain committed to a peaceful resolution, and work together to ensure that Ethiopia remains politically stable and secure.",0,540

"Upsetting events often make the news because they don't happen very often. This section gives you some tips about what to do if you are feeling sad about what you've seen or heard. 1.

"The jury praised Ahmed Mansoor for regularly raising concerns about arbitrary detention, torture and degrading treatment in the Gulf state. As a result, it said, he had faced repeated intimidation, harassment and physical attacks. ""The life of this courageous human rights defender is a testament to the power of one person's willingness to speak truth to power,"" it said. Mansoor was sentenced in May 2018 to 10 years in prison after being convicted of ""publicly insulting the UAE's reputation abroad"" and ""publishing false information and rumours."" The charges stemmed from posts he made on social media about alleged torture in UAE prisons and his calls for political reforms. Before his conviction, Mansoor had been subjected to a sustained campaign of threats and harassment, which included being placed under surveillance, having his phone hacked and being followed by unknown individuals. He was also arrested and threatened with criminal prosecution several times. ""Ahmed Mansoor is a symbol of the struggle for freedom of expression in the United Arab Emirates and beyond,"" said Dr Agnes Callamard, Director of Amnesty International's Global Issues Programme.

"Mr Charney, who also founded the company, was ousted last year because of the employee complaints and amid accusations of misuse of company funds. In the San Francisco court filing, he said the company had ""wrongly accused him of misconduct, misused corporate assets and wrongfully terminated his employment."" He sought damages and to be reinstated as CEO. Charney's lawsuit also alleged that the board of directors had a conflict of interest in his firing, because the board members stood to benefit from the termination. Charney's legal team argued that the board violated its fiduciary duties by not properly investigating the employee complaints against Charney, which they argued were unsubstantiated. They argued that the investigation was designed to push out Charney, and not to protect the company. The court ultimately dismissed the case, ruling that the board of directors acted within their rights when they fired Charney. The court noted that although the employee complaints may have been unsubstantiated, the board had a reasonable basis to believe that Charney had engaged in misconduct and misused corporate funds. Ultimately, the court found that the board did not breach their fiduciary duty to protect the best interests of the company.",0,545

"The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95 compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22, earns more than 10,000 a year, and works in the UK. Auto-enrolment is an important part of the government's efforts to ensure that all employees have access to a retirement savings plan. It is intended to make it easier for people to save for their retirement. The 95 compliance rate among small businesses is testament to the success of the scheme so far. The next step for the auto-enrolment programme is to increase the minimum contribution rate from 2 to 5. This means that employers will be required to contribute at least 5 of their employee's salary towards their pension. This will help to ensure that people are able to build up an adequate amount of savings for their retirement. The government is also currently considering changes to the way in which pensions are taxed. These could involve changing the rate of tax relief on contributions, or introducing a 'flat rate' of tax relief. Any changes to the current system could have significant implications for how much people are able to save for their retirement. Overall, the auto-enrolment programme has been successful so far and is helping to ensure that more people are able to save for their retirement. However, further changes may be necessary in order to ensure that people can build up sufficient savings for later life.",0,557

United put five past Fulham at Craven Cottage, with Robin van Persie scoring his first hat-trick for the club and Wayne Rooney netting twice. The victory moved United two points clear of City, albeit having played a game more, while also sending out a powerful message to their rivals that they remain a force to be reckoned with. The result was in no small part due to Ferguson's tactical acumen. He switched to a three-man midfield containing Michael Carrick, Tom Cleverley and Shinji Kagawa, allowing Rooney and van Persie the freedom to roam and exploit the space behind Fulham's defence. His decision to bring on Antonio Valencia late on also paid dividends, with the Ecuadorian adding yet another goal to the rout. In short, it was a masterclass from the veteran manager.",0,567

The DHPA said it was not advocating for a full-scale registration scheme, but rather a voluntary one. The group said it wanted to ensure that high quality Dartmoor Hill Ponies remain in the population, by providing owners with an incentive to register their animals. This would also provide assurance to potential buyers that the pony they were buying was of good quality. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions from pony enthusiasts, with some questioning whether such a scheme is necessary or practical. Some have argued that there is no real way to verify a pony's pedigree or quality without rigorous testing, while others have argued that such a scheme could be abused by unscrupulous traders. The British Horse Society (BHS) has backed the DHPA's proposal, saying that it could help protect the welfare of the ponies and prevent them being exploited. It said that any scheme should be based on ""robust"" data collection, which includes microchipping, health checks and genetic testing.

"Leaving the union would see prices rise and threaten jobs, the prime minister said, in a move seen as an attempt to reach out to Labour voters. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, David Cameron said the UK should stay in a reformed EU because it is ""good for jobs, good for British business and good for our national security."" He acknowledged that people had concerns about the EU but argued that the risk posed by leaving was too great. ""The question we have to ask ourselves is this: do we want to be part of this European Union - with all its flaws - or not? I say yes, and I will make the positive case for Britain to remain in the EU."" He added that he wanted to see reforms to the way the EU works, including reducing red tape, cutting the cost of bureaucracy and protecting jobs.",0,581
"Paul captured global attention after he successfully predicted the results of all of Germany's seven games at the 2010 World Cup, as well as the final. Each time he opened a mussel and revealed the flag of the winning team. Paul's predictions made him an international celebrity, and he has been featured in several documentaries and news articles. He was even presented with a signed German national team jersey by the players themselves.

"Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared from near a farmhouse in Iraklis on 24 July 1991. The site, which is 750m from where he was last seen, has been extensively searched by police, firefighters, and volunteers. Ben's disappearance sparked a massive search effort in Greece and beyond, involving hundreds of people, including police divers and helicopters, to try to find him. Despite all the efforts, Ben has never been found and his whereabouts remain unknown to this day. The case remains open and police have not ruled out foul play. In 2010, a Greek court convicted two men of kidnapping Ben and sentenced them to life in prison, but their convictions were later overturned on appeal due to lack of evidence. The search for Ben continues, with Ben's parents still hoping that one day he will be found. Over the years, multiple theories have been suggested as to what happened to Ben, but none have been proven and his fate remains a mystery.",0,583

"Marco Goncalves, 34, assaulted the referee after being sent off in last month's game against Rio Tinto, and was escorted off the pitch by police. Images of the attack went viral on social media, and he was subsequently banned from playing in the league for one year. The attack was a serious breach of sportsmanship and a violation of the rules of the game. As a result, Goncalves must accept the sanctions imposed by the league and abide by them. Additionally, he should seek counseling to understand why his actions were wrong and how to prevent similar behavior in the future. It is also important that he apologize to the referee for his actions and show remorse for what he has done. Finally, it is necessary to stress the importance of respecting referees and other players in order to keep everyone safe on the field.",0,585
"The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too ""narrow"" and residents not properly consulted. He wants an interim report on the findings of the inquiry, which could take up to two years, ready by the end of this year. Mr Corbyn has promised a package of measures to help Grenfell survivors and their families, including free legal advice for those affected, financial help with housing costs and mental health support. He said Labour would also bring in laws to ensure all social housing meets ""the highest standards of fire safety."" The Prime Minister has promised that lessons will be learnt from the tragedy and taken action to make sure it never happens again. She has set up a public inquiry and pledged to carry out an independent review into building regulations and fire safety.",0,586
"Tigers are fifth after a season of struggle which has seen them sack director of rugby Richard Cockerill. They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the Premiership and have been unable to keep pace with the leading teams. The Tigers have had some good performances this season, particularly in Europe where they reached the quarter-finals of the Champions Cup. However, their lack of consistency has cost them and they have struggled to put together a run of wins in the league. The Tigers will need to regroup for next season if they are to challenge for a top-four finish. They must strengthen their squad and bring in some new faces to provide competition for places. They will also look to improve their defence and work on developing their attack. Overall, it has been a disappointing season for the Tigers but one which could act as a learning experience for the club as they look to build for the future.",0,587

"Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over PS600m in 2014 to only PS55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from PS500m in 2014 to just PS17m in 2015. The research firm found that while Aberdeen's investment market is highly cyclical, with activity peaking in 2014 and taking a nosedive since then, the city remains attractive to investors looking for long-term potential. The city's strong education and healthcare sectors, as well as its position as a hub for energy production and services, provide an opportunity for investors to gain access to new markets and diversify their portfolios. Despite the slump in investment volumes, Knight Frank said rental values have remained relatively stable, and there has been some evidence of a pick up in the office sector, although this is largely due to existing tenants expanding or relocating within the city.",0,590

"Their lawyers had asked the court to declare ""unlawful"" the consultation process that led to the proposed axing of the PS320m fund. The five are among 19,000 people who receive benefits from the fund. Their lawyers argued that the government had failed to give proper consideration to the impact of their decision on the claimants, who rely on the fund to pay for essential services such as home care, respite care and adaptations to their homes. The court said that while it sympathised with the claimants' plight, it could not find any legal grounds on which to declare the consultation process unlawful. It also noted that the government had taken steps to ensure that those affected by the proposed cuts had been consulted in a meaningful way. The court did, however, express concern at the lack of information provided to the claimants about the potential impact of the proposals. It urged the government to ensure that future consultations are more transparent and provide more detail to claimants about the potential consequences of changes to their benefits.",0,592
"The Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, held 47 trillion (PS30tn) in private wealth last year as the number of new millionaires rose in China and India. North America is the world's wealthiest region, with a combined PS47.6tn in private wealth, followed by Europe with PS44.4tn and Japan with PS17.9tn. The Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing region for wealth creation, according to a report from consultancy Capgemini. The number of millionaires in the region rose 11.3 on 2016, while the total amount of wealth held increased 10. China was the main driver of growth in the region, with its wealth increasing 15.2 to PS14.1tn. India was the second-biggest contributor, with wealth rising 11.5 to PS7.5tn. The report said the growth was due to rising incomes, buoyant stock markets, and favourable currency exchange rates.

"The club's latest accounts, for the year ending May 2014, also show the Bluebirds owe around PS174m - most of it to owner Vincent Tan. This was despite revenue increasing to PS91m, a rise of almost PS10m on the previous season. The accounts also showed that the club's wage bill had risen to PS43.1m - up from PS40.8m in the previous year - representing 47 of the club's turnover. The club had made a pre-tax loss of just under PS30m for the year ending May 2014. The club's financial position has been a source of controversy since Tan took over in 2010. He has invested heavily in the club and has also funded a number of high-profile signings including Wilfried Zaha, Steven Caulker and Gary Medel. However, his ownership has come in for criticism due to his controversial decision to rebrand Cardiff City in 2012, when he changed their home kit colour from blue to red.",0,594

The US Department of Justice has alleged that the defendants were involved in a long-running scheme to solicit and receive bribes and kickbacks from sports marketing firms in exchange for media and marketing rights to major international soccer tournaments. The charges include wire fraud, money laundering, and racketeering. Additionally, two Fifa executives were also accused of bribery.

"He was speaking after crowds in Tehran cheered negotiators who had agreed to curb some of Iran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. The six-month interim deal agreed in Geneva on Sunday is intended to open the way for a final agreement that would ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. But some hardliners in Iran have expressed anger at the deal, saying it goes too far in curbing Tehran's nuclear activities. Mr Obama said: ""I understand the scepticism... I don't blame people for being sceptical. We have to work through a long process in which the world has confidence that, in fact, they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon."" The president also said he was confident that if the negotiations over a permanent deal failed, the US and its allies had the capacity to exercise options that would keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. He added: ""We will continue to put pressure on them and increase pressure on them until they take a different course.""",0,599
"The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the West. This is due to the fact that countries like India and China have experienced a surge in the number of college graduates, while the West has seen its numbers decline. The OECD estimates that by 2030, nearly half of the world's tertiary educated population will be Asian, compared to just over a third in 2020. This shift is likely to have significant implications for global economic trends and international labour markets. In particular, there could be a surge of competition for jobs in the Western world from high-skilled workers from Asia. It could also create a new divide between high-and low-skilled work, with lower wages for those without a degree. Additionally, it could put pressure on Western governments to invest more heavily in their education systems and research and development, in order to keep up with their Asian counterparts.",0,600

It was stationed in Cornwall, Hampshire, Norfolk , Suffolk and Kent during World War II. The aircraft saw extensive service in the Battle of Britain and later in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres. It was credited with four confirmed kills and seven probables. In 1943 it was damaged in an accident while flying a training mission and had to be retired from active service. It was then used as a trainer before being donated to the Royal Air Force Museum in 1967. Today, ""Bette"" is on display at The Royal Air Force Museum in London. It is one of the few remaining original Spitfires still in existence and serves as a reminder of the courage and bravery of those who flew it during the war.",0,603

The inquest heard that he was not placed on any UK watchlist and that the British authorities had no knowledge of his prior conviction when he arrived in the UK in 2007. The coroner made a number of recommendations to the Government at the conclusion of the inquest, including the introduction of a European-wide alert system for those with convictions abroad, and ensuring that police forces across the UK share all relevant information about known offenders. He also called on the Home Office to consider introducing tougher border controls for convicted criminals from outside the EU.",0,604

In the same period , the number of people killed or seriously injured on British roads rose by 6. The figures suggest that there has been a reduction in the effectiveness of the prosecution system for road traffic offences. This is concerning, as enforcement is an important tool in encouraging drivers to adhere to the law and reduce casualties. It is also possible that other factors have contributed to the rise in serious injuries and fatalities on the roads. These could include an increase in traffic volume, changes in driving behaviour or a lack of investment in safer infrastructure or improved education campaigns.",0,606

"A firmer dollar in the aftermath of the first Clinton-Trump presidential debate helped send gold prices lower. The Dow Jones Average was up 0.74 to 18,174, while the more tech-related NASDAQ was up 0.44 to 5,301. The US dollar index rose 0.27 percent to 95.80, sending gold prices down 0.11 percent to 1,331.50 an ounce. Silver prices also declined, falling 0.76 percent to 19.12 an ounce. The debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump caused a shift in investor sentiment, as the dollar strengthened against other major currencies. This put pressure on gold prices, which had been rising over the past few weeks due to expectations of further stimulus from the Federal Reserve. The increased demand for the US dollar that came after the debate reflects investors' preferences for safe-haven investments, such as the greenback. Meanwhile, oil prices were little changed after the debate, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading at 44.54 a barrel, up 0.01 percent. Oil prices have been weighed down by worries about oversupply and weak global demand. The next presidential debate is scheduled for October 9, so it remains to be seen if investors will continue to favor the dollar or if gold prices will rebound as investors look to take advantage of any uncertainty surrounding the election.",0,608

So when Fletch asked him if he had any advice for young footballers, his answer cut right to the heart of the matter. ""If I could give them one bit of advice,"" said Gazza, ""it'd be look after yourself, don't make the same mistakes as I did. Look after your body and your mind."" It was a brutally honest assessment from the former England star, who has battled with addiction for much of his life. And it's a message that Russell clearly took to heart. ""That's really important what he said,"" said Russell. ""I think it's something that all young footballers should take on board. It's so easy to get caught up in the moment and forget about the long-term consequences of your actions."" Russell is not alone in taking Gazza's advice to heart. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness among footballers of the importance of looking after their mental health. And Gazza's words are a reminder that even the most talented players can have struggles off the pitch. If we can learn anything from Gazza's story, it's that no one is immune to mental health issues.",0,611

"6 January 2016 Last updated at 12:15 GMT The technology lets people physically feel the buttons displayed on a touchscreen, which could help drivers keep their eyes on the road. The technology, called haptic feedback, has been developed by a team from the University of Bristol in the UK. It works by using an array of tiny actuators to create a 3D model of virtual buttons and sliders on a touchscreen. When users interact with the display, the actuators vibrate and move in order to generate a physical sensation.

"The Reds looked in control when Roberto Firmino converted James Milner's pass and Daniel Sturridge backheeled to Sadio Mane to clip home a second. But Leicester were given hope when Jamie Vardy tapped in for his 20th goal of the campaign and Danny Drinkwater forced a save from Simon Mignolet. The Reds were able to take some of the sting out of the game when Sturridge added a third, but they had to endure a tense finale when Shinji Okazaki scrambled in a consolation. Jurgen Klopp's side, however, held on to record their first league win since December 14 and move into eighth place - eight points off the top four with two games in hand. Leicester remain second but they are now five points behind leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand. Klopp made three changes following Liverpool's 0-0 draw at Sunderland last time out, with Divock Origi and Lucas Leiva coming into the midfield, while Kolo Toure replaced Martin Skrtel at centre-back. Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri made four alterations as he looked to bounce back from the Foxes' FA Cup exit against Tottenham. Andy King and Demarai Gray came in for the injured duo of N'Golo Kante (hamstring) and Marc Albrighton (ankle), while Okazaki and Nathan Dyer were also brought in. After an even start, the visitors took the lead on 27 minutes when Milner's pass was volleyed home by Firmino at the far post after Leicester failed to clear their lines properly. Leicester almost responded immediately when Drinkwater's long-range effort forced a smart save from Mignolet, before Origi tested Kasper Schmeichel with a powerful drive from 20 yards. The hosts had an even better chance to level just before the break when Jeffrey Schlupp found space in the box, but his close-range effort was blocked brilliantly by Toure. Liverpool doubled their lead four minutes after the restart when Mane converted from close range after being teed up by Sturridge. And it should have been 3-0 moments later when Schmeichel parried Milner's effort straight to Origi, only for the Belgian to fire over with the goal gaping. Leicester were handed a lifeline on 63 minutes when Vardy nodded in Riyad Mahrez's cross, and Drinkwater then stung the palms of Mignolet with a fierce drive from 25 yards. But any hopes of a Leicester comeback were ended nine minutes from time when Sturridge capitalised on some poor defending to slot home his first league goal since October. Okazaki added a late consolation for Leicester, but it was not enough to deny Liverpool the win.",0,619

"Eight year-old Phoebe Hanson wrote to BBC Radio 4's PM saying she worried how the ""bongs"" would be replaced while Big Ben is being repaired next year. PM's editor, Roger Sawyer, decided to write back to her. Dear Phoebe, Thank you for your letter to PM about Big Ben. It's a very interesting question and one that has been asked a lot since it was announced that the famous bell at the Houses of Parliament is to be silenced while repairs are carried out next year. The good news is that the bongs will not be lost while Big Ben is being repaired. The House of Commons has revealed plans to install a modernized version of the chimes - known as 'quarter bells' - in the tower while Big Ben is restored. This version of the bells is expected to sound every 15 minutes and will ensure that the famous chimes are still heard throughout Westminster. We hope this answer helps to alleviate your concerns about Big Ben and the bongs! Best wishes, Roger Sawyer Editor, PM",0,623

"Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands finally coming out of recession? It is too early to say definitively whether the West Midlands is coming out of recession. While these job growth numbers are encouraging, there are still signs of economic weakness in the region, such as rising unemployment and stagnant wages. The region is also facing a number of challenges, including Brexit uncertainty, rising costs for businesses, and the impact of automation on existing jobs. Nevertheless, the 1,700 job creation announcement from Jaguar Land Rover is certainly a sign that the West Midlands economy is beginning to turn a corner.",0,625

"The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close with a volley and the hosts should have been out of sight by half-time. The visitors had a few chances of their own, with Olivier Giroud bringing a save from Alisson, while Bukayo Saka forced the Brazilian into action early in the second period. But Liverpool were never seriously threatened and sealed the points late on when substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fired home from the edge of the box. It was an impressive display from Jurgen Klopp's side, who moved to within three points of the top four, and here are five things we learned from the game... 1. Liverpool show attacking intent The Reds showed plenty of attacking intent from the outset, as Origi and Firmino combined to open the scoring inside 15 minutes. The hosts had an array of chances to extend their lead throughout the first half, with Origi going close with a volley and Sadio Mane narrowly missing the target with a header. Klopp's side continued to push forward after the break, but it wasn't until the introduction of Oxlade-Chamberlain that they finally found the third goal to seal the win. It was a performance full of attacking intent and one that will give the team confidence heading into the festive period.",0,627

"It's rare that the company delves too far into how the ""magic"" - as they call it - works. Their logic is a magic trick doesn't get better if you know how it's done. The basic idea behind their technology is that they use a combination of artificial intelligence and deep learning to provide customers with personalized recommendations. They have a proprietary algorithm which takes into account various factors such as user preferences, previous searches, browsing history, and purchase history. This data is then used to create a profile of the user and determine what products they may be interested in. The algorithm is designed to learn from user behavior over time, meaning that the more users interact with the platform, the better the recommendations become. The company also uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand customer queries and provide relevant results.

Manufacturers reported their highest growth rate in six years, driven by strong exports, while the service sector saw its best performance since 2016.

However, inflation increased to its highest level in nearly four years, and business confidence dropped to its lowest level since the Brexit referendum in 2016. There are also mounting concerns about skill shortages and recruitment difficulties, as well as falling sales in some sectors.

""With millions of people stuck on housing waiting lists, we need urgent action to make sure those who desperately need a secure, affordable home are not left behind. The government must act now to ensure more social homes are built to replace the ones lost to Right to Buy.""",0,667

Officials at the park said they imposed a 10,000 rupee (130) fine on the couple for the violation.

"3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy a home. The practice has become so common that Chinese estate agents are now being told to report such deals to the authorities, according to state media. Some couples opt for a fake divorce in order to get around China's strict rules on buying property in big cities. Under these regulations, only one member of a couple can own a home - which makes it financially difficult for two people to buy together. By opting for a fake divorce, one partner can purchase the property alone, while the other still remains living there. The reports by CCTV, China's national broadcaster, come amid a nationwide housing boom, with prices in some cities soaring 20-30 over the past year. The government says it is clamping down on the practice, with estate agents now being held responsible for reporting any suspicious transactions. China's ministry of civil affairs has also said it will be setting up a database to track divorces and help detect any fakes. Divorce in China is relatively easy, but the law states that a couple must wait at least six months after splitting before remarrying again.",0,682
"Police forces tasked with implementing strict state interpretations of Islamic morality exist in several other states, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Malaysia. Many - especially those with an affinity with Saudi Arabia - enforce highly-conservative interpretations of Islamic law, often punishing perceived moral transgressions with physical punishments like flogging. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the religious police (also known as the Mutaween) are responsible for enforcing the country's strict interpretation of Sharia law. This includes prohibiting activities such as mixing genders in public, playing music, drinking alcohol, and other activities deemed to be immoral by the government. They patrol public areas and can also confiscate goods that they deem to be offensive or immoral. In some cases, they can even arrest individuals suspected of violating Sharia law. In Sudan, the Hisba police are responsible for enforcing morality in accordance with Islamic law. This includes monitoring dress codes, preventing the sale and consumption of alcohol, and prohibiting activities deemed to be immoral. They are also tasked with preventing ""inappropriate behavior"" and have been known to use physical punishments such as flogging to punish those who violate Islamic laws. In Malaysia, there is the Federal Territories Islamic Religious Department, which is responsible for enforcing morality and Islamic law in the country's federal territories.

"The trial, which targets women who are too late to undergo surgery, gives six weeks of additional chemotherapy. On average, 94 women in Northern Ireland each year are diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, a disease that is often not detected until it has spread to other parts of the body. The trial aims to determine whether giving additional chemotherapy can extend the length of time women survive with the disease. Women who are eligible for the trial will receive either the standard three-month course of chemotherapy or an additional six weeks of chemotherapy. The aim of the trial is to see if the additional chemotherapy can increase the chance of survival. The trial has been designed to provide the best possible medical care and support to the women taking part. It also aims to ensure that they have access to all the relevant information they need during their treatment. All women will be offered psychological and social support throughout the trial.",0,714

"The works on Gdynia Way near Plymouth's city centre have been in place since June to widen the road to three lanes. But police said they had seen an increase in the number of collisions on the route since the works started. The works have increased traffic congestion in the area, and it is believed this has contributed to the increase in accidents. The police have also noted that some drivers have been driving too fast through the roadworks, despite warnings to slow down. To improve safety on Gdynia Way, Plymouth City Council are taking action. They have installed additional signage and speed cameras to remind drivers to take extra care when travelling through the roadworks. Additionally, they have reduced the speed limit from 30mph to 20mph, and are encouraging drivers to be more aware of their surroundings. In response to the increase in collisions, the council has also set up an online survey for people to submit their views about the works and how they can be improved.

He was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay back 38,000. The court heard Coffey used his position as the practice manager to write cheques to himself, transfer money from the practice's bank account into his own, and make unauthorised refunds to himself. He also doctored the accounts to try and cover his tracks. The court heard that Coffey's actions caused significant financial harm to the practice, leaving it with a large deficit.

"21 October 2016 Last updated at 15:03 BST In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but none have been spotted since The seahorse population at South Beach in San Francisco Bay has not been seen for more than eight years. In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the site during a study, but none have been spotted since. The reason for the disappearance of the seahorses is not clear, but it is thought that overfishing and habitat degradation could be factors. The seahorse population is also vulnerable to changes in water temperature and pollution levels. The discovery of this once abundant species has led to a new research project by the California Academy of Sciences, which hopes to determine what happened to the seahorses and how they can be reintroduced to the area. Researchers are studying the behavior of other types of fish in the bay and looking for signs of seahorse life. The research team will also examine whether the introduction of artificial habitats, such as artificial reefs, could help the seahorses re-establish their presence in the bay. Artificial habitats can provide secure places for seahorses to breed and hide from predators. In addition to the research project, conservation groups are working to protect the remaining seahorse populations in the bay. They are encouraging local fishermen to use sustainable fishing practices and are advocating for better protection of the seahorse habitats. The disappearance of the seahorses from South Beach is a reminder of the fragility of marine ecosystems and the importance of protecting them. Hopefully, with increased awareness and conservation efforts, the seahorses will return to the bay.",0,722

"The Lions looked the more dangerous side in the early stages and experienced striker Steve Morison twice hammered efforts over the crossbar. There was little goalmouth action at either end as both sides struggled to get into their passing rhythm. The visitors went close to breaking the deadlock on 28 minutes when Shaun Williams' shot from 25 yards was deflected narrowly over the bar. Millwall began to dominate proceedings and Morison was denied again five minutes later, this time by a stunning save from goalkeeper Joe Murphy. The Shrews strived to hit back but were unable to create any clear-cut chances and went into the break goalless. The second period saw Millwall continue to press for the opener and Ed Upson's free-kick almost did the trick, only for the ball to be cleared off the line by Abu Ogogo. The home side eventually made the breakthrough on 67 minutes when Morison headed home from close range after a brilliant cross from debutant Shane Lowry. The Lions sealed the victory in injury time when substitute John Marquis finished off a fine move with a perfectly struck shot from 12 yards. The win sees Millwall move up to fifth in the table and they will now look to make it four wins in a row when they travel to Peterborough United next week.",0,724

"The pontiff granted Spanish Monsignor Lucio Vallejo Balda a Christmas-time clemency after he served half of his 18-month sentence, the Vatican said. The priest was convicted in July. The leaked information concerned a secret Vatican document on financial reform and the Holy See's relationship with Italian banks. The pontiff granted clemency ""out of the love that Jesus has for all of us and especially those who are suffering,"" a statement from the Vatican said. It added that Pope Francis was taking into consideration ""the request for clemency, the conditions of detention and the health status of Monsignor Vallejo Balda."" The pope also pardoned Francesca Chaouqui, a former public relations consultant who had been convicted along with the monsignor. The Vatican said she received a ""conditional suspension of sentence"" because the time limit to serve the brief sentence had already expired. She was sentenced to 10 months in jail but was released after four months in prison due to good behavior and regular attendance of church activities. The pontiff's action came as a sign of mercy during the Christmas season and was seen as a gesture of reconciliation. The pope's decision to grant clemency was also viewed as a way to put an end to the conflict, which had become a distraction to the Vatican's efforts to combat financial scandals.",0,729

It's a decision that could shape the future of the UK, and it's one that Scots have been discussing for years. So what exactly is at stake? Well, the big question is whether Scotland would remain in the UK if they voted ""Yes"" to independence.

This could mean that decisions made at an EU level could impact on Scotland more than they currently do. On the other hand, those who are against independence argue that being part of the UK gives Scotland more stability and security than it would have as an independent country.

"Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Dales in Belfast. Gerard Hughes pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and two counts of assaulting police officers. Gavin Hughes admitted one count of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and one count of affray. Joseph Hughes pleaded guilty to one count of affray. The court heard that on the evening of 2 August 2020 the three brothers had been at a bar in Belfast city centre and had become involved in an altercation with another group of people.

The gun was later found to be an imitation firearm. The court also heard that Gavin Hughes punched one of the officers in the face and Gerard Hughes attempted to punch and kick the officers before they were eventually restrained. Sentencing the brothers, Judge David McFarland said: ""This was a serious incident involving firearms in a busy city centre and could have had devastating consequences.

"The government wants some households to pay more to raise money for education, and finance secretary Derek Mackay gave evidence to committee backing the plan. The committee formally recommended the plan, expressing support for the policy. Mackay argued that it was necessary to raise more money to fund improvements in education. He argued that the additional revenue would allow the government to provide more resources and reduce class sizes, as well as invest in high-quality teaching and learning. The committee proposed a graduated tax system, which would see some households paying higher rates of taxation than others, depending on their level of income. This would be implemented through changes to the Council Tax system, with different thresholds for each band. Mackay noted that the Scottish Government had already committed to freezing the basic rate of income tax, and that this plan would not increase the overall tax burden for Scots. He also pointed out that the additional revenues generated by these new taxes would be invested back into public services, such as education, and that this would help Scotland reach its ambition of becoming one of the most successful small countries in the world. Finally, Mackay highlighted the need to ensure that any changes to the tax system are fair and that those on lower incomes are not disproportionately impacted. To this end, the Scottish Government will set up an independent body to review the impact of any reforms.",0,753

At trial, Carpenter argued that he genuinely believed he was entitled to accept donations and that the guitars and equipment belonged to him, as he had a past agreement with the owner of the equipment. However, the prosecution said that Carpenter had deceived members of the public and had not made it clear that he was asking for donations.

Or could Leicester once again become a destination of choice? The city's tourism industry has seen a dramatic transformation since the discovery of Richard III in 2012, but there is still much work to be done if it is to reclaim its place as a popular tourist destination.

"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday. It aims to create a single hospital site, with the Royal Liverpool University Hospital as the main hub. The Aintree University Hospital site would be developed to provide additional services such as diagnostics and outpatients. The plan also suggests that a new model of care will be developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, focusing on a ""one-stop shop"" approach for patients. This could include bringing together specialist teams from different disciplines, such as cardiology, vascular surgery and neurology, who can work together to diagnose and treat complex conditions. The proposal is part of a wider plan to improve healthcare across Merseyside and Cheshire, which includes closing some hospitals and creating larger health hubs. The Royal Liverpool and Aintree University Hospitals are two of the largest hospitals in the region and the merger would enable them to provide more efficient and effective care.",0,793

"The man, named by state media as Ji Zhongxing, 34, from central Shandong province, was injured and taken to hospital. No-one else was hurt in the blast, which filled part of the arrivals hall with smoke. Ji was allegedly seeking revenge after being beaten by security guards at Beijing airport in 2005. He has reportedly been demanding compensation from the government for more than a decade, and told those around him shortly before the explosion that he wanted to draw attention to his case. The blast happened shortly after 16:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Saturday. The Beijing News said Ji had been holding a red bucket with a ""firecracker"" inside when it exploded. China's state broadcaster CCTV said Ji had been travelling to Beijing to seek compensation for an injury he claimed to have sustained in a beating he received in the city of Dongguan, Guangdong province, in 2005.

Reuters news agency reported that Ji had posted a statement online prior to the attack in which he said he would ""blow up the airport"" if his demands were not met.",0,797
"Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common hierarchical approach. But none of them felt right, and the team was lacking in motivation and focus. So they decided to try something different. Rather than having a traditional top-down hierarchy, Crisp implemented a self-organising model, where individual teams were responsible for their own decision-making. This meant that each team had autonomy to decide how to best achieve their goals - with guidance from an overall leadership team. The result? A more collaborative atmosphere, increased motivation and better performance across the board. Crisp's success story should serve as a reminder that sometimes trying something different is the only way to truly unlock potential. It can also be a great way to increase employee engagement and creativity. Organisations that are willing to experiment with new organisational models may find that it leads to improved efficiency and productivity - not to mention happier employees.",0,798
"The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 percent to 0.25 percent in an effort to stimulate the economy as it faces a severe economic downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic. The MPC's decision is consistent with the Bank's overall aim of providing support to businesses and households during this difficult period. The low rates will help to protect those affected by the economic shock, such as those who have lost their job or had their hours reduced, by keeping borrowing costs low. At the same time, the Bank is aware that it must be cautious in its approach. Keeping rates low for too long can lead to a build-up of financial risk, which could destabilise the economy in the long-run. Therefore, the MPC has decided to keep rates on hold until there is more clarity about the extent of the economic damage caused by the pandemic, and how long it will take for the recovery to begin. In the meantime, the Bank is continuing to use other tools, such as quantitative easing and the Term Funding Scheme, to provide additional support to the economy. These measures are designed to help maintain financial stability and ensure that credit continues to flow to both households and businesses. Overall, the MPC's decision to leave rates at their new, historically low, level is a prudent one. It will help to protect those most vulnerable in society while avoiding a potentially dangerous build-up of financial risk.",0,799
"Based on a true story, Pride shows how gay rights campaigners from London raised thousands of pounds for miners in the Dulais Valley, after the NUM had spurned their support. The film follows the group of activists, led by Mark Ashton (played by Ben Schnetzer), as they attempt to bond with their new Welsh allies and fight for a common cause. The film highlights the struggle that both gay rights campaigners and miners faced during the 1984-85 Miners' Strike, as Thatcher's government attacked both communities with its policies. Through humour and heart, Pride shows how the two groups came together in the face of adversity, inspired by each other's courage. The film also confronts issues such as homophobia, sexism, and racism in 1980s Britain, and shows how the collective strength of individuals can create positive change. Despite the political difficulties faced by both groups, the story ends on a hopeful note, as the activists and miners celebrate their victory over the police. Pride is an inspiring tale of solidarity and hope. It celebrates the power of community and the importance of standing up for what you believe in. In doing so, it has become an important part of the LGBT movement, and a reminder of why we must never forget our history.",0,800

Macron's centrist En Marche! party is a newcomer to the scene. The election of Macron or Le Pen will be seen as a major shift in French politics, with implications for the European Union and beyond. Macron is a strong advocate of Europe and wants to deepen integration, while Le Pen wants France to leave the EU. Macron is expected to win the second round on May 7th, but it is not certain. The contest between the two candidates is likely to get more heated in the weeks ahead. Whoever wins, their success can be attributed to the fact that they are completely different from their predecessors and represent a break from the status quo.",0,802

One of the whistleblowers, former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman, said he was ordered to get the drug by Shane Sutton The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the international governing body of competitive cycling. It is based in Aigle, Switzerland and was founded in 1900. The UCI is responsible for regulating, promoting and developing the sport of professional cycling and is also responsible for the coordination of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The UCI has introduced a number of rules and regulations over the years in order to ensure fair play and protect the health of cyclists. In 2011, the UCI banned the use of intravenous injections in professional cycling. This decision was made after it was revealed that some teams had been using performance-enhancing drugs. Team Sky, which is owned by British billionaire and cycling enthusiast Sir Dave Brailsford, has been at the centre of controversy due to allegations of doping. Former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman has alleged that he was ordered to get triamcinolone, a powerful corticosteroid, for riders. The UCI has since launched an investigation into the matter. If found guilty, Team Sky could face severe sanctions including suspension, fines, disqualification and expulsion from the UCI. The UCI has the power to impose these sanctions on any team or rider who is found to have violated its rules. The UCI has also recently announced plans to introduce a new system of monitoring and testing riders for the use of banned substances.",0,803
"John Lahiff, 75, told local media that he disturbed the crocodile while looking for a ball in water at the course in Port Douglas, Queensland. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries to his right arm. Mr Lahiff said he had been fishing in the lake when he saw a round object in the water, which he thought was a golf ball. When he reached into the water to pick it up, he felt a ""crunch"" and realised it was the jaws of a crocodile. He managed to pull his arm out of the animal's mouth, but not before suffering severe injuries to his right arm. He was taken to Mossman Hospital, where he received treatment for his wounds. Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) spokesperson Neil Blake said that the incident was under investigation. ""We are still trying to determine what species of crocodile it is and will be setting traps to catch it,"" Mr Blake said. He added that it was important for people to stay vigilant when visiting areas where crocodiles may be present.

"It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain the telltale signs of a disease that has long been known only by its symptoms. Using a new technique called ""patch clamping,"" researchers were able to detect abnormal electrical activity in neurons from mice with a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The findings provide important insight into how ALS affects the brain, potentially leading to new treatments for the debilitating neurological disorder. The patch clamping technique involves placing a tiny electrode onto the surface of a neuron and then measuring the electrical activity inside the cell. By doing this, the researchers were able to detect changes in the electrical signals produced by neurons from ALS mice. They found that the neurons in ALS mice had significantly lower electrical signals than those of healthy mice. These findings suggest that ALS may be associated with a disruption of electrical signaling in certain neurons, which could be used to diagnose the condition and identify potential targets for drug therapies. Additionally, the technique could also help researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms behind ALS and other neurological disorders.",0,807
"The Sky Blues currently play in Coventry's Ricoh Arena but had a long dispute with the stadium's previous owners.

"The king commissioned the piano for the palace from renowned maker Thomas Tomkison in about 1821. The instrument displays the flamboyant taste Tomkison shared with the king. It was bought for a considerable sum, and is one of the few surviving pianos made by Tomkison. The piano is an impressive 6'3"" in length and has a beautiful rosewood case with a unique rosette inlay of ebony, ivory, and rosewood. The keyboard has five octaves and is composed of ebony and ivory. The action is typical for the period; it has a metal frame, leather-covered hammers, and hardwood jacks. It also features a Viennese double escapement which allows the keys to be released without completely depressing them. The soundboard is constructed from spruce and lacquered with gold leaf giving the instrument a truly majestic appearance. The king was so pleased with the piano that he had a custom mahogany stand built to hold it in the palace.

The piano is a rare example of Tomkison's work, and is testament to the skill of the craftsman and the taste of the monarch.",0,816
"Dubbed ""carbon farming,"" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices and taking away land from food production. The concept of carbon farming is based on the idea that plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, locking it away in the form of biomass such as wood or soil. If farmers can manage their land to maximize this effect, it could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. The idea is gaining traction among some researchers, who believe it may offer a viable way to reduce emissions without relying on expensive and untested technology. In fact, recent research suggests that carbon farming could be more cost-effective than traditional methods of reducing emissions, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). In addition to reducing emissions, carbon farming could also have other benefits. For example, it could help improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and provide additional income for farmers. However, not everyone is convinced. Critics point out that carbon farming could have unintended consequences, such as driving up food prices or taking away land from food production. They also argue that the idea has yet to be fully tested and that more research is needed before it can be implemented on a large scale. Only time will tell if carbon farming will live up to its promise. For now, it remains an intriguing but controversial idea with potential implications for the global climate.",0,817

"It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned. Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save the Amazon rainforest from loggers and speculators. Moura had been convicted in both 2008 and 2014 for orchestrating Stang's murder, but both convictions were overturned on appeal. In 2020, Moura was again convicted of ordering Stang's assassination and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The conviction was based on testimony from two men who said they saw Moura give money to the hitman who killed Stang. The two men received reduced sentences for their cooperation with prosecutors. The case was seen as a test of Brazil's commitment to justice for environmental activists, many of whom have been murdered in recent years while defending their land. Stang's murder has become a symbol of the struggle between landowners and small farmers over the use of the Amazon rainforest.",0,839
"Simmons, 52, was suspended in September for questioning the continued omissions of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard. He issued a public apology to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). ""I regret my comments and apologise to the WICB, Bravo and Pollard,"" Simmons said. Simmons had been critical of the WICB's decision to not select the two players for the West Indies tour of India in October. He argued that their omission was detrimental to the team's chances of success. The WICB responded by suspending Simmons for two matches and issuing him a fine. Simmons' suspension meant that he would miss the second Test against India and the two ODIs against Sri Lanka. The WICB also issued him a warning that any further criticism of the board could result in further sanctions. The suspension was lifted following Simmons' apology, but he was not selected for the upcoming Test series against Pakistan. This has led to speculation that his relationship with the WICB is still strained. Despite the controversy, Simmons remains one of the most respected coaches in world cricket. He has coached four different teams, including the West Indies, South Africa, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. In 2012, he led the West Indies to the World T20 title.",0,840

"New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed millions of bees worldwide and has become a serious problem for beekeepers. The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with the mites because of its increased grooming behaviour. The study also found that the same traits that make the Cornish Black honey bee more resilient to varroa mites also give it an advantage in other areas, such as better honey production, longer life span and improved winter survival rates. The findings could help beekeepers breed more resilient bees, helping to protect the global bee population from the devastating effects of the virus.",0,844

"The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices. But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech expert has warned. The draft Bill was published by the Home Office in November and includes a legal duty for ""telecommunications operators"" to provide assistance to law enforcement, security services and other public bodies where necessary. This could include accessing data on devices, like phones or PCs. However, speaking at a Westminster eForum event, Dr Richard Clayton, a senior expert in computer security from the University of Cambridge, warned that this clause is not limited to these devices. He said: ""This clause applies to anything that's got an IP address. It doesn't matter if it's a phone, a PC, a fridge or a lightbulb - all of them are subject to the same legal duties [under the Bill]."" Dr Clayton also warned that any device with an internet connection could become a potential target for hacking - including medical equipment, industrial machinery and even vehicles. In addition, he also raised concerns about the lack of clarity in the Bill when it comes to defining what constitutes 'reasonable' assistance from providers. He said: ""What's reasonable? Reasonable for who? We don't know."" The Investigatory Powers Bill is currently being scrutinised by the parliamentary committee, which is due to deliver its report in February 2016.",0,848

"Slovakia is launching a legal challenge to mandatory quotas that were passed in a majority vote on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister has proposed a radical budgetary revamp to raise funds to support the country's immigration policies. The Slovakian government has filed a legal challenge against the mandatory quotas at the European Court of Justice, arguing that they violated EU law. The move is likely to be seen as an attempt to undermine the European Union's refugee policy, which seeks to share the burden of hosting refugees among its member states. Slovakia argues that it should not be forced to accept refugees who are not from its own region and have little chance of being integrated into society. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has proposed a radical budget revamp which includes cutting welfare benefits and raising taxes to fund his country's immigration policies. This includes deploying thousands of additional police officers to monitor Hungary's borders, as well as paying for the construction of a wall on the Serbian-Hungarian border. He also plans to create a ""border hunter"" unit to track down migrants who enter Hungary illegally. The proposal has been widely criticized by human rights activists, who argue it would lead to more human rights abuses.",0,882

"That phrase hinted both at an ideal flexible arrangement in the future and an ideal shared approach from both the UK and Irish governments, together stressing to the EU the need for flexibility in the context of Brexit.

It implies that the two governments should make their case to the EU as a unified front, emphasizing the importance of finding practical solutions that meet both sides' needs.

"Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA analysis of ancient remains has revealed that most Europeans are a mix of these three ancestral populations. The indigenous hunter-gatherers were the first inhabitants of Europe, living in the region for thousands of years before the arrival of Middle Eastern farmers and the Bronze Age population from the east. These hunter-gatherers had a predominantly dark skin tone and were distributed across Europe until they were eventually absorbed into the growing farming populations. Middle Eastern farmers migrated to Europe around 8,000 years ago, bringing with them their own unique genetic lineages. This group is thought to have played an important role in introducing new technology and crops to Europe, as well as contributing genetically to the European gene pool. The Bronze Age population from the east arrived in Europe around 3,500 years ago, bringing with them Indo-European languages and cultural influences. This population is believed to have been mainly composed of male warriors, who left a strong genetic legacy in the form of Y-chromosome haplogroups. Overall, Europeans today are a mixture of all three ancestral populations, and the proportions vary depending on geography. For example, northern Europeans tend to have higher levels of ancestry from the Middle Eastern farmers, while southern Europeans have higher levels of ancestry from the Bronze Age population.",0,898

"The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time.

"The poverty rate was 15 in 2011, meaning 46.2 million Americans were in poverty, staying flat after three previous years of increases. Real median income of households in the country was 50,054 in 2011, a 1.5 percent decline from the previous year. The poverty rate has been on the rise since 2007, with the highest rates recorded in 2011 and 2012, reaching 15.1 percent in both years. The economic recession caused by the financial crisis of 2007-2008 is widely believed to be the chief cause of this increase in poverty levels. In addition, the Great Recession of 2008-2009 further exacerbated the situation, leading to high unemployment and a weak labor market. The disparities between those who are wealthy and those living in poverty have become increasingly pronounced as well. The top 5 percent of Americans accounted for 21.9 percent of total household income in 2011, while the bottom 40 percent of Americans only accounted for 12.8 percent. The federal government has implemented several initiatives to address poverty and income inequality. These include programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit, which provides tax breaks to low-income earners, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps low-income families purchase food. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided additional funds to states and localities to help those hit hardest by the recession. In spite of these efforts, the poverty rate and income inequality remain stubbornly high. Additional policies such as a higher minimum wage, increased access to education and job training, and stronger safety nets for vulnerable populations are needed to ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to escape poverty and build better lives for themselves and their families.",0,915

"Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who will start on pole, was the only one of the silver cars to beat Hamilton's best lap time, but was unable to match his pace on the other laps. Hamilton had been in the top three all weekend, but an untimely spin at Turn 11 on his final lap saw him finish tenth and seventh overall. He had set a fastest sector two time which would have put him second, but the mistake cost him dearly. Rosberg, who finished fourth overall, was able to take advantage of Hamilton's mistake and secured his second pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix. It was his first front row start since Bahrain in April 2015. Meanwhile, Mercedes' other drivers Valtteri Bottas and Pascal Wehrlein were also able to capitalise on Hamilton's misfortune. Bottas, who had qualified fifth, was promoted to third while Wehrlein, who had originally started tenth, moved up to eighth.",0,921
"The group were convicted of Tuesday of assaulting social worker and activist Ken Tsang as he took part in the 2014 pro-democracy rallies. TV cameras caught the officers removing Mr Tsang from a protest site, carrying him away and then beating him in a dark corner. The officers were found guilty of causing actual bodily harm to Mr Tsang and were sentenced to two years in prison for the assault. This is the first time that police officers have been convicted and sentenced for their involvement in pro-democracy protests. The ruling was welcomed by activists and human rights advocates who hailed it as a victory against police brutality. However, some criticized the verdict as too lenient and argued that the officers should have been given a harsher punishment. The case has also highlighted concerns about police accountability and transparency, as well as the need for greater public oversight of law enforcement. The conviction of these officers may signal that police officers are being held accountable for their actions, but it also highlights the need for further reforms and greater scrutiny of law enforcement in Hong Kong.",0,922

"Germany forward Linden, who was signed from Frankfurt, nodded in from a Kerys Harrop cross to salvage a point. Melissa Fletcher had put the hosts ahead, meeting an Emma Follis cross in the 28th minute. The result, which leaves both teams level on points at the top of the table, means they will be joined by SC Sand and Wolfsburg, who are also on 33 points, at the summit. The draw was a fair reflection of the game, with both teams creating good chances throughout. Frankfurt dominated the early possession, with their experienced midfielders controlling the tempo. They came close to opening the scoring when Turkish forward Belinay Guveli hit the post from outside the box. Birmingham City Ladies responded well and created several chances of their own. Kerys Harrop went closest, forcing a fine save from goalkeeper Carolin Endler with a powerful drive from 20 yards. The Birmingham side eventually took the lead through Fletcher, who headed in the Follis cross. But Linden popped up late to ensure the spoils were shared. The draw keeps Frankfurt within touching distance of the top of the table and puts them firmly in contention for a Champions League spot.

"""Dependency on giving that only appears to be charitable must end,"" he said in a tweet ahead of this weekend's African Union summit in South Africa. The BBC's Robert Kiptoo in Nairobi says Mr Macron's comments reflect growing frustration with the continent's donors. The French president has been outspoken about his commitment to Africa and its development. He has championed France's policy of investing in the continent and promoting financial independence from foreign aid. But he has also been critical of some African countries' reliance on foreign aid, which he believes has stifled innovation and hindered economic growth. In a series of tweets ahead of the summit, Mr Macron said ""dependency on giving that only appears to be charitable must end."" He added that Africa must take charge of its destiny and build its own future. Mr Macron's comments come at a time when the continent is facing numerous challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, insecurity and corruption. Many African countries have long relied on foreign aid to fund their development projects, but the funding has not always been used effectively or efficiently. The French president's comments were welcomed by several African leaders, who agreed that the continent must shift away from dependence on foreign aid and find ways to develop its own resources.

"Culture Secretary Maria Miller said ""decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table"" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to evasion, and said it was ""well-equipped"" to tackle evasion already. The BBC is currently funded through the licence fee, a fixed fee charged to households in the UK that watch or record live television programmes. The licence fee has been criminalised since 1946, meaning that non-payment can lead to prosecution and a fine. The BBC's charter review is currently underway, with the aim of setting out the corporation's governance and funding arrangements for the next 11 years. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said that decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table during the charter review. She argued that criminalising those who do not pay the licence fee is outdated and inappropriate, and suggested that civil penalties such as fines should be used instead. The BBC rejected the suggestion, arguing that changing the law could lead to more people evading payment of the licence fee. They said they were already ""well-equipped"" to tackle evasion. The BBC also argued that decriminalisation could create a loophole which would allow some people to avoid paying the licence fee without incurring a penalty.",0,938
"A judge said there was a basis for concluding the officers, known as M and Q, may have perverted the course of justice and committed perjury while giving evidence. Pearse made the comments during a hearing held in relation to an application by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), for permission to investigate the two officers. The investigation relates to their involvement in the case of Sean Rigg, who died in police custody in 2008. The judge said there was evidence which suggested the officers may have lied about their knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Mr Rigg's arrest and the use of force against him. He also noted there were discrepancies between what the officers told the IOPC and what other witnesses had reported. Pearse concluded that the allegations were serious enough to warrant further investigation and that granting the IOPC's request would be appropriate.

The families, who say 24 unarmed villagers were killed by British troops, had asked the court to declare that the government was legally obliged to hold an inquiry. The majority of justices ruled that the families could not use the Human Rights Act to bring a legal challenge against the government, as the events had taken place too long ago. The dissenting justice argued that the government should have had the opportunity to explain why there had been no investigation and why it did not intend to order one. The families are now considering taking their call for an inquiry to Parliament, although the government has so far made no commitment to do so.",0,959
"Four-month-old Ted visits Wales twice a month to see his grandparents in Carmarthenshire and the TV star hopes he will be brought up to be bilingual. He will be heading to Wales twice a month for now, but as he grows older, his visits will likely become more frequent. It is great that Ted is being exposed to the Welsh language and culture from such an early age. Research has found that exposure to a new language before the age of three is key in developing a bilingual ability later on in life. To support Ted's development, there are several things his parents can do. Firstly, they should bring Welsh books and toys with them when they visit Wales so he can get used to hearing the language spoken and seeing it written down. They could also listen to Welsh songs or stories together and find Welsh-language nursery rhymes online or in bookstores. When Ted is old enough to understand, they can introduce him to Welsh TV shows and movies. Ted's parents should also speak Welsh to him when they are visiting Wales and encourage others to do the same. Finally, they could consider enrolling him in Welsh language classes or clubs which will help to build his confidence and understanding of the language. By introducing Ted to Welsh culture and language now, his parents are giving him a head start in developing his bilingual ability. With the right support and encouragement, he can be a proud Welsh speaker in no time!",0,960
"The self-styled Islamic State group said two days ago that Abu-Zakariya al-Britani detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul.

"He crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race - a gesture made by Ethiopia's Oromo people who have suffered brutal police crackdowns. He says he may have been the first athlete to make such a gesture at an international event. The gesture was made by Feyisa Lilesa, an Ethiopian marathoner, at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race in protest of the government's brutal crackdown on the Oromo people, an ethnic group in Ethiopia. The gesture quickly became a symbol of resistance and solidarity among the Oromo people. It was seen around the world and inspired similar protests in other countries. Lilesa has since become an advocate for the Oromo people and has spoken out against human rights abuses in Ethiopia.",0,962

"In the corner of a busy hospital ward, tucked behind a curtain for our arrival, lies Joshua Davies. His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down the ward and you'll notice something different about him. Joshua is one of a growing number of children who have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder. Joshua has had to adjust to a new life since his diagnosis. He's restricted from eating certain foods, has to take medication every day, and often has to go for regular checkups. Despite this, he remains cheerful and resilient, determined to make the best of his situation. His parents are also learning how to cope with the changes that have come with his illness, but they have found solace in knowing that there is support available for them and their son. The hospital team have been an invaluable source of information and advice while Joshua undergoes treatment, and they have been there to provide emotional support too. Joshua is still living with Crohn's disease today, but he no longer lets it define him. He has found his own way of managing his condition, and is making the most of the extra time he now has to explore his interests and passions. His outlook on life is inspiring, and serves as a reminder that even when faced with adversity, it is possible to stay positive and find ways to cope.",0,964

"The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts. The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they added. The adware, which was pre-installed on some Lenovo laptops, was injecting ads into webpages by intercepting traffic between users and websites. This could make it easier for hackers to capture people's personal information, the experts said. Superfish also came with a root certificate that allowed it to read all encrypted traffic passing through the laptop. This meant it could potentially be used to spy on its user. Lenovo has since removed Superfish from its systems and released an automated tool to remove it. But security experts have warned that even after removal, the software could still leave backdoors open for attackers.",0,970

""I'm Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin."" We shook hands and exchanged pleasantries while the other people in the room seemed to be hanging on his every word. I soon realised why - this man had changed the face of money as we know it. He explained the concept of Bitcoin, how it works and how it could revolutionize our economy. It sounded complex and revolutionary, but he made it clear and simple. Everyone in the room was enthralled by his vision. As the meeting ended, I left feeling inspired and energised.

Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk assessment expert Brian Rodgers both attended the inquest.

It was also revealed that there had been several other incidents at the depot in the run up to Mark's death, including two previous fork lift accidents. The coroner found that Hayes Fuels had failed to take appropriate action in response to these incidents and that this failure had contributed to the fatal accident.
