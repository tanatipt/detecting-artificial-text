"Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised Human embryos are typically killed at 14 days, and some researchers are still able to keep them alive longer. But a new study shows that if scientists really want to maintain this restriction, they could keep them alive for up to a year. The study was published in the journal Science, and it is the longest time that any human embryo has survived in a lab, beating the previous record of 15 days that was set in 2009. The new limit is based on the assumption that keeping the embryos alive longer would pose a greater risk of genetic damage. Scientists have been prohibited from keeping human embryos alive in their labs for more than 14 days for the last few decades to avoid ethical issues that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised that might be raised. Now scientists aren't following the rules to the letter, but they are doing so to keep the embryos safe from harm. But the new rule could still have serious consequences for the research that scientists conduct. For one thing, the new restriction is not just aimed at embryos, but at the embryologists who work to create human embryos.
