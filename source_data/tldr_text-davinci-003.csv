"StyleGAN2 is a style-based GAN architecture for data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. It improves on image quality, and it also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is generated or not. StyleGAN2 is a progressive growing GAN (PG-GAN) architecture, which means that the generator and discriminator networks are trained incrementally by adding new layers in each training stage. It also uses a multi-scale structure, where the generator progressively increases its resolution output. This allows for better control over the generation process and results in higher quality images. StyleGAN2 improves on image quality by introducing an adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer, which can be used to inject style information into the generated images. The AdaIN layer is able to take existing features from the training data set and apply them to the generated image, making it more realistic. Additionally, StyleGAN2 uses a noise mixing layer which takes two inputs - one from a fixed noise vector and the other from a variable noise vector - and combines the two to create a more diverse set of images. StyleGAN2 also introduces a feature known as a ""class embedding,"" which enables the model to learn a representation of the data set that can be used to detect if an image is real or fake. This helps to improve the reliability of the generative models.",0,45

Next, you'll need to create a fallback favicon for browsers that don't support SVG. You can do this by creating and saving a 1616 pixel PNG file, then adding a link tag with the rel attribute set to ""icon"" and the href attribute pointing at the PNG file. Finally, you'll need to declare the SVG as the preferred icon by adding a link tag with the rel attribute set to ""prefetch"" and the href attribute pointing at the SVG file. Once you have all of these steps complete, you will have successfully added an SVG favicon to your website. This will give your site a modern look and make it stand out from other websites. Additionally, SVG favicons are more efficient than traditional raster images, meaning they will load faster and use less bandwidth.",0,106

"Nine years after hundreds of thousands of people fled the area, nature has started to reclaim the space around Fukushima in Japan. In recent years, many evacuation orders have lifted , and people are returning home to find their neighborhoods overgrown with foliage. The Fukushima prefecture has seen an explosion of plant growth as a result of the lack of human activity in the area since the disaster. This has resulted in an increase in biodiversity and the return of many species of birds and other wildlife to the area. Local communities have taken advantage of this, creating projects like ""Fukushima Flower Fest"" to promote the natural beauty of the region and encourage tourism. In addition, the government has implemented various measures to help the environment recover. These include replanting trees, removing contaminated soil, and improving sewage systems. Scientists have been monitoring the effects of radiation on the environment, and while there is still evidence of contamination, the level of radiation has decreased significantly.

"A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourban 's artificial tree requires no water or soil and can be used in both urban and rural areas. Biomitech claims that its artificial tree is capable of capturing up to 1,400 grams of pollutants per hour, including carbon dioxide and the fine particles that cause smog. The company has designed the device to provide clean air for an area of 4,000 square meters, making it an ideal solution for cities with high levels of air pollution. The idea behind the artificial tree is to replace trees that are not present in urban areas, or to supplement existing vegetation in areas that do not have sufficient numbers of trees to provide enough air purification. Additionally, the device does not require much maintenance, as it is made from recyclable materials and runs on solar power. The product has already been installed in some cities in Mexico and the company plans to expand to other countries in the near future.

"SpaceX is starting a program to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into rocket fuel. The technology will be important on Mars, as fuel could be made from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. SpaceX is developing a new project to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from Earth's atmosphere and transform it into rocket fuel for use on Mars. The program is part of SpaceX's long-term mission to establish a self-sustaining human presence on the Red Planet. The technology works by using a process called Sabatier Reaction which combines hydrogen and CO2 to produce methane and water. The methane can then be used as rocket fuel, allowing spacecraft to refuel on Mars without having to transport fuel from Earth. SpaceX plans to develop the technology at its Texas test facility and eventually bring it to Mars. In addition to providing a potentially sustainable source of fuel, the technology could also help reduce atmospheric CO2 levels.

"Ten eggs were harvested from the last two remaining northern white rhinoceroses, potentially saving the species from extinction. Neither of the white rhinos can carry a baby to term, so the eggs were harvested and fertilized with sperm from a deceased male white rhino. The embryos are being stored in liquid nitrogen and will be implanted into a surrogate mother when the technology is available. This is an incredible breakthrough for conservationists and could possibly save the species from extinction. The eggs were harvested using a non-invasive procedure that involved collecting follicular fluid from the female rhinos. The embryos were then inseminated using a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This process involves injecting a single sperm directly into the egg, allowing it to fertilize. Once the embryos were successfully created, they were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until scientists can find a way to implant them into a surrogate mother. The hope is that once the technology becomes available, the embryos will be implanted into a surrogate mother of another subspecies, such as a southern white rhino or an eastern black rhino. Doing so would help boost the genetic diversity of the northern white rhino population, while also increasing their numbers. This groundbreaking scientific advancement could be a monumental step forward in the fight to save the northern white rhino from extinction. Conservationists are optimistic that this could be the first successful attempt at using assisted reproductive technology to bring back an endangered species.",0,126

"CSS linear gradients get washed out and muddy in the middle unless steps are taken to avoid the effect. This article teaches developers how to avoid the gray dead zone of linear gradients by using the following steps: 1. Define your gradient stops. A gradient stop is a color that marks the beginning and end points of the gradient. Gradient stops should be defined in percentages to ensure that the gradient looks consistent across different browsers. 2. Use fewer stops. Too many stops can lead to muddy gradients. To avoid this, use fewer stops and spread them further apart. This will help create a smoother effect. 3. Increase the contrast between stops. By increasing the contrast between stops, you can create a more vibrant and visually appealing gradient. 4. Make sure there are no overlapping stops. Overlapping stops can cause unexpected results. To prevent this from happening, make sure all stops are evenly spaced apart. 5. Use a greater range of hues. Utilizing a wide range of hues can help create a more dynamic gradient. 6.

"Scientists can manipulate dreams using an app combined with a sleep-tracking device called Dormio. In a recent study, the researchers inserted certain topics into a person's dreams using the technique. The researchers used the app to play audio recordings at specific times during sleep cycles. The content of the audio would depend on the desired dream topics. For example, if the study was on fear, the audio played might include explosions or other frightening sounds. The sleep-tracking device Dormio is worn overnight by participants in the study. It records brainwaves and other physiological data, which helps scientists determine when the person is entering REM sleep. This is the stage of sleep where most dreaming occurs. When the desired sleep stage is reached, the app plays a cue sound such as a tone or a voice command. This cues the participant that they should begin dreaming about the desired topics.

"This article talks about the experience of a solo developer who decided to offer phone support for a couple of their apps in Japan. As the user base was small, the developer thought it would be a good idea to offer phone support in order to build better relationships with their users. The developer started by offering free phone support for each app, but soon found that providing this was unsustainable. To offset the cost of their phone service, the developer began charging a fee for premium support. This fee was based on the amount of time a user needed help or the complexity of the issue they were experiencing. The developer also found it important to differentiate between ""basic"" and ""premium"" customers. Basic customers received standard support via email or chat while premium customers were given priority access to the phone line. The developer also tracked customer response times and made sure to respond quickly to any issue raised. The experience was a success for the developer. By offering premium support, they were able to build closer relationships with their customers and ensure that their apps were always running smoothly. They also gained valuable knowledge about their users, which enabled them to improve the quality of their products. In addition, the fees earned from their premium support service helped to cover the cost of providing phone support.

"This article follows how a flaw was discovered and exploited in an internal test version of Google Cloud Deployment Manager. The flaw allowed requests to be issued to Google internal services that would normally be inaccessible. The flaw was initially discovered by a security researcher while testing the Google Cloud Deployment Manager (GCDM). GCDM is a service used to manage and deploy applications on Google Cloud Platform. Upon further investigation, the researcher noticed that requests were being allowed to internal Google services, which are normally inaccessible from outside of their network. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or even launch attacks against these internal services. To exploit this flaw, the researcher set up a malicious server that was able to issue requests to the Google internal services. After some testing, the researcher was able to successfully issue requests to the services, allowing them to access data and resources that would normally be inaccessible. Once the researcher had identified the flaw, they reported it to Google who then quickly patched the vulnerability. In response to the incident, Google also implemented additional security measures to prevent similar exploits in the future. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining secure systems, especially when dealing with cloud-based services. It also highlights the need for organizations to regularly monitor their systems for any suspicious activity, as well as have effective processes in place to respond quickly to any issues that arise.",0,210

"Physicists predict that information can be transmitted across two black holes paired via quantum entanglement. If the theory is correct, it might offer clues on how to unite quantum mechanics with general relativity, two of the major theories in physics. The concept of using quantum entanglement to transmit information across black holes is still theoretical and has yet to be tested. In theory, if two black holes are entangled, then any change to one should affect the other instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This could allow for information to be shared between them in a way that is faster than the speed of light, which would violate one of the fundamental laws of physics. However, this type of transmission would be limited by a variety of factors such as the size of the black holes, the strength of the entanglement, and the amount of energy available to make the exchange. If successful, the transmission of information between black holes could provide support for the idea that the universe is built on a quantum foundation and that the classical laws of physics can be unified with the principles of quantum mechanics. It could also open new possibilities for understanding the nature of space-time and how gravity behaves at the quantum level.",0,241

"Jeffrey Berns, CEO of Blockchains LLC, wants the Nevada government to allow companies like his to form local governments on land they own, granting them power over everything from schools to taxes. He believes this form of government could help foster innovation and provide a unique opportunity to create new models of governance. The Nevada state government has yet to take a stance on Berns' proposal. It is likely that the government will be hesitant to grant such power to private entities, given the potential for abuse. Berns' proposal could potentially lead to a situation where individuals or groups are able to create their own laws, regulations, and standards without any oversight from the state. Additionally, some people may view it as a form of corporate welfare, where companies are allowed to avoid paying taxes for services provided by the government. At the same time, local governments are already in place in many parts of the world, such as in the United Kingdom, Canada, and most U.S. states. In these cases, local governments have certain powers delegated to them from the state government. This could be a way to explore a similar model in Nevada, where private entities are granted some autonomy while still being subject to the laws and regulations of the state. Ultimately, the decision rests with the Nevada state government. If they choose to pursue Berns' proposal, they would need to consider the risks and benefits carefully to ensure that it does not pose a threat to democracy or public safety.",0,297

"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System (MADS) is a mobile, hand-held device that produces microwaves of the same frequency used for cooking. The microwaves are emitted in short pulses and cause an intense heating sensation on the skin, which is described as feeling like a ""rubber band snapping"" or a ""stinging nettle."" The intensity of the sensation can be adjusted to cause pain but not injury. The MADS is designed to be used in crowd control situations, to disperse people without causing any physical harm. The MADS works by emitting a microwave beam that penetrates approximately 164th of an inch into the skin. The microwaves heat the top layer of skin, causing an unbearable burning sensation that is difficult to bear. The heat is non-lethal and dissipates quickly once the device is switched off. The MADS has been tested extensively and is considered safe when used properly. The MADS has potential applications in law enforcement, military, and security operations. It could be used to disperse large crowds without causing any lasting physical harm.

"Stay-at-home and social distancing may have played a major role in romance scams reaching record levels in 2020. Total losses were estimated at 304 million. The total dollar losses have decreased significantly since 2018, when they were estimated at over 1 billion. Stay-at-home and social distancing requirements likely have had a major impact on the rise of romance scams in 2020 due to the increased reliance on online dating platforms. With people stuck at home, scammers have had an easier time finding potential victims to target. They use clever tactics to lure their victims into believing that they are forming an emotional connection with them, and then quickly try to exploit them for financial gain. Additionally, the restricted physical contact may have made it easier for scammers to carry out their activities undetected.

"Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans are able to learn and adapt quickly when navigating a new environment. The model enables robots to adjust the way they move in order to traverse an unfamiliar terrain, based on visual input. The technology uses a deep reinforcement learning approach that combines perception with motor control. This allows the robot to develop a ""muscle memory"" of how to react to different obstacles. The robot is trained to interpret visual input and then generate a set of commands to adjust its movement accordingly. The model has been tested on a robotic platform in a variety of terrains and achieved success rates of up to 90.

"CRISPRoff is a new gene-editing technology that can control gene expression while leaving the sequence of the DNA unchanged. Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without altering their underlying sequences. CRISPRoff is based on the CRISPR-Cas system, which uses a type of bacterial immune system to protect against viral infections. In the CRISPR-Cas system, a short RNA molecule binds to a specific sequence of DNA and recruits the Cas9 protein, which then cuts the DNA strand at that particular site. In contrast to the CRISPR-Cas system, CRISPRoff doesn't cut the DNA strand. Instead, it uses a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas system, called dCas9, to recruit transcription factors that can bind to the DNA and inhibit gene expression without making any changes to the underlying sequence. By targeting these transcription factors to specific sites in the genome, scientists can selectively turn off genes without causing any permanent changes to the DNA. This technology has numerous potential applications in both medical and agricultural research. For example, it could be used to create new treatments for genetic diseases, or to develop crops that are more resistant to disease and pests. It could also be used to better understand the role of individual genes in development and disease.",0,343

"This article is an introduction to learning COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL). COBOL is a domain-specific language for business. It excels in managing and manipulating heterogeneous data in record structures, and it is the most widely used language for creating business applications. It is used to create applications that are used in a variety of industries, including banking, finance, insurance, and government. COBOL was first developed by a team of computer scientists in 1959, and since then has been updated to meet the needs of the changing computing world. It is a high-level programming language, which means it is easily readable by humans and it is also structured, which makes it easier to debug. COBOL is designed to be used with data files, which allows data to be stored, retrieved, and manipulated. COBOL is divided into four divisions: the identification division, environment division, data division, and procedure division. The identification division identifies the program and its author, while the environment division sets up the runtime environment. The data division defines the data structures used in the program, while the procedure division contains the code that actually runs the program. In order to use COBOL effectively, one must understand the syntax and structure of the language. COBOL's syntax is relatively simple, but it does have many rules that must be followed for a program to run correctly. For example, each line of code must begin with an indicator that specifies what type of instruction it is, such as READ or WRITE. In addition, all variables must be declared before they can be used in the program. Learning COBOL requires patience and dedication, but it can be a rewarding experience. Once you understand the basics, you'll be able to create complex business applications that can be used in a wide range of industries.",0,345

"Amazon is bringing 25,000 jobs with average salaries of 150,000 to Queens in New York City, but locals are protesting the 1.525 billion (48,000 per job) that Amazon is receiving in subsidies from the state and city. They are concerned that this money could be better spent on infrastructure, housing, and schools, among other things. This is a difficult situation because it involves two competing interests. On the one hand, Amazon's 25,000 jobs would bring much-needed economic activity to Queens and create thousands of high-paying jobs. On the other, the 1.525 billion subsidy is a substantial amount of public money that could be invested in infrastructure and other services that would benefit the local community. It is important to consider the broader implications of this situation when making any decisions. For example, if the city were to invest the funds in infrastructure instead, would the benefits outweigh the costs? How many jobs would be created and what would the salary range be? What type of long-term economic impact would this investment have on the local economy? Ultimately, it is up to the people of Queens to decide how they want to use the funds. It is possible to strike a balance between the pros and cons of Amazon's job creation and the city's public investment. If a compromise is reached, both sides can benefit. For example, Amazon could agree to pay higher wages or provide additional training opportunities for local residents, while the city could commit to investing a portion of the money into infrastructure projects or other initiatives in the local community.",0,360

"A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge has increased the amount of energy extractable from photosynthetic bacteria by over an order of magnitude. Scientists have been trying to harness photosynthetic bacteria such as cyanobacteria to generate energy since the 1970s. These bacteria convert light energy into electrical energy using a process called ""biophotovoltaics,"" however the efficiency of this process had been limited until now. The team of researchers increased the efficiency of the biophotovoltaic process by creating a new kind of semi-conducting material that could be used to augment the existing process. The new material, called a ""bio-hybrid nanostructure,"" is composed of organic and inorganic components that work together to maximize the amount of energy that can be extracted from the bacteria. The research team believes that their new material could eventually lead to the development of more efficient and cost effective biophotovoltaic cells. This would enable the creation of an entirely renewable source of energy that could provide electricity to homes, businesses and even entire cities. Although the technology is still in its infancy, the team is optimistic that their findings will one day revolutionize the way we generate energy.",0,370

"In a project called Mission Shakti, India has successfully tested its Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile, which destroyed a low-orbiting satellite on Wednesday. While it is unknown who the satellite belonged to, India is one of the only four countries in the world, along with the United States, China and Russia, to possess this capability. The test is a major milestone for India's space program, as it makes the country a member of an elite group of nations that have demonstrated their ability to shoot down satellites in orbit. This is also a significant step forward for India's defense capabilities, as the ASAT missile can be used to take out enemy satellites or prevent them from being used for surveillance or intelligence gathering purposes. It is important to note that the test does not violate any international treaties or regulations, since the target satellite was orbiting at a relatively low altitude. However, some experts have expressed concern that the debris created by the destruction of the satellite could have negative long-term effects on other satellites in the same orbit. They are also worried that other countries may now feel the need to develop their own ASAT missiles in order to keep up with India.

"The 61st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the first IMO that has been held remotely and may also be the last time that artificial intelligence doesn't compete. Researchers view the 2020 IMO as a testbed for future AI-driven educational technology. The 2020 IMO was administered to over 6,000 students from 115 countries and featured a total of six problems which were designed and marked by the IMO Committee. Each problem was composed of two questions with supplementary materials providing additional information or guidance to the students. The problems covered topics such as algebra, number theory, geometry, combinatorics, probability and statistics, and graph theory. In addition to the main competition, the 2020 IMO also included multiple ancillary events such as an online seminar series, an international lecture series, and an online exhibition. The virtual format of the event enabled IMO participants from around the world to interact in real time and gain exposure to other countries' mathematical cultures. By enabling students to engage in discussion and collaboration, it is hoped that these activities will aid in developing a global community of mathematicians. Given the success of the 2020 IMO, there has been increased interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) in mathematical competitions. AI can be used to create puzzles and provide solutions to existing problems, allowing students to focus on higher-level problem solving rather than on basic calculations. AI could also help assess student performance, provide feedback on their work, and suggest areas of improvement. As AI becomes more advanced, it could potentially be used to evaluate students' written explanations and offer feedback on their performance. This could lead to a more comprehensive assessment of student progress and help identify areas of strength and weakness. AI could also be used to generate personalized learning pathways for each student, helping them to hone in on their individual strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, AI technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn mathematics. By providing an efficient, accurate assessment system and personalized learning pathways, AI could help students better prepare for future international math competitions and give them the tools they need to succeed.",0,379

"Researchers at MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. Electricity is made up of discrete particles, and it can flow with the viscosity of a liquid in solid materials. In tungsten ditelluride, the electrical current can move in swirling patterns like whirlpools. The researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope to image electrons moving in the material. They found that electrons were moving in circular patterns around defects in the crystal structure. The electron whirlpools were formed when two electrons with opposite spins got close enough together that their wavefunctions overlapped and interfered. This caused them to repel each other and form a vortex-like motion. The researchers believe that the electron whirlpools could have potential applications in electronics and spintronics. By understanding the underlying physics behind these whirlpools, they may be able to use them to create more efficient transistors and memory devices. They also suggest that the whirlpools could be used to transport energy or information between components.",0,394

"A Belgian research group discovered a major security flaw in the keyless entry system of the Tesla Model X. The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer and a cheap radio transmitter, which costs around 40. The attack works by intercepting the signals sent from the car to the key fob when it is used to unlock the doors. The attackers then use the Raspberry Pi to replay those signals, allowing them to open the car without having access to the actual key fob. Tesla has since released a software update to address the security flaw. The update requires owners to enter their unique PIN code each time they use the keyless entry system. This prevents attackers from using the same signal-spoofing technique to gain access to the vehicle. Tesla also recommends that owners keep their key fobs in a Faraday bag when not in use, which will block any malicious radio signals from being received by the key fob.",0,396

"Scientists from Japan have found a species of slug that can self-decapitate and regrow their bodies from their heads. It appears that the slug does this in response to parasites and other environmental threats. The species of slug, named Onchidiopsis japonica, was discovered by researchers from the Graduate School of Science at Kyoto University in Japan. The slugs have an unusual adaptation that allows them to sacrifice their heads in order to survive if they are threatened by parasites or other environmental factors. The detached head then regenerates its body over time. This unique trait is believed to be the result of a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors, which control the expression of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This means that the decapitation and regeneration process can occur multiple times in the same individual, allowing it to survive multiple threats. The discovery of this phenomenon highlights the remarkable adaptability of some species to survive in extreme environments. It also provides insight into the potential for humans to develop similar regenerative abilities.",0,404

"A fossilized dinosaur embryo preparing to hatch from its egg was discovered in southern China. It is one of the best-preserved dinosaur embryos ever found. The embryo's posture was similar to that of a modern bird, suggesting that dinosaurs may have hatched in a similar way. The discovery of the fossilized dinosaur embryo is an exciting one for paleontologists, as it provides new insight into the early development and behavior of dinosaurs. The embryo was embedded in fine-grained sediment and preserved in three dimensions. It revealed details such as the embryo's head, limbs, and tail, which had been partially extended, suggesting that the embryo was preparing to hatch from its egg. The position of the embryo suggests that dinosaurs may have hatched in a similar manner to modern birds, with their heads bent forward and their legs almost fully extended. This implies that some form of parental care may have been involved in dinosaur hatching, similar to what is seen today in many species of birds. The discovery also has implications for other aspects of dinosaur biology, such as their growth rate, metabolism, and feeding habits. The embryo's size implies that the animal would have been relatively mature at the time of hatching, which suggests that dinosaurs grew very quickly during their early stages of life. This discovery provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of dinosaurs, giving us insight into their behavior and biology. It is a reminder that even though they are extinct, we can still learn a great deal about them through careful study of the fossil record.",0,408

"Scientists have determined that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size by pitching them against each other in a competition over preferred burrows. There were two groups of mantis shrimp observed in the study, with one being more aggressive than the other. In the competition, the aggressive group was found to win out a majority of the time. In addition, researchers also noted that mantis shrimp would fight longer and harder when they had access to burrows of ideal size. The study found that the more aggressive shrimp spent more time defending their burrow, while the less aggressive shrimp moved around more and were less likely to hold onto the same burrow for an extended period of time. Overall, the study revealed that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size when they are engaged in competition with each other.

"CSS was never designed to be a server-side language, but that doesn't mean that it can't be used as one. This article walks through how to use CSS as a server-side language in order to create dynamic web pages. First, it's important to note that CSS is not a programming language, but rather a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. This means that it does not have the capability to execute commands, such as looping or if-then statements. However, CSS can still be used to create dynamic websites by taking advantage of its rules-based approach. The most common way to use CSS as a server-side language is with preprocessors. Preprocessors like Sass and Less allow developers to write code snippets that are then compiled into valid CSS. This allows for more complex logic than what is possible in regular CSS, including looping and conditions. Another way to use CSS as a server-side language is to take advantage of the power of the cascade. By using the cascade, developers can define different styles for the same element based on certain conditions, such as device type or user role. This allows them to create dynamic webpages without having to write any additional code. Finally, CSS can also be used to create dynamic websites using JavaScript. By using JavaScript libraries like jQuery and React, developers can write code that manipulates the DOM and applies CSS styles based on certain conditions. This is especially useful for creating interactive features such as drop-down menus and image galleries. By taking advantage of the power of CSS, developers can create dynamic webpages without having to learn a traditional programming language. It's important to keep in mind that CSS is not a programming language, but by using preprocessors and the cascade, it is possible to create dynamic webpages.",0,419

"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies had claimed that neuron creation was limited to early childhood, but this study has overturned this belief. The researchers used a technique called BrdU labeling, in which injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were given to the subjects and then tracked over time. This enabled them to accurately measure the rate of neuron production and the duration of the process. The results showed that new neurons are indeed created throughout adulthood, though at a much slower pace than during childhood. This finding is important for understanding the human brain and could lead to advances in research on neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders. It may also have implications for therapies targeting neurogenesis, such as those that use stem cells. Additionally, it could help scientists understand why some brains stay healthy and functioning into old age while others start to show cognitive decline earlier. Overall, this study provides an important new insight into the complexity of the human brain and how it develops throughout life. It overturns existing beliefs about neuron formation and highlights the importance of using accurate techniques when studying the brain.",0,421

"As COVID-19 grabs the attention of the world, the war against antibiotic-resistant bacteria wages on. The number of people dying from bacterial infections could grow from 700,000 annually last year to 10 million by 2050, according to the World Health Organization. The rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria has been attributed to the overuse of antibiotics, which occurs when people take antibiotics for illnesses caused by viruses, or when they are prescribed antibiotics for infections that do not require them. In addition, bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics when they are exposed to low doses over a long period of time. In order to combat this growing threat, governments and healthcare organizations have begun to implement strategies to reduce the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. These strategies include raising public awareness about the dangers of taking antibiotics when they are not needed and educating healthcare providers on the appropriate uses of antibiotics. Additionally, research is ongoing to develop new and innovative ways to treat bacterial infections without relying on traditional antibiotics. This includes the use of bacteriophages, which are naturally occurring viruses that attack bacteria, as well as other treatments such as antibodies and probiotics.

"Companies such as Facebook and Google may soon be forced to inform customers individually on how much profit they gain from customer data. The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Corporate Accountability Act of 2019, or the DASHBOARD Act, is a bill that would require public companies to disclose information about their data usage and the profits they make from it. The DASHBOARD Act was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. The act requires publicly traded companies with over 1 billion in annual revenue to provide individualized reports to customers regarding how their data is used and how much money they are making from it. The reports must be provided on a regular basis and should include an explanation of the data collected, what services the data is used for, and the estimated value of the data. The bill also requires companies to provide customers with the ability to opt out of their data being used in certain ways, as well as the right to delete their data altogether. Additionally, companies must offer customers the ability to access their own data and have the option to transfer it to other services.

"This article follows a software engineering student's attempt at training a more efficient version of the 124M parameter version of GPT-2. The resulting model didn't perform as well as GPT-2. A software engineering student recently attempted to train a more efficient version of the 124M parameter version of GPT-2. The goal was to come up with a model that would perform better than GPT-2 while having fewer parameters. The student's method involved distilling the knowledge learned by the original GPT-2 model into a smaller, more efficient model. For this task, the student implemented a knowledge distillation approach based on the paper ""Distilling Task-Specific Knowledge from BERT into Simple Neural Networks"" (Clark et al., 2019). First, the student trained a larger model using the same GPT-2 architecture and hyperparameters as before. Then, the student used the distilled model to generate a new set of weights for a much smaller model. This smaller model had only 8M parameters compared to 124M in the original GPT-2 model. Although the resulting model had fewer parameters, it did not perform as well as GPT-2. The student hypothesized that this was due to the fact that the distilled model did not have access to enough information from the original GPT-2 model. As a result, the student concluded that a more thorough exploration of different methods of distillation is necessary in order to successfully train a smaller, more efficient version of GPT-2.",0,514

"Scientists have created a vaccine for cat allergies that trains the immune systems of cats, instead of desensitizing the immune system of people allergic to cats. Hypocat trains the cat's immune system to stop producing Fel d 1, a protein that causes allergic reactions. The vaccine works by injecting the cat with a modified version of the Fel d 1 protein, which is then recognized by the cat's immune system as a potential threat. The cat's body then produces antibodies to fight off the perceived threat, and in doing so, builds up immunity to Fel d 1. As a result, the cat no longer produces the allergen, meaning that people who are allergic to cats can be around the vaccinated animal without experiencing any symptoms. Though the Hypocat vaccine is still in its early stages, it has shown promise in initial clinical trials and could provide a much-needed solution for people who suffer from cat allergies.",0,526

"The Planetary Society, an organization founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, is sending a small spacecraft to orbit the planet. Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite is designed to demonstrate the potential of solar sailing, a form of space travel that uses the momentum of photons from the Sun to propel spacecrafts. The LightSail 2 will be launched in late 2019 aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Once it reaches orbit, the satellite will deploy its four triangular mylar sails, which measure 32 square meters (344 square feet). When the sails are deployed, the spacecraft will be pushed along by the pressure of light particles, or photons, bouncing off its sails. The spacecraft will orbit Earth for several months and then attempt to raise its altitude using solar radiation pressure. If this experiment is successful, it could pave the way for future missions that use solar sailing as a primary means of propulsion. Solar sailing has been proposed as a way to explore beyond our solar system, since it does not require fuel like conventional rockets. It is also a much more efficient way to explore the outer planets in our own solar system, since it would take much less time to reach distant destinations.",0,548

The species was named Cymbospondylus youngorum in honour of Dr. Robert Young, a curator of paleontology at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas who first recognized its importance. Cymbospondylus youngorum had a large size for an ichthyosaur, reaching up to 6 meters (20 feet) in length. Its body was long and slender with a powerful tail fin. It also had a pair of paddle-like limbs at the front which were used for steering and propulsion. The mouth of Cymbospondylus youngorum was filled with sharp teeth, suggesting it fed on fish and other small marine animals. It also had eyes that allowed it to see in low light conditions. The most remarkable feature of this ichthyosaur was its ability to stay submerged for long periods of time, possibly due to its large lungs and streamlined body. This giant ichthyosaur provides us with an exciting window into the past, allowing us to understand the ecology of the early oceans and the dynamic evolution of life on Earth.",0,562

"A new finding suggests that the Ebola viruses behind a new outbreak in Guinea may have originated from a survivor who carried the virus for at least five years. The World Health Organization (WHO) said that genetic sequencing of the viruses showed they were similar to those seen in an outbreak in the same area five years ago. The recent outbreak in Guinea was first reported in February 2021 and has killed at least 80 people as of April 2021. The WHO said it is possible that the virus may have been carried by a survivor from the previous outbreak, which killed more than 11,000 people across West Africa between 2014 and 2016. The new finding underscores the importance of monitoring the health of survivors and providing them with necessary medical care.

"The same CSS code can sometimes output different and unexpected results. CSS is a complex system and subtle differences can change how properties behave. This article looks at layout algorithms , inheritance and the cascade, specificity, and browser compatibility as some of the most common causes of unexpected results. Layout algorithms: CSS uses a variety of layout algorithms to determine how elements are positioned on the page. Different elements can be laid out in different ways, and understanding these differences can help you debug unexpected behavior. Inheritance and the cascade: CSS is designed to be inherited by child elements from their parent. This means that if a property is set on the parent, it will be applied to all its children unless it is overwritten with a more specific selector. This can be confusing, so it's important to understand the cascade and how it affects your code. Specificity: The order of selectors and properties can also cause unexpected results. When two selectors conflict, the one with higher specificity (the more specific selector) will always take precedence. It's important to pay attention to the specificity of your selectors, otherwise you may end up with unexpected results. Browser Compatibility: Different browsers interpret CSS differently, so it's important to test your code across multiple browsers to ensure compatibility. If you're seeing unexpected results, it may be due to a browser-specific issue. It's also important to make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of each browser.",0,584
"Researchers at MIT have created a rechargeable lithium-ion battery in the form of a 460-foot-long fiber. The batteries can be manufactured to arbitrarily long lengths. They can be 3D-printed into any shape, and are only about three times thicker than a human hair. The battery is made up of an anode and a cathode, with a solid electrolyte in between. This combination allows the lithium ions to move back and forth between the anode and the cathode as the battery is charged and discharged. The fibers can withstand temperatures of up to 250 degrees Celsius (482 degrees Fahrenheit). Because they are so thin and lightweight, these batteries could be used in many applications, such as powering medical implants, wearable electronics, or even robots. They could also be woven into fabrics to provide power for smart clothing. The researchers believe that the batteries could be a potential alternative to traditional batteries due to their flexibility and small size.",0,585

"Tardigrades are microscopic extremophiles that can survive exposure to intense temperatures, pressures, and even the vacuum of space. A group of scientists recently recorded high-speed videos of the animals traversing the surface of an axe blade. The videos, filmed at 20,000 frames per second and slowed down to reveal their movements, show the tardigrades slowly climbing up the edge of the blade, using their four stubby legs to grip the metal surface and pull themselves up. The footage also shows the animals rotating their bodies in order to move from one part of the blade to another. The tardigrades' movements are surprisingly graceful for such tiny creatures. The footage reveals some interesting details about the tardigrades' physiology. For example, the scientists noticed that the animals were able to adhere to the metal surface with just the suction cups on their feet, which suggests that they may use a combination of suction and surface tension to move around. The videos also showed that the tardigrades can change direction quickly and easily by simply shifting their body weight. The researchers hope that further study of these videos will help us better understand how tardigrades survive in extreme environments and even in outer space.",0,592

"Iberospinus natarioi, a newly identified 8-meter-long predatory dinosaur, represents a new genus and species of spinosaurid, a group that includes the Spinosaurus. An analysis of the spinosaurid's jaws found that it had a unique tooth arrangement, suggesting that this new species may have been adapted to feed on different prey than its relatives. The fossilized remains of I. natarioi were found in the Early Cretaceous deposits of Spain's Ainsa Basin and date back approximately 125 million years. I. natarioi is the first spinosaurid dinosaur to be discovered in Europe, and the fifth globally. Its skull and lower jaw were well-preserved, allowing researchers to analyze features such as the number, size, shape, and orientation of teeth, which can tell us about how the animal fed. Analysis of I. natarioi's jaws revealed that it possessed a unique arrangement of its teeth, consisting of two rows of large, curved teeth along its upper jaw, and one row of smaller, more pointed teeth along its lower jaw. This tooth arrangement provides evidence that I. natarioi may have been adapted to feed on different types of prey than its relatives, such as fish, aquatic reptiles, and even small dinosaurs. The discovery of I. natarioi provides insight into the evolution of spinosaurids, and suggests that these predators may have had a more diverse diet than previously thought. The fossil remains of I. natarioi shed light on the evolutionary history of this group and provide an important window into understanding the ecology of predatory dinosaurs during the Early Cretaceous period.",0,595

"Scientists from the University of California San Diego have developed a method to create neurons. The technique is able to convert astrocytes, the supporting cells in the brain, into neurons, and could potentially be used to develop new treatments for neurological diseases. The method relies on reprogramming astrocytes, which are cells that provide physical and metabolic support to neurons, into functional neurons. The technique involves introducing certain proteins into the astrocytes, which causes them to become neurons. The team tested the technique in mouse models, and showed that the newly created neurons were able to form connections with other neurons and respond to stimuli. In addition, the converted neurons were stable and could survive long term. This research provides a potential new approach to treating neurological diseases. By creating new neurons from existing astrocytes, doctors may be able to replace lost or damaged neurons and restore neuronal networks in patients suffering from neurological conditions.

"SVGs have become popular due to their scalability, flexibility, and how lightweight they are. This article takes a look at SVG techniques such as SVG grids, fractional SVG stars, masks, and more. SVG Grids Grids are a great way to structure and organize SVG elements. They provide a base for accurately positioning elements and help create a consistent layout across all devices. Grids can also be used to define a specific area of the document, which can be useful for creating responsive designs. Fractional SVG Stars Fractional SVG stars provide an easy way to create interesting illustrations with just a few lines of code. By using a combination of circles, arcs, and lines, you can create stunning stars of any size or shape. You can even adjust the number of points on the star to create different effects. Masks Masks are an important tool for creating complex effects in SVG documents. A mask is essentially a layer that covers up part of an element or image, allowing the designer to create unique shapes and textures. For example, masks can be used to create the illusion of transparency in certain areas of an SVG document. Filters Filters allow designers to manipulate the properties of a graphic in order to achieve a desired effect. Filters can be used to add blur, contrast, brightness, grayscale, and other effects to an SVG document. They are especially useful when combined with masks, as they can be used to selectively apply effects to certain parts of the document. Animations Animations are a great way to make SVG documents come alive. Animations can be used to animate individual elements or entire scenes. By using a combination of keyframes, transformations, and easing functions, designers can create smooth and realistic animations.",0,623

"Scientists have observed electrical activity similar to the brain activity of premature babies in lab-grown brains. The lab-grown brains are simplified versions of the organ that is grown in a laboratory using a combination of human cells and artificial molecules. The brains are grown in a petri dish and consist of two different types of brain tissue. The lab-grown brains have been observed to generate electrical activity similar to that of premature babies, although the activity is much simpler due to the lack of complexity in the lab-grown brain. This activity has been observed in response to stimuli such as light, sound, and touch. Scientists believe that this discovery could help them better understand how the developing brain works, as well as provide insights into treatments for neurological conditions that affect premature babies.",0,629
A quantum effect called superabsorption allows a collection of molecules to absorb light more efficiently than if each molecule were acting individually.

"Learn how OAuth is actually used in the real world. We cover topics like the eight common OAuth modes, how to use the Authorization Code grant, and why you should never use the Implicit grant. The eight common OAuth modes are Authorization Code, Implicit, Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password Credentials, SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Profile, JWT Bearer Token Profile, Device Flow and Refresh Token. Authorization Code grant is used for user-initiated logins. It includes a server-side application that exchanges an authorization code with the client application for an access token. This grant type is widely used by web and mobile applications as it provides secure access to the protected resource. Implicit grant should never be used as it does not provide enough security. It is used for browser-based applications and works by sending an access token directly to the client in the URL fragment. This means that anyone who has access to the URL can get the access token, which leads to a huge security vulnerability. Client Credentials grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication where no user interaction is necessary. It requires the client to send its credentials (client ID and secret) to the authorization server in exchange for an access token. Resource Owner Password Credentials grant is used when the user provides their username and password directly to the client application. This grant type is not recommended since it poses a security risk. SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Profile is used for single sign-on (SSO) solutions. It allows a user to authenticate once and then access multiple applications without having to sign in again. JWT Bearer Token Profile is used for delegating access to a third-party service or API. It allows a user to authorize a client application on their behalf so that the application can access resources without them having to provide their credentials. Device Flow is used for authentication in scenarios where there is no browser or any other interactive device available. It requires the user to use a separate device to approve the login request. Refresh Token is used to obtain a new access token after the existing one has expired. It is used to extend the lifetime of an access token beyond its initial expiration date.",0,631

"Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond s are known as the hardest natural material and are used in a variety of products from jewelry to cutting tools. The researchers found that when they exposed a hydrocarbon substance called benzene to pressures up to 1.5 million times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, and temperatures between 300 and 500 degrees Celsius, it transformed into diamond-like nanocrystals. These diamond-like crystals were similar in size and shape to what is seen in synthetic diamonds grown in a lab. The researchers believe this new method could be used to produce diamonds from low-cost sources like coal or petroleum. The method could also replace current diamond synthesis methods which use high temperatures and expensive catalysts. Using this new method, the scientists estimate that diamonds could potentially be produced at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.",0,635

"A study has demonstrated how the sight or smell of a meal can trigger an inflammatory response that guides insulin production. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), was published in the journal Cell Metabolism. The research team found that when mice were exposed to either the sight or smell of a meal, their bodies produced inflammatory signals that triggered the release of insulin from pancreatic cells. This response helped regulate the animals' blood sugar levels following the meal, preventing it from becoming too high. To make this discovery, the researchers used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing, which allowed them to map the activity of different cells in the pancreas and observe how they responded to the presence of food. The team's findings suggest that the body's ability to regulate blood sugar by releasing insulin is not just a reaction to the digestion of food, but is also regulated by the senses. This could lead to new treatments for diabetes, as well as other diseases where insulin regulation is disrupted.",0,639
"The way a river flows, where the path splits up and breaks into smaller channels like the branches of a tree, is called branching flow. It has been observed in many rivers and streams, and occurs when a river is flowing over an uneven surface. As the water flows, it encounters different levels of resistance as it travels, causing it to split up into smaller channels and create branching patterns. This type of flow can be beneficial for erosion control and habitat creation.",0,640
"Future Meat Technologies announced its industrial cultured meat production facility on June 23. The factory, based in Israel, is capable of producing up to 1,100lbs of lab-grown meat every day. The facility is the first of its kind in the world and will enable the company to bring cultured meat to market sooner. The facility will use a proprietary production process that combines cell-based technology with fermentation and bioreactor engineering, enabling the industrial-scale production of high-quality, sustainable meat.

"This article follows the story of Kayode, an A-grade student that was studying at one of the country's most elite educational institutions who turned to cybercrime during the pandemic. The article dives into the reasons why he chose to turn to cybercrime, his methods and the consequences of his actions. Kayode was a bright and ambitious student who had earned himself an A-grade at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. However, due to the pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis, Kayode found himself without a job or stable income. Desperate for money, he turned to cybercrime to make ends meet. He used his computer skills to create malicious software and phishing attacks that targeted vulnerable online websites and services. He stole passwords and personal information from unsuspecting victims and sold them on the dark web for profit. Kayode's activities soon caught the attention of law enforcement and he was arrested and charged with numerous counts of cybercrime. He was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay reparations to the victims of his crimes. The consequences of Kayode's actions have been far-reaching, causing him to lose his reputation, respect and educational opportunities.

"It can be difficult for adults to learn other languages even after years of exposure. In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and improve the ability to recognize and acquire a new language. The vagus nerve is a long nerve that runs from the brainstem to the abdomen, and it plays an important role in regulating many processes in the body such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion. Stimulating the vagus nerve can have a positive effect on cognitive abilities, including language learning, by activating areas of the brain involved in language processing. In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to increase neural activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with higher-order thinking and language processing. In addition, it has been found to activate the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation and recall. This suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve may be effective in improving language recognition and acquisition in adults. In humans, a small study conducted in 2014 showed that vagus nerve stimulation improved language learning in adult patients suffering from epilepsy. The results of this study suggest that vagus nerve stimulation may have potential as a therapy for language learning difficulties. However, further research is needed to better understand its effects on language learning in healthy adults.",0,662

"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology is powerful and can be used to solve complex problems, we do not always know what is happening under the hood. This can cause a lot of anxiety and confusion, especially when it comes to decisions that have real-world consequences. To combat this issue, transparency and accountability must be built into the design and development of AI systems. This means that there needs to be a way for people to see how and why the algorithm is making decisions, as well as a way for people to challenge the decision if they feel it is wrong or unfair. Additionally, organizations should create ethical guidelines to ensure that their AI algorithms are designed with fairness and equity in mind.",0,716

"Over the last two years, researchers have rewritten nearly every major chapter in our galaxy's history due to working with better data. In 2018, the European spacecraft Gaia released a 3D map of our Milky Way, which allowed researchers to measure the exact distances between stars and solar systems. This provided more accurate information about galaxy formation and the arrangement of stars within our own galaxy. In 2019, scientists used this data to show that our Milky Way is actually warped in a ""S"" shape, rather than the traditional disc shape. This finding was further supported by the observation of two new stellar streams, or clusters of stars, which were formed when smaller galaxies collided and merged with the Milky Way's disk billions of years ago. Additionally, in 2020, researchers used Gaia's data to discover an unexpected link between the large-scale structure of the Milky Way and the motions of stars near its center. This showed that the Milky Way's disk is not just warped, but also rotating faster in some places than in others. This discovery has implications for how our galaxy evolved over time, and could help explain why it looks the way it does today.",0,729

"This thread discusses projects that were developed but never became profitable. While we hear a lot about successful ventures, there is still a lot to learn from completed, yet unsuccessful, projects. Many of these projects fell short due to a lack of proper planning, poor execution, or simply bad timing. However, there are often lessons to be learned from the failure of a project and understanding why it failed can help to inform future endeavors. One example of an unsuccessful project is Google Glass. Google had high hopes for this wearable technology when it was released in 2013, but due to its high cost and privacy-violating features, it failed commercially. The company failed to anticipate user concerns and didn't adequately address them prior to launch. This serves as an important reminder that before launching any product or service, companies must consider customer needs and feedback. Another example of a failed project is Apple's AirPower wireless charging mat. After several years of development, the product was finally cancelled due to technical issues. It is believed that the batteries and coils used were too large and the product was unable to charge multiple devices simultaneously. This serves as a reminder that products must be tested thoroughly before launch and any potential problems must be identified and addressed in order to ensure success. Finally, an example of a failed project is Foursquare. Originally launched as a location-based social networking app, Foursquare failed to take off due to the emergence of more successful apps such as Instagram and Snapchat. This serves as an important reminder that companies must stay ahead of the curve in terms of trends and competition if they wish to remain relevant and competitive in their market. Overall, all of these examples illustrate the importance of careful planning and execution for any project. Understanding the possible pitfalls and being proactive about addressing customer needs is key to ensuring success.",0,740
