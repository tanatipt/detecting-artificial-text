The boats require virtually no maintenance and can Whether you're out for a leisurely paddle or a serious expedition, an electric boat could be the future of water travel. Zin Boats creates electric boats that can go a hundred miles or more and recharge using an ordinary wall plug. The boats require virtually no maintenance and can be easily repaired at any port.

The company began developing the ZINC electric boat prototype in 2012 and has since received 100,000 in grants to develop the boat. The 275-pound ZINC can go a range of more than 100 miles on a single charge and can be recharged using an ordinary wall outlet.

SpaceX says the failure happened while SN3 was undergoing the same cryptogenic proof test that killed the previous two Starship prototypes. The test involved filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to pressures of up to 14.7 pounds per square inch to simulate the loads that will be placed on the vehicle during a mission as part of SpaceX's efforts to develop deep space capability.

It would mean that a single patient could be the origin of multiple outbreaks, a scenario called ""imported"" Ebola. The survivor who contracted Ebola in 1976 in northern Nigeria may have been infected with the same strain of Ebola that is spreading in Guinea today, the study's authors wrote. In 1976, a Liberian man died from the disease, and health officials believe the virus he contracted was the same strain that is now causing an outbreak in Guinea. Researchers believe the survivor's infection could have mutated into a form that is transmissible to others. Until now, the only evidence of survivor infection was a single case in eastern Congo. Researchers isolated Ebola viruses from blood samples taken from two patients during the current outbreak. They",0,582

Diamond Researchers have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. (CNN) Scientists have found a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. The compound, called C60, is found in coal and natural gas, but it is not a good material for making diamonds. Scientists at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform it into diamonds. ""This is an important step towards turning carbon into diamonds in an environmentally benign way,"" said Michael Kostyuk, professor of chemistry at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper on the discovery.

In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and Adults learn languages best by hearing, speaking and seeing them repeatedly. (CNN) It can be difficult for adults to learn other languages even after years of exposure. Adults process information differently than infants and children. In animal studies, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult sensory-perceptual systems and make them more responsive to the stimulus. But the same technique could be useful for adults. Research suggests that vagus nerve stimulation can help prime adult auditory, visual and tactile systems to process new information. This might help adults learn new languages. Other studies suggest that stimulation of the vagus nerve can improve memory in older adults. Researchers at New York University School of Medicine are exploring the possibility of using vagus nerve stimulation to improve language learning in adults. The study, funded by the National Institute on Aging, will look at whether vagus nerve stimulation can improve memory of words in a foreign language.

"Apple has been criticized for placing its own apps at the top of the App Store search results. While Apple denies the accusations, an analysis of search terms showed that Apple's App Store has come under renewed scrutiny over the way it ranks apps for users. The company has come under fire for allegedly manipulating search results so that its own apps show up more frequently. Analysts at the New York University's Stern School of Business analyzed data from the store for the period between September 2010 and May 2014 to determine whether Apple was indeed using its own apps more frequently than others. The group found that apps from Apple's ""tied developers"" occupied 19 of the top 20 spots in search results for certain popular terms, while apps from competitors occupied just 6 of the top spots. In some cases, Apple-tied apps were ranked above non-Apple-tied apps by more than double. For example, iMovie was ranked above Adobe's Creative Suite by nearly 50 of the time. Google's Android Market, which has more than 500 million apps, ranks Apple's apps more heavily than those of its competitors. The New York Times points out that Apple has been accused of manipulating search results before. In 2011, the company was accused of using domination to promote its own music streaming service, Beats Music, when it was still a competitor.",0,747

"Matt Dupree recently wrapped up a job search after around 65 days. During that time, Dupree applied for 16 jobs, attended seven interviews, and received two offers. Many companies required A recent survey by CareerBuilder.com found that 47 of job seekers use social media to network during the hiring process. That number seems high, but recent stats show that social media usage doesn't always translate into full-time employment. An article in the Houston Chronicle recently highlighted the results of a survey of 24,000 job seekers who found that 33 of job seekers admitted to using social media during the hiring process. That number may seem high, but the article also revealed a surprising truth: Many job seekers are using social media to network while they look for work. The survey found that 47 of job seekers use social media to network during the hiring process, and 33 do so only after receiving a job offer. That doesn't mean social media isn't proving to be a useful tool during the job search. In fact, the survey found that 51 of people who use Twitter during the hiring process find it helpful. However, the numbers are not surprising when you consider that the average length of a job search is 65 days.

"South Korea will soon see a drop in their military personnel due to a decline in birth rate and recent laws that make it easier to avoid mandatory national service. With the US and China beefing up their military presence in Asia, there's a new threat in the region a shrinking force of South Korean soldiers. South Korea's military is expected to shrink by 8,000 to 10,000 over the next decade, according to the Korea Institute for National Unification. The drop is due to a decline in birth rate and recent laws that make it easier to avoid mandatory national service.

""As an island nation, it's important for us to have a strong military at our disposal, but we're also facing the challenge of a rapidly aging population,"" Lee said. In 2008, South Korea's military had 1.3 million personnel, but is now expected to shrink to 850,000 by 2025.

This article features two chapters from the book that covers the startup's search for a mascot and the early days of Android. The following is an edited version of those chapters. The book starts in November 2001 with the hiring of Andy Rubin to lead Android. Rubin's hire was a bit of a surprise, considering that Google had not worked with a software engineer before. Rubin spent just a month on the job before being promoted to manager of Android. The new hire's first job was to figure out a way to make it easy to transfer data between Android and the iPhone. ""It was a pretty big deal for us,"" writes Pichai. ""It was a mascot, but it was also going to be a way to get data between the two devices.""
