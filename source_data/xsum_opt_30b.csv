"This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, dominated as it is with hard-line nationalists and anti-Rohingya activists including former leaders of Myanmar's military junta - shows how little has changed since Aung San Suu Kyi took office in 2016 promising to address discrimination against minorities. The UK government should engage more assertively than before in its efforts to end ethnic cleansing at home and abroad among Muslims in BurmaMyanmar (as many people prefer). The plight of the Rohingya is a symptom that goes back decades: British participation can make a difference if we act now or risk another tragedy like Srebrenica happening again elsewhere in modern Europe.",0,0
"Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related items were sold on Facebook Marketplace - a platform to buy and sell goods with more than 300m active monthly users worldwide (pdf) - for as little as 1 each. In one case cited by Gun Violence Archive researchers, an item was listed online under ""car parts"" but contained three AK-47s shipped from California, Florida and Texas; another listing had two rifles labeled as speaker cables: an AR-15 assault rifle and SKS semi-automatic hunting rifle packed together inside what appeared to be plain cardboard boxes. Others included pistols hidden within books of matches, and handguns shrunk down into bottles of shampoo. In addition to these listings, other sellers offered gun training services via social media platforms such as Instagram Live, where they would charge anywhere between 50-100 per session depending which firearm type is being trained upon. Instagram has not responded to requests for comment about this service or whether it plans to take any action against those offering similar classes on its platform. The sale of illegal weapons also extends beyond private sales through sites like Craigslist, Armslist and Letgo, the study went on to show. One seller advertises his wares under the title ""guns,"" while others use terms including ""firearms."" Some even include phrases meaning shooting accessories when describing their offerings, yet investigators say there's no way of knowing if these products are truly legal because none of the posts provided details regarding whether the guns have been registered, transferred properly or licensed. Under US law, only certain professionals can legally make and advertise purchases or transfers of new long arms - and among rules surrounding registration requirements, every weapon must include information identifying the buyer so he or she will eventually get traced back should something go wrong. But buyers who purchase off illicit websites don't know whether their prospective dealer got all proper licensing documents required before making any deal - nor do authorities. Tracker systems used nationally across America to track stolen and lost property aren't able to identify pieces adapted into illegal uses without first having serial numbers filed off. Even then, smugglers simply file paperwork indicating ownership using fake names at pawn shops owned by friends and family members. A spokesperson for US Customs Border Protection told Motherboard it did pursue cases involving small caliber machine guns imported illegally, adding that CBP investigates most complaints received concerning suspected violations relating to imports arriving in the country. He declined however to provide further specifics saying records were confidential.",0,1

"Apple Music performed a U-turn over payment policy a day after the pop star threatened to prevent the US firm from streaming her album 1989. Swift had argued that Apple could not offer both free downloads and paid streams of songs included in its iTunes Match service without paying artists compensation for each play, but on Wednesday it said all music would cost 99 cents with no limits placed on how many times they were played. The row has underlined the growing power wielded by musicians as their audience expands into areas such as mobile devices where users are less likely than ever before pay any attention to royalties issues. The dispute also comes at an awkward time because tech giants including Amazon, Google and Facebook have moved into media content production or distribution - which some believe will diminish revenue generated through artist's work.",0,4

They are pictured above enjoying drinks on Friday evening A photo taken shortly afterwards shows them arriving back onto shore still holding hands following the horrific accident - which took place around 2pm local time (1am BST) yesterday afternoon. They later arrived home safely via ambulance after undergoing treatment. Their injuries have not yet been confirmed or disclosed further apart from one photograph showing some cuts on both men's bodies. Their family thanked well-wishers this morning, writing on Twitter: 'We can confirm there were terrible accidents involving our son nephew while vacationing overseas'. Pictured right: Brothers Cody and Ethan on Thursday night outside a restaurant in Sofia city center Cody also shared a photograph of himself touching down in New York City late last week ahead of flying over to Europe with him sat next to him during the journey Speaking exclusively to MailOnline yesterday, Mrs Jones described how medics worked frantically to save both her sons even though each of them suffered significant injury. She revealed doctors believe Ethan fractures his tibia and fibula bones because blood loss led to internal damage including bleeding inside his knees. The head doctor called surgery on his knee'successful', saying it may take several days to remove bone fragments due to swelling caused by sepsis. He will need plastic reconstructive surgery once treated properly for infection. Doctors do not expect the full recovery process to be completed until August 4th, meaning he faces missing most if not all of July 4 celebrations in America. However, scans showed no breaks occurred elsewhere other than those already known. Medics say his wounds look worse now as tissue dies resulting in more bruising and discoloured flesh. A scan of Eathan revealed small bleeds internally across multiple organs indicating possible internal organ trauma consistent with shallow chest compression especially considering initial reports of abdominal pain. It means he likely endured shock waves similar to a car crash victim's spinal fracture. One report claimed Ethan broke four ribs during impact causing acute pulmonary edema, commonly associated with drowning victims suffering lung failure. But doctors refuted claims stating X-ray results show only three rib fractures, adding the patient did not suffer any additional puncture wounds nor bruises although such conditions cannot always be identified without autopsy confirmation prior to hospital discharge. Officials would not comment whether either man experienced narcosis due to oxygen deprivation given corpses undergo rigor mortis within minutes giving little chance of accurate assessment post resuscitation unless specifically requested by family members citing particular concerns regarding secondary crush injuries against the torso being experienced primarily upon impact. Both remain sedated under heavy doses of general anaesthetic throughout day five to help prevent body movement potentially interfering with medical procedures requiring close access to soft tissues beneath skin surface.

"Liverpool-bound striker Dominic Solanke picked up Lewis Cook's pass to score the winner shortly after the interval. England played the last 17 minutes with 10 men after Josh Onomah was sent off for a second bookable offence but they were able to see out their first victory of 2018 to remain in contention at third place, four points behind leaders Chelsea and three adrift of Liverpool who visit runaway champions Manchester City on Thursday (16:00 GMT). Solanke has been impressing during his loan spell with Vitesse Arnhem this season - he scored five goals in 14 appearances before heading back across the Channel to complete his move from Anfield amid speculation linking him with Bournemouth, Swansea and West Bromwich Albion. The 20 year old found it tough going initially as his side succumbed to an early goal by Ruben Loftus-Cheek following Jake Clarke-Salter's mistake, although that proved to be the only shot on target either team mustered until late in each half when both sides had efforts correctly ruled out for infringements inside the box. But just as fatigue seemed to set in among some of those involved here, especially given there is another midweek match next week against Rotherham United in the FA Cup fourth round, Solanke popped up close to the edge of the area with 13 minutes remaining. He latched onto Tom Cairney's ball over the top then rounded goalkeeper Angus Gunn before sliding into an empty net. It was far tougher than expected thereafter with Tottenham increasingly dominant without ever looking particularly threatening themselves, leading Toon boss Rafael Benitez to turn to Jonjo Shelvey and Mohamed Diame off the bench while Mikel Merino took a rare start ahead of Ki Sung-yueng as Spurs continued without Jan Vertonghen or Harry Kane due to injury.

"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the figure was up from 7.6 in the year to February. Separate figures showed the amount of money borrowed for home loans in April hit 2bn - far less than economists had expected, as lenders were put off by a slump in house prices at the start of lockdown measures which sent sales plunging and made it harder to get mortgages approved ""This is an enormously important set of numbers: stamp duty receipts are worth more per month than departmental spending on higher education,"" Robert Chote, head of the ONS's fiscal impact team, told reporters. ""We have never seen anything like this."" But he added that while the level remained high relative to normal times they would shrink further before recovering later in the financial year because there will be fewer transactions over time after buyers rush through deals during the current three-month period when all property purchases remain exempt from stamp duty. The government has also temporarily lifted borrowing rules so companies can raise extra funding easily if needed but warned banks against trying to take advantage amid fears some may not need support despite slumping into the red recently due to lower profits or rising provisions for loan losses caused by Covid-19 disruption.",0,42

"The 35-year-old schoolteacher told the court that her digestive system sometimes converts food into alcohol. After her arrest, her doctor conducted tests that found that high levels of yeast in her body were causing ethanol to be produced when she ate carbohydrates like bread and pasta.

"The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants ""public good"" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like any other scientific advance, such as antibiotics or new vaccines. But it is opposed by many consumer groups who say that because GM food has not been properly tested there are no guarantees about its safety. But CST chairman Sir John Beddington said: ""Infectious diseases kill millions of people a year; heart disease kills more than one million every week."" A third of deaths worldwide were now caused by known human pathogens, he added. He told BBC News Online: GM] technology could make major contributions towards combating these illnesses through gene therapy techniques which might enable us to overcome genetic defects that predispose patients to infection with viruses prevalent in developing countries, where so much of this type of research takes place at present. And we have great hopes that some day you will find drugs against HIVAids...that would protect children from being infected when they're born."" The government's chief scientist Professor Ian Pearson also thinks it possible that genes taken out of animals' DNA may help produce medicines tailored specifically to individual needs. Among them could be treatments based on an antibody found only in the blood cells of haemophiliacs but capable of destroying particular types of cancer cell. HOPE OF THE FUTURE? Sir Andrew Turner There was huge progress made during my career. I think the future looks very exciting indeed Anthony Backhouse Despite suffering two strokes 18 months ago Sir James Black believes his work with genetically modified plants can still contribute vital information into how humans age. His team has been working on methods to transform corn to resist pests and drought conditions without affecting plants health. Cancer treatment Meanwhile scientists hope they can use animal tissue culture - involving separating normal cells from tumours and growing billions of copies of healthy ones inside a mass of plastic moulds called Petri dishes - to develop effective anti-cancer drugs. While plant growth enhancers do exist, none have yet worked well enough to allow farmers to boost crop yields sufficiently quickly. Scientists believe altering fruit flies using GM techniques enables experiments that couldn't otherwise take place. They claim GM offers real opportunities for preserving species threatened by extinction, improving fertilisers used around the world and providing safer foods for consumers. However, opponents warn that risks from commercialisation cannot currently be evaluated accurately. In addition long term effects remain unknown since trials usually last several years rather than decades before conclusions can safely be drawn. Mr Walton estimates up to 30 of all land across Europe is contaminated with traces of herbicide resistant weeds developed using conventional breeding techniques. Some experts are concerned that overuse of pesticides leads to resistance among insects while others fear superweeds evolving immunity to chemical weapons designed to wipe out their populations. 'Lack of knowledge' On top of that critics argue selective breeding companies aren't conducting adequate tests prior to bringing products onto market. These concerns led US President George Bush Jr recently to suspend funding for field trails in America pending evaluation of public opinion polls due later this summer. One company accused of rushing ahead too fast claims it did everything required by law including publishing test results showing clearances for both insecticides and weed killers applied under controlled circumstances. But environmental group Greenpeace insists the lack of scrutiny makes premature approval inevitable. Leslie Williams, head of policy at Friends of the Earth said: ""We don't need another approach to science which assumes what works somewhere else will automatically apply here."" Research director Dr Philip Lymbery agreed that controversial novel approaches must undergo rigorous testing wherever practical. Such efforts had already produced promising advances and provided lessons learned needed to improve current systems. As for whether the debate itself helped focus minds she questioned why governments wanted answers sown if they then sought to avoid making difficult decisions.

"Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was carried out by a team led by Professor Michael J. Fox at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis and is believed to be the first of its kind in humans - with other studies showing similar results for mice. The study involved people aged between 30 and 70 who had never exercised before but were otherwise healthy and willing to try it; all completed four group sessions per week over 12 months on bikes or treadmills. Half also received memory training three times weekly while they cycled or ran, focused around Alzheimer's disease and how changes in physical activity could affect cognitive function later in life. Those taking part did not need to already engage in moderate aerobic activities such as walking regularly or swimming laps.

"Adam Wilson, of Lostock Hall, was found with serious injuries at a property on Albrighton Crescent in Lostock Hall near Preston in September. Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall and Ryan Hughes, 22, from Penwortham were charged by police after the incident but later released under investigation for attempted murder On Wednesday (January 8), both men appeared before Preston Crown Court via video link to be sentenced over their part in Adam's attack which left him needing extensive hospital treatment including operations to his head, chest, arm and spine as well as exploratory surgery. Taylor pleaded guilty last week while Hughes initially denied any involvement until he changed his plea during court proceedings this morning. Both defendants will now serve an extended sentence - known as a ""hospital order"" or ""indeterminate detention."" It is hoped that when they are eventually released some time into the future it would only take them around half of what would have been normal prison sentences if convicted of manslaughter. Judge Andrew Jefferies QC said: ""There's no doubt you two played roles... You each picked up weapons... It seems to me there can be little doubt one of those weapons hit Mr Wilson repeatedly causing really significant injury. READ MORE 'Brutal' gang violence leaves man fighting for life following street brawl He added: ""The minimum term required isn't 15 years; 12-and-a-half years might seem right given your age and level of responsibility."" The judge also imposed concurrent four year terms for affray against each defendant who apologised through tears today saying sorry out loud several times. No reason had previously been made public why Mitchell set upon Adam in such savage fashion outside of his own home in Lancashire. However Judge Jeffries expressed concern about how similar incidents may result in further violent attacks among rival gangs trying to settle scores, adding: I wish all involved could understand the extent of damage done to society.""

"""We save people here every day,"" said the 46-year-old policeman - managing to sound both proud and chiding and the same time. Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned as a volunteer emergency responder for Careem, Uber's Middle East ride hailing rival. In exchange for responding to emergencies in the app when called upon by authorities or other users who spot an accident scene on their route, he gets free rides home from work most nights of his shift. To be fair, this isn't much different than what taxi drivers do all over the world either: They are paid overtime wages after working long hours patrolling crime hot spots with little chance of seeing customers during normal business hours. But it does illustrate one thing about how start-ups operate that is not exactly typical conventional wisdom behind many established companies' strategies: That they can afford to give away services because even if there is no immediate revenue from them yet, someone else will pay later down the line through advertising or subscriptions. And those future sources might just turn out to be you too. When I explain to him my thinking around why we should probably avoid using terms like ""moonshot,"" he nods along thoughtfully as though still processing these ideas himself rather than having already gotten used to hearing me espouse such notions whenever possible within earshot. He tells me how at Google Ideas (the think tank arm under Alphabet) which he joined right before leaving his job to found Careem back then, he was involved in projects aiming to help solve big problems across several parts of Africa including establishing drones to deliver medicine in Rwanda without needing roads. More recently however, something has changed inside him where its less obvious solutions have begun to appeal more instead. One project involves trying to make travel safer so women don't feel vulnerable while taking public transport alone at night in cities. The first step towards solving the problem? Getting enough cars on the streets late at night themselves filled by trained professionals ready to drive passengers safely wherever needed. So far, some 200 vehicles driven exclusively by male volunteers patrol Cairo each evening between midnight and 4am picking up female passengers whose phones get pinged when they call for assistance via the app versus relying only on regular taxis manned mostly by men. Those professional chauffeurs offer five trips per hour compared to two for others but also cost 50 Egyptian pounds (1.60). In addition, any passenger who feels uncomfortable sharing her journey with another woman may request special treatment. She'll sit in front beside the driver wearing earphones plugged into music playing loudly through customised speakers attached onto the roof-rack. No matter whether she speaks Arabic, English or French - EgyptAir operates flights to Paris, Dubai and London among numerous destinations globally - she won't risk being exposed outside her comfort zone thanks to the headphone isolation system built into the car windows. SOUND ISOLATION SYSTEM If Ms Sarah Ahmed calls us today shortly following our conversation yesterday morning asking for a lift to Zamalek district north east of downtown Cairo, we arrive sooner than expected due to traffic congestion caused by roadworks nearby prompting a detour allowing us to pick her up early near Wadi Al Helo area close to Tahrir Square wherein mass demonstrations against former President Hosni Mubarak were held almost 10 years ago. It turns out she works briefly as a real estate agent helping foreigners settle in Cairo and had been visiting friends. Since enrolling months earlier herself wanting to learn new skills beyond running tech support teams, she says getting accustomed to commuting solo around the city in this way helped open doors professionally speaking since Egyptians tend generally to shy away from talking to strangers let alone accepting offers made directly to them personally unless given prior approval. Indeed, she claims clients would often ask her about personal details once introduced together making her wonder if perhaps ladies prefer to remain incognito online too despite local laws requiring phone numbers exchanged face to face to ensure safety. Although she admits sometimes feeling odd riding alone in a vehicle full of unknown faces mainly comprising older white European expats volunteering alongside locals willing to take part in the initiative, ultimately nothing bad ever happened nor did anyone try anything inappropriate according to her account. After dropping off nine year old daughter Hadeel accompanying mother Ms Atefah Boudais el Shazly joining father Dr ElShazly Assem senior psychiatrist looking forward to attending mosque in times ahead, Najwa Othman from Saudi Arabia heads out again soon afterwards heading south east toward Maadi suburb past sprawling residential developments spreading out further westwards than central districts with clearer air quality benefiting from lower emissions stemming primarily from private sector pollution unlike heavy industry historically responsible elsewhere in the country.

"The 25-year-old claimed her maiden able-bodied national title on Sunday and won team gold with England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. But to qualify for Rio, Brown would have to do something she had never done before - swim a 100m breaststroke in under 1:10 minutes. ""I've been swimming since I was six,"" said Brown, speaking from Loughborough University's National Aquatic Centre (NAC), where Great Britain are training ahead of their Olympic campaign which starts next month. ""But when you're starting out there is no way that you think about going into an Olympics."" Brown has come close over time but consistency eluded her until last year after being diagnosed as suffering from brittle bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta or 'brittle bones' aged 11. It reduces bone density leading to frequent fractures including broken arms and ribs while also increasing susceptibility to muscle damage. Her condition means even low levels of impact can cause severe pain. She endured more than 50 operations during childhood alone having suffered countless falls due to weak limbs and joints. The injuries took its toll mentally too with Brown often feeling isolated given other children's fascination with sport. ""It definitely played a part because it made me feel like I wasn't normal,"" she explained. Much changed though after competing alongside British Paralympic champion Ellie Simmonds in 2013 claiming bronze medals across the 2015 World Championships and European Paratriathlon Cup series. After initially considering stopping competitive athletics altogether upon turning 16, Brown followed coach John Trevorrow to NAC in April 2014 seeking greater support within para-sport. Thanks largely to his advice and guidance culminating in London 2012 success, Brown managed to shave seconds off her personal best times by adapting techniques such as adding upper body strength work. In June 2016 came another breakthrough, qualifying for the Rio Games via rankings from world championship events held earlier this season.

"Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed on roads leading from Newport Road and Ely Crescent, but they have since been removed after reports that staff had found it difficult to get past traffic while trying to deliver patients into AE. The new system was introduced with the aim of giving paramedics quicker access as part of an overall plan by health board chiefs called 'Project Emperor'. However, nearly six months later some crews are still waiting up to 30 minutes for a green light before being able to enter through the main entrance off Crumlin Road West - one route used during peak times when there is congestion outside UHW's accident and emergency department. An incident where several ambulance vehicles became stuck behind parked cars prompted criticism over what has happened to Project Emperor, which promised to reduce delays caused by high demand entering hospital premises. Ambulance response times across south east Wales improved following its implementation back in February 2018. But around 18 per cent of 999 calls meant ambulances took longer than 15 minutes to arrive at their destination - known as not meeting time targets set out in Welsh Government guidance. The number of incidents referred to watchdog the Care Quality Commission also saw significant falls along most routes between April 2017 and March this year compared to the previous 12 months. READ MORE: This week's top stories Advertising But data covering June 1, July 2 and October 11 show response times hit an average of 16-minutes-and-one second on all three days recorded despite the barriers remaining in place in the same locations throughout each period. On both July 2 and October 11 waits reached 28 minutes, exceeding national guidelines recommending treatment within seven minutes if symptoms include chest pain or heart attack or stroke. It comes just two years after figures showed four ambulance trusts met 90 of target responses when running under capacity. Last summer, we revealed how hospitals faced mounting pressure due to high levels of people attending casualty departments because GPs had closed early ahead of planned strikes. During 201617, health boards spent 846,000 providing additional staff to cover vacancies linked to industrial action taken against the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. Officials claimed NHS Improvement pay deals signed earlier this month would ease pressures by increasing salaries by 3. At St John's hospital, response times averaged 22 minutes-and-49 seconds every day between May 17 and September 21. In total, 92.6 per cent failed to meet performance standards imposed by the Welsh Government. Waiting times peaked 24 hours apart on different dates reaching 23 minutes on May 19 and 25 minutes on September 27. One crew reported having waited 41 minutes on November 20. Another paramedic said she ""couldn't believe"" her eyes seeing another vehicle wait twice as long once inside the building meaning clocking 33 minute-and-56 seconds on January 4 followed by 32 minutes and 59 seconds on December 13. A spokesman for Hywel Dda University Health Board admitted the situation could be better saying: ""We apologise to anyone who finds themselves waiting unnecessarily long periods of time whilst we deal with very challenging circumstances surrounding staffing."" He added: ""It remains critical that our frontline clinical teams continue to make judgements about patient need based solely upon them rather making decisions based only on arrival time criteria alone. We will however take steps forward immediately so these issues do not arise again."" South East Wales AM Lee Waters described the latest statistics as ""very worrying."" Mr Water said: ""I am extremely concerned about the impact this delay can have on life threatening conditions such as strokes or cardiac arrests and I sincerely hope things improve soon.

"So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's history is no easy task. But new head coach Liam Manning believes his appointment has already made an impression on players and supporters alike after just four days at Stadium:MK. Speaking exclusively to Football League World LIVE ahead of Saturday afternoon's clash against Accrington Stanley (3pm kick-off), 'Mano' revealed what it was that convinced him to accept the job last week when he knew there could be other options available - both within football circles and elsewhere... ""It wasn't necessarily [the chance to take over from] someone I know well,"" 'Mano said about joining MK Dons following seven years spent working under Robbie Neilson at Scottish Premiership outfit Hearts. ""I'd never met Martin before but we've spoken since and you get that feeling straightaway when speaking to people like that; so my gut instinct told me this would work out."" With Paul Tisdale having also left Stadium:mk earlier on during pre-season, MK were looking down two potential paths towards finding their next permanent boss heading into 202122 - including bringing back former City favourite Dan Micciche to take control again or promoting academy director Pete Russell from within. But while these alternatives remained on the table, Manning came forward without hesitation once approached by chairman Pete Winkelman soon after taking up his role north of the border. And despite only arriving in Milton Keynes less than 10 days ago, Mano insists he can see signs early doors that suggest not too much will need to change behind the scenes if shown time.

Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be rolled out in over a dozen forces from April 2019 to tackle repeat offending of those who are already subject to suspended sentences or community orders for serious violence against women and children. The scheme is being funded with 2m from the Home Office's Serious Violence Fund - which was set up following pressure after the murder of Sarah Everard earlier this year. It follows similar schemes run by Scotland Yard that have focused on high-risk perpetrators of sexual offences such as rape; these include an initiative called Project Hunt launched three years ago. Image caption The pilot project aims specifically towards men convicted of violent crimes including stalking, harassment and coercive control ""We're looking at all forms of domestic abuse,"" says Detective Superintendent Simon Harding, lead officer on Operation Gauntlet: the Metropolitan Police investigation into historical child sex abuse allegations against VIP figures. He adds there were 1,068 cases referred between 201415. ""That shows you how big [the issue] actually is."" Some victims identified more than 100 suspects. Most of them had never even gone before a court because they died. But now police are finally getting round to investigating many others thanks to modern DNA technology combined with advances in surveillance and mobile phone evidence. 'I'm not evil' Operation Fairbank began last November when detectives discovered indecent images of young boys hidden within computer files linked to Sir Edward Heath. Since then an estimated 30 officers across five local authority areas - Wiltshire, Avon Somerset, West Mercia, Thames Valley and Hampshire - have been working around the clock building what looks like one of Britain's biggest ever paedophiles investigations involving hundreds of suspects allegedly operating right under their noses for decades.

Education minister Kirsty Williams has spoken about her ambitions for this country since she became one herself five years ago when it emerged children here were lagging behind those across Europe. It went beyond Brexit - although that fact did not escape her attention either.

There are still challenges ahead but if ministers like Ms Williams can get around these plans which include reforming assessments more closely aligned to the Welsh curriculum, raising teacher numbers further, investing money into improving buildings, challenging schools to raise attainment levels year upon year even while pupils move through different phases, tackling low confidence among parents that their child can achieve, creating better links between universities and colleges, introducing new apprenticeships schemes based within classrooms themselves... then perhaps the next generation isn't doomed to repeat history?",0,79

It meant that funding available to provide additional places at existing schools would remain flat between 201011 and 2015.

"The mutation was also present in our evolutionary ""cousins"" - the Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it is not found in humans' closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. As early humans evolved, they started to live longer than their ancestors did (see human life expectancy). Mutations accumulate over time when a cell divides, but these mutations are usually neutral for an organism's survival. In some cases, however, a new trait can arise that confers an advantage or disadvantage on its carriers. If this change benefits individuals with copies of both versions more often than those without them, then only one version will persist within each generation. The same mechanism allows other beneficial traits such as blue eyes by suppressing excess production of a protein responsible for eye colour during development. These beneficial changes survive because they help parents produce offspring who have better odds at passing along advantageous genes. What makes the Madingley Pond mutant so interesting from an evolutionary perspective is how well-suited it seems to be for modern society - especially after centuries of selection to make us bigger and better adapted to long lives. For example, fast metabolism would allow people carrying two working copies of the mutated gene variant to burn through energy quickly enough to keep up physically demanding work schedules. This could explain why most coal miners carry the mad1 allele; many anthropologists believe the earliest occupations were carried out primarily by workers whose physical strength allowed them to haul heavy loads underground. It may even underlie today's high rates of obesity among white Americans, which might confer additional strenuousness on generations of descendants still bearing two active copies. Both metabolic disorders associated with the mutation cause similar symptoms: increased appetite coupled with difficulty controlling food intake, leading eventually to weight gain. People with two copies find themselves hungrier all day and unable to control urges to eat large quantities of carbohydrates. Those afflicted typically struggle to maintain normal blood sugar levels resulting in fatigue, muscle cramps and lack of concentration. Many develop diabetes mellitus later in life. Other health problems include alcoholism, anxiety attacks and heart disease. Some scientists suggest that greater susceptibility to stress induced depression may result too.",0,109

"Jessica Taylor suffers debilitating fatigue and painful muscles caused by Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). The 25-year-old, of Cliffe Woods, Kent, met Samuel Bearman, 24, through the online dating site OkCupid in March 2015 before he moved to Brighton. They started a relationship but Jessica said she was shocked when her partner told her about his plans for after they had children together - which included adoption or surrogacy options involving another woman rather than carrying them himself. She claims that Mr Bearman even suggested using IVF so one child could be genetically related to him while another would not need to go though it at all. But months later their relationship came crashing down following an argument over what Ms Nelson claimed were 'controlling' behaviour from her boyfriend. Shellshocked, last January, she took out a restraining order against Mr Bearman and left London where she lived with him into rented council accommodation near Canterbury costing 400 per month just four miles away from the home she shared with Mr Bearman. After splitting up with Sam, Jessica began working three days a week on a zero hours contract at Just Eat in Sandwich. However when that job ended, around a year ago due to Covid-19 restrictions, she found herself back living with mum Angela who has helped fund her daughter's treatment since 2017.

"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites claim that taking certain pills such as the ADHD drug Ritalin or sleeping tablets like Ambien will give students an advantage when it comes to completing essays, studying for tests or doing revision work. But experts warn there is no proof of this - and that many teenagers who rely on drugs could suffer serious side effects if they misuse them. Others have died from suspected overdoses after becoming addicted to these substances prescribed to help treat otherwise normal symptoms linked to exam stress. And now anti-drug campaigners are warning parents need to be vigilant about what children may be getting up to while at home during lockdown. The MHRA has seen a 300 per cent rise online searches involving terms related to Adderall - which can be used legally to improve concentration but also illegally recreationally. Searches relating to Modafinil (another legal stimulant) were six times more likely than usual between January 1 and March 31 last year compared to 2019. Meanwhile, Quetiapine, a medication commonly known under its brand name Seroquel, saw search queries 12.5 times greater over the same period. Dr Heath said: 'We know that thousands of UK youngsters gamble away their future every day by misusing prescribed medications including those designed specifically address conditions caused by excessive pressure.' Advertisement MailOnline spoke exclusively with cannabis campaigner Billy Caldwell's mother Charlotte before his medicinal marijuana was seized again following five days without access back in February 2018. Their story went global sparking national outrage against Home Secretary Sajid Javid's decision to seize the cannabis oil he needed to control seizures because some batches contained THC above the allowable limit. Following sustained campaigning Mr Javid announced new rules allowing seriously ill patients to receive medicinal marijuana where clinically appropriate earlier this month. And despite coronavirus lockdowns across Britain, dozens of families within weeks had been able to secure prescriptions via specialist doctors amid warnings not enough progress has yet been made. But yesterday Ms Caldwell told MailOnline she fears her son needs treatment sooner rather later due to ongoing post traumatic seizures. She added how judges should intervene urgently so other sick kids don't die waiting on vital medicine. She hit out saying current laws permitting medical professionals to prescribe cannabidiol CBD based treatment significantly harms vulnerable British citizens adding urgent change must come fast through politicians intervention. Speaking just ahead of International Day Against Drug Abuse Illicit Trafficking today, Mrs Caldwell revealed how high profile teenager Alfie Dingley wants her advice going forward into adulthood having watched their lives unfold together since 2014. Mrs Templeton explained how the pair were both handed three-month sentences suspended for 18 months plus 200 hours unpaid community service after being convicted of possessing two kilos of cannabis resin worth 10,000. Yet three years on none of the trio involved even served half their sentence given the time spent behind bars awaiting trial then bail.. They were instead released immediately meaning all received immediate credit towards any further punishment passed down upon conviction... 'At the end of each criminal court hearing we were taken straight out of the courtroom, via the dock door,' Billy recalled. Even though I'd done nothing wrong my mum got searched first because I'm disabled and that meant me too. It felt humiliating seeing officers running around us touching our arms and legs trying to find something illegal. Then another officer took off his belt, pulled open his trousers and started patting himself!' He continued:'I knew inside prison would be worse and wished Mum hadn't brought me along. When you're sitting outside looking at everyone else enjoying themselves drinking beer from plastic cups seemed stupid really! There were loads of fights happening everywhere - one boy ended up spitting blood onto someone else's head! At least here I didn't feel judged and nobody stared at me.

"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, starting with John F Kennedy's 1961 request that Congress legislate ""a program designed to provide high school graduates throughout America... an equal opportunity for employment in our country's expanding economy."" The federal government was first to jump into action. In 1964 it launched TVE (Teacher Vocational Education), which brought grants and contracts to schools offering teachers courses ranging from dental hygiene (you know how many dentists there are now?) to electronics repair. It created the National Advisory Committee on Teacher Quality, whose mission became widely known by its acronym: READY - Reach Every Available classroom Youth Deserving underfunded teacher training options. Finally, after years spent debating whether or not students should be able to advance beyond their eighth-grade reading level before graduating from public high schools, President Carter signed legislation creating TOPS (Trained Opportunity Partnership Schools) - the nation's first federally funded, state-run demonstration project specifically aimed at raising student achievement. The idea was simple enough: grant funds would go directly toward hiring more effective educators who had completed college but hadn't yet earned advanced degrees; these ""next generation"" teachers were placed within struggling middle and low income communities across the county where they worked closely alongside seasoned professionals until each one had mastered her craft and proven herself capable of inspiring young minds.

The Scots are two points adrift of third-placed Lithuania going into Thursday night's match against Slovakia - who lead the way by three points and host England later that evening. Strachan has been criticised for playing a weakened team as he rested his key players following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Malta but insists SFA chiefs knew why his side were made up mostly of fringe men. ""I didn't surprise them [the board],"" he said. ""If you're asking me whether I had any input it was minimal because we've got to know each other well enough now where there wouldn't need too much between us.""

This 1914 example was made by textile artist Barbara Hepworth who took inspiration from WWI artists such as Walter Sickert whose works were used by British officials as propaganda tools while fighting raged across Europe Mr Cory told MailOnline: 'I'm so pleased Virginia found my great uncle Edward Morris' flag which must have lain hidden away somewhere within our family home for many decades.'

Spendiff took part in a further assault on other men with the blade during his violent rampage through Glasgow city centre Spendiff (right) and co-accused Daniel Docherty were jailed for seven years over their involvement in four assaults including one which left victim Stu Trelfa requiring 35 stitches to stab wounds inflicted by Spendiff at The Arches pub It is understood that both Mr Trelfa - then 20 - as well another man had been stabbed before spending almost two weeks recovering from surgery when they could not find any witnesses willing to come forward after going public about what happened to them. However, prosecutors said it would have taken'significant courage' and significant planning because of the repercussions from coming forward against spendiff or others involved in the attacks. In court today Fiscal Depute Sean Murphy told Sheriff Derek O'Carroll: 'At 11pm while he was still inside Callaghan Square Police Station officers observed him walking unsteadily towards Buchanan Street carrying an umbrella.' He added: 'Officers gave chase but lost sight of him outside the entrance to Debenhams. Officers conducted a search of the area where upon about 10 minutes later they saw the accused again sitting on a wall near Marble Arch McDonald's sheltered walkway'. Mr Murphy went onto explain how police found Spendiff holding a large hunting knife up to his own neck saying words to effect of ""I'm going to kill myself."" He also sustained cuts to his forearms having slashed himself several times whilst trying unsuccessfully to cut off his hand. The prosecutor explained this came about following an altercation between members of different groups of young people earlier in Strathclyde Park just east of Finnieston Road, close to the University of West Scotland campus. Following these incidents all parties met back down Dickies Drive beside the university and spilled into Pitt Ross Garden. Hereupon a fight broke out involving weapons being used and punches thrown by each side resulting in three separate altercations taking place within five minutes. One leaving the first male needing 18 staples inserted under local anaesthetic across his face. Another sustaining injuries to his eye socket and cheekbone. A total of 15 males aged 16 to 25 are believed to be amongst those present during the melee according to eyewitness accounts given to police investigators. Some wearing black jackets emblazoned with 999 logos printed on front pockets calling themselves emergency services staff. Others donning high vis vests bearing the name SPG or fire service markings. A number using umbrellas branded with NHS symbols. All armed themselves with knives and baseball bats. With some brandishing knuckle dusters. The offenders moved away from the scene along Union Street into Merchant City heading westwards, past McColls supermarket where footage shows the attack happening. This led to more violence erupting once again elsewhere around the southside district. By this point angry crowds gathering began shouting abuse aimed at police. At least ten riot vans rushed to the streets alongside dozens of police cars. National Police Air Service helicopter deployed overhead scanning the skies for suspects escaping justice. Around 140 calls made to police reporting criminal offences ranging from multiple stabbings to serious road traffic crashes. 27 crime scenes established across central belt locations nearby including George Square Gardens, Sauchiehall Street, Dumbarton Road, Albion StreetArgyle Street, Bothwell Street, Great Western Road, Pollokshaws Road East, High Street, Renfield Street, Trongate, Cowgate, Gallowgate, Hope Street, Dalhousie Street, Lorne Street North Bridgehead South King Street, Morningside Drive, Cadogan Place, Duke Street, Clyde Walk, Riceburn Terrace, Easterhouse Road New York Brae, Mount Vernon Way.

"As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday. Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether this deadline had been met or breached in order for him and staff at Welsh Government's quarry unit to approve plans which were submitted on Thursday evening. Mr Roberts initially said: ""It is difficult because I can't say there isn't any wood coming off that site."" He then added he could also not confirm if it would be used within five days but claimed the company has made progress with its proposal after speaking to workers involved who are being paid 450 per week during work stoppages. But Mr Bryant asked how long they will remain suspended from their jobs before having to claim Universal Credit themselves - something the Cabinet Secretary admitted may happen due to his inaction over concerns raised by members about safety standards more than two-and-a half years ago. ""I think you'll find we've got an agreement today,"" replied Mr Roberts when pressed again. In addition to paying contractors directly, Forestry Commission Wales (FCW) agreed a new contract worth up to 500k annually last year as well providing training opportunities through apprenticeships. However unions including GMB Cymru believe the process should start all over again following allegations around health safety breaches earlier this year.",0,157
"It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about coalitions, and its leaders know exactly when to call in favors from old friends or seek new ones. That's what Likud did on Wednesday morning after exit polls showed a clear path for forming one with Avigdor Liberman's Yisrael Beytenu party, which put itself first among right-wing parties even though it fell short of half the Knesset seats overall - no mean feat considering how far back it started. For those who have followed this particular roller coaster ride over many years now, there will be little surprise at being asked again to join an extended family whose members are not always particularly enamored with each other but struggle together nonetheless as Israel faces mounting challenges on all fronts: Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, radical Jews abroad, international enemies within our borders; demographic threats both inside Israel proper (the ultra-Orthodox) and outside it (Palestinian citizens); domestic social pressures that threaten civil order and democratic institutions; economic conditions requiring attention if we want to keep growing without becoming unwieldy. Here too I speak mostly of Israel today rather than some future Israeli tomorrow because my point isn't so much to offer predictions as explain why elections take place every few months here instead of once every four years like they do elsewhere. It has less to do with the complexity of managing such a country than ensuring public accountability during periods where major decisions can potentially affect just about everything important. For instance... The Left's Long March There were rare moments throughout Tuesday night when hardliners could look forward to another term under Bibi while centrists might fear their days were numbered. As early results came pouring in, Blue and White seemed locked into second place behind Lapid's Yesh Atid ahead of Labor leader Amir Peretz. Together these three created something called the Joint List, leaving out Meretz along with former defense minister Moshe Ya'alon's Telem faction. If Israelis thought last September's inconclusive election ended things, Big Brother didn't get any sleep until well past midnight before announcing his decision regarding whether he would recommend either Gantz or Netanyahu to form government. By then, most observers assumed Rivlin would make his choice based primarily upon recommendations made by secular Jewish parties since religious parties were unlikely to support anyone outside their camp unless forced through agreements already reached between them. When initial numbers indicated centrist leaders Benny Gantz and Gabi Ashkenazi may receive enough votes to head up a viable coalition alongside two Arab factions led respectively by Ayman Odeh and Ahmad Tibi, conservative voters looked around nervously wondering whom else besides Netanyahu could possibly lead a stable majority? Would Kahol Lavan actually overthrow him as prime minister following only eight months in office and despite having lost the popular vote convincingly? Did centrist voters really trust someone accused of corruption allegations equivalent in seriousness to the crimes against humanity currently facing war criminal Slobodan Milosevic? And finally ... were Arabs ready to govern themselves responsibly given that Lieberman himself drew almost as strong support from Haredim as nationalists? For better or worse, yes! Aided enormously by a confluence of factors ranging from voter fatigue toward Netanyahu coupled with widespread disgust across demographics previously seen supporting him resulting largely from recent revelations involving various actions taken vis-a-vis shady associates including racist incitement, bribery charges looming overhead relating to accusations leveled against El Al Airlines chairman David Bitan - a member of Netanyahu's inner circle, according to police transcripts leaked to reporters late November 2019 - and others, large swaths of Mandelblit's political base went against their long time champion. This enabled left wingers representing big cities like Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Jaffa and Lod to come roaring home, pushing center-leftist blocs into serious contention heading towards runoff voting. While it remains unclear precisely where each candidate stands concerning specific issues likely to define upcoming debates, we do know that neither side intends to compromise when discussing core principles embedded in Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. In fact tonight alone provided fresh encouragement confirming deep divides separating us on fundamental questions connected especially closely to Israel's identity as defined by civilization v. barbarism, nationalism vs. religion, security concerns versus human rights violations, Zionism vs. anti-Zionismanti-Semitism etc., etc.. What became increasingly apparent late yesterday afternoon included the likelihood that Likud won't concede anything meaningful concerning annexation of parts of Judea Samaria east of Jordan River while also failing entirely to convince voters otherwise. On the contrary, significant elements within Likud appear poised to continue promoting settlements regardless of historic realities and attendant strategic implications threatening Israel's very existence meanwhile simultaneously seeking ways to ensure immunity should legal problems related to possible conflict of interest arise over handling policy matters affecting private interests linked directly to ongoing cases.

"The UK must go further to ensure those settling learn English ""so they can be more integrated into our country."" Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said: ""We are only doing what every other country in Europe does. The proof of the pudding is that a quarter million people have already come here and settled over this Parliament... I think it is good for us to say we want British values to prevail but also there will always need to be a place within Britain where you retain your own culture which has been part of who we are as a nation throughout history."" Mr Salmond argued that England should not get special treatment when all countries had an obligation under EU rules to help newly-arrived migrants to integrate by learning their language before using welfare benefits or social housing. He added: ""There are many things the Westminster establishment do very well...but one area where Scotland leads the way on integration is evident from today's figures - Scots immigrants arriving since 1999 speak fluent Gaelic with 87 able to hold full conversations compared to just 46 per cent elsewhere, while those speaking Polish were found to have mastered 68 words out of 100 in comparison to 25 across Great Britain, according to research published last year. These are clear examples showing how Scottish governments work hard to make sure newcomers feel welcome and included...Scotland wants to play its part too - why shouldn't we?"" Separate government statistics show 27 percent of new arrivals spoke no English upon arrival between 200405 and 200809; 10 percent fewer than first estimated because researchers counted them twice after initially being put down as German due to confusion with dialectal differences",0,159

"Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane.

In order words; these people won't automatically get out as soon as possible - even though we know there's no guarantee this sort of punishment works anyway (you only need look at how well rehabilitating terrorists into society has worked).

"In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra PS84m annually. Economist Gillian Paull says this is not enough to meet demand and will be more likely to leave some children without any care at all than help them get into nurseries or childminders. The Conservative Party has pledged that every three-and four-year-old in England should have 15 hours of free early education a week by 2020 - double what it offers now- and claim overall investment under their plans could reach 2bn per annum within five years. The Liberal Democrats are proposing ""cost sharing"" with private providers over 10 years which they say means families won't pay anything towards services until there's sufficient funding from government. All parties agree something needs doing about rising pressures on school budgets but disagree strongly how best to do so: while Conservatives argue schools must become less reliant on local authority funding through council tax rises (they already receive around 40 of total income), others want central budget increases instead. A recent report found that if spending was maintained as before 201415 then cuts would need to continue until 202122 rather than ending next April.",0,165
"Alistair Spagnoletti, 21, of Luton, and Curtis Walker, 23, of Watford, pleaded guilty to controlling a child at Harrow Crown Court. Callum Ward, 19, of Watford, was found guilty of the same offence following a trial in May 2019 and sentenced on July 2 last year. The three victims were aged between 14-16 years old when they met their abusers through social media but had been groomed by them for some time before that point - many even being abused over FaceTime or Snapchat messaging apps which meant police could not intervene until after each attack happened. The children would then be asked about what sexual acts took place so it could be shared with other men online. In one case, girls as young as 13 were manipulated into meeting up with multiple offenders where they were passed around like'sex toys'. One victim described how she felt scared and alone whilst enduring repeated rape and abuse from strangers who came disguised behind fake profiles all seemingly acting out sick fantasies. The court heard evidence relating to more than 100 videos involving 136 different boys captured during four separate days at venues across London including Brixton Academy and Wembley Stadium. A fifth defendant, 18-year-old Jadan Winstanley, also known as Jaydee, admitted grooming two teenage girls via Facebook messenger trying to convince both underage teenagers to engage sexually online. He will return to court for sentencing later this month. Advertisement Judge Sarah Paneth said: 'My summary is simple...these defendants have caused untold harm.' She told Allen he was an experienced man who had engaged in such offending since 2015. She added: 'It's hard to see why anyone would want to do these sorts of things let alone use such vile language towards those you are abusing; phrases such as ""I'm going to turn her inside out"" while filming the very thing you say that you're planning. You used your experience to cause significant pain.' Allen claimed his actions did no serious damage because none of the males involved has complained publicly - something Judge Paneth rejected referring back to him telling officers if any parent saw footage of himself engaging in sex with a girl, they'd kill themselves. 'They may well feel ashamed,' she conceded. But she noted there seemed little remorse demonstrated throughout proceedings adding that perhaps Mr Allen didn't understand just how damaged the lives of individuals can become once abuse begins.",0,166

"Tandridge District Council leader Martin Fisher gave planners a shortlist of five areas for such a scheme. He said one new Surrey village is better than ""scatter-gunning"" homes and cramping existing villages, while protecting green belt land at the same time as delivering on housing need in our district."" In his report to cabinet he adds: ""The council has identified sufficient'strategic sites' across its area that could accommodate approximately 4,500 new houses by 2036 if necessary - enough capacity to meet anticipated demand up until then without having recourse to any significant development within Green Belt or other protected land areas which would otherwise have been outside the scope of this planning framework document."" He says: ""I believe it imperative we move ahead with a joined up approach rather than scatter gun developing around the county where appropriate locations are not available when needed most (ie during the economic recovery period). This will also help us achieve net zero carbon targets set out in the council's recent climate change strategy. A key part of achieving these aims involves removing vehicles from car dependent communities along with encouraging active travel options such as walking cycling etc...therefore agreeing plans now before building starts again in earnest next year makes good sense for all concerned.""",0,168

This means either Cap doesn't know much about his own military or this story must be very confusing indeed because, come on - you can see for yourself.

""I've got a massive opportunity to play well there,"" said Murray Andy Murray says he has had a positive start to his time away from tennis after undergoing hip surgery earlier this year, despite being forced out of Wimbledon with an injury set back. The Scot revealed last week that he would be withdrawing from SW19 as part of a plan which could see him return later in 2018 or early 2019 - and admitted it was just ""painful"" watching matches at this stage. However, speaking ahead of his exhibition match against Roger Federer in Glasgow next month, Murray insisted things were going better than expected so far. He told BBC Scotland: ""It's good actually [the recovery]. I'm still working really hard but my body feels great."" Asked if three weeks without competitive action might have been different, given what happened during January and February, when he pulled out of both Miami Masters 1000 events citing fatigue, Murray added: I] don't know because obviously you never quite know how your body will react until you go through something like that. So we'll find out over these few months."" Murray also spoke about returning to training following tendonitis problems in his knee prior to pulling off another remarkable comeback by reaching last month's Australian Open quarter-finals. And while acknowledging he may need another operation further down the line, he hopes playing matches leading up to tournaments rather than simply practising can prevent any more injuries occurring. 'My body felt brilliant towards the end of 2017' In addition to recovering physically, Murray believes merely getting used to competing again should help make sure no issues arise when he does begin hitting balls once again. ""That takes some adjustment mentally coming into these very physical matches knowing exactly where you're at with everything,"" explained the two-time Grand Slam winner. ""You feel fine every day, but then stepping onto the court and pushing yourself even harder maybe hurts slightly more sometimes; having somewhat forgotten how much work goes into those moments. Those are all lessons you learn only by doing them. ""So hopefully yeah, they won't happen anymore. It doesn't mean they definitely won't either though, especially if I do get injured again. But certainly feeling myself now and looking forward to kind of focusing completely on trying to improve my game and win more big titles here. That's pretty exciting."" Although he struggled badly in Melbourne due to a lack of preparation coming together amid fitness concerns, 12th seed Murray did demonstrate signs of progress throughout the tournament. He reached the final eight at Roland Garros four years ago (losing to Novak Djokovic) and made the same count en route to the 2016 US Open semi-final too. After finishing runner-up to Stan Wawrinka in New York nearly six months ago, many believe there remains plenty left in Murray's tank. And although keen to take each step carefully initially upon resuming his career, the Scot expects to compete strongly at Flushing Meadows in August. ""Yeah, absolutely,"" replied Murray when asked whether he thought lifting silverware remained possible at major level. ""If you look at Australia, I think I played well enough to beat Rafa Nadal if I'd put my mind to it. If I hadn't slipped and hurt my leg, potentially I could have beaten Milos Raonic too. Then you throw in Cilic who went on to reach the semis. Marin Cilic, probably top five player in the world right now. Dominic Thiem, who took [Alexander Zverev], someone people talk about a lot, deep into five sets. ""Then you have Juan Martin del Potro who came back from three elbow operations. You knew he wasn't anywhere near 100 fit, yet he pushed me extremely close. Kei Nishikori, who had quite bad wrist trouble for periods of time, started way behind schedule compared to everyone else. But when he plays well... Oh man, he hits such big forehands and serves huge, moves extremely well for 6ft 5in guy. There were some tough guys.""",0,185

"Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal. His absence from that list of illustrious names reveals how much has changed at Anfield since then and while some fans may be reluctant to forgive him for leaving when they did, it would do them good to learn what happened next. Liverpool signed Sadio Mane (above) just months after selling Wallace PA Photos Enlarge As soon as Kenny left a year later by mutual consent, owner John W Henry was on the phone offering Carroll 100,000-a-week - more than any other player in English football except Wayne Rooney and David Beckham. The deal prompted muttering among supporters who wondered why their manager had been sacked before being replaced with a striker whose best days were behind him because of injury problems. It led to the famous 'zeitgeist' tweet from Ian Ayre: ""Our zeigiest signing ever."" Sure enough, within two years Carroll made only one appearance under Roy Hodgson and spent most of the second half of last season out injured again. He seems destined never to fully justify such wages but even so there remains an astonishing gulf between his status now and the position held previously by few players in the club's whole history. Twenty years ago this week Michael Owen arrived at Anfield. He cost around 17m but didn't start scoring regularly until late 200203; six months earlier, after joining Newcastle United on loan, he'd won the FA Cup against all odds. Yet no matter where you stand on transfers these days, nobody could accuse Sir Alex Ferguson of misjudging his arrival into Manchester United's forward line. Few imagined a time when both Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge would surpass Owen's total return of 91 goals in 172 appearances yet here we are. Instead, argues Gary Neville in his new book, money can buy success if used correctly but only once certain conditions are established. Transfer policy should reflect long term strategy rather than short term necessity I don't think premiership clubs know anything about building a team and structural changes to training methods must also take place alongside investment strategies designed specifically to provide young talent with opportunities. In short, everything needs tweaking. On Sunday evening a million people watched Steven Gerrard lift another Premier League trophy up above his head which meant something special given those closest to him knew better than anyone else exactly what it took to get there. While others will argue that 30 years without winning silverware isn't acceptable, perhaps instead we need to accept that times change and priorities shift. There'll always be pressure but sometimes expectations are unrealistic. Nowhere does that apply more than at Real Madrid. If Barcelona win La Liga too it means three league titles in four seasons plus Copa del Rey victories mean Pep Guardiola has surpassed Del Bosque's achievements despite spending far less over the course of five campaigns than Jose Mourinho during his own run of dominance at Chelsea.

"Ethnically it is highly diverse, with more than 300 local languages. The people range from rural hunter-gatherers to a modern urban elite. Sophisticated kingdoms existed before the arrival of the Persians around 1200 BC, and were later replaced by Greco-Bactrian rule (525-330BC), Achaemenid Persia until about 200 AD, Kushan Empire between 150 and 280 AD, Indo-Scythian Kingdom at some time in this period, followed finally by Seleucids who controlled most of Bactria during their reigns as well. In the 1st century CE, Parthia was part of the Roman province of Mesopotamia, which also included Babylonia, Syria Palaestina, Armenia Minor, Cilicia, Pontus and Pamphylia. In addition, there are records showing that parts of Sogdiana, Arachosia and Transoxania belonged to the diocese of Daraene in the early 2nd century CE but may have been lost after being annexed into Turkic empires such as Gokturk or Seljuq Turks. Armenians ruled here for many centuries; however they never managed to capture the heartland areas beyond the Oxus river valley even though two invasions under Tigranes II and Artaxias I resulted only in minor territorial gains along the borders against the Scyths. During his campaigns in 21011CE Alexander the Great moved through the territory on both banks of the Indus River looking for an easier route across India back to Greece. Under Emperor Diocletian's reforms circa 284, Bactra became one of five bishoprics added to the list within the newly created ecclesiastical Province of Asia.[10] The Han dynasty established its first border outpost here during the mid 3rd century BCE when they built fortresses along the road from Taxila to Kucha. With the fall of the Western Xia kingdom in 221, the Hunnic empire emerged out of what had previously been known as Xiongnu land and then invaded China proper via Central Asian nomadic tribesmen including the Alans, Magyars and Khazars respectively moving westwards towards Eurasia over the Tian Shan mountains and plundering Lamedan and Termez enroute. They came very close to breaching Chinese defences near Shiyan forcing Cao Pi to send envoys to treat with them while he prepared to launch another campaign himself but died shortly afterwards leaving orders not to advance further without him. His successor Jin Shiji declined contact due to concerns regarding possible corruption among the marauders so instead sent emissaries led by Fan Jian he met at Sui to purchase protection money as compensation for past losses suffered against them since 386 (see Records of Grand Historian). By 450 the western frontier army stationed at Bactra consisted mainly of Korean mercenaries brought up to speed on military matters according to official histories written years later although probably arrived earlier if reports based upon archaeological evidence dating sites like Tash Bulak can be believed[citation needed]. Although sometimes referred to elsewhere simply as ""Koreans"" these troops did not come from Korea per se rather were recruited from various ethnic groups inhabiting northern China just south of Manchuria comprising Yue people from the league states, Yuezhi from what would become southern Mongolia plus others identified either by name Hani or origin Han depending on whether referring directly to modern Koreans or using older descendent names used prior to Qin unification e.g.: 'Yue' 'Jin'. This suggests that much has changed over those 500 years especially following the introduction of Buddhism paving the way for trade throughout central Asia leading inevitably toward eventual recognition of political unity resulting eventually in the birth of unified Goryeo Dynasty in 918. Some historians have gone so far as suggesting that the presence of Korean forces themselves helped create conditions favoring the spread of Christianity thereby laying foundations for future reunification efforts centered initially upon Joseon Dynasty and ultimately developed - albeit intermittently - culminating today in North South Koreas joining hands once again creating yet another potential buffer state isolating China completely should hostilities arise. Another factor making war less likely now might possibly lie hidden deep beneath Earth's surface where scientists suggest vast reserves of natural gas could potentially transform almost all industrial activity worldwide away from fossil fuels currently generating greenhouse gasses causing global warming. Those deposits alone are estimated to dwarf current proven oil reserves. It therefore seems unlikely any nation will want to risk disrupting regional stability by sparking conflict unless convinced otherwise - something which goes hand-in-hand with recent moves made publicly encouraging bilateral talks aimed at forging peaceful relations unlike decades ago when U.S.-led Vietnam War caused widespread destruction killing millions despite claims neither side wanted anything other than peace. For now Bactrians remain happy trading partners sharing cultural similarities common to neighboring peoples sticking together relatively peacefully compared to say Persian Gulf Arabs facing off Iran while Uzbekistan maintains good neighborly ties too recently sending medical aid to flood ravaged Pakistan meeting popular demand perhaps because human rights abuse allegations levied against leaders.

"Once Kyle Abbott dismissed Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for 59 in the third over of the day in Port Elizabeth, the tone was set. Abbott (2-38), Kagiso Rabada (3-77) and Vernon Philander (4-66) then ripped through a batting line up that has been struggling with illness this week to help South Africa ease into a 2-1 series lead heading into next weekend's final test at Johannesburg. The visitors were bowled out for 183 after tea on the second day before spinner Keshav Maharaj grabbed two wickets including his maiden five-wicket haul in tests as they slumped to 120 all out 20 overs later. It is only their fourth loss ever by an innings margin away from home against South Africa and leaves them facing another bleak trip back across the country just days before Christmas. ""To be honest we really didn't expect it,"" said left hander Thirimanne, who top scored with 47 off 127 balls and shared a 63-run partnership with former skipper Mahela Jayawardene (30). ""We thought if AB de Villiers got going he could carry us but unfortunately our batsmen couldn't do what they did last time."" On previous tours to South Africa, young players such as Kumar Sangakkara failed when put under pressure while Tillakaratne Dilshan struggled outside Colombo International Stadium. This tour, though, began more promisingly than most having won the first game convincingly in Durban thanks largely due to centuries by old hands like Thilan Samaraweera and Sanga. They also managed one each here from youngsters Niroshan Dickwella (64 not out) and Roshen Silva (56), both relatively untested international cricketers, which gave some hope to the future of the side now led by De Silva. But once again the lack of experience showed as no other player made 25 or higher aside from those three knocks. The tourists had sent down 14 maidens in total during the day while picking up eight wickets and they continued in the same vein until lunch on Sunday where 18 runs came off 38 deliveries without losing a wicket. However, any hopes youngster Dhanushka Gunathilaka carried gained momentum when he pulled himself together amid a mini collapse immediately after lunch lasting 40 minutes. He hit four boundaries in his 39-ball fifty as well as sharing a 53-run stand with Tharindu Kaushal (19) to take 33 runs off the session and pull the score to 1466. His dismissal proved even better news for South Africa however when Abbot enticed Kaushal forward to edge behind moments later leaving debutant Vishwa Fernando stranded on nine at the crease alongside Surange, 17 not out, coming in at number 10. In between periods of play, team manager Asanka Gurusinha announced coach Graham Ford would miss the rest of the match after suffering chest pains earlier in the morning following the death of his mother late Saturday night.

Speaking exclusively to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after the letter was published by The Times newspaper this morning Mr Johnson said: ""We need more flexibility when we're talking about stopping people who might pose a risk.""

"The concerns came amid Sportscotland plans to reduce sport funding in Scotland by 20. Scottish Athletics, which runs the initiative to encourage non-club runners to take exercise, said it was aware of the complaints and stressed that any issues were raised with them directly rather than via social media or other channels. Linda Curran, who lives on a hill near Stirling but is running for charity at this year's Virgin Money London Marathon has also been affected after she took part last week in her local race - the Jurassic 5k Fun Run. She had paid 12 before being told afterwards there would be no prize money if more than 40 people entered because each entrant would get a medal instead. However, only 29 entrants turned up so everyone got their medals without getting anything extra back from organisers, something they expected as the event costs just over 1,000 to put together including insurance. It then emerged that several others have complained about similar arrangements elsewhere since 2012. Curran says: ""I went along expecting nothing except my medal and I found out what was happening when arriving home later. My worry now though is that those events haven't been cancelled yet despite clearly breaking rules while some appear not even notified of previous breaches until 2015! Couldn't these things have all been spotted earlier? This whole issue seems like an excuse too easily made to dodge paying winners prizes - especially given how many races are raising funds through entry fees alone."" SportScotland say that although three sports where incidents happened did contact its team, none have reported apparent irregularities going forward following inspections conducted soon after receiving correspondence. Indeed two seem to have continued under new management whose focus will presumably include checking whether due process has always prevailed during existing timespans and particularly regarding recent years. The third instance involves Badminton England (which received one complaint) as well as both Northumberland Fire Service Rescue Authority and Durham County Council Sports Partnership Trust; neither body responded to requests seeking comment. In contrast, East Lothian Harriers Club treasurer Andrew Bruce tells AW he thinks his club followed official guidance correctly six months ago. At around the same time Glenrothes Athletic Club confirmed to AW that winning athletes do indeed receive cash prizes depending upon number of finishers plus medals per genderage group at its hosted parkrun series. For example at April's Woodhall Spa Parkrun, first place men aged 18-24 won 100 (6030). And while Glengairn Stonehaven AC remains committed it can offer either trophies, Tshirts, socks etc., never cold hard cash, it does pay into a central pool for the overall winner collected post run. But Simon Grant, chairperson of British Masters Track Running Association believes otherwise explaining why BMTRA has produced guidance specifically designed 'to avoid accusations of unfairness'. He stresses ""races should give clear notice beforehand as to what awards may or may not be available."" Meanwhile Scottish Athletics' Phil Smith adds: ""We want our clubs to follow good practice giving full disclosure prior to events taking place"" adding hat unless you spell everything out competitors could reasonably assume that it happens automatically.",0,241
"Jon Schueler, who died in New York in 1992 at the age of 75, created many of his pieces from a studio in Mallaig in the Highlands. He was inspired by both Gaelic art and modernism - as shown in this enchanting picture of him with fellow artist Sheila Hicks In an interview for BBC Radio Scotland's Archive on 4 programme, Doors To Yesterday: The Art Of Jon Schmidt Schuwer (June 27), he said that pictures were 'an escape' because they let you see something else than what is going round your head.' The documentary also looks into how Highland emigrants viewed their work when it came back home to them after years away working elsewhere or living abroad. One such piece now hangs proudly above my front door. It shows two men standing outside a church before taking off together across some water. Growing up I remember seeing these figures occasionally; more often however, I saw one of the same figure but riding a pony. This painting had hung over our sofa in Tain until last year where we moved house during lockdown. My husband arranged its return straightaway once we found a new place here near Loch Ness. This beach scene has been described as being reminiscent of Gauguin's Tahitian paintings while others have likened it to Joaquin Sorolla's landscapes It might not be anything special if seen in isolation but coming fresh from Shiela Hicks's latest exhibition Altered States which opened just days earlier at Aberdeen Art Gallery seemed like perfect timing given her emphasis upon memory and dreams within artwork. In fact there are so many commonalities between Ms Hicks's beautiful composition and Mr Schlueter's work. Both seem other-worldly yet grounded somehow, perhaps due to the texture created through brushstrokes or paint application and both tap into memories already stored deep down inside us all anyway. My own paternal grandfather arrived in Australia around 1910 aged 12 without his parents leaving behind only a brother still under 10. Sadly he did not stay long enough to start any family himself although later generations would keep alive links via photographs, letters and stories about the old country. But even then immigrants rarely mentioned much beyond the famine times and how hard life could get. When asked whether people liked Ireland, the answer nearly always became simply, ""Well ye no fit!"" There never seems to have been time to develop strong links with anyone apart from those closest to them especially once money started pouring out of the ground following gold rushes. Perhaps the real reason why locals don't talk too fondly of the past may well lie deeper still...",0,242

"In front of a home crowd in Birmingham, 27-year-old Yafai won 118-108, 119-107 and 119-107 on the judges' scorecards. Yafai knocked down the 31-year-old Japanese in the second round, but was unable to finish him off with his superior power punches before the bell sounded for the start of the next stanza. Vargas (25-2) began looking more dangerous after that early scare from Yafai as he rallied back into contention by flooring the Briton twice late in the third session. The Mexican challenger's best chance at an upset came earlier when referee Paul Latham gave Vargas time out while Yafai recovered from another knockdown during the fourth frame. ""I knew it wasn't over,"" said Yafai who improved his record to 26 wins against three losses since turning professional almost five years ago. ""He got caught good shots - big shot.

"Correspondents said the atmosphere at schools was subdued and many pupils had not returned. They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with immediate effect, adding that most of them were unaware of it until last night when they received messages from their children or heard about on television news stations last evening [Monday]. The Nation learnt some principals sent text message reminders to parents who did not pick up calls seeking clarification over the matter while others called aggrieved parents individually as soon as possible after getting information. The development came barely one week before public examination begins across the country. It has also prompted concerns among educators in private nursery, primary and secondary schools whose students are writing exams for external candidates this year. Federal Unity Colleges, which reopened yesterday, announced resumption dates ranging between May 4 and 17 depending on whether such institutions have national examinations scheduled during those periods. However, there is no indication yet if all other category of students would resume classes today (Tuesday). Sources close to ministries of education told our correspondents that Monday deadline given to proprietors of learning institutions could be reviewed based on the outcome of consultations with key stakeholders including the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 headed by Mr Boss Mustapha; National Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria and state governors. Some school owners however queried why federal authorities rushed into reopening classrooms without considering what impact the new policy might have on both teachers and students. Others wondered how feasible it will be working under present circumstances where majority of countries around the world ordered closure of educational facilities due to coronavirus pandemic. A source within a top management staff of an international organisation overseeing education sector disclosed: ""Last Thursday, I watched Minister Adamu Mohammed addressing journalists via televised presentation on the readiness of schools and he mentioned three major challenges facing us - lack of personal protective equipment like face masks that can guarantee safety against infection and social distancing."" He added: ""I think we should look for other options than opening schools now because many people may get infected through exposure to learners coming back to class."" In Abuja, a parent simply identified as Mrs Okafor expressed anxiety over her daughter's return to school any moment from Tuesday. Though she noted that some measures put in place by the government showed seriousness on its part but insisted more needs to done especially on socialphysical distancing aspect. She explained further: ""My daughter resumed on March 30th following announcement made earlier by President Muhammad Buhari then. When my husband got home last Friday, he asked me questions bordering on fears bothering on issues pertaining to health risk associated with sending kids back to school amid reports emerging globally concerning negative impacts of the virus. Finally, I gave him my consent to allow our child go back to school only because I noticed his increasing restlessness on her staying indoors since the stay-at-home order issued nationwide directive expired two weeks ago. We've prepared everything required here at home like sanitiser, hand gloves etc so that once she returns,we won't waste time doing things again.

"It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout. Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for Hibs when he somehow blazed over after being found unmarked by substitute Florian Kamberi with just keeper Remigijus Geda to beat in first half added time but it mattered little as Neil Lennon's side won their fourth match on the trot and were deserved winners against opponents whose organised rearguard action frustrated them without ever really threatening seriously themselves notwithstanding Josh Magennis' header that looked destined for the top corner until Ofir Marciano came up trumps late on. The fact this victory also means they leapfrog Celtic at the summit of Scottish football at least momentarily will be lost amid all the post-match euphoria although if results go their way tomorrow night then Sunday afternoon should see Hibs move into pole position for the title provided St Mirren fail to win away to Dundee United today or next Wednesday evening when Rangers entertain Livingston at Ibrox. What is certain though is that there are no easy games left now regardless of who you're playing because so many sides have proved capable of ending a run of successive wins - indeed Hibernian played out back-to-back draws during one recent sequence while only Aberdeen can boast four victories in succession having thumped Motherwell 5-2 last weekend before claiming another three points here yesterday courtesy of goals scored inside 15 minutes either end of the second period. For much of ninety minutes yesterday however both teams struggled to create too much fluency despite plenty more encouraging signs than we've seen recently about Hibs' attacking play since Flo Kamberi signed on loan from Grasshoppers Zurich last week. Indeed the Swiss striker could hardly believe his luck upon finding himself free between two defenders following good work by Martin Boyle down the right wing early on yet still managed not to get off a shot although his pass did release Jamie Murphy whose subsequent low drive was well held by Rodyga Gedvilekas. The Lithuanian goalkeeper had been handed an unexpected start after regular No 1 Tomas Cerny pulled something in training prior to kick oht, hastening his return to Germany whereupon Zdenek Zlamal joined him on the sidelines through injury meaning inexperienced youngster Matt Macey made his third appearance since joining from Arsenal on a season long loan deal. It wasn't quite his dream debut given how easily Paul Hanlon sent the ball in his direction shortly afterwards but unlike some other goalkeepers who'd played alongside Ross McCrorie during pre-season, neither young man appeared overly concerned as the ball rolled under his body allowing Nisbet to tap home unopposed. And that would prove enough to give the hosts the lead even if they didn't dominate proceedings during a relatively tame opening quarter hour and certainly weren't creating anything themselves beyond taking pot shots straight from corners nor posing any real threat once Adam Jackson cut out Drey Wright's cross intended for Kevin Holt as far as Allan Campbell whose downward header drew a save from Marciano moments later..",0,287

""If something came up then maybe it is possible."" Daly did not rule out playing against his former club this weekend but says that will be purely on personal terms rather than anything else as he kept matters professional while working under Steven Gerrard and Gary McAllister during their time together at Rangers. He added: ""It's one thing being friends outside football - you can banter all day long about things like family members or whatever.

"It says increases will be needed if current trends in teacher recruitment and retention continue. Nevertheless, the STRB has recommended a pay rise of just 1 for teachers in England next year - 2 per cent below inflation - which would result in an effective real-terms cut given that rising costs consume more than half of their salary budgets by 201920.

"Critics say the new contract involves pay cuts of up to 30, with ""normal hours"" extended to include 7am to 10pm on every day except Sunday. The British Medical Association has called it a disgrace and says no doctor could survive such working conditions without suffering severe stress or burnout. A protest was held outside parliament last week attended by several thousand people including NHS staff and their supporters from across Britain's political spectrum - even some Conservative voters who have been profoundly affected by funding shortfalls in recent years that left them waiting months for treatment at times. One woman told me her husband had died earlier this year after being forced to wait too long for an operation she said he desperately needed but which wasn't deemed urgent enough due to health service cutbacks. Many took banners saying: 'We are not robots.' A lot felt betrayed because doctors were among those who voted strongly to leave Europe precisely so they wouldn't be subject to EU rules dictating what kind if work can be classed as ""social,"" rather than strictly medical. They thought Brexit would allow more money into public services - never mind that Boris Johnson promised very early on those claims weren't true either when announcing his vision for leaving the bloc. Now there is anger directed towards him; I've heard plenty of talk about how much better things used to be under Tony Blair (even though Labour didn't abolish these kinds of contracts back then). These days many believe Jeremy Corbyn should also share blame since he initially refused to support strike action until late May.

'I don't want my children growing up like us': Londoners tell of poverty, hardship Read more Tensions run deep between junior medics and senior consultants over government plans to expand the number of places available through its Graduate Entry Scheme, aimed specifically at overseas recruits coming here post-Brexit. Thousands graduated during Covid already meaning training budgets have gone elsewhere amid a backlog caused by cancelled operations, delayed procedures and fewer students coming forward overall despite increased incentives. Aspiring GPs feel unfairly treated compared to European counterparts getting preferential access via family connections while surgeons get to choose where best suited geographically and financially. It all makes you wonder why anyone wants to join medicine right now. To mitigate against potential problems ahead we need far greater investment throughout our whole healthcare system, coupled with proper planning and clear communication regarding changes taking place as well as guarantees not only that existing workers won't lose out again following any transition period once free movement ends next December but that nurses will come here regardless given attractive salaries aren't guaranteed anywhere else yet. Then maybe we'd finally see the end of recruitment adverts promising wages higher than the average salary plus bonuses and other perks outside of London! With luck any future pandemics might bring issues around staffing levels upwards to national priority status before irreversible damage takes hold, especially considering social care often isn't mentioned alongside hospitals anymore although experts insist neither sector can operate successfully alone anyway.

"Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease. But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), inspectors no longer have the authority or power to do this themselves as it could lead them into an ""unacceptable risk"" where they might contaminate meat with their own blood and other bodily fluids if a dead animal was found with TB. Instead, when pigs are slaughtered at slaughterhouses there will only ever be one government vet present alongside staff from the food business operating the plant - who inspect each individual animal before being dispatched on its journey along production lines. The vets' role is limited to ensuring that any paperwork accompanying the animals is accurate; checking whether the pigs were fit for human consumption when bought by processors; making sure all packaging meets labeling requirements prior to dispatch but not during transit and assisting officials with investigations into suspected outbreaks of TB after processing has finished. This makes sense because investigating cases of bovine tuberculosis infection among live stock can take months while affected premises must remain closed until cleared. The FSA says there is nothing untoward about these changes: farmers face daily challenges such as feeding livestock properly, looking after hygiene levels around farms and managing risks associated with manure storage sites so should continue doing what they've always done anyway without relying too heavily upon state-sponsored inspections by the agency itself.""Overall, we expect most businesses carrying out these activities would already meet our standards,"" said Dr Monique White, head of BSE surveillance at the FSA. She added the decision had been taken due to concerns over how long it takes to investigate outbreak situations involving herds containing infected cattle - which often occur far away from slaughter plants near agricultural areas rather than inside factories which handle large numbers of carcass movements per day. It also reflects lessons learned following the 2013 West Coast E. coli O157:H7 outbreak, she claimed, where high death rates linked to contaminated meat led some consumers to believe UK authorities did little more than pay lip service towards food safety issues once processed foods left factory gates. But although refusing to look behind pork products may help ensure clean supermarket shelves across Europe, critics warn against ignoring fresh meats altogether. Dr Peter Stevenson runs Capital Vet Group Ltd., based outside London and works closely with small beef and dairy producers throughout England.. He agreed with Ms Byles that regular testing allows him to spot problems early on but insisted the limitations imposed last year by senior veterinary officers means he cannot monitor his clients' cows like he previously did himself. For example, instead of taking samples directly off cow udders every month during calving season, Mr Stevenson now relies solely on postmortem examination carried out at specialists labs operated jointly between Defra the Veterinary Health Laboratory Network. These facilities test for various diseases including scour caused by salmonella bacteria and Johne's Disease, which affects young calves unable to fight back, by collecting swabs from rectums via plastic tubing inserted through anus openings. If either illness appears then tests show up within 24 hours meaning immediate action can quickly follow to contain further spread of infection. Unfortunately many of those suffering Johne's die before anyone realises anything serious is wrong thanks largely down to tiny amounts of moisture getting trapped underneath skin folds surrounding udder teats even though bulls tend to expel milk immediately afterwards leaving calves vulnerable to infections later on life stages, said Mr Stevenson. Once symptoms appear surgery becomes necessary followed by treatment using costly drugs costing thousands pounds annually depending on their type.",0,340
"The pages from a 13th Century text of the holy book of Islam were purchased by the council in 1951. Conservator Richard Hawkes said: ""This is the earliest example of this type, there are other examples but they're all painted and not written."" He added that it had been mounted on to an early 20 century wooden box made for another piece. Mr Hawkes continued: ""It's unusual because usually these boxes wouldn't be given with books like this or paintings - often you'd find them more as documents where people wanted something small enough to carry around rather than heavy manuscripts which would have needed some sort of support structure inside a case.""

"Members of the Clwyd North Division are against the changes at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan. These could see clinical staff transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd and Wrexham Maelor hospitals from 6 November 2017 until further notice. The proposals have been met with some criticism by local residents calling for them not be implemented because they will increase waiting times for patients in need of urgent care as well as emergency treatment being available elsewhere across Mid Wales rather than a hospital that is on their doorstep. A campaign group has also sprung up which aims to stop the proposal going ahead arguing it's an ""over-reaction"" following safety concerns raised about AE services last year after two people died within four days while attending Glan Clwyd's Emergency Department during one week in April 2016 - although both deaths were found to be unrelated but there was still serious concern over patient safety levels due to overcrowding caused by rising demand.",0,342
"The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days. Plans for Green Park Station were put forward in the 1990s but have not come to fruition and as such it falls outside London's Underground network (which covers much of Central London). However, the connection between Paddington station - both mainline services from Waterloo and Crossrail trains destined for Heathrow Terminals 4 5 - and Green Park will be greatly improved by 2050 with the Western Gateway scheme connecting this part of West London directly into the Tube system at Cricklewood. The tunnel section between Euston Square GardensFarringdon Road and Liverpool Street stations was opened in 2017; however there are plans to extend further north via Old Oak Common and through the City of Westminster once again along Oxford Street before reaching Farringdon and then Green Park where the line splits off towards Sloane Square or South Kensington. Connections are quickly made from here onwards to destinations across central London including Victoria Station and all other major railway hubs like King's Cross St Pancras International, British Library, Tottenham Court Road, Bank station etc.. This multi-billion pound project includes proposals to build 3 skyscraper blocks up to 49 storeys high above ground level plus extensive pedestrian areas below them that would link these main junctions together seamlessly whilst providing additional office space within reach of many people working in this location who currently rely upon expensive housing costs elsewhere. These developments could accommodate over 10,000 new homes, commercial properties and public buildings! It should be noted that Eastern Gateway does not include any development opportunities nor funding mechanisms set aside yet even though significant engineering works needed to start construction already exist: so we may need to wait until 2030 if ever they get approved! Another recent addition included an extension down towards Islington and Highbury. Little Venice This small cluster of canalside streets is regarded one of Camden's most desirable neighbourhoods thanks mainly due to its mix of conservation and period houses alongside more modern residential apartments built in the late 1970s. For decades now it had been perceived only suitable for professional families seeking 2 or maybe 3 bedroom terraces offering private gardens overlooking Regent's Canal whereas young professionals preferred renting flats nearby since they often didn't want to commit financially to home ownership when they still lived relatively cheaply away on campus while studying abroad. Since 2010 Little Venice became very popular amongst students too looking specifically for 1 bed escape pads close enough to their university campuses without having to commute back each night after lectures finished. In recent years some larger family units did manage to get onto the property ladder living near the canal banks especially those willing to pay slightly higher prices than previously offered to smaller couples and singles asking rents no longer exceeding 1K per month during peak seasons. But despite being located just minutes walk from Camden Town tube station access to several restaurants remains limited compared to local alternatives available closer to Hampstead Village Swiss Cottage Primrose Hill. As well provides plenty of green spaces to explore walking distance away either side of Kentish Town Road although far less options become readily accessible beyond neighbouring Kingsland Road. Some shops do remain open later evening ultimately attracting customers heading out afterwards to bars and nightclubs operating past midnight unlike Hampstead Broadway becoming mostly quiet earlier hence why residents prefer shopping along the wide selection Avenue Road offers instead. Tufnell Park Located west of Angel Finchley Circulars Tufnel Park is arguably best known among UCL students for its sports facilities comprising two swimming pools, tennis courts, football pitches, multiple gyms and fitness rooms shared with University College London whilst the adjacent Tufnell Park tube stop provides direct links throughout the day allowing you to run errands locally rather than making your way uptown catching buses or changing tubes at various points depending how busy things happen to be running. With the latter option coming recommended anyway given the total number of underground lines serving this neighbourhood with plenty more joining here at Wood Lane meaning travelling anywhere else takes little time at all whether visiting another borough inside Greater London or venturing further afield. A growing community called ""New Town Farm"" aims to produce organic vegetables sold directly to consumers every Friday afternoon at a weekly market held near Tufnell Park Station car park next door to the Community Centre opening hours listed online. While a variety of pubs and clubs operate within easy driving distances covering everything ranging from live music venues hosting alternative rock bands playing electronica to jazz quintets performing bluesy tunes right down to traditional Irish folk songs played by virtuoso fiddle players accompanied by flute accordionists enjoying regular outings at weekends or weekdays.

"Sales volumes increased by 1.7 in November from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared with the same month last year, sales were up by 5. However, growth was driven largely by a massive jump of 54 percent increase on online shopping as restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus kept many Britons indoors and away from high streets, according to analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The ONS data showed that while the number of people visiting stores dropped 11.2 over the three months through October, it had barely changed since September after an initial drop-off when they reopened during July's lockdown only lasted about two weeks compared with six months earlier this year.

"A health tribunal has found Peter Sutcliffe no longer needs any treatment for any mental disorder. In 1981 he was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders and given 20 life sentences but the Yorkshire Ripper died in hospital on Sunday aged 74 from Covid-19 The decision means that Mr Justice Chamberlain will consider whether his underlying conditions mean it is'reasonably likely' that if released, he would be at risk of serious harm to himself or others Sutcliffe's ex Sonia Woodward (pictured), who survived a brutal attack by him while she worked in Leeds, said: 'I think plenty of people are going to feel very angry about this news - I'm not happy.' He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after being moved to Broadmoor secure hospital ten years ago where doctors have ever since treated him as though he had the condition. But experts believe many of his crimes could possibly be attributed to other factors such as cocaine abuse which may well have exacerbated an existing personality disorder rather than making him mentally ill. When asked during his trial whether what he did was sane behaviour, Sutcliffe replied: 'No, quite clearly it wasn't. The reason why you are asking me these questions now because my sanity should be questioned'. Pictured: Sutcliffe arriving back into court following sentencing In 2017, forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Johnson told how Sutcliffe might never reach full remission due to smoking cannabis and drinking heavily throughout most of his adult life - despite occasionally abstaining when living under 24 hour surveillance inside Broadmoor. After leaving prison in 2010 he continued taking drugs including LSD. Prof Johnson added that even if Sutcliffe does eventually achieve complete recovery there were still concerns over his ability to stay out of trouble once freed. He also feared the killer posed too great a danger to society to be allowed outside unsupervised. However Prof Phil Scraton today said: 'There is nothing wrong with someone like Ian Brady [who murdered five children] getting parole - we want them rehabilitated so they can go home again without problems.'",0,346

The EHRC says it is concerned by these increases as well as an increase in victims who are being ""intimidated or targeted because they belong to certain groups"" including those who identify themselves as Muslim, Jewish, Polish or Black British. It also notes further concerns over racially aggravated harassment and bullying at schools which could be related to Brexit-related discussions taking place within classrooms. As such, it urges teachers to address any issues around race equality before children go home for summer break so students can enjoy their holidays without confusion.",0,347

The tourist, a certified diver, went underwater on Tuesday and failed to resurface as the boat returned after its dive trip around 2pm (9am GMT). He could not be found despite an immediate search of the reef using two boats from the company's fleet that included a jet skier, police say. A post mortem will take place today but it is understood there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

"Prison inspectors discovered the average period of stay at the facility near Gatwick Airport had risen from 28 to 48 days. Twenty-three people were held for more than a year. Police found evidence, including CCTV footage, that'suggested Mr Wright was assaulted and potentially tortured' in his cell between 10pm on 26 December and 4am 27th', prosecutor Andrew Jackson said today Mr Johnson told jurors: 'The prosecution say this is an egregious case.' He added: 'Mr Wright died whilst he was being unlawfully detained by G4S staff who showed deliberate indifference to him as they left him lying unresponsive in their care over almost two hours before even attempting to seek assistance or summoning medical help. We will prove beyond reasonable doubt what happened during those crucial 45 minutes when there remained every opportunity to save Mr Wright's life after he was first observed by correctional officers slumped forward against some bars inside his cell. As I have already stated we are alleging these events led directly to Mr Wright's death without any intervention whatsoever until it became clear he was no longer breathing.' The inquest heard police launched Operation Sceptre into how he died following concerns raised about the adequacy of procedures in place across prisons run by private firms such as Serco (file photo) A jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing against prison officer Lee Deighton, 46, of Orpington, Kent; suspended custody manager Stephen Cribbins, 47, also of Orpington; healthcare assistant Joanne Hayes, 44, of Dartford, Kent; and support service worker Matthew Hanratty, 25, of Beckenham, south east London. They all denied manslaughter but were convicted yesterday. Lindon Coombes, 23, of Bromley Common, Greenwich, south east London, admitted assisting prisoners to escape. He has yet to be sentenced. All five defendants appeared in court via video link from HMP Bronzefield where they remain remanded ahead of sentencing next month. Sentencing would normally take place within six weeks of conviction - meaning the men could face years behind bars under current guidelines.

"Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header. The visitors tried hard but Oldham were comfortable defensively and as they pressed forward for an equaliser they looked vulnerable at set pieces - another of their Achilles heels this season that contributed directly to last week's defeat against Fleetwood Town. After 57 minutes came a second major blow after Khan was sent off by referee Gavin Ward, having been adjudged to have elbowed Payne inside the penalty area without appearing to get any contact on him. Payne had missed the best chance before then, his shot being blocked by Ben Garratt just prior to half time. Having said all those nice things about Grosicki didn't I... well here's some more! After 60 minutes he made it 2-0 with a great finish into the roof of the net following good work down the left wing by Jack Byrne. It seems his team mates are able to feed off his confidence too whilst also creating chances themselves. A fantastic strike. The provider? David Ball who showed exactly how classy he is playing through the centre behind two strikers (as opposed to one).

Sibery told police that they had been arguing when it became physical with Ashleigh grabbing his throat. He claimed this caused her death as because of previous injuries he believed she was breathing through broken ribs so stopped trying to resuscitate her until paramedics arrived some time later. But Northumbria Police launched an investigation into possible murder after it found Ms Sibery's body cold to touch but still warm to the touch which meant there were no signs she'd suffered any injury or trauma for several days before being dead.

"The men, identifying themselves Andreas Richter and Piotr Koper, appeared on the country's TVP public television. In a statement they said they had ""irrefutable evidence"" the train existed, but failed to produce any physical object that would support their claims - showing only maps of what appear to be railways in Poland from World War II and satellite photos which could indicate tracks or damage caused by fighting, as well as video analysis suggesting it was not possible for an ordinary locomotive to have made such a trip. They also claimed to possess footage taken at the site of the crash itself, photographic images purporting to show Hitler's bunker under Berlin after 1945 (though these were later dismissed), documents detailing plans drawn up before the war by Nazi engineers, as well as eyewitness accounts collected by a German academic named Martin Bormann who worked with Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda during WWII. The pair claim to know where some of these items are kept today, though none has been seen publicly since. While there is no clear historical consensus regarding whether Operation Valkyrie ever took place, this particular story just didn't add up. It lacked even basic plausibility; if the allies really did open fire upon escaping top Nazis while chasing them down railway lines, why wouldn't someone document this fact? And then there were the questions about how exactly a group composed entirely of German officers managed to make its way into Soviet territory undetected... perhaps more importantly: Why hadn't anyone reported this alleged incident either during the chaos immediately following Germany's defeat or decades earlier when Cold War tensions seemed much lower between East and West than they do now? This whole thing simply smelled fishy. There must've been another explanation behind all those reports claiming otherwise. But still nothing came off the rails quite so spectacularly until 2017, when Ukrainian filmmaker Roman Bondar announced he'd found proof the Germans actually pulled something like this one off ... somewhere else altogether.

"Sexton suffered a suspected groin injury, before O'Connell was carried off at the end of the first half. Leading 9-6 at half-time, Rob Kearney's try increased Ireland's lead before O'Mahony and Sexton added further scores to seal an impressive win in Murrayfield for Joe Schmidt's men with Simon Zebo scoring Scotland's only points from five kicks at goal. Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw believes that his side need to start converting their chances into wins after they were left frustrated by defeat against Ireland on Saturday evening as Johnny Sexton scored all 22 Irish points. The Scots had led 6-3 early on but managed just two penalties courtesy of Duncan Weir until Odsonne Edouard grabbed possession near halfway and released Jacob Stockdale who sprinted through the defence to score under the posts back around 10 minutes later. A second successful conversion gave them some breathing space out in front ahead of the interval before Sexton kicked three more penalty goals immediately upon resumption to turn the game completely Scotland's way as he also converted tries from Tadhg Furlong, Sean Cronin and Keith Earls either side of another Weir effort which narrowed it down again late on despite Connacht man Jack Carty having replaced Sexton several times during the contest when he looked set to be taken to hospital following his battle with HIA protocols. ""We are getting there,"" said head coach Gregor Townsend afterwards about how far this young squad is coming along since last year's World Cup.

"It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence.

The Strathclyde Shipbuilding Company is credited as being one of Scotland's most successful shipyards during World War II, producing numerous types of vessels such as trawlers, FPAs (fast patrol craft), corvettes, tankers etc. These were mostly built under licence at Stockton-on-Tees but also used steel manufactured locally at Motherwell on occasion.

"Rafael Esquivel admitted receiving bribes in connection with the sale of marketing rights to tournaments. He was among seven officials arrested at a luxury hotel in Switzerland last year. More than 20 million is alleged to have been embezzled from soccer's world governing body FIFA during more than two decades, U.S and Swiss authorities said when they unveiled indictments against 14 people in May 2015. The charges included racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracies for allegedly accepting millions of dollars linked to lucrative media deals in exchange for the awarding of television broadcasting contracts by FIFA - once led by Sepp Blatter until he resigned that same month amid corruption allegations engulfing soccer's global governing body. The indictment does not name the sports company or companies involved but says the bribery scheme dated back as far 1999. Esquivel pleaded guilty before federal judge Pamela Chen on Dec. 23 ""to one count each of conspiring ... (and) engaging"" in an effort to defraud Qatar Stars League clubs, Mexican club Santos Laguna FC, Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle and Honduran team Olimpia FC, according to court filings unsealed Wednesday which detailed his cooperation agreement signed early this month. His sentencing hearing will be scheduled pending further proceedings related to other defendants who also face trial on various counts stemming from the massive probe into state-sponsored soccer graft. In conjunction with prosecutors' request made Tuesday for Esquivel's assistance, Special Counsel Robert Mueller recommended leniency for him under the federal guidelines based on his level of participation and that he had agreed to cooperate fully going forward.

They knew bin Laden's life story: From early childhood poverty with time spent living among Mujahideen fighters battling Soviet forces during Afghanistan's civil war; moving into Sudan before 911 followed quickly after its fall under intense pressure from the CIA (he'd been allowed safe haven there since 1992) where he set up camp like some medieval leader surrounded by loyal followers while seeking funding and training across borders. It wasn't until last year however Bin Laden fell out of favour due partly to disagreements over how much money should go towards fighting other Muslim groups such as al Qaeda splinter group Islamic State instead of the United States which culminated in Bin Laden refusing direct contact with senior Afghan Taliban leaders and accusing them in turn of being ""American agents."" Those accusations are not made lightly given founder Mullah Omar has always denied any collusion between himself and America but rather than causing resentment among ordinary Afghans their claims seem only to have reinforced loyalty amongst younger generations already inspired religiously through social media channels and mosques dedicated to extremist teachings on Salafism - another strand of Islam founded around 13th century Saudi Arabia.",0,395

"Andrew Apperley, 38, from Eastbourne, was reported missing after failing to return to his hotel four days after going to a Full Moon party. Richard Apperley said the situation was 'heartbreaking', adding that he would miss out on seeing him walk down the aisle The family of an Australian man who went missing in Thailand have been told by police they will continue their search for several more months and may never find answers about what happened to him (pictured is Mr Apperely's brother with Thai authorities) A body found near a riverbank in Ratchaburi province has not yet been identified as belonging to Mr Apperley but Relatives are pleading for any information regarding the disappearance of Andrew John Papell (pictured), who disappeared while travelling around Southeast Asia last month Mr Apperley had also posted photographs online appearing to show himself enjoying alcoholic drinks at parties hosted in Bangkok during New Year celebrations Police captain Krissana Pattanacharoen added: 'We can't say if this person is related or unrelated [to this case]. The investigation continues.' 'Nothing conclusive so far,' she added when asked whether those remains were linked to the suspected murder of Andrew. Ms Eriksen-Jorgensen earlier revealed how her son started partying shortly before Christmas 2016 - visiting bars across Australia until early 2017. He then flew overseas where he spent time in Bali, Singapore, Malaysia and Cambodia. In March 2018, two weeks before he vanished, friends noticed something unusual about some Instagram posts made under his name. One post showed three people standing next to each other wearing dresses and holding up one finger. Another photo appeared to be taken inside a toilet cubicle with blood splattered walls. When Ms Jorgensen realised it could possibly allude to drug use, she contacted Interpol which later tracked down each friend involved in posting these images through IP addresses and email accounts. It led them back to Melbourne nightclubs. She claimed one former boyfriend even confessed to drugging and raping her son prior to leaving home. However, no charges ever came against anyone as both men denied allegations, according to 9News.com.au. Afterwards, Mr Apperley changed his profile picture to include a blue heart emoji alongside text saying: "" I love you guys'. His mother hoped this meant he was finally overcoming problems such as depression. She heard nothing further from her son. Pictured above is his Facebook page showing someone dressed like Michael Jackson dancing in front of the moon On July 8, two blogger friends called Oatsy Badger and Kyle Wilson announced via YouTube channel LightShed Podcast that they believed Mr Apperley died six months ago because social media users saw photos of his corpse online. They believe he drowned. Friends and relatives confirmed they'd seen similar pictures online too He returned to Sydney just once since January 11, asking his parents over FaceTime to take him swimming at Bondi Beach, telling them it was nice there compared to Bangkok weather. But it wasn't long into a new year adventure away from home that became increasingly bizarre, leading most interested observers to question everything still surrounding his apparent tragic death within the past few weeks. A video supposedly uploaded onto Snapchat shows him smiling happily whilst surrounded by beer bottles and pillows - indicating alcohol consumption - lying face down outside. Then, concerning messages began coming in from worried loved ones; persistently inquiring why he hadn't checked in following previous promises almost every day.

"Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous.

""It's a fantastic game that we all enjoy,"" said Prof Pollock, who led the research with Dr Kristina Skierka from Wolfson College. ""But if you're going to play, why are there so many injuries? Why aren't people keeping their brains alive while they keep on playing?"" Play Video 1:44 'We have no choice': players fall silent during first minute of Super League games - video report The researchers looked specifically at four types of tackle - head-high (above shoulder height), low or high-to-low, high-mid-off (hits above midriff) and side hits below waist level. Each was associated with more severe injury than others. The data were collected between 2014 and 2017 by monitoring medical records from professional rugby league matches played across England. In total the study included 722 career concussions among 2,364 men aged 18-35 years old. There was a progressive increase over time in concussion frequency so that 8 of players sustained one per season within six seasons; 15 in seven seasons and 27 in eight seasons. Of these numbers 60 occurred when tackling highhead-high and 32 involved multiple blows to the head as part of this tackle alone. 23 took place after tackles involving players being tackled near to the ground. Skierka says other sports such as Australian Rules football which has rules aimed preventing skull fractures also show higher rates of brain trauma compared with rugby union where helmets prevent more serious impacts happening. Comparing both codes she found less risk from head-high tackles in women because they tend to use lower levels of force whereas, for example, male backs often engage in fierce clashes around rucks due to positions and tactics used in lineouts leading to greater risks overall. She recommends reducing most forms of mandatory body checking before lowering legal limits on how hard tacklers should hit each other. Currently World Rugby only bans neck roll techniques designed to choke opponents' airways. Players caught performing them can face three weeks out plus possible further punishment depending upon match review panel decisions. It does not ban taking off rival team members legs just like NFL rule changes mean fewer defensive players are allowed to land full weight on quarterbacks. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A player receives treatment following a collision Photograph: Richard SellersPA Images via Getty Images Pollack argues the same kind of change would reduce head impact injury in rugby league though admits it may make some collisions look even uglier and harder hitting. But he calls current law enforcement ineffective anyway as challenges remain difficult to assess objectively since hairline damage suffered in training often goes unreported meaning incidents deemed innocuous become red card offences once put under scrutiny by officials. He adds that simply banning certain styles could lead to unintended consequences given different shape heads experience coming into contact differently. Overall though his findings suggest repeated heavy traumas occurring regularly enough causes long term harm similar to those experienced by boxers affected by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known colloquially as CTE. This is described as neurodegenerative disease believed caused by repetitive knocks inflicted mainly through boxing punches yet increasingly seen in American Football players although its exact causes remain unclear. Current evidence suggests any number of factors including genetics and age might contribute towards susceptibility alongside lifestyle choices affecting diet alcohol intake etc.. Risks rise rapidly late teens early 20s mostly linked closely to physical activity but younger athletes may also be vulnerable especially if already prone to psychological problems. CTE first came to prominence with former USA footballer Junior Seau having shot himself dead aged 43 in 2012 leaving behind a note saying he wanted to leave behind clues about what had happened to him physically throughout life. His case spurred a flurry of ongoing studies now revealing the condition afflicts thousands of retired pros particularly at higher risk include ex-rugby union international Alix Popham diagnosed posthumously aged 40 last year.

"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that this behaviour is linked to bird-to-bird communication via subtle head movements in which individual petrels subtly signal each other's presence when foraging together as pairs or small groups. Dr David Lohmann of Cornell University told BBC News: ""This study provides us with indirect evidence through experiments that some birds are using head postures where they can look at something without moving their whole neck."" The scientists conclude that these signals help the birds quickly assess whether it pays to join up with others - an important survival skill since food resources vary widely across the oceanic islands inhabited by many seabirds (Image 1).

"The normal body tissues show up as green, while the cancer comes out as intense red spots. The team, at the University of Tokyo and the RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center, has published their results in the journal Scientific Reports. This work was done on mouse tissue samples that were taken from mice with breast tumors after surgery to remove them. Researchers first stained these cells for a protein called CD34 so they could tell which ones were healthy or unhealthy. Then those cells were labeled with another marker (PDF) called CM11 that fluoresces when exposed to blue light. Finally, some more tumor-specific markers are used; each one lights up separately under different wavelengths of light: 633 nm is used by green algae, 532nm by bacteria, 529 nm by researchers studying photosynthesis, 488nm by plants, 395nm by insects, and 365nm by humans - so it's not just visible but also compatible with most off-the-shelf microscopes. And if you've ever watched glowing bioluminescent plankton before bedtime, then this last bit will sound familiar too.

"Jocelyn McKay is now 81 and said she feels ""released"" from the feelings that gripped her for so long. ""I may be old, but at least I am happy,"" she added in a statement read out by lawyer Michael O'Riordan on Wednesday before Judge John Morrissey ordered her to pay 3m damages. The judge had earlier heard evidence of how Ms McKay's husband promised their children that they would inherit his family home when he died after which it was not sold or given away despite having been valued as being worth more than 1 million (840 000). He also gave instructions regarding who should have custody over them if anything happened to him, with Ms McKay receiving access only once every three months while spending Christmas Day alone without any contact from anyone during those days except Mr Dwyer whom she regarded as both a father figure and friend. In March 2011, he requested to take temporary sole guardianship of one child because he feared what might happen to himself following an accident where he sustained multiple injuries including fractures and broken bones requiring surgery. However, this request did not result in changes made inside the house, according to evidence presented. The court previously heard there were no locks on doors throughout most areas of the property apart from bedrooms which prevented neighbours seeing who went in and out - save for two windows located near the kitchen area through which people could view into the garden. There were only four keys issued for entering the front door allowing entry to all rooms within. When gardai first arrived at the scene they found Ms McKay unconscious lying face down beside the fireplace surrounded by empty vodka bottles with another partially consumed bottle nearby along with a number of prescription tablets scattered about. Four further pills in blister packs containing Nembutal along with some anxiety medication were later uncovered behind a sofa cushion. She has since spent time living in various care homes due mainly to problems caused by alcohol abuse; however, she still sleeps downstairs in the main bedroom of the cottage next to the main entrance steps leading up towards the rear patio doors overlooking the back yard. A security light above these steps can illuminate the room creating shadows around its perimeter making escape attempts difficult under normal circumstances, Mr McSweeney told the sitting Tuesday morning claiming the presence of such lights posed potential risks to others especially elderly residents walking past late at night seeking assistance. But even lifting someone off the ground requires turning off the switch outside then switching it again to re-enable operation meaning either party would have known there are other tenants sleeping upstairs for privacy reasons. He also claimed any noise coming form the top floor was usually generated by medical equipment used daily by clients brought regularly to see professionals working at the practice below with lemons placed strategically against walls meant keep sounds muffled stopping patients hearing voices calling out directly beneath their feet. On occasion individuals visiting Dr Fennell must wear ear protectors placing strain upon communication between doctor and patient rendering speech disjointed adding extra challenges to keeping conversations private. It was put forward by counsel assisting Colin Ryan SC that Dr Fennell cannot recall ever asking whether silence indoors was necessary particularly while treating vulnerable adults who require help navigating unfamiliar environments yet find themselves dependent upon getting directions right each time otherwise risking injury falling awkwardly out of step while moving across floors carrying heavy objects.

"Daniel Bragg, 37, hit Julie Cook, 44, so hard he broke her left eye socket in the assault, police said. Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, losing consciousness for a short time before being taken to hospital where she needed surgery and was kept under observation overnight Bragg, of Stockton-on Tees, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to grievous bodily harm with intent while armed. He had been due to stand trial but changed his plea today. He will be sentenced tomorrow morning when it is expected that two other charges against him - wounding with intent - will also go ahead alongside this conviction. Sentencing guidelines state Bragg faces up to 12 years behind bars. Prosecutor Rachel Masters told Teesside Crown Court how Bragg attacked his victim after they returned home from visiting friends together. The pair spent much of their relationship apart as each lived with different partners. They got back together however during lockdown last year, which has now ended temporarily because of England's third national coronavirus shutdown. The court heard how Mr Bragg began drinking excessively resulting in them getting into arguments and Ms Cook leaving in the early hours of September 25 last year. She later decided to return around 3am or 4am on Sunday November 1 2020 'out of concern' for what might happen if she didn't come back soon enough. It was then that Bragg struck out violently towards the mother-of-two who suffered brain injuries and lost sight in one eye following the vicious attack. Mr Justice Goss added: ""She describes you as controlling throughout your relationship with her."" Julie described how Daniel would often turn violent over nothing and control every aspect of her life including not allowing any men round In evidence read on behalf by Danielle Binns prosecuting, Julie explained how he started attacking her after returning home drunk. She stated: I] tried telling him I wanted my stuff and we were done [but] he just wouldn't let me leave until there wasn't anymore room for me inside so finally felt like I couldn't get away from him without hurting myself even more than already did.""",0,447

"The suppliers, one making seats and the other parts used in gearboxes, have stopped delivering to VW in a contract row. Car and parts production has already been halted at some sites as workers go on strike until Monday, while no new orders will be taken at others until Tuesday afternoon, sources close to the company said. VW declined comment ahead of an event with union leaders later Friday morning that is being closely watched by investors who fear disruptions could spread across Germany's car industry if talks fail to resolve the dispute during Europe's summer vacation season - when plants are closed anyway for two weeks or more. Most analysts say they still see limited short-term impact from the stoppages unless it drags out further than three days or leads to widespread strikes elsewhere in the sector. But many economists warn there would likely be serious knock-on effects next year due to reduced supply capacity given the complexity of car manufacturing processes where even minor delays can affect the component flow of entire vehicle lines. ""If this continues beyond Sunday then we'll start getting into real trouble,"" warned Ralph Wiechers, head economist at Commerzbank AG, adding he saw only a 5 percent chance of such extreme circumstances occurring.

"The athlete set records for the fastest marathon for a double amputee and has won two Paralympic 200m gold medals. Photographer David Baird has charted Whitehead's progress for many years, as he tells BBC Sport: ""I first took one of Steve's photos when I was shooting at an event in Bristol 20-odd years ago,"" says photographer David Baird. ""He said that if you wanted to do something great with your life then go into sport photography - so from day one we were on the same page."" This week, their relationship is being celebrated by National Geographic magazine which named him this year's Sports Photojournalist Of The Year (SPOTY) after his series about Para-athlete Richard Whitehead won last year's Action category prize. It marks the culmination of 10 days spent following Whitehead across five continents during 2018. A body composition scan will give me some baseline figures but no matter how much weight I lose or how strong my legs are it doesn't change anything physiologically in terms of what goes wrong between my ears. For people who have never been injured there can be quite a gap because they don't understand pain management or rehabilitation, let alone having lost limb function yourself. In order to tell someone else's story well you need empathy; understanding injury psychology helps create those connections and help them feel like part of a team rather than just another face in front of the camera. There had already been plenty of press coverage around all aspects of Whitehead's training and preparation before meeting up again ahead of the World Championships in Dubai earlier this month where 42 athletes competed under the banner 'Para Athletics'. But few visitors would know more about his everyday existence outside competition than Baird and his fellow photojournalists Daniel Gravis and Tim Clayton. After initially agreeing not speak about each other while working together, now everyone seems happy enough to share stories over beers later in the evening back in London sober ones. Their work ethic also shines through once off camera too; spending long hours waiting out the rain in freezing temperatures until photographers' light meters start flashing red means getting close to the action without actually crossing its path. That extra effort pays dividends though; capturing intimate moments such as Whitehead jogging alongside his guide runner Peter Knight's wife at Dorney Lake near Windsor Castle or sprinting towards home winning the men's 100m T38 race at the European championships in Berlin. Asking for permission isn't always necessary either; Baird got Whitehead running past Buckingham Palace en route to filming from Tower Bridge for a TV segment, before encouraging spectators along the South Bank promenade to cheer louder every time he went past. We've shared countless conversations both personally and professionally throughout our careers... When he broke world records aged 14, [Whitehead] told us via text message saying 'that's amazing, keep going!' To hear a young man say that meant everything to us because none of these things happen overnight even when success does come very quickly. Having seen different sides within athletics, swimming, cycling etc., probably the biggest challenge para sports faces compared to able bodied competitors relates to funding - especially the younger generations coming through. With disability comes challenges whether physical or psychological meaning the burden falls heavier onto personal support workerspartners, parents etcetera whereas able bodies get financial backing straight away. Any journalist covering any kind of sporting events should understand completely why disabled individuals want access to certain areas, facilities equipment which may seem basic but is essential given limited opportunities available due to local authority budgets cuts etc. If nothing changes soon then Britain could really struggle against rivals further down field in terms of talent pool availability. Thankfully British Athletics invests heavily into grassroots programmes helping youngsters regardless of ability gain crucial experience competing alongside others irrespective of impairment requirements. Even Mr Blobby himself knows Steve Whitaker is high quality stuff! All three journalists agree that the best thing anyone could ever achieve is self belief. No doubt the words of encouragement offered by Whitehead early on in Baird's career helped spur ambitions to become a fulltime professional photographer perhaps further fuelled by witnessing US track star Oscar Pistorius compete in 2012. Watching a double leg amputee run 400m faster than most elite sprinters came as a shock to the system although flashbulbs apparently weren't needed to capture images making history forever. Another highlight included capturing shots of Chris Froome arriving late to Team Sky's pre-race briefing at Paris-Roubaix 2015 in contrast to Bradley Wiggins jumping on board ready for battle aboard Sir Dave Brailsford's bike shortly afterwards. Although trepidation crept in when hitting refresh on Twitter anticipating negative comments regarding prior accusations surrounding performance enhancing drug use amongst cyclists despite evidence suggesting otherwise, sometimes truth hurts. Yet not giving up was worth fighting tooth and nail for in the end as confidence levels soared seeing several projects completed from Whitehead including featuring in October 2017 edition of Men's Health UK, plus speaking engagements in schools whilst continuing to travel annually overseas partly funded by commercial shoots involving brands targeting audiences eager to see real inspirational heroes portrayed instead of fantasy idealised characters.

"All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination showed that almost all had a distinct pelvis and vertebrae - which is what you'd expect from pelvic bones associated with an adult animal giving birth. So we know it could be done: long-necked dinosaurs such as Brachiosaurus gave birth by pushing the baby out through its cloaca (the hole where waste leaves a dinosaur). So why didn't the first archosaurs do likewise? Why were they laying eggs instead if they shared so many other features between them and living reptiles today? Some experts even suggest that reproduction may have been more difficult for early animals because eggshells are stronger than shells formed during life; however, our analysis shows no evidence showing how much tougher or thinner these ancient eggshell membranes might have become over time. The answer probably lies somewhere else... but nobody has yet pinpointed exactly when those changes took place.",0,479

"Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks ""resilience."" South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) runs the phone line and has said calls have increased by up to 30 percent. The OCCG is now considering whether it should be extended for another 12 months through a contract extension - but that could mean an increase in price from 3m per year. The current deal expires on November 31 this year. After more than 150 responses were received during last week's consultation period about changes to emergency ambulance cover across Oxfordshire, including 17 responses from local clinical commission groups (CCGs). Consultation documents showed there was widespread support among CCGs for extending the 111 service beyond March 2018.

"Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun. Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, which was first seen by astronomers more than 50 years ago and is believed to weigh roughly 450 solar masses yet still has not been directly observed - although it may have been glimpsed briefly through an eclipse). Image copyright NASA Image caption The Hubble Ultra Deep Field took advantage of the 11-year gap between servicing missions for Nasa's famed space telescope ""This catalogue tells us we need a better understanding about how black holes form,"" explained Prof Jamie Bock from CaltechIPACS. The new results also confirm several other longstanding mysteries involving these strange objects: they are far less dense than expected; their orbits can change dramatically over time rather like planets circling around stars or moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn; they appear to eject material out into intergalactic space at high speeds when they grow rapidly. And there doesn't seem to be any correlation between size and mass either. There are at least half a million supermassive blackholes lurking across our observable Universe but this one stands alone because of its apparent youth and proximity (it lies just under 25,000 light-years away in the southern constellation Fornax). This means that if future instruments such as ESO's Extremely Large Telescope do discover others nearby then this will provide further clues as to what makes them tick so quickly after the Big Bang itself teemed with lots of activity.

"Researchers hope to learn how much it weighed, how it moved and what it used its iconic back plates for. A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones in 3D using X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners at the Natural History Museum's Centre for GeoGenetics in Cambridge, which is part funded by a grant from the National Geographic Society. The researchers also plan to study DNA samples taken during expeditions that discovered new pterosaur species on islands off Madagascar or Komodo Island, an area where they haven't previously found any evidence of ancient reptiles living there - a sign that these animals might have lived elsewhere as well but were wiped out before scientists could explore them with advanced technology such as CT scanning. ""We are trying to bring all this information together to create a family tree,"" says David Martill of the University of Portsmouth, who leads the project along with his colleague Nizar Ibrahim. But even if they can assemble one based only on their physical remains, other experts say more questions will remain unsolved about Pteranodon than answers: How many subspecies did it evolve into?

"That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury says his decision to go into exile after beating Wladimir Klitschko was necessary because he had ""hit rock bottom."" Fury stopped Klitschko at Duesseldorf's Esprit Arena on 29 November 2015 with a stunning display of boxing that earned him praise from many observers. But just 68 days later, the 28-year-old announced he would never fight again as it appeared an addiction to cocaine and alcohol were beginning to take their toll. ""I didn't know how much damage I'd done,"" said Fury ahead of Saturday night's rematch against Ukrainian Klitscko at the Manchester Arena. The 28-year-old, who fought for more than three years before winning world titles, watched footage of himself during training camp and found there was little resemblance between what happened then and now. He added: ""It makes me sick seeing myself like that. It made me realise where my life could have gone if I hadn't been able to stop."" After stepping away from the ring following his win over Klitschko, Fury became embroiled in controversy when he claimed fellow British boxer Anthony Joshua should be shot for fighting ""like a black guy."" He also criticised homosexuality and raped women. In March 2016, UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) requested samples taken from Fury by testers shortly before his stoppage victory over Francesco Pianeta in August 2015. In April 2017 Ukad informed the fighter they had recorded traces of nandrolone metabolites in two urine samples. The substance can improve strength but can also mask evidence of other illegal substances being used. Three months ago, Ukad withdrew its case citing lack of evidence, saying neither party wished to proceed further or appeal to the independent National Antidoping Panel (Nasp). Shortly afterwards Fury confirmed plans to return to action within 12 weeks without giving any details about opponents, venues or dates. On Tuesday, promoter Frank Warren revealed American Deontay Wilder will face unbeaten Cuban Luis Ortiz on 6 September, with a likely date of 14 October set aside for the bout.",0,495

The use of filters, lighting techniques and apps further enhance user experience and interaction via photographs posted showcasing idealised versions of reality versus real life situations allowing individuals to project personal opinions regarding the images displayed onto representations created using visual technology resulting in idealisations of physical attraction. Social influence influences cultural perception surrounding fashion, fitness, health, career aspirations, sexual preferences including size specific ideals particularly relating to female representation leading to unrealistic standards causing great concern among young adults, adolescents and teenagers suffering from poor mental states, anxiety disorders, low moods, isolationism, loneliness, stress impacting negatively upon educational attainment increasing rates of exclusionary behaviour contributing to feelings of inadequacy requiring support programs addressing issues arising form misinformation distributed across digital networks leading to disordered eating patterns characterising today"" So far 2017 sees Jada Louise continuing to set benchmarks higher as inspirational internet starlet dedicated to encouraging her fans to Love Themselves despite perceived imperfections thanks largely to the lure of easy access mirror selfie tools freely available on smartphones globally.

The satellite uses radar imaging technology developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) which has been used on several previous missions including its first Sentry mission launched in 2007. Unlike other satellites that send information back to remote ground stations via radio signals, Sentinel 1B measures ocean conditions using high resolution ""pings"" sent through the water itself between the spacecraft and an antenna array located on land. This method allows scientists to measure waves, currents, sea ice extent and snow cover with greater accuracy than ever before.

It may have been different if he hadn't survived what could well be termed umpire's call as Mohammed Shami was given lbw only for replays to show that the thick edge missed leg stump completely. But there didn't seem much doubt about other dismissals like Wriddhiman Saha failing once again when caught behind down the leg side or Hardik Pandya spooning one straight up in air off Lungi Ngidi. Some might argue that batsmen need to do better than throwing their wickets away especially someone like R Ashwin who has now hit six ducks in eight Tests in England. Not many would disagree either considering how badly times are going for them right now having lost five matches chasing totals of 170 plus so far across formats starting with the ODI series opener between these sides followed by T20Is and now Tests. As also seen yesterday, AB de Villiers showed why he remains such a class apart because on another day batting conditions can turn tricky allowing Ravindra Jadeja time enough to run around the ring multiple times keeping the fielders busy. That worked wonderfully in De Villiers' favour till Ishant Sharma drew blood from his pad pegging the Proteas legend back to 13 (72b; 1x4, 2x6). Later Markram joined Quinton de Kock (57), taking advantage of a drop catch offered by MS Dhoni off Umesh Yadav's bowling thanks to poor work from Rohit Sharma diving towards short fine-leg. However, just when things started looking up for the hosts on Day Two, Kohli called for declaration leading to another spell from spinners where most of the action happened after Bhuvneshwar Kumar struck within minutes with debutante Nadhim Zadran (0) edging one straight to Mahendra Singh Dhoni after scoring three off 29 deliveries.

"Revised growth estimates now suggest the construction industry shrank in the first quarter of 2012, but by less than previously thought. Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean that Britain's economic output did not shrink at all during January-March and held up better than most other countries.' A senior analyst with Capital Economics says: 'The building PMI rose from 49.2 last month (January) to 50.9 this time round, even though new orders fell for a second consecutive survey period.... The small improvement is welcome news given that surveys elsewhere are pointing towards another sharp fall in manufacturing activity over the past few months due largely to weakness across Europe. In our view it has become clear that UK manufacturers will have done much worse in Q1 as a whole compared with their counterparts abroad because they rely more on exports while domestic demand weakened substantially earlier in the year - perhaps somewhat earlier than expected under the impact of euro area crisis worries...'",0,522

In his address, Vice President Nicolas Maduro broke down as he thanked Cabinet ministers for their support since Mr Chavez announced last month that the cancer had returned after four years in remission. At one point during an impassioned speech, Mr Maduro fell off a stool while speaking at a podium set up outside the Miraflores Presidential Palace. He later stood back up with help from aides.

Some economists say such plans ignore public debt levels which have climbed above 60 billion (S85b) this year - or around 60 per cent of GDP. Critics accuse Mr Chavez of reckless spending throughout most of his 14-year presidency, including massive social programmes aimed at combating poverty and reducing inequality.

"Media playback is not supported on this device At 44 years old, Owens was the oldest of the 12 referees chosen for the World Cup, but his age will not be a factor in Brazil ""I think it's about being honest with yourself,"" he says. ""When you are young and that desire to referee comes over you... I wanted to achieve everything there could possibly be to do as an official."" Owens had already been part of two England youth international teams before making his debut at full level aged just 21 - marking him out from many other officials who have emerged into senior football via lower leagues or non-league clubs. He went on to take charge of top matches including both legs of Manchester United v Arsenal's famous 2006 FA Cup semi-final victory; Liverpool beating Chelsea 3-1 en route to winning their sixth European Cup later that season; plus Champions League games involving Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AC Milan. In 2010 he became only the second Englishman after David Elleray to officiate at three major tournaments (Euro 2008, South Africa 2010 and Euro 2012) when taking charge of nine games across those events. Sir Howard Webb followed suit four years later by becoming the first British ref at four straight finals. And here we now are again with Owens' profile having risen almost beyond recognition since 2014 thanks mostly to one incident: the quarter-final between France and Romania which saw striker Florin Gardos sent off following a handball outside the area against the hosts during extra time. It meant Les Bleus progressed 4-3 despite trailing 1-0 early on. The decision sparked fury among fans back home yet further fuelled belief within French media circles that they were denied justice because of Owens' nationality. The man himself has never taken offence either though does admit feeling slightly embarrassed watching how far things escalated afterwards given its roots in such a tiny moment.

""But obviously, once people start talking like that then it starts gathering momentum quite quickly so yes, what happened did surprise me."" As expected in these situations, social networking sites provided fertile ground without too much prompting along similar lines. One comment suggested Owens must have ignored several red cards handed down elsewhere due to shirt colour while another simply said 'fing ct'. Paul Devlin may well know exactly why some feel negatively towards the Welshman considering he spent 25 years in various roles around world soccer. As head of global technology policy development with FIFA until retiring earlier this month, Devlin oversaw discipline issues for hundreds of players and match officials worldwide prior to leaving amid controversy surrounding former vice president Jeffrey Webb. Devlin tells BBC Sport Wales he feels rather sorry for Owens. Besides wanting more support locally and understanding from those abroad, together with greater assistance away from game days, Devlin believes the sport should look closely at itself regarding attitudes to officials themselves. World Referees Association director Paul Devlin worked alongside Pierluigi Collina throughout his career Devlin served under Italy legend Pierluigi Collina through the latter stages of his own illustrious playing career and also held numerous positions inside UEFA during 24 years working for Scottish Football Association. He stepped up to become general secretary of Uefa's referees committee seven years ago leading a panel involved solely with monitoring performances and potential disciplinary action relating to officials. Such cases would normally go directly to the governing body's appeals board. However, an increasing number concerned specific incidents referred to national associations instead. This included six instances concerning Owens alone - mainly arising from television footage or stills published online. All decisions involving Owens were correctly dealt with according to regulations set by each country individually. Yet Devlin admits the frequency suggests widespread dissatisfaction exists even if it doesn't always come out openly. Rather than judging individuals based purely upon performance levels - often impossible anyway because fouls and mistakes cannot be recorded officially - Devlin thinks consideration needs to be paid to whether referees might need better personal protection going forward.

This past week saw a spate of diplomatic activity aimed at averting such fears from materializing as concerns grow over what role his successor, Hailemariam Desalegn, will play when he takes office later this year. The new prime minister said Wednesday he would not reverse course on political reforms begun by late leader Meles Zenawi who died August 20 after ruling since 1991.

"The jury praised Ahmed Mansoor for regularly raising concerns about arbitrary detention, torture and degrading treatment in the Gulf state. As a result, it said, he had faced repeated intimidation, threats to his life by unidentified people and even death threats from one of Bahrain's interior ministers. ""I am still waiting for justice,"" he told Reuters on Friday after hearing that Amnesty was recommending him for an award along with two others who were jailed last year: Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) which has been banned since June 2012, and Ali Abdulemam, editor-in-chief of the independent newspaper Al Wasat. Bahraini authorities have long denied allegations they abuse opponents or activists. They say their strict security measures are needed because of militant threats against Shi'ites, who make up most of Bahrain's population but rule is run by Sunni Muslims. Amnesty called on the government to ""put an end to its campaign of retaliation."" It also urged Britain - a former colonial ruler whose forces helped quell protests during 2011 pro-democracy unrest before withdrawing in March 2011 - to exercise more pressure, including through cancelling arms sales contracts. Rights groups accuse Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries of using prisons as political tools since revolts swept across North Africa and the Middle East beginning early this decade. In states like Egypt and Syria, rights campaigners blame authoritarian rulers for jailing dissidents rather than tackling domestic instability. In Qatar, where foreign workers face harsh conditions without recourse to judicial redress under a sponsorship system common among oil exporters, human rights organisations remain largely invisible to Western governments. But Qatari citizens do not lack for voices critical of official policy towards them.

"The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-112 to Burns, 115-113 to Beltran and 114-114, which did not seem to reflect Beltran flooring Burns or his dislocating the champion's jaw. Fight fans were aghast at how it could have been so close given the general opinion that Burns had won every round bar one in their unification clash - and even then he gave as good as he got before being pushed back by an onslaught of punches from 'El Nino'. 'I beat him,' insisted Burns (right), who lost for just second time as a professional after winning world titles across four divisions Beltran used all five rounds at ringside to tell trainer Robert Garcia the fight was over but referee Russell Mora waved on the contest with two minutes left despite the Mexican landing more than 100 unanswered blows during those final moments. Burns refused to accept defeat until hearing that result live at home later while watching replays on TV. He felt himself take too many shots following going down early in Las Vegas but fought well enough thereafter to retain title belts previously held at super lightweight, featherweight and junior welterweight. He said: 'It went exactly like I thought it would go because we prepared very hard coming into this camp specifically knowing what Elwin Beltran likes to do against guys when they're hurt is come forward. That's why you saw me trying to catch him right away with counter punching. Venezuelan veteran Beltran (left) retired last year having long considered retiring aged 38 due frustration over losing opportunities 'We knew if he came out aggressive I'd be able to get my timing off quicker. Once I caught him in the first [round] and put some hands together...we practiced catching him flush.' As expected, the former Olympian started fast. By contrast, 35-year-old Beltran threw less punches overall though landed better ones through to the end of each frame and also stopped Burns from taking any sustained offensive momentum towards the end of the sixth.

"Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that leaves Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitting his team are now in ""a fight"" for second place. But despite their victory over Everton, who scored an own goal and could quite easily have conceded three more given how bad they were defensively on this occasion, United will not be looking too far ahead as there is still much work to do before the season ends next May. United keeper David de Gea was forced into some fine stops against Roberto Martinez's side but he had little chance when Rooney netted his 20th league goal of another impressive campaign after 26 minutes. Rooney came close twice in quick succession early on while his first effort ended up flying just wide and then Phil Jagielka should really have done better than slice a clearance straight back towards his England captain. The ball bounced off his shin and past Tim Howard from 25 yards out and it could so easily have been 2-0 within 10 seconds thanks to De Gea's misjudgement of Romelu Lukaku's shot which allowed Leighton Baines space to shoot only for him to screw an attempt well wide. Everton did manage to get themselves back into contention midway through the half - Seamus Coleman charging down Ashley Young's attempted cross, allowing Arouna Kone to pounce on the rebound and fire home. It might have got even worse soon afterwards though if Juan Mata wasn't alert enough to block Gareth Barry's powerful strike although things quickly changed once Marouane Fellaini restored United's lead seven minutes later. Although Villas Boas' men fell apart during the closing stages of the opening period, the one positive for them would appear to be that they remain very difficult to beat away from Goodison Park having triumphed here for the third time already this term following victories over Chelsea (2-0) and Liverpool (3-0). Mata put United 3-1 up six minutes after the break - a move started and finished by Wayne Rooney - whose exquisite pass picked out the Spaniard to emphatically volley high beyond Tim Howard. Fellaini made sure of all three points late on, heading home Chris Smalling's long throw-in before Barkley rounded off a miserable afternoon for Everton with his injury time consolation.",0,567

"He was speaking after crowds in Tehran cheered negotiators who had agreed to curb some of Iran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. The six-month interim deal agreed in Geneva on Nov 24 averted a feared war with the West over Iranian attempts to develop an atomic bomb, and may provide time for more serious diplomacy between world powers and Iran. ""If we can have this extension... then I think that gives us space,"" Kerry told CBS News. ""And it doesn't mean you immediately resolve all differences or challenges."" Iran has denied any ambition to acquire nuclear weapons capability but its refusal so far to scale back uranium enrichment - which could be used both as fuel for power stations and material for bombs if processed further - makes many Western countries wary about trusting it. Kerry said he did not believe there would need to be another meeting like those at times dubbed by critics as ""P51 plus one,"" referring to five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States), Germany and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, whose role is co-ordinating diplomatic contacts with Iran. The senior State Department official travelling with him appeared to leave open the possibility of such talks taking place again soon, saying: ""There are no plans yet for any meetings before Christmas."" But none were scheduled. With less than two weeks until Dec 31 when new U.S. sanctions aimed at crippling Iran's oil exports take effect unless they are waived by Washington, diplomats say failure now would likely lead to renewed confrontation next year. A NEW YEAR OF SANCTIONS? Washington says Iran must stop higher-level uranium enrichment first, while Iran wants international guarantees that economic benefits will flow swiftly from any curbs it agrees during the temporary respite. Some experts fear Israel might attack Iran's nuclear sites early next year if it deems negotiations failing; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his country's right to defend itself against what it sees as existential threat. In New York, Samantha Power, Obama's ambassador to the United Nations, expressed scepticism that tensions with Tehran could ease without significant progress toward ending their dispute. ""I don't see how 2013 becomes better than 2012 unless something changes dramatically,"" she told CNN. However, she added: ""We're going into these discussions with good faith and hope... We'll do everything possible to find common ground ahead of Jan 1."" Israel has threatened military strikes to prevent its arch foe acquiring a nuclear weapon that Israelis see as an existential threat, although it does not contest Iran's right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to enrich uranium for civilian purposes. Even though Iran retains political influence through allies across the Arab region, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Lebanese Shi'ite guerrilla group Hezbollah, analysts doubt whether regional partners would join forces should Israel decide to act. Western officials suspect Shi'ite Iran's ultimate goal is to obtain enough fissile material for a single nuclear device, a capacity that most experts deem impossible within months given the technological hurdles involved.",0,599

The mother claims Commander Dave Twyford failed to respond adequately when she wrote a letter detailing how the alleged perpetrator - known by his nickname Jimbo - used his position within families to groom young girls including herself before systematically abusing them over several months until he was stopped one night by three youths outside Birmingham city centre. 'I've given my life since I reported what happened,' added Mrs Shadyad. 'It has taken me into hiding almost every day. It is hard not knowing if someone you know could pick your name out.' She also claimed Mr Twyford hadn't replied to numerous emails sent requesting updates despite telling her previously: 'Rest assured we will do our best to ensure justice is done'. But today senior coroner Louise Hunt determined there wasn't enough evidence to show whether anything substantial went wrong following the original complaint made by Mrs Shadid saying 'there are no findings of fact which can properly be made adverse to the conduct complained of in relation to these matters; nor does there appear to have been any misconduct on behalf of PC Jones'. Ms Hatfield ruled Coventry South MP Jack Dromey should apologise to Mrs Shadid however adding she hoped their relationship could go forward positively now with mutual respect between both parties. The Labour politician accepted full responsibility for failing to act upon allegations regarding Robert Ridsdale despite having been aware of rumours concerning child sex crimes committed throughout multiple generations spanning 30 plus years involving children as young as eight. In March 2015 Mr Dromey took advice rather than going public due to concerns of jeopardising future prosecutions citing fears of prejudicing ongoing trials yet still says nothing publicly until 2018 stating it was down to poor judgement rather than cowardice. Yesterday, speaking exclusively to MailOnline, ex-soldier Joe Clarke warned grooming gangs operating across Britain pose an increasing threat to communities everywhere with women particularly vulnerable unless more serious measures are put in place such as placing restrictions preventing suspects associating freely around youngsters without supervision.

The target, set by Ed Miliband in 2010 after Labour's third successive defeat under Gordon Brown, has been seen as a key barometer for gauging how well parties are doing electorally - but there is no consensus on whether it works or not. Labour MP Frank Field also warned against shooting themselves in the foot with another election pledge that would help voters make up their minds before they enter polling booths later this month. He wrote: ""It's far better if we can get our core vote out first - then persuade others who haven't made up yet why voting Conservative won't bankrupt them!

"Charity Twelves Company, based in Devon, said it had turned away 112 people seeking support in 2015. A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a rise of over 30 since 2014-15 when there were 1,845 incidents involving begging and rough sleeping on the streets - up from just under 100 two years ago Members of the public contacted us to tell stories about what they thought was happening outside their homes or near children's play areas, including instances where beggars appeared aggressive if refused money. Several charities told us negative attitudes towards homeless people stemmed partially from inaccurate perceptions around them being drug users, alcoholics or criminals who preyed on members of society by asking for cash with 'lies' such as saying they were ill. One man described an incident at his local McDonalds restaurant: ""I went into McDonald's one morning, I'd dropped my wife off at work so she could get her hair done before meeting me back home,"" he says. ""There is never any trouble inside but all three fast food outlets are close together and within 50 yards walk down the road you can see someone sitting cross legged behind a bin."" He then describes how another customer came out of the shop telling him not give anything because this particular person would use it buy drugs. The witness asked why - to which the individual replied: You don't know do you? Because we're used to seeing these types of characters sitting outside pubs waiting for customers walking past, most residents assume everyone living on the street has addiction problems.' Resident Martin Posnett (not pictured) gave evidence during HTA discussions But the resident also witnessed something more positive later than day. ""The same guy popped up again sat next door having breakfast. As always, no problem whatsoever inside the premises. This time though he seemed very keen for help...he walked straight across the road into Tesco's [supermarket] and bought himself some food."" HTA participants suggested schemes like the Birmingham model works best in cities where large numbers join together to demand change rather than relying solely upon councils who say funding constraints means they cannot follow through properly. They recommended councils be encouraged to set aside land specifically designated for safe campsites; provide access to clothing banks, showers facilities and mental health services alongside physical shelters; create methods whereby people experiencing homelessness self declare for treatment instead of requiring medical checks, particularly those suffering from serious illnesses should stay indoors overnight unless hospitalised; make sure housing stock available provides adequate heating, insulation, lighting and fire prevention measures; consider placing temporary emergency accommodation units in places other than traditional city centres after working hours, possibly linked to shops offering 24 hour opening times. Advertisement A spokesman added that while complaints made against its Street Outreach Service rose 65 per cent last year compared with 2017, staff attending reported 141 fewer crimes related to anti social behaviour recorded by officers between April 2018 and March 2019. Shelter spokesperson Anna Renton explained that many factors contribute to rising levels of rough sleepers, adding that investing in initiatives aimed at preventing homelessness - combined with ending cuts to welfare benefits and increasing affordable energy bills - would reduce the number of vulnerable individuals forced onto Britain's streets each night. She continued: "" It's clear that the Government needs to urgently reverse recent severe benefit cuts hitting families hardest, ensure Universal Credit keeps pace with rents and inflationary costs and commit to building genuinely affordable homes. That way we won't continue to leave thousands facing a bleak winter without proper shelter. """,0,647

"They were able to hold a metal plate a few centimetres above the rabbit's chest and use it to regulate the animal's heartbeat. If such medical implants could be made wireless, they would allow doctors or paramedics wearing gloves to control heart rate in emergencies without having to touch patients with wires attached,"" said Dr Praveen Arany, Assistant Professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst who led this research published recently in Science Robotics ""A remote-control system for cardiac devices is also particularly useful when surgery cannot be performed immediately due to patient movement."" The researchers had used flexible electronics before but on much larger scales that couldn't fit inside an animal body. Also using them required complicated manufacturing processes involving multiple steps including bonding semiconductor chips onto rigid circuit boards. To make their implantable device more compact, light weight and easy to manufacture, they replaced these components by combining ""flexible printed circuits (FPCs) containing interconnecting copper lines sandwiched between two thin polyimide films as well as ultrathin zinc oxide transistors manufactured from solution processable materials."" They then designed a hemodynamic monitor powered completely wirelessly through radio frequency signals transmitted via antennae placed next to each electrode.

"Inspectors criticised teaching and leadership at the Phoenix Academy and Lakeside Academy following visits in February, rating both schools inadequate in all areas. Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by The Learning Partnership Trust (TLPT), were rated 'requires improvement' as was Brookside Community College which had previously been given an outstanding grading but has now lost its inspection status due to poor performance over a number of years. After reviewing what happened during these inspections first hand it is clear that there are failings within TLPT's management structure with one former principal describing her time working for them like being 'in jail'. Other current and ex-staff have described how they feel scared about speaking out publicly because of threats from senior staff members who hold secrets against those who do not toe their line while others admit leaving jobs simply so will no longer be bullied or intimidated into doing things they know are wrong. Despite this none wanted to go on record fearing repercussions when applying elsewhere. One said: ""It feels very much like we're living under siege."" Another added: ""We did our best work yet still got slated."" Others describe feeling shocked at some of their findings where only months later concerns remain unaddressed despite narrative plans having already been produced outlining changes required. This includes serious issues relating to safeguarding children identified - including instances where pupils' safety risks were ignored - raising questions around whether regulators went far enough in withdrawing recognition last year. However Ofsted states categorically that additional inquiries would need to take place before any formal action could even begin. TLPT says it understands why parents may be concerned but insists school leaders, governors and inspectors alike recognise the progress made since April 2017. They state they continue to recruit, train and retain high calibre teachers supported by strong systems of internal promotion between departments in order to ensure quality education remains central to everything they do. A spokesperson said: ""Our priority continues to be providing excellent opportunities and experiences for students and ensuring young people leave us well prepared for future success; however, sometimes we miss the mark along the way. We welcome external feedback and believe actions taken arising directly from such reviews reinforce our determination to improve and get better every day. As a result of these most recent reviews we've introduced new policies and processes across both trusts designed to further enhance our curriculum delivery, support staff development and safeguard student wellbeing whilst addressing challenges raised."" In spite of assurances security teams monitor each academy site 247 and CCTV covers reception areas keeping watch upon visitors after dark though several staff fear visiting classes without other adults present just isn't safe anymore. What makes matters worse according to many sources inside the trust is knowing individual cases covered up rather than acted upon meaning pupil safety remained compromised until whistleblowers stepped forward either leading to serious incidents being investigated or resignations taking effect immediately. Some say certain individuals put career prospects above child protection even going so far as telling staff off if they dare raise their voice regarding behaviour, health safety or staffing levels again making whistleblowing difficult. Staff weren't alone in noticing flaws within the system. Parents too saw problems emerge almost straight away and accused officials of ignoring multiple complaints via social media then failing to act once solutions had become apparent instead prioritising protecting themselves citing restrictions imposed by government funding cuts forced onto local authorities. Parent Gemma Snowden told us she didn't want anyone else struggling through the same ordeal she'd experienced saying: Parents] started asking questions right back in September 2016 [after a changeover involving key personnel]. Everything seemed fine...it wasn't! I remember sitting in meetings thinking something doesn't seem quite right here...then warning SLT weeks later that my son shouldn't wear his uniform any more because he looked awful...he had holes in his trousers!"" According to Mrs Snowdon headteacher Mark Shortt refused to listen claiming it couldn't possibly be him responsible adding she should speak to another member of staff called Will who ran learning resources. Concerns about Mr Shortts attitude apparently led Ms Snowden to send texts advising colleagues to avoid direct contact with him implying he might make damaging claims if she reported anything inappropriate happening behind closed doors. She said: ""I thought you can't prove text messages so nothing ever came of it..."" Even with warnings like hers falling on deaf ears Ms Snowden admits eventually things became unbearable forcing her husband Craig to move house with family unable to sleep properly worrying about potential danger facing seven-year old son Charlie particularly late at night although thankfully never seeing evidence of harm occurring. Yet importantly allegations were indeed submitted formally resulting in Thames Valley Police launching two investigations ultimately finding insufficient grounds for charges alleging breaches of data protection rules related to emails showing registration forms shared among families containing sensitive information belonging solely to the boy himself. Both police probes recognised failures occurred internally long acknowledged by TLPT admitting mistakes caused distress amongst parents whose daughter taught alongside Charlie confirming possible discrimination towards boys had driven requests for investigation. And earlier this week ITV News revealed confidential details of an email sent to third parties stating ten girls alleged sexual harassment by male classmates commenting inappropriately on appearance prompting heads to initially refuse the naming of suspects allegedly involved insisting legal advice prevented referral to Trading Standards.

"A 911 caller said ""they were going to blow up the Statue of Liberty,"" the National Park Service said. Federal police arrived and when sniffer dogs found ""an area of interest"" on a ferry boat, officers searched it top-to-bottom Thursday night but didn't find anything dangerous or suspicious, authorities said. The scare prompted New York City - birthplace of both America's symbol of freedom and its NYPD counterterrorism unit that responded with bomb squads and helicopters - to raise security levels at sensitive locations including city buildings, bridges, tunnels and landmarks. The new threat level remained in place Friday afternoon as officials investigated whether there was any substance behind the claim. Police Commissioner James O'Neill called the unsubstantiated report ""insulting"" to his hardworking employees who patrol Manhattan sites daily. Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking near ground zero hours after receiving word of the alert, dismissed the idea that there could be danger in an area where thousands gather each year for solemn ceremonies remembering 911 victims. He noted how crowded lower Manhattan already is with tourists before the summer season even started. ""I went down to Ground Zero twice yesterday. It does not feel like something that could cause any kind of disruption,"" he told reporters. De Blasio praised law enforcement's response, saying they checked out a number of leads but found nothing untoward. Police are still searching for suspects wanted in connection with Saturday morning's stabbing of five people aboard a No. 2 subway train.

"The Lions, who won the semi-final first leg 3-1, looked to have put the tie to bed when Lee Gregory slotted home.

Yannick Bolasie was sent off 20 minutes from time following a late challenge which left Martin Cranie needing treatment but he stayed down longer than expected as the ref completed his booking procedure leaving the visitors with 10 men against nine. The game swung towards Town again though as Aaron Wilbraham scored an equaliser two minutes later and it seemed that they would hold onto their slender advantage until injury time when Rudy Gestede headed in what turned out to be the winner.

The suspect stabbed a member of staff during an altercation with airline crew members as he attempted to make his way through airport security check points ahead of boarding flight LH3484 to Istanbul. He then tried to enter Terminal 3 and ran towards British Airways counter 77, where police were called by travel agents who witnessed what happened. A graphic video posted online showed him being shot before lying motionless next to the BA desk. Another witness told ITV that she heard shots fired while sitting inside her office near departures.

"Media playback is unsupported on your device 12 July 2015 Last updated at 01:20 BST The BBC's Mohamed Madi went to Soho's Greek Street to find out. Produced by Marcus Godinho The tourist board promoted London as the great ""multicultural"" city, but in reality white people were vastly more likely than black or Asian ones to be employed and own their homes - according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). So when a new wave of migration hit Britain during the 1960s with an influx from Caribbean countries like Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad it was feared that inner cities would become slums filled with unemployed men who might come over here illegally and steal jobs, women would no longer want to marry them because they could not support families, crime rates would increase and taxes needed to rise to pay for law and order services. This fear led to the White Paper published under Harold Wilson government which set limits around immigration numbers so that this country will remain culturally British. But many immigrants weren't happy about being told what colour they had to be and resented being kept apart. And while some communities did break down, others formed tight-knit social groups based upon shared ancestry. In particular there are three main areas where Jamaican and other West Indian cultures have played a key role; music, food and fashion. It has been well documented how reggae inspired bands such as The Clash, Bob Marley's Wailers made pop classics including No Woman, No Cry and I Shot the Sheriff while other artists created waves through ska, rocksteady, dance hall, '60s RB, funk, dubstep and hip hop. All these genres are still popular today and all can trace back directly to musicians born and raised in places like Kingston, Montego Bay, St Ann Parish, Port Antonio, Clarendon, Mandeville and Spanish Town. Many arrived via boat hoping just to survive before finding work picking fruit, working on building sites, factories, in restaurants, shops and offices. From those humble beginnings came a rich musical legacy. While UK clubbers may think grime means the genre invented by Drake and Skepta, Grime Reggae started long ago on streets like Brick Lane, Shoreditch and New Cross Road among East End communities influenced by soulful roots sounds drawn primarily from Africa and America. Today you'll hear jukeboxes pumping out tunes both current hits by Stormzy featuring Ed Sheeran and classic songs recorded decades earlier playing across clubs, bars and street corners. At its heart though lies traditional calypso from Barbados and Grenada blended into modern styles performed by veteran performers alongside young upstarts looking to make name. You don't need much money to start making music thanks to cheap recording equipment available online. Aspiring stars use digital tools to record themselves rapping then share tracks through apps like SoundCloud or YouTube instead of hiring expensive studio time. By contrast the biggest names play stadiums packed full of fans dancing away dressed head-to toe entirely covered in designer outfits costing thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of pounds per outfit alone. Fashions change fast too meaning barber shop salons brimming with locals getting cut n' styled really highlights and exaggerates different cultural differences. These spaces offer affordable hairstyle solutions, hot meals cooked fresh daily plus plenty of loud conversations taking place within earshot. For years fried chicken and fish chips served up from roadside eateries was seen as uniquely British fare until Nando's launched 17 years ago offering a similar spicy version perfectly suited to the spicy foods eaten commonly throughout South American nations like Argentina and Brazil. Since then chains selling Peruvian cuisine followed along with hundreds of outlets serving vegetarian Chinese dishes known as dim sum and Japanese curry houses. Meanwhile ethnic supermarkets sell goods ranging from exotic spices used regularly in cuisines serving large populations living mainly outside Europe to non-alcoholic drinks containing natural ingredients found only in African rainforests. How else do we explain why one type of currant jelly sold next door sells for less than another? Or why someone growing sugar cane in Fiji uses very little of the product compared to Western cultivation methods yet charges substantially higher prices? Welcome to multiculturalism!",0,677

"3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy second homes. Legislation which was due to come into effect on 1 July would have given people the right to own two properties if they were married or living with their partner and had not previously held a home elsewhere. But it has been delayed until next year because of concerns about its impact on prices. The argument over how many houses one person should be allowed to purchase highlights what analysts say is an irrational housing market - distorted by subsidies from local governments. In certain circumstances that can mean house prices rising faster than incomes. ""Wealthy buyers who want multiple apartments often resort to going through the motions of divorce,"" said Mark Tanner, managing director of Shanghai-based research company China Skinny. He added that clients seeking information on this option include newly divorced men looking for other women willing to live with them as they seek another home while waiting out legal proceedings against their former partners. Mr Tanner believes the number of couples taking such measures may remain small but could grow significantly depending upon economic conditions. Life expectancies are lengthening across the country and there will soon be more young families able to afford expensive mortgages amid ultra low interest rates. 'No problem' Beijing resident Zhang Liying told BBC Chinese she went ahead last summer after her husband proposed buying a second apartment together (they already owned one) following discussions with his mother. One thing led to another and I came up with the idea of doing an annulment... It took us less than five minutes to do it officially online via WeChat Mrs Huang Lihong They decided he could keep both places provided each one did not exceed 50 sq m (538 sq ft). Mrs Zhang, 36, said she obtained permission to put down deposits using money left behind by her deceased father rather than having new loans secured against all three family assets. She described herself and her 39-year old spouse simply as being unable to conceive naturally and wanting children to complete their family unit. Both their mothers wanted grandchildren too, said Ms Zhang. Her son also needed somewhere private where grandparents could stay when they visited from Sichuan province. A business analyst before she gave birth to twins four years ago, Ms Zhang now works part time teaching English. She said: ""One thing led to another and I came up with the idea of doing an annulment [of marriage]... It took us no longer than 10 days."" If you don't agree then move away! This requires quite remarkable control over your emotions. You need someone very experienced Mr Tan Jinhua Even though getting remarried carries serious consequences under Communist Party rules - including losing government benefits (see below) - experts like Mr Jiang Jianming believe there are any number of ways around this regulation. One potential solution involves hiring somebody else to perform marriages overseas; although these ceremonies are illegal without state sanctioning, foreign websites reportedly offer services ranging between 1,600 (1,300) and nearly 50k (35k). Family lawyer Mr Tan Jinhua explained that lawyers charge between 4 and 5 commission per successful application made to the relevant authorities. However, despite only requiring relatively basic paperwork, cases become complicated once attempts begin to get round restrictions placed on ownership rights. For example, individuals might submit documents saying that separate names listed on mortgage agreements belonged actually belong to different relatives; others claim double occupancy permits are really issued jointly. Some existing regulations appear contradictory. According to government guidance published earlier this month regarding second residential homes purchased prior to May 2013, those wishing to hold onto multiple dwellings must file proof of marriage within 30 days of securing approval. At present, however, unmarried owners cannot obtain formal contracts unless legally recognised spouses consent to sharing ownership responsibilities. Married couples meanwhile enjoy preferential treatment compared to single purchasers since certificate applicants who provide evidence of marital status receive certificates enabling immediate registration. Such policies create opportunities for corruption, admits Mr Tan. ""This creates lots of loopholes like paying bribes to officials along the way. So far we haven't seen anything major happening yet, mainly just minor stuff here and there."" Social experiment? Many Chinese perceive the debate currently raging surrounding national property policy as nothing short of revolutionary. Those opposed argue the current system represents an effective subsidy passed directly downwards from central government, particularly in tier one cities near provincial capitals. That belief gained currency recently thanks to a public outcry over reports that rich developers linked to senior party figures stood accused of trying to profit illegally off land sales, sparking intense criticism towards corrupt practices among civil servants and lack of transparency among leaders. State news agency Xinhua called for greater protection of citizens' legitimate interests during recent legislative meetings on related legislation.

"The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed its investigation after it found no evidence of a defect in the vehicle. Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with Tesla's Autopilot system last year Tesla is one of several automakers, including Ford Motor Company and General Motors Co., that have taken steps to increase the capabilities of their driver-assistance software systems as they compete for business among consumers concerned about safety on U.S. roads. According to Reuters' report: The NHTSA said data from the crash showed no evidence of any automated control system engaging before or during impact. It did not say whether the system had been activated at all while Brown was driving. Brown was traveling alongside Telsa visionary Elon Musk who attended the event Musk welcomed guests to Sunday evening's charity fundraiser which honored Netflix CEO Reed Hastings (left) whom he called 'an inspiration'. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger speaks onstage during an awards ceremony held by the Roadster Club Northern California Chapter prior to dinner on Friday night near El Segundo, Calif. A new generation of sophisticated self-driving cars are being put through their paces this weekend ahead of what many consider will be inevitable widespread deployment within months Following the fatal accident involving the company's Model S sedan using AutoPilot technology, Tesla issued warnings reminding drivers who use such features to keep both hands on the steering wheel at all times and pay attention to road conditions and traffic signals. In May 2016, nearly two years later, another Tesla owner died in Florida when his Model S hit two trees, crossing into oncoming lanes. Neither crash has officially resulted in charges against the companies involved. Elon Musk tweeted out images Saturday showing him standing next to the bright red electric sports car again However, some experts argue there is still work left to do even if autopilot can see stop signs and speed limit signs, react quickly enough and brake automatically - especially since human error causes more than 90 percent of accidents. But most agree that humans aren't capable of handling every aspect behind the wheel safely 100 per cent of time either. Despite those concerns, automakers continue rolling out vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems like Tesla's auto pilot.

"The trial, which targets women who are too late to undergo surgery, gives six weeks of additional chemotherapy. On average, 94 women in Northern Ireland each year are diagnosed with breast cancer at stage four (the most advanced), and the new treatment has a successful rate for patients up until now - 80. Now researchers have called on more funding from charities so they can roll out their study across all parts of England where it is needed. A woman's risk of developing breast cancer doubles every 10 years past 30 if there isn't enough oestrogen in her body. It increases by another 50 after 40. The 'womb' or ovaries produce hormones such as progesterone that protects against ovarian cancers but decrease levels of oestrogen when pregnancy occurs. This leads many post-menopausal women into stages three, four and five of breast cancer because no longer having children means higher levels of oestrogen circulating around the system. In contrast, men do not experience this change in hormone production during declining fertility and prostate cells contain high amounts of testosterone throughout life, boosting sperm counts and protecting them against testicular tumours. Professor Tony Young said: ""We believe we're onto something here; our clinical trials show giving an extra dose of targeted hormonal therapy significantly improves survival rates over standard care, especially among women whose disease progresses despite taking tamoxifen.""",0,714

"Stuart Coffey, 44, transferred cash from Bracebridge Heath Medical Practice into his own account between 2008 and 2013. Lincoln Crown Court heard he stole so much money the surgery fell behind in its tax payments to HMRC A GP who defrauded a practice out of thousands of pounds has been jailed for two years. Lincoln Crown Court was told Stuart Coffey used funds donated by patients at Bracebridge Health Centre as 'a secret bank'. He paid himself back 40 every day on average over three-and-half year period when working there. His fraud came to light after missing a payment deadline with HM Revenue Customs (HMRC) due to insufficient numbers of patient donations being received. The court heard how 12,000 were then needed urgently but it wasn't until 11 months later that they realised what had happened - which left them facing having their premises repossessed or losing their licence. Michael Cranmer-Brown prosecuting said around 40 per cent of patients didn't realise what had occurred and continued donating under false pretences because of their loyalty towards the practice. Mr Cranmer-Brown added: ""It's important to note this is not just about greed. This defendant did try to repay some money."" Recorder David Gordon QC described him as someone who took advantage of patients' trust. He said: ""You abused your position within an NHS establishment you worked and exploited something called Patient Donation Scheme where people donate very generously to help keep medical services going.

"The Lions looked the more dangerous side in the early stages and experienced striker Steve Morison twice hammered efforts over the crossbar. There was little goalmouth action at either end , but there were a few scares for Stoke before half-time when Robert Snodgrass curled an effort narrowly wide of Shay Given's right post from just outside the box after being set up by Joe Allen. Charlie Adam had been reading his team-mate's intentions well all evening and he did so again to intercept another through ball intended for Morison on 42 minutes as the visitors almost snatched the lead against the run of play. It was not until the 51st minute that some home fans got their first real sight of fortune with one of two Gozie Ugwu headers dropping agonisingly wide. The 500,000 summer signing then nodded down Grant Holt's corner 20 yards out only to see it spilled behind by Jack Butland following Steven N'Zonzi's heavy touch at the near post. A goalmouth scramble ensued which ended with Andrew Surman heading straight into the arms of Given despite six players scrambling around him inside eight yards of opposition territory. Having wasted three clear chances already, Norwich finally made their possession count seven minutes later courtesy of Holt - who has now scored four goals since joining the club this month - firing past Butland from close range. Although Stoke could have levelled matters soon afterwards, Erik Pieters saw his low shot saved impressively by John Ruddy while Marko Arnautovic unleashed a powerful left-footed drive which narrowly cleared the bar. Just like last weekend at Middlesbrough, Albion came under severe pressure late on and they needed some desperate defending resembling the style exhibited during Alex McLeish's tenure to keep things level beyond 90 minutes. With time running out, substitute Cameron Jerome powered forward and sent over an inviting delivery towards Jonathan Walters 12 yards out, but Smalling comfortably held onto his header. In stoppage time, Burnley loanee Sam Vokes headed inches wide when leaving himself unmarked to meet Danny Graham's free kick deep into added time.",0,724

"The classic adaptation, which opened on Wednesday, is presented on a set designed like a Victorian toy theatre.

It was very much by chance - at least partly- that he even made it onto stage as Poirot. He had been offered another play by David Edgar (who has also adapted Agatha Christie for radio), but when McPherson decided to adapt The ABC Murders last year there were problems getting funding and casting. Colleigh suggested Caryllis would be perfect because she knew him from directing several productions of Pinter Plays at the National Theatre; they have worked together twice before since then. ""I think Simon Russell Beale described me as having my finger up Piccolos nose,"" said Caryllis about their first meeting where they discussed how best to present the story. They agreed not to use the original text or music score but instead tried other ways of making sure viewers could follow what's going on within each scene without breaking the fourth wall. That includes using visual methods such as blackouts between scenes so actors can move through them while the audience still see everything happening around them.

"13 April 2016 Last updated at 20:41 BST She told BBC TV's Ask the Leader election special it had been a ""terrible mistake"" for the Lib Dems to make ""a coalition of chaos."" She said she was still looking forward to standing down and that people should not be concerned about her having a peerage. Ms Swinson, who is also deputy leader on Westminster Council in London, joined the Conservatives as an activist aged just 16 because they were against the European Economic Community (EEC). She has held posts including president of Conservative Future - then called Young Conservatives - and director general of the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange. In 2006 when David Cameron became Tory party leader he appointed her transport minister with responsibility for London Underground. But after 18 months Mr Blair offered her his old job as chief secretary to the Treasury; she accepted but left two years later after falling out with Gordon Brown over plans for public sector pay restraint. After losing her Sussex East seat by 3,000 votes last year, while fellow ex-Tory Amber Rudd won Hastings and Rye from Labour, Ms Swinson challenged Sir Vince Cable to take charge of the Liberal Democrats following Tim Farron's resignation earlier this month. The result surprised many within the party given she lost nine seats under Mr Clegg's leadership between 2010 and 2015. Speaking during Thursday night's programme, which featured all seven remaining leaders answering questions submitted online, she admitted there would have been more support if voters knew what direction the parties wanted to go in. Asked whether there could ever again be coalitions involving other right wing parties such as Ukip or the Tories via electoral pacts similar to those seen since 2007, Ms Swinson said: ""I don't see why we couldn't work together."" 'Struggle' Over the past week both UKIP's Paul Nuttall and Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives faced criticism after appearing alongside either Nigel Farage or Theresa May respectively without being quizzed themselves concerning their policies. But asked how politicians like them got away scot free with avoiding scrutiny, Ms Swinson added: ""That shows you are asking me difficult political questions I didn't expect! ""The thing is, though, every time I've come up against one of these reunions things look much worse than they actually turn out. So perhaps the lesson here...is learn your lessons before you start making any assumptions!"" When pressed further on potential future alliances with other parties aside from working with Lib Dem MPs at Westminster, she replied: ""There may well be some opportunities where even closer co-operation might happen... so long as everyone knows exactly what they're getting into beforehand."" However she insisted Britain needed to give the EU referendum result full effect first. And despite pledging to hold another vote herself in five years unless Parliament voted something else, she refused three times to say whether she believed Brexit should now definitely go ahead regardless of what happens next. Instead she suggested leaving the single market altogether rather than trying to reform it remained on the table depending upon negotiation outcomes. Ms Swinson went on: ""But let us focus our energies. It takes quite a lot of energy to pull apart 40 years worth of integration, to try and unpick all those threads. There will need to be compromises made, no doubt, whichever way you cut it. We do know already that the consequences of staying close to Europe economically, financially - whatever you choose to call it - will mean trade barriers going up, economic growth lower and investment slower."" Pressed yet again as to whether hardline Brexiteers pushing for a clean break with Brussels really did represent mainstream opinion among Labour Leave supporters too, she responded: ""They certainly seem to claim that mantle. They must speak for large numbers of Labour leavers. If you ask everybody: What does success look like? People want immigration reduced, control returned to Britain over borders etcetera. Do Labour Leavers agree with everything the ERG want, absolutely - probably not. That doesn't necessarily stop them voting for Theresa May and the Brexit deal she comes back with.

The committee formally recommended the levy in November, but several MSPs have since said they would not support it as proposed by ministers. Mackay told Holyrood's Finance Committee that he wanted a system where ""the majority of people paid less than 200,"" although SNP business convener Derek MacKay later insisted this did not mean every home paying between zero and 200. He also suggested there should be payments from those who benefited most - such as high earners or big businesses - rather than having key workers and low-paid families facing higher bills because someone else was getting away with cheaper rates.

At least one human rights group says ethnic cleansings are already taking place: Nhial Majak D'Agoot, spokesman at the Justice Ministry said there was no evidence of any ongoing campaigns against civilians based purely on ethnicity.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 52 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize has been open only to writers from Britain and Ireland - previous winners included Americans Philip Roth (2003) and Cormac McCarthy (2006), as well as Australians Richard Flanagan and Helen Garner. ""Film scripts are almost always based on books,"" said Saul Zaentz, producer of American Beauty whose script was written by Christopher Nolan after he read author Alan Ball's 1997 novel about an unhappy high school English teacher driven into adultery and murder. ""The real competition for film audiences comes not so much between feature films but between TV miniseries."" In one example, British television network BBC America decided last month it would air U.S. cable channel HBO drama True Detective straight after airing its finale later this summer rather than wait another 12 months until next January or February when both seasons will be available on DVD. Last week ITV announced plans to broadcast Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire simultaneously across nearly all of Europe over Christmas, breaking new ground in cross-border telecasting. In India, movie director Mira Nair hopes her upcoming adaptation of Vikram Seth's fantasy romance A Suitable Boy will interest viewers outside the subcontinent who have never heard of the book before she began filming last September. She says the long gap between publication dates works out better logistically for filmmakers too since they know exactly where their project stands at any given time compared with having to go back to publishers every few weeks while shooting. In Hollywood there typically is no more than six years difference each way between the release date of a finished film adapted directly from a source material like Dr Seuss' children's story Green Eggs And Ham, which hit theatres nine days ago, versus other films based purely upon screenplays such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator released 14 years earlier. THE BIG SCREEN GONE HOME? Some critics see little point in publishing fiction anymore now that cinematic versions can come along just two or three years afterwards whereas authors are often left waiting up to half a lifetime following the original sale if studios do decide to get around to making adaptations. This winter brought George Orwell's Animal Farm and Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey respectively to big screens fresh off bestseller lists; neither took particularly good box office numbers though some say sales spikes usually occur nearer to releases. In recent times major hits garnered via novels turned movies include Tom Clancy's The Hunt For Red October, JK Rowling's Harry Potter series starring Daniel Radcliffe, Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman something critics argue could hardly happen today without the guaranteed return already assured from ticket sales. This helps explain why many top-selling literary titles these day tend towards adventure stories aimed at teenage boys and girls or crime thrillers featuring police detectives working within established fictional universes popularised through comic books and video games. Video game maker Electronic Arts Inc counts bestselling thriller writer James Patterson among its list of celebrity brand ambassadors including Justin Timberlake and Michael Jordan helping sell millions of copies of his work across multiple platforms. He recently signed a deal giving him 90 percent royalties and the chance to option future rights for development into motion pictures worth 1 million per title plus 10 percent participation fees according to Forbes magazine. But Sierra Burgess Is a Loser creator Shannon Hale argues against segregating literature into genres saying successful titles should transcend labels simply because readers want them to succeed regardless, adding however: ""I think we're living in somewhat dark ages right now... People don't put money toward literature unless you've got characters wearing capes coming down the stairs."" Publishers remain optimistic despite mounting concerns about piracy eroding profits further still even with consumers increasingly willing to pay close attention to details involving production costs versus potential returns. Patrick Spence, managing editor of Little, Brown Book Group, part of UK publisher Hachette Livre, denies stiffening ebook prices were related solely to ebooks becoming less profitable due largely to increased pricing power enjoyed by Amazon itself. Spence cited relatively strong advances paid to debut authors David Nicholls and Donna Tartt amongst others worldwide alongside growing demand especially for nonfiction titles citing Jon Ronson's 2015 billion dollar podcasting industry expose Them as evidence positive change really might lie ahead. But Anthony Barnett, professor of media theory cultural studies at London College of Communication, remains doubtful overall pointing to ever accelerating changes wrought throughout global economies in general leading societies astray in ways unlikely to reverse themselves anytime soon let alone allow anyone else to catch up.

By then Mr Justice Nicholas Parfitt had already heard evidence from English officers about what they found when they went into the defendant's house after arresting him at Heathrow airport as part of an investigation by US counter terrorism officials. And also how their search turned up materials relating not only to al-Qaeda and its propaganda but also videos showing beheadings carried out by so called Islamic State (IS) jihadists. The judge will decide whether information given under oath can be used during Mr Naseer's trial with possible consequences for thousands more people facing extradition on similar allegations. For around four hours this week one British investigator gave testimony which strongly suggested such material is likely to find its way onto UK soil once foreign suspects are sent back home - where they may face charges over activities linked to IS or other groups without being tried first here.",0,761

"Angus Carpenter, of Liverpool, who has played in the city centre for more than 30 years, denied three counts of fraud. The 62-year-old was found guilty of one count when he appeared at Minshull Street Crown Court yesterday (Wednesday).

He falsely claimed 20,935 from Kensington Homes Ltd before also attempting to claim money relating to two other companies - A S Carpentry Services Limited (1,300) and St James' Craftsman Ltd (3,500), all based locally. The court heard how another contractor took photographs inside a property while working there but gave them to Carpenter so they could be used without permission.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines But China's rise continues to make waves within world higher education circles. The country now sends more students abroad - 835,000 outbound enrolments were recorded by the Chinese government during 2011-12 compared with 515,700 five years earlier. This means that there are currently 447,900 Chinese nationals studying overseas on courses for over six months; almost half of these will earn degrees from institutions that participate in the QS World University Rankings. Accordingly institutes based outside Beijing have seen their applications increase significantly: while PekingUniversity remains number three overall it saw an incredible 366 per cent growth between 2010 and 2012, thanks largely to increased interest among applicants seeking to study English language teaching postgraduateships. Every other institution ranked in our table experienced similar surges in applications but none had such extraordinary increases relative to the size of their student populations. The US retains pole position across all categories except Law, where British institutions dominate. It also holds sway in Business Management Studies. But business schools do tend toward Harvard whereas engineering departments steer clear of MIT which takes second spot in both subjects behind Berkeley.

"Government limits to teachers' pay and ""real terms cuts"" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. ""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the Observer ahead of Tuesday's National Education Union conference in London. But ministers are refusing demands for extra cash after an official report showed that schools had been underfunded since 2011 by 2bn - with funding per pupil now at its lowest level on record as inflation has outstripped growth in teaching staff numbers over this period. The former Tory prime minister David Cameron was forced into 2015 spending U-turns when he tried to cut wages for public sector workers such as nurses but failed amid opposition from Labour and unions. However, there is no appetite among Conservatives to repeat those mistakes again even though teacher strikes could lead to voters turning against them unless politicians can find some way through the impasse before December's general election. The NEU says it will seek strike ballots if disputes cannot be resolved or, where possible, begin planning industrial action while negotiations continue. On Monday, education secretary Damian Hinds told BBC Radio 4: It] would clearly not make sense ... [if we were to have another round of] strikes."" He said any new money available should go towards reducing class sizes first because smaller classes improved children's learning outcomes more than higher salaries for teachers alone. Asked whether he thought striking teachers wanted better conditions rather than higher salaries, Hinds replied: ""I think what you see at times like these is people who want their voices heard; I don't think most adults actually enjoy disrupting young people."" But union leaders say teachers deserve much more than just 1 a year rises given average starting salaries are around 30,000, according to research published last week which warned many pupils leave secondary school unable to read properly due to lack of reading skills acquired during primary years. Some 90 of all teachers describe themselves as struggling financially compared with 75 five years ago as real living costs soar faster than wage increases, according to a survey conducted by Tes magazine.

"The military said the driver was taken into custody after the incident near the Jewish settlement of Ofra. It brings to 41 the number of Israelis killed in knife, gun or car-ramming attacks since October 2015. The Palestinian toll stands at 67 dead and more than 2,100 wounded during that period. In a wave of violence last week, Israeli forces shot four Palestinians who stabbed or tried to stab soldiers and civilians in Jerusalem and the West Bank on Thursday alone. Overall this year, there have been close to 130 stabbings carried out against Israelis by Palestinians around the same time frame, according to Israeli police figures. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed a tough response: ""Whoever tries to attack us will pay dearly."" Those sentiments were echoed Wednesday evening as he laid wreaths for those slain over the past five years - including three children under 10. He also called on other countries to join him in recognizing Israel's right to defend itself when necessary. ""At times like these we should stand together,"" he told international ambassadors gathered outside his residence in Jerusalem from nations with whom it does not often hold formal diplomatic ties. Netanyahu made no direct mention of any proposed change to laws governing freedom of speech, but some members of parliament are suggesting legislation to allow tougher action against individuals involved in violent protests. For now, however, such measures may be difficult to enact because they require parliamentary approval. Israel captured east Jerusalem along with the west during the 1967 Mideast war and annexed both areas in moves that are not internationally recognized. Its annexation is not accepted by most world powers, which regard the territories as occupied territory awaiting a final status agreement between the sides.

"Doctors realised Maia Collingswood needed the transplant after her father Dan revealed he also had the procedure in 1997. Maia, from Barmouth, Gwynedd, had the transplant at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital on December 27 It was during a family holiday to Aberystwyth when Dan first noticed something wasn't right with his daughter and she started having seizures every day around 7pm. Pictured: She is taken off for surgery today The youngster went into hospital several times but doctors were unable to find out what caused them. After being referred to various specialists they eventually discovered that Maia has mitochondrial disease - meaning there are problems producing energy within cells of body tissues or organs (stock image) WHAT IS MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE? Mitochondrial diseases affect how your body uses food as fuel. They are caused by faults in mitochondria, which are tiny structures inside almost all our cells that produce most of the energy we need to live. Common symptoms include muscle weakness, poor growth, lethargy, blindness, heart defects and brain disorders. Vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency, can be an underlying cause. In some cases, parts of the body begin to fail because they don't get enough oxygen. These are known as organ failure. Symptoms vary depending on which part of the body is affected. Treatment focuses on providing extra nutrients where possible, or replacing worn-out organs. Source: NHS Choices 'I kept getting told it would just pass 'but nothing ever changed,' said Mr Collingwood whose transplants comes 22 years after treatment himself.'She lost weight really quickly, so I thought perhaps she may have an eating disorder but then everything else came back including losing eyesight slowly over time'. 'By this point my wife Lisa and myself were in despair because no one knew why Maia was unwell', added the musician who says now feels like Maia's third parent. Mr Collingwood got tested again last year while struggling through chemotherapy and radiotherapy following testicular cancer diagnosis. He underwent the same tests twice more before learning he too suffers from Mito Disease. As well as liver issues similar to Maia, both parents suffer joint pains due to their condition along with skin rashes and hair loss. The couple put much emphasis on keeping fit despite suffering pain daily. Last Christmas Day saw the entire family spend together though many tears were shed throughout the evening; laughter only breaking through every few minutes between bouts of grief and sadness. But the moment everyone looked forward to arrived without any warning. Maia suffered a seizure brought about by low blood sugar levels leaving her unconscious until paramedics pumped some liquid glucose into her veins via a drip arriving 10 minutes later. Her condition improved once medication took effect allowing the whole family enjoyed each other's company undisturbed. A statement released yesterday read: 'After months of appointments at different hospitals searching for answers...and two operations on her liver propped up against life support machines and dialysis machines, we finally found a team who could help us solve these mysteries surrounding Maia's health challenges. We therefore decided to take hope rather than giving up. And miracle upon miracles....we did!'.",0,794

The latter worked well enough in small groups but it didn't scale up; some employees felt like second class citizens because of their lack of influence over decisions taken by the larger group. The result? A new hybrid model inspired partly by Holacracy (which would come to be known internally at Crisp simply as ""Crispy called Flexible Teams.

LePenVote pic.twitter.com6nW3jqS1Rp - LCP (LCPofficiel) May 7, 2017 While President Francois Hollande is expected to resign this week once the results become official, Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has stayed put while French media reported last month talks were underway between him and Senate Speaker Gerard Larcher about replacing Manuel Valls as head of government. With no clear majority emerging from Sunday's vote any replacement prime minister could struggle to get parliamentary backing when they wish to pass laws such as those needed to implement a planned labour reform which critics say puts too much strain on companies by raising the bar for firing workers. On Monday hundreds gathered outside parliament calling on lawmakers not to back what one placard held aloft called Valls "" social coup'. A group opposed to a proposed tightening up of gun control rules also took part in protests against plans being drawn up under Interior Minister Matthias Fekl to ban future sales of weapons capable of carrying large magazines. After campaigning away from the limelight since taking office 18 months ago, Hollande gave an unusually energetic speech late Friday urging people to come out to vote, saying it was vital for democracy.

He denied any wrongdoing before resigning last May ahead of being charged over 'prescription offences'. It took until August 2018 for him to respond formally to these charges relating to the administration of banned substances triamcinolone - better known under the brand name Kenacort - and fluimucil to members of the Sky Procycling Team between June 2011 and February 2013. Freeman denies any suggestion that either substance caused or contributed to performance enhancement within professional sport. In January 2020, he was found guilty of ordering 30 sachets of Testogel via eBay by a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel. However, he avoided suspension due to ill health. The tribunal ruled its reasons would not be published because they contained sensitive personal data about individuals who had made complaints against Freeman. 'This action has been taken despite my objections... I do feel strongly that I have no case to answer and am confident I can clear my name.' He resigned just hours afterwards. A statement released added: It] has become increasingly apparent to me since November 2017 that those running the service at the General Medical Services department [of Team Sky], did not share my commitment to maintaining the highest ethical standards within the team."" However now details revealed in emails sent by Dr Freeman suggest unethical practices going back years further than previously thought.

"John Lahiff, 75, told local media that he disturbed the crocodile while looking for a ball in water at the course in Port Douglas, Queensland. He was taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries Lahiff said: 'I thought I'd get one more stroke off and then see where it found me' before being attacked by what is believed to be an 11ft croc called Harry (pictured) The 12 golfers saw the reptile swimming towards them as they played on Sunday morning but were shocked when Mr Lahiff fell into its mouth without warning Mr Lahiff explained how his horrific ordeal unfolded during their round of nine holes at 6am. He revealed Billy had approached him after dropping another golfer off - saying: 'Hey John! Come out here mate!' As soon as he arrived close enough, the large saltwater crocodile pulled down Mr Lahiff from behind. His friends didn't even realise what happened until hearing him scream loudly underwater. In disbelief over what has just occurred, one player can be heard calling flatly: It's] been fed.' The rest are equally stunned as there appears no way either party could have seen each other coming through thick vegetation so early in the day. One person calls repeatedly for help but nobody nearby seems able to do anything except hope someone else will come along who knows CPR or first aid. They continue playing oblivious to the fact anyone may need assistance urgently. Eventually others realised something serious must have occurred because they started shouting out that somebody needed paramedics immediately due to some kind of medical emergency Billy says she doesn't usually call people names if they miss putts, which makes her actions all the more shocking considering this incident involved a man she knew personally having almost died When asked why did not think twice about going near the edge of the lake and taking such extreme risks? She replied: 'You know you're not gonna die... You should always play safe though obviously yeah'. Pictured is the scene following the attack At least two people eventually noticed something had gone seriously wrong around a mile away later and went straight back only to find Mr Lahiff submerged beneath the surface screaming. They managed to pull him onto dry land before performing CPR for 20 minutes until paramedics arrived. One said afterwards he felt like the group'saved [his] friend's life', according to Yahoo 7 News. In total four men tried unsuccessfully to save Mr Lahif. But despite their efforts, rescuers couldn't administer any further treatment once they got him safely up onto solid ground, leaving doctors instead deciding simply keeping pressuring on already open wounds would keep him alive long enough for an air ambulance flight to arrive. Paramedics desperately rushed him via helicopter to Cairns Hospital suffering significant facial lacerations, including damage to both eyes. Doctors say these eye injuries pose potentially dangerous complications given the amount of blood loss sustained. Most concerning still remains internal bleeding within his liver however medics are hopeful those injuries won't prove fatal. These images show inside the wound caused by the predator Divers searched the area using infared cameras hoping to spot the huge animal responsible for the vicious bite marks across Mr Lahiff's torso. It took six dives to finally catch sight of Harry lurking under the murky waters, authorities confirmed Harry, understood to weigh 400lbs and measuring roughly 5m from nose tip to tail, appeared very aggressive throughout much of the search operation although ultimately allowed himself to be caught unharmed so police officers could retrieve footprints left in the mud leading directly to his den Despite several days passing since the traumatic event now known locally as the Port Douglas Crocodile Attack resulting in multiple surgeries, Grafton Base Hospital staff remain cautious regarding whether Mr Lahiff will survive beyond Christmas Day Mr Lahiff spent three nights recovering at Port Douglas Hospital and discharged last Thursday en route to Brisbane City in order to receive urgent surgery at Princess Alexandra Hospital. Speaking publicly for the first time today in incredible scenes outside the same hospital, Mr Lahiff thanked everyone who helped rescue him. But added ominously: 'There'll be plenty more bloody stories,' referring to many other incidents involving similar tragedies occurring every year around Australia. Asked how does he feel knowing numerous lives depended upon him surviving the encounter, Mr Lahiff admitted feeling guilty. Those feelings intensified considerably after learning eight tourists previously lost their own lives trying to take selfies next to wild animals in recent years alone. What is perhaps most remarkable about this story is that Mr Lahiff refused to learn self defence techniques offered free to Australians living where wildlife encounters often occur. When shown footage of the attempted capture shortly before speaking to journalists said: 'If anybody wants to go anywhere near a croc...

"Joanna Michael, 25, from St Mellons, Cardiff, rang 999 twice before Cyron Williams stabbed her to death in 2009. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ruled she was failed by police and the watchdog is still investigating what went wrong with Ms Michaels' case A mother who died on Christmas Day after being knifed 14 times had begged for help just minutes earlier - but officers were not dispatched until an hour later because staff thought it was a hoax call. Bar worker Joanne Michaels, 25, dialled 999 at around 8pm complaining of chest pains shortly before losing consciousness having been attacked while walking home from work alone outside Llanrumney, south Wales. An inquest jury has now concluded that Miss Michaels could have survived if emergency services had answered their radio sooner less than half-a-mile away. They also criticised South Wales Police's handling as 'inadequate'. The force accepted all points raised during Thursday's hearing into Miss Michaels' murder three years ago. Her family said they hoped lessons would be learned so other families did not suffer like them following mistakes made over previous incidents involving women who died after calling 911. Miss Michaels worked behind the bar at the Bargoed Inn pub where she met Mr Williamz when he came there looking for his brother Leon James. She and another colleague went out back so she could buy him some cigarettes only moments before she called cops then fell unconscious. But despite four calls including one from her friend pleading: 'My girlfriend needs you', no officer arrived and she bled to death 15 minutes later near Riverside Park overlooking the River Taff opposite her former home. Three ambulance crews used a defibrillator within seconds arriving first followed soon afterwards by two more ambulances. A single paramedic attempted CPR whilst awaiting further assistance which never turned up even though radio communications indicated those resources should do so.

But her parents Simon and Sally claim cruel jibes about injuries sustained in gymnastics contributed towards her taking her own life aged just 17 in May 2017. An inquest this week heard how her disability led others to make fun of the level of treatment her carers gave her and claimed drinking bleach would fix everything. One bully told friends he wanted to cut off her legs leaving doctors struggling to manage severe depression brought on by her ordeal. Just six weeks prior to killing herself Robyn confessed to staff working at West Sussex College in Crawley that people were threatening to tell everyone intimate details of photographs she shared online without permission.

"The king commissioned the piano for the palace from renowned maker Thomas Tomkison in about 1821. The instrument displays the flamboyant taste Tomkison shared with the king. It was bought by a private collector - and served as such until 1956, when it became part of the collection at Casa Batllo Museum (Casa Balboa). As an example of Spanish Romanticism that is recognized across Europe to this day, there are few other instruments on display anywhere more representative than this one here today.""",0,816
"Dubbed ""carbon farming,"" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices for poor people in developing countries where hunger already stalks millions of families. The concept involves growing crops using methods that increase soil fertility while reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions from farmland by trapping them underground as part of natural processes such as photosynthesis rather than allowing them to escape into a warming atmosphere. Crops include wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice, sorghum, millet, sunflowers, peanuts, soybeans, various legumes and vegetables like lettuce and tomatoes. The process can also be used on pasture land and forest lands being converted to cropland.",0,817
"A YouGov survey suggested low name recognition of councillors across the UK, with 79 of East Midlands residents unable to name a single representative. Satisfaction with the work of councils has also been declining since 2010 and now stands at only 30 per cent satisfaction in our region, compared with 36-42 nationally - lower than Europe's other big urban areas such as Paris or Madrid (43) but much higher than London (22). But despite this it seems that few people have considered standing themselves for local elections. According to the Electoral Commission just 939 candidates stood out of more than 10 million eligible voters in May 2017. The total number was about half what had actually turned up four years earlier when there were 1,532 candidate lists from 3,700 wards around England. Or put another way five times fewer council seats changed hands on election day last time round than they did 20 years before in 1997. This points towards an airless void which leaves little place for political debate because even if voters know who their representatives are no one is motivated enough stand against them. With so many options available most choose not get involved. And those that do often find out its harder to engage constituents online rather than face-to-face.",0,818

""This particular part where you've got these two major roads intersecting each other - one leading inland into Nairobi [and] then towards Lamu Island...this is seen by many analysts as particularly vulnerable because if those checkpoints could be attacked successfully like they appear to have been tonight, then essentially all eyes would turn very much toward Mombasa port on the Indian Ocean coast,"" she added. Kenya sent troops across its border into southern Somalia six years ago to fight al-Shabaab fighters whom authorities say stepped up their campaign beyond their home territory, seeking refuge underground in more urban areas such as Garissa County close to the Ethiopian frontier.

"Frenchman Christophe Borgye's remains were found at a property in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, in 2013 - four years after he was reported missing. Manuel Wagner, 29, has been found guilty of his murder The body parts belonged to three other men who vanished without trace between 1994 and 2002 - Daniel Whitworth, 21; David Spencer, 19; and Brian Waters, 47. Whitworth disappeared on March 28 1994 while delivering food for Nando's in Liverpool city centre but never returned home. His car was later discovered by police with its engine still running near the M62 motorway.

But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech expert has warned MPs MPs are debating legislation that will allow the security services greater powers of surveillance online - including requiring companies such as Facebook and Google to break encryption systems so they can access communications. The Investigatory Powers Bill (IPB) is designed help intelligence agencies track terrorists by allowing them more intrusive means than simply reading their emails or tapping into phone calls.

"From April 2016, those in England and Wales will have to pay a 3 surcharge on each stamp duty band. George Osborne said the new surcharge would raise PS1bn extra for the Treasury over three years from 201718-19. The government has already announced that no such tax is planned within Scotland or Northern Ireland where stamp prices are lower than in England Wales (and therefore more property transactions take place). Linked to this announcement was confirmation of its plan to abolish Stamp Duty Land Tax completely by 2020 which may be an encouragement not least because there seems also little prospect at present of any further rises being implemented here during this Parliament; but who knows what might happen after May 2020?",0,866
"""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving his feet with great pace, weaving between cones - they are coloured yellow for easy identification when he is playing against 11 other boys and girls aged eight to 12 years old - but it isn't just about that. The session at Celtic FC Community Trust (CFCT) has been designed by coaches who have worked at Premier League clubs such as Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Manchester City. They teach skills specific to 5v5 games like agility training, passing and finishing techniques which translate well into full size matches. It may seem an odd concept coming from England where 11 v 11 dominates youth development programmes however the basic principles used here can be applied across all levels in Scotland regardless if there are two or 22 participants involved. The idea behind short intense sessions instead of longer ones focusing more on tactics was developed by people within Scottish Football Association during discussions surrounding how best to improve the national squads performance under Gordon Strachan's stewardship back in 2014 after their disastrous results over qualification groups for Euro 2016. This led them onto research conducted by Eric Cantona and then further studies undertaken around what makes elite teams successful before looking deeper still at coaching methods employed globally. When teenagers enter puberty and start growing taller, bigger muscles form making handling the ball less controllable without knocking the wind out of yourself. But hitting passes through small spaces becomes easier than ever so kids need quickly learn different ways - even unorthodox manoeuvres - to do this successfully whilst maintaining speed and control. ""If you were doing anything else besides kicking the ball I think we would probably see some injuries because children naturally don't want to take risks especially jumping off two feet too high realistically,"" explains Ian MacDonald from CFCT whose organisation took up residence alongside Parkhead last summer following previous moves to the various grounds Swansea City AFC play home fixtures at including Liberty Stadium, Vetch Field stadium and Fairwood Road sports ground. Mcdonald believes improving technical ability directly translates into increasing athleticism allowing young athletes to reach higher speeds while keeping possession of the ball meaning better team work habits develop. These kinds of things are vital attributes needed for any success scored abroad according to Macdonald: ""We know many countries now use us regularly to improve their own game."" And crucially these lessons aren't exclusive only available those who join academies set ups by top flight European outfits; semi-professional sides, school leavers hoping to make career changes away from sport entirely, Sunday league veterans wanting to sharpen existing skill sets also reap rewards. A recent study carried out among 13 year olds showed almost 70 weren't satisfied with current opportunities given to them leaving vast swathes of talent untapped, not helped either by traditional notions. In Scotland youngsters starting out tend to attend big cities due to being able train and compete close enough together rather than spend hours travelling long distances each week and most opt to focus solely on winning rather developing individual abilities. Most English academy graduates will go straight into professional contracts whereas in Scotland parents feel pressure put upon them by head teachers and PE instructors alike telling pupils becoming pro could affect future job prospects should they decide to pursue something else later down life. However numbers studying physical education careers actually dropped slightly despite a rise among others related subjects prompting debate around whether encouraging extra curricular activities lead towards improved educational attainment?",0,868

"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry is due to speak at 3:00 p.m., but according to reports in Hebrew media, his plans have been changed since Saturday evening when he had planned to present during an event held at IDF Headquarters and attended only by middle level officers appropriate solutions for continuing Israel's control over Area C without losing its Jewish majority or having any Palestinian state there. In recent years, Palestinians living under PA rule are increasingly complaining that they lack security services such as police stations which extend their authority beyond territory officially designated ""Area A,"" where the PA directly administers civilian matters with help from international forces stationed nearby; ""A"" represents about 20 percent of Judea and Samaria. The rest lies within what Israelis call ""Area B,"" which includes all large towns including Nablus and Ramallah cities while leaving most other areas largely ungoverned, often falling into anarchy, making it easy for terrorists among them - like those behind last week's stabbing attack near Ofra -to operate freely. According to sources familiar with planning, one solution would be to set up a joint force comprised mainly of Arabs serving under orders given out by members of the civil administration residing in area C together with additional personnel brought in through bilateral agreements between Israel and Jordan. This idea has already been advanced in talks held several times between senior officials from both sides, who agree that creating a force similar to Lebanon's UPDF, whose ranks include many Christian Lebanese soldiers, could prevent further attacks against Jews inside Israel.",0,871

"During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK. He worked tirelessly to ensure money for their upkeep and was responsible for making sure they were eventually settled into homes with suitable foster parents after a period staying at various hostels until they found permanent placements. He also arranged the transport of Hungarian Jews who had been imprisoned by Germany's ally Hungary during World War II under appalling conditions as part of Operation Margarethe (named after Queen Margaretha). The escape plan involved refugees on forced marches through mountainous terrain being shot if they fell behind schedule or failed to catch up - often resulting in numerous deaths along the way before reaching Austria via Italy where most would be transferred onto boats bound for Palestine. For this operation alone, Mr Darvall earned himself an OBE nomination but didn't receive it because his name wasn't cleared like others working alongside him due to lack of proof that he'd assisted those arrested so many years earlier - something acknowledged decades later when three members of staff received British Empire Medals instead; Pauline Leibovitsky, Ruth Silverman and Louisa McLean.

The second explosion was very big,"" witness Li Xu told Reuters by phone before he fled from his office near Tiananmen Square to a nearby subway station. Footage on television showed passengers screaming as they plunged head-first down escalators in a tunnel following reports of gunfire inside Beijing Railway Station. Ambulances screamed into action outside the main concourse at the city centre hub after the blasts erupted around 8:30 p.m (1230 GMT), sirens blaring and lights flashing. Passengers ran for safety through smoke-filled corridors between railway carriages. Others lay on ground bleeding from wounds including bloodied heads. At least three bodies could be seen lying amid shattered glass with crowds milling about and many shouting or crying. State broadcaster CCTV aired amateur footage showing police struggling to cordon off some streets leading away from the site of the attack. Police armed with assault rifles patrolled an adjacent road lined with numerous blackened buildings while paramilitary policemen stood guard at entrances to housing compounds in the area. A group of men wearing white T-shirts clustered under a bridge overpass, where rescue workers had stored backpacks filled with emergency supplies - presumably left behind when commuters evacuated. Traffic came to standstill across central Beijing late on Friday evening as security forces sealed off roads leaving only pedestrians free to traverse usually busy sections.

Some questioned why they weren't allowed more information but others seemed resigned even though they felt safe enough within their neighbourhoods to venture outdoors. 'TOURISTS ARE SAFE' No details have emerged yet concerning those injured nor any possible motives for the attacks. But in the wake of such violence, China has taken steps towards preventing another incident like this happening again. Shortly after midnight, state media reported all bus service connecting Beijing with neighbouring cities south of the capital would stop until further notice due to tightened security checks on highways entering the city. All seven underground lines servicing Beijing also stopped running between 10pm (1400GMT) and 9am (0100GMT).

"Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA has also revealed two distinct sub-populations: one centred on Russia's Volga riverlands close to where most Russians live today; another around Kiev in Ukraine. The study found Ukrainians had more genetic overlap with Western Europe than any other country except Estonia but did not have enough samples for individual analysis as is standard practice among academic studies. Just over 12 of their genomes came from the ancient farming migrants who settled central Asia about 7 000 years ago before spreading into Europe. That figure compares with 40-50 in many European countries. The researchers said this suggested some Ukrainian lands were occupied by both groups at different times.

And it was also a successful afternoon of European football in general with Celtic progressing into the last 16 despite losing 1-0 to Lyon while Arsenal beat Fenerbahce 3-1 away from home which means that Arsene Wenger will now be able to concentrate his energies fully on trying to progress further in the Champions League with them rather than having one eye constantly looking over his shoulder back towards the Premier League title race and suffer another slip up like he did earlier in December when Liverpool won 4-3 there at Anfield.",0,900

"The video of Bailey Matthews showing him abandoning his walking aid to cross the finish line has been viewed on Facebook more than 27 million times. Bailey, from Doncaster, was in a wheelchair for about six years after being diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he started school Bailey's story became even bigger thanks to the support and fundraising efforts by The Brain Tumour Charity - which helped make it possible for mum Claire (pictured) to travel around Europe before her son died last year aged 10 MUM'S HORROR STORY: HOW CLAIRE LOST HER SON TO A BRAIN TUMOUR... 'I remember looking at my beautiful little boy who had just turned five-and-a-half one day - such an energetic, happy child full of life. Then suddenly I noticed that he wasn't using both legs like other children do.' It was October 11 2016 and Claire Matthews knew something was wrong then as she watched her young son walk into their home with two different gait patterns. But still they did not know what would cause them such devastation within weeks later. That Christmas Eve, while preparing dinner together, Claire took out some new plates. Her husband Stewart looked over at Baileys and spotted a large lump behind its eyes. She rushed him off to hospital where doctors found nothing untoward but advised further tests were needed. In January 2017, shortly before Easter Bunny parties began, he fell down stairs outside the family home. He lost consciousness immediately but came round quickly enough once paramedics arrived. After scans, repeated blood tests and x-rays no obvious problems could be seen so they returned home. But days later there was another fall during a visit to Sheffield Children's Hospital. Doctors eventually discovered a tumour growing near the brain stem. Surgeons removed part of the growth including half of his left hemisphere of the brain known as the cerebellum. They also managed to remove 99 per cent of the tumour itself without damaging any major nerves or the main artery supplying oxygenated blood to the head. At first everything seemed stable until August 18 2018 when Bailey developed high fever and vomiting. Staff ran tests straight away because this type of reaction is frequently linked to meningitis infections caused by bacteria entering the body through wounds such as cuts. However, results came back clear. Within hours though Bailey appeared unable to move anything below his waist except his right arm. One minute he couldn't turn himself over, next thing you know he can't feel his lower limbs,' said Mrs Matthews. A scan showed swelling throughout his spine and doctors told the parents devastating news. Paediatric neurologists confirmed the worst fears; cancerous cells already present inside the surgery area had spread and multiple medulloblastoma secondary cancers now existed in three separate areas. These typically affect children under four and are highly aggressive with very few treatment options available due to their location deep inside the spinal cord, skull base and optic nerve. Surgery alone carries significant risks given how close these tumors are situated in relation to vital structures. And chemotherapy might reduce symptoms temporarily only for the disease to return months later requiring equally difficult treatment plans. Although Mr and Ms Matthews agreed to go ahead with intensive radiotherapy, it carried huge side effects too. This included bloating all over his face, hands and feet meaning he struggled to eat and drink properly. He also suffered severe diarrhoea and nausea reducing his appetite dramatically leaving him feeling weak and exhausted most of the time. His weight dropped rapidly falling to 5st 3lbs less than half his normal height by early December. Despite having numerous platelets transfusions to help clotting and provide immunity against infection either directly donated by people just like themselves or made artificially in labs many often resulted in internal bleeding leading surgeons to struggle controlling pressure drops resulting in frequent hospital admissions. Because the tumor prevented much of the circulation in his arms and legs working correctly weakened tissues caused painful sores preventing Claire getting adequate rest putting extra strain on Bailey whenever trying to change dressing especially towards end of 2019. On December 31 2020 staff admitted Bailey saying things weren't going well despite various treatments designed specifically for rarer forms of pediatric malignancies. By New Year Day medical teams decided action must come fast if they wanted to save lives to buy Bailey precious time every hour counted. With coronavirus restrictions delaying usual transfer procedures long enough, specialists created bespoke care plan allowing clinicians to gain access remotely via telemedicine equipment never used previously due to current health crisis. Those involved in caring for Bailey estimate it saved up to 48 hours precious time helping improve chances overall rewarding team effort across Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust specialising in neurological illnesses working closely alongside University College London Cancer Centre UK experts diagnosing why Bailey continued suffering worsening condition despite specialist drugs meant to control certain types of childhood cancers improving outcome ultimately saving patients' quality of life.

"Adrian Simut, 35, travelled to Newport train station, where he thought he was meeting a 14-year-old girl called Sam. But he was confronted by so-called ""paedophile hunters"" and later arrested, the court heard. Prosecutor David Pinnell told Swansea Crown Court: ""In reality it turned out that what Mr Simut had been communicating with online were two women who are members of an organisation which is dedicated to meeting up men at railway stations in order for them to be met by younger persons pretending they want sex."" The defendant admitted attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming between December 16 last year and January 10 this year. He also pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children - including some involving young boys - after police searched his home address on March 7. Prosecutor Amanda Lewis said one video showed five males raping a female while another depicted a boy aged eight or nine being given oral sex by adults. Some other videos featured girls as young as seven years old performing sex acts. All the footage appeared to have been taken abroad rather than within Britain. Jonathan Webb, defending, asked Judge Keith Thomas not to impose any jail sentence due to medical complications arising from a septic wound on his left leg which meant the inmate could only stand upright during breaks to wash himself if seated. The barrister added there would be no problem complying with the terms of release because Simut already worked full time night shifts stacking shelves for Tesco's distribution centre near Cardiff docks.

"Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) aims to reduce radiation leaks in three months and to cool the reactors within nine months. The firm said it also planned to cover the damaged reactors with a double-layered shield of special concrete by 2015 that will be able to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 8 - one every 150 years on Japan's northeast coast, where several quakes have struck over the past two weeks. The government has pledged more than 5 billion towards decommissioning costs for Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant operator Tepco after Prime Minister Naoto Kan promised last week there would not be any further cost increases beyond what was already budgeted as part of its business plan through March 2013.",0,933
"Germany forward Linden, who was signed from Frankfurt, nodded in from a Kerys Harrop cross to salvage a point. Melissa Fletcher had put the hosts ahead, meeting an Emma Follis through ball before rounding keeper Lee Alexander and slotting home in the seventh minute of injury time for their second victory this season after 11 games. A win would have moved them above Wolfsburg at the top but they are stuck on six points along with 16th-placed Potsdam, while Leverkusen dropped down one place into fifth on 10 following Bayern Munich's 4-1 demolition of Koln later Saturday.

"The new plan is for training to be split across three different sites. There would be some joint training, but the three services would each have their own facilities. The Army and Navy would hold most of its exercises at Fort Ord in Monterey County; Air Force units trained on a base near San Luis Obispo that was once used by the U-2 spy plane program. But all that has changed since then: Base closures forced the closure of both bases - leaving only Camp Edwards as an option now. And with tensions rising between Washington and Beijing over trade issues and other matters, military commanders say it's more important than ever to maintain close ties among the branches so they can work together seamlessly if there were any kind conflict with China or another nation.",0,936
"""Dependency on giving that only appears to be charitable must end,"" he said in a tweet ahead of this weekend's African Union summit in South Africa. The BBC's Robert Kiptoo says the AU will discuss migration at its meeting, but it is unlikely to make new commitments publicly because there are few solutions on offer and no consensus from member states. A number of countries have taken unilateral action - closing borders or sending people back across them. The UN has warned such actions violate human rights law and risk causing further suffering for migrants fleeing conflict, extreme poverty and persecution. What does Ethiopia say about returnees? Ethiopia deported hundreds more Eritreans last month after they had been stranded at two transit centres near the border with Djibouti since 2017 when the government closed the main crossing point into Sudan. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in 2018, campaigned on promises of reform including making peace with neighbouring Eritrea. But his authorities also launched an offensive against dissident groups inside Tigray state, where many ethnic Afar minorities were forcibly displaced by the TPLF before fighting broke out between federal troops and local forces earlier this year. Tens of thousands fled their homes amid reports of atrocities committed by both sides. Many sought refuge beyond Ethiopian territory along the border with north-eastern Eritrea. When Mr Abiy announced victory over rebel fighters several months later, those refugees began returning home voluntarily. This week, however, officials tried to stop buses carrying 113 Eritrean nationals trying to cross through the Semera checkpoint close to the shared frontier, which sparked anger among some international charities working in the area. ""Our team witnessed large numbers being detained while attempting to leave via unofficial routes under police escort towards Massawa city... we believe these individuals were eventually returned to Yemen,"" one wrote online. Another added: ""It was very distressing seeing families separated as a result."" Officials told AFP news agency none would be sent back until conditions improved. ""Eritreans should wait here [in Ethiopia] till our country is peaceful again,"" defence ministry spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane said. ""We need time... not immediately; let us keep you guys safe first. Once everything settles down then come back."" What do European politicians think? Several EU leaders called for urgent talks following recent developments, citing fears for asylum and refugee protections. They discussed plans during a virtual gathering hosted by Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel. In June 2020, Denmark reversed plans to deport 26 unaccompanied minors who arrived illegally with family members three years ago. Similarly, Sweden agreed in July 2020 to allow Syrians seeking protection to remain indefinitely rather than send them home despite having legal opposition from its rightwing minority government. One politician familiar with discussions involving six other nations suggested postponing any decisions pending fresh elections in Italy next spring. Germany continues to face pressure for allowing nearly 40,000 asylum seekers to stay even though they entered without valid documentation. And UK Home Secretary Priti Patel accused her French counterpart of refusing responsibility regarding migrants already present in France claiming to want to seek asylum in Britain instead of staying closer to northern Europe. So what can happen now? Some destinations may refuse entry to anyone arriving irregularly if current trends continue unchecked. Others might start turning away potential claimants based on nationality alone, something which could mean tens of thousands stuck within Europe unless individual agreements are reached with each nation involved. Countries targeted by migrant smuggling networks could see arrivals increase once travel restrictions ease due to concerns raised by coronavirus lockdowns like job losses and financial hardship throughout much of southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Attempts by aid agencies operating off Somalia's coast to deliver food and medical supplies using smaller boats means more lives saved compared with larger vessels used previously. However, environmentalists fear this shift to less polluting methods threatens livelihoods needed by communities relying upon tourism associated with big ships. Courtesy: (BBC)",0,937
"Culture Secretary Maria Miller said ""decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table"" during the BBC's charter review before 2017.

"Vikki Thompson, 21, died at HMP Leeds on 13 November. She had been awaiting sentencing for robbery. Her partner Bob Steele said the letter should have alerted officials to her condition and that women who did not report their pregnancies were also at risk of suicide. ""She was a healthy woman before she went in there but when it came out they couldn't understand why,"" he told BBC News after being shown an extract from his girlfriend's death note which read: 'I am at the lowest point I can ever get.' The prison service declined to comment further than saying Ms Thompson took her own life while on remand as no inquest has taken place yet into how or where she died. A spokesperson added ""our sympathies are with Mr Steele [Mr Solomons] and family."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland ordered an urgent review of reproductive healthcare provisions across all prisons following Miss Thompson's case. ""Pregnant prisoners need specialist support inside and outside to ensure both mother and baby receive the best possible care throughout pregnancy,"" he said last month. During Theresa May's premiership, more pregnant female inmates were given space to give birth away from other prisoners in custody suites but campaigners argue this is insufficient. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Steele described Viki as having a ""heart of gold"" despite battling drug abuse issues since childhood. He claims staff knew that if anything happened during childbirth then the baby would be placed into foster care adding up to another tragedy.",0,942
"US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that play a key role in fighting infection by killing toxins from harmful bacteria such as S. aureus.[1] The researchers first tested whether adding extra vitamin D would have any effect on the number or effectiveness of these ""killer"" cells against S. aureus after they had been extracted from mice - but without being activated - then reinjected into healthy mice. The results showed an enhanced protective response when both B3 plus vitamin D was injected before injecting the live dangerous bugs into another group of inoculated animals. This suggested making the killer T-cells more effective at targeting invading pathogens like S. aureus using either treatment approach is beneficial. The team next looked specifically for changes in gene activity levels caused by giving each component separately rather than together. They discovered significantly increased expression of two chemokine genes (CXCL12 and CXCR2) which are involved with attracting white blood cell reinforcements called macrophages to infected tissue sites where S. aureus can cause damage if left untreated. These findings suggest boosting immunity through this specific mechanism could be beneficial even though it's not directly linked to activating T-cell function alone.[2] Dr. Minhajul Haque says:",0,943

"It has been hailed as the most comprehensive list to date. About 9,000 names - nearly all German - are on the Auschwitz garrison list, some with photographs attached. The original document is in Polish and contains information about when they arrived at the camp, their unit designation, what they did there, where they were from and how long they stayed before being sent to another concentration camp or transferred into forced labour. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content ""I think it's a great collection ... because of its completeness,"" said David Ferreira, head archivist for Nazi-era records at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Centre in Jerusalem who analyzed the documents. He called them an important resource that will allow scholars to study individual prisoners and units. According to historians' estimates, more than 1 million people, mostly Jews, perished during World War Two at Auschwitz, which was run by Nazi Germany alongside other death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. 'THEY ALL DIED HERE' A copy of the archive provided exclusively to Reuters includes details on 642 victims known only by their prison numbers: 214 Germans, 116 Poles, 56 Hungarians, 43 Romanians - among them Gypsies - 18 Frenchmen, 14 Italians, 10 Rumanian Communists, eight Dutch citizens, seven Belgians, six Russians, five Greeks, four Czechs, three Slovaks and two Swedes. What makes this unique is that unlike previous lists, it does not contain any entries for prisoners whose final destination was one of these other camps. They died en route. Israel Museum curator Shmuel Rosenman believes it is likely that many of those buried at Birkenau's unknown mass graves had originally been part of various SS formations stationed around Poland and Hungary earlier in the war. Some may have even fought against each other, he suggested. Among the population kept out of sight until 1945 appears to be 13 political prisoners, including nine communists, an anti-fascist trade unionist and two Jehovah's Witnesses. Historians say communist forces operating in the area took several thousand Jewish prisoners late in 1944 after retreating Soviet troops retreated westward ahead of advancing Western Allied armies. There could also be members of resistance groups like the Zegota organization in hiding. Reached by phone, 85 year old Piotr Rybak, a survivor born near Lodz in central Poland now living in Toronto, expressed hope others would come forward given heightened awareness today about preserving historical memory and preventing future genocides. ""The survivors know everything we went through. We don't need to repeat our stories again and again. I wish somebody comes forth so we can give testimony to history.""

"Five justices in the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge for an inquiry into the shootings at Batang Kali in 1948 by a four to one majority. The families, who say they were members of the armed wing of the communist party (IPR) led by Jose Maria Sison, wanted justice with regards compensation and reparation from the state. They are still waiting today as almost 70 years later no action has been taken against those responsible for their loved ones' deaths. The court used its so-called 'laches,' or lateness doctrine when deciding on whether it was reasonable that complainants waited over seven decades since taking legal proceedings before invoking them now. That principle is legally untenable given advancements made globally especially in mass atrocity investigations; according to Human Rights Watch ""national judicial institutions must not be allowed to shield abusers."" While this decision may seem like another failure to deliver justice through our courts - where perpetrators often get away scot free due to loopholes within national laws which allow impunity - there have also been some important steps forward towards accountability too. In 2018 President Rodrigo Duterte signed a bill allowing victims of human rights abuses to file cases directly against perpetrators without going first to local authorities. As well as introducing measures such as integrated reporting systems to strengthen coordination between government agencies involved on preventing violence and protecting survivors. And last month 12 Filipino soldiers implicated in extrajudicial killings during martial law under dictator Ferdinand Marcos went on trial after being charged 40 years ago. Why do we need international involvement here? Despite these efforts domestic mechanisms alone can't guarantee access to redress for all current and future victims once past crimes escape responsibility because of outdated legislation or weak implementation. We cannot expect any other outcome than more trauma if states fail to prosecute war criminals let along pay restitution to surviving family members whose lives remain destroyed even 90 years later.

"He crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race - a gesture made by Ethiopia's Oromo people who have suffered brutal police crackdowns. He says he may run again, but there is just too much to do at home first. ""I will be very happy if I win these elections,"" said Abiy in an interview with Reuters last week from house arrest where he was held for four years before regaining his freedom and returning to lead the country of 105 million people. ""There are many other things that need my attention."" The former soldier became prime minister two years ago after three decades of repressive rule under Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, whose death in August 2015 prompted protests across Africa's second-most populous nation. Those demonstrations were put down harshly until Abiy took office pledging reforms including media freedoms and opening up political space. In 2018, opposition parties won all 547 seats in parliament. Now they face off against each other on June 21 when more than 37 million registered voters go to cast ballots. They're choosing lawmakers whose votes Abiy needs to push through promised economic and democratic reforms which would allow him stay in power longer. But Abiy has been detained several times this year because of unrest or concerns over national security - most recently following deadly protests sparked by a dispute between Addis Ababa and the capital city Addis Aabeda over land rights in April 2019. Although technically still free while campaigning ahead of next month's vote, Abiy can't travel far without fearing another detention. For now though, state television channels show him daily giving speeches and promising prosperity and peace. It's not clear how long it might take to move beyond words and get changes passed. As one senior ruling party official told Reuters: ""It requires time... We must overcome our challenges together."" When asked about flaws holding back change so far, Abiy noted limited resources and suggested some institutions needed reform themselves. ""Some leaders don't want to leave their positions easily because we've got used to them staying there forever,"" he added. 'CAN'T WIN EVERYTHING' Abiy wears traditional Ethiopian robes known as khatas, speaks fluent Amharic and sings songs of praise at rallies designed to appeal to different ethnic groups. Born in the town of Beshasha in 1983 into the Oromo group, the largest ethnic community accounting for around 40 of Ethiopians, he studied law at Addis Ababa University and worked briefly as a lawyer. After joining the military, he rose rapidly. When mass anti-government protests erupted in 2016, Abiy supported the demonstrators initially but then turned against them. Then army chief of staff, he helped broker a deal ending two years of violence along ethnic lines that killed hundreds of thousands and displaced 2 million. He later resigned his position and went into politics fulltime. Since becoming leader, however, critics say he hasn't done enough to quell ethnicity-based conflicts nationwide. Female activists describe him as patriarchal, saying he sometimes seems indifferent to women's issues like sexual harassment amid widespread reports of rape during conflict. And although Abiy welcomed ethnic Tigrayan rebels back into the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition that previously dominated government, other groups complain of being sidelined politically and economically. [nL8N24H2SJ] This election could see further delays due to COVID-19 though officials deny this. Only 34 parties out of 44 active participants had submitted applications for registration as of May 13, according to the electoral board. Some prominent new entrants include Jawar Mohammed, the outspoken owner of TV station Oromia Media Network, who fled abroad late last year citing threats to himself and family. Another new arrival is Demeke Mekonnen, vice chairman of the National Movement of Amhara (NaMA), a newly formed ethnically based regional political party founded by popular musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, shot dead by unknown gunmen in December. Could this mean fragmentation? That depends partly on whether Abiy wins big, said Samuel Ramani, research fellow at Oxford university's Africa Programme. If smaller parties feel shut out, ""they'll form alliances post-election,"" said Ramani; otherwise the system could become ungovernable.",0,962
"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was to last until February 11th at least - enough time for preparations for an elaborate peace conference planned for Geneva on that day. In fact there were further talks between Russian diplomats led by Mr Lavrov and American officials over subsequent days before another agreement which included a fresh accord about withdrawing Ukrainian troops from rebel-held areas (see article). The first phase of this process started badly: Ukraine's government swiftly dismissed it as ineffective; Russia announced its own withdrawal within hours when fighters continued firing across part of the front line; four soldiers died after artillery fire hit their vehicle near Debaltseve. Yet partly because both sides are now used to dealing with one-another face to face, matters improved quickly thereafter. Last week NATO said more than 60 of all violations had ceased since January 15th. On Friday America offered preliminary sanctions relief - including easing restrictions against Gazprom, Russia's state gas giant - on condition that Moscow plays ""constructive"" roles at future international forums. A Western diplomat says the new truce is likely to stick better precisely because Kiev will be less eager to scupper any chance of progress. It may also help that some rebels themselves want out of a conflict they fear has little hope of success without foreign backing. With Vladimir Putin reportedly worried about domestic unrest if his proxies suffer heavy losses, he might well feel obliged to keep them supplied with arms long enough for negotiations to start properly. Fierce fighting continues around Mariupol but appears unlikely ever again to threaten either Donetsk or Luhansk, with populations too large and determinedly pro-Russian. If so, then these two cities could become safe bases not only for negotiating a settlement but also organising local elections under UN supervision later this year, perhaps even taking place inside government territory. One crucial test remains whether Moscow keeps up supplies not just for individual units but also entire brigades. But given how high the stakes still appear to be for each side, we should prepare ourselves for setbacks along the way rather than assume total victory next month. After all, hopes rose during previous ceasefires similarly to those today yet fell apart almost immediately afterwards.",0,963

"Media playback is not supported on this device Real took the lead in the ninth minute through Karim Benzema, but Gaku Shibasaki scored either side of half-time to put Kashima ahead Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Japanese champions Kashima Antlers was a case of history repeating itself for manager Zinedine Zidane. The Frenchman became only the second man after Bob Paisley 40 years ago to lift three consecutive Champions League titles with different clubs as he oversaw his first victory at Los Blancos since returning from Juventus. Zizou has now won all nine games against J-League opposition during his managerial career - and six by a two goal margin or more: ""We're very happy,"" said Zidane. ""It wasn't easy because we knew what sort of game it would be."" And who better to help him celebrate than Cristiano Ronaldo? The Portuguese superstar fired home an 81st minute penalty to make sure that despite being outplayed for long periods, they went back to Spain with their place in the last 16 secured before Christmas. Yet again though, there were question marks about how far this team will go in Europe if Bale doesn't fire up front. It had been over four months since his most recent strike when he came off the bench to score twice against PSG just days earlier. Here though, once Isco also entered the fray early in the second period, things changed significantly. Kashima vented frustration late on courtesy of several bookings received by goalkeeper Yoichiro Kakitani (right) Everywhere you looked, former Manchester United winger Nani caused problems down both flanks while Yuya Osako used his height well too. Indeed, it could have got even worse had Shinji Okazaki given away a penalty midway through the second half instead of bundling into Thibaut Courtois' chest under pressure from Marcelo. Despite the threat posed by such players however, it was one man who made the difference here thanks to another clinical finish which brought up double figures in terms of goals scored across all competitions so far this term. His tally stands at 12. In fact, according to Opta, no player has found the net more times than Ronaldo since September. He may still find some rivals closing in soon enough, but right now nobody looks quite capable of stopping that devastating form... Karim Benzema opened the scoring after converting Dani Carvajal's cross 10 minutes later In addition to breaking records domestically, Ronaldo can also claim credit for winning victims hearts around Asia wherever he goes. That much was clear to see following Thursday night's group stage opener where fans from Guangzhou Evergrande and Shanghai SIPG produced banners proclaiming 'Ronaldo', presumably in reference to the Portugal captain rather than Paul Pogba! They travelled hundreds of miles hoping to catch a glimpse of arguably football's greatest ever player yet sadly many left disappointed due to security restrictions preventing them entering Signal Iduna Park until kick-off time. Not such issues greeted those watching events unfold live from Japan today. After missing training last week due to illness, those attending showed great patience waiting patiently along streets adorned with flags bearing Ronaldo's image throughout Saturday morning as supporters lined up outside the stadium hours before kick-off. Their efforts seemed justified almost immediately as Real quickly raced into leading position inside 90 seconds - although admittedly aided somewhat by defensive frailty in possession from Kashima. As usual, Gareth Bale proved particularly effective utilised wide on the opposite flank, drifting towards the touchline whenever possible. A run deep into opposition territory created space behind the defence allowing Toni Kroos to pick out Daniel Carvajal whose low centre was turned past Shusaku Nishikawa via a deflection from Jonathan Viera. But then disaster struck less than 60 seconds later. Former Premier League full-back Yuto Nagatomo darted infield onto Johnathan de Guzman's pass while Luka Modric chased alongside him leaving Nobuhiro Kojima free to feed substitute striker Karim Ansarifard who played a neat give-and-go before firing beyond Keylor Navas. On any other day, perhaps Real might have wilted having surrendered such an advantage so early on. Instead theirs was never going to be a defeatist attitude here. Having already clinched qualification prior to Wednesday's matchday five fixtures, attention switched to ensuring top spot here and avoiding Chelsea in round 16 next month. When Casemiro drifted forward before seeing his shot blocked, Ronaldo stepped up knowing exactly what he needed to do; guiding the ball expertly between legs before sending it flying high into the roof of the net. Thereafter, Real began to dominate proceedings without managing to add anything else significant to ensure they remained level on points with Group H winners Borussia Dortmund but with a superior head-to-head record meaning progress into the knockout stages regardless of the outcome of Tuesday's clash at Stamford Bridge.",0,976
"The Reverend Gavin Ashenden, a senior clergyman in the Church of England, left his position as chaplain in order to be free to criticise the move. A passage from the Bible that he used to make his argument is: ""If you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses."" Matthew 6 v 12-15 (KJV) While clearly stating forgiveness must mean something different than simply letting people off 'Scot free' for wrongdoings they have committed; but how much more should we extend this? With Jesus Christ being our Saviour and Lord - shouldn't He be able to save us all if needed... even those outside His church family? Isn't it true God forgives everyone 'in spite' or because of 'our sins?' In short - yes! If one only reads what was written about salvation before Jesus came into the world, then everything comes down to works - by which many were keeping track back then (Romans 3). But with Christ's finished work on the cross taking the place of mankind's inability to live up to its own standards... why does anyone need to go through additional steps after accepting Him?",0,977

"Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles were probably used in a section of what was there previously - an area that now houses Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, according to The Times of Israel (TOTI). The researchers believe it is possible they could have been part of buildings or structures built by Solomon when he conquered Jerusalem around 1000 B.C., TOTI said: ""You can imagine building something like this would be really expensive but also very impressive,"" archaeologist Amit Reem told Haaretz newspaper at the dig earlier this month. In addition to temples for worshipers of Yahweh, which are thought to have stood on top of where the mosque stands today, ""Solomon brought other people into his kingdom"" such as Phoenicians who helped build ""a magnificent port city...as well as large storage facilities."" Irena Zuzakowska-Olejnik, co-director of the excavations with Reem, added, 'We know about these big complexes because we find evidence down below ... This is just one piece among many others [that] tells us how important King Solomons palace complex must've been. "" Citing biblical accounts, scholars think the temple was destroyed during the Babylonian exile following the Jewish defeat against the ancient empire led by Hammurabi beginning roughly 2300 years ago; its ruins remained standing until Herod's construction project began after Alexander Jannaeus seized power over Judea and Samaria circa 106 BC. Archaeologists discovered parts of stone walls surrounding some remains believed to belong to the structure while digging southward beneath Lions' Gate toward Ophel last year alongside more than 50 residents employed in archaeological digs sponsored through the Waqf Council - The Islamic endowment that administers the compound - and overseen by Antiquities Authority officials working under contract for the council, along with experts hired specifically for the work. More discoveries may yet come before archaeologists conclude their 2017 season late next week unless rains cause additional delays.
