"Open source code has been essential for China's rapidly growing tech sector. GitHub has been a large part of this growth, but its future in China is uncertain. Many fear the US-based company could be blocked by Chinese authorities if there are no changes to comply with new cyber security laws enacted last year that require overseas companies doing business here to keep user data within China."" GitHub reportedly pulled down around 200 accounts being used to facilitate intellectual property theft and other prohibited activities related to open source projects from across different sectors such as technology, manufacturing etc., leading The Verge report further elaborating on how these account holders were stealing information about foreign entities' products or services via their respective social media profiles.",0,2
"Ant Group's world record-setting initial public offering has been suspended. Its controller, executive chairman, and CEO were summoned and interviewed by regulators in China. The company later reported significant issues with its financial reporting, the state of which remains unclear but is reportedly serious enough for Ant to have told investors it will delay filing its official preliminary prospectus until after a meeting between officials at the country's central bank (People's Bank of China) next week. On Wednesday morning local time, shares of Alibaba fell as much as 10 amid speculation that Chinese authorities would soon move against some companies like Jack Ma's conglomerate as part of an anti-monopoly campaign announced last month. However, many observers noted these reactions may be overblown or simply due to concerns about market confidence rather than any specific actions being taken. It wasn't long before they reversed course: By midafternoon U.S. tech stocks had led the Dow Jones Industrial Average back toward all-time highs set earlier this year while Hong Kong equities rebounded from losses yesterday on their biggest rally since November 2019. Wall Street futures also climbed higher - albeit more modestly - as traders shrugged off those early jitters even if sentiment remained decidedly cautious ahead of jobs data today expected to show further deterioration in the labor market due to COVID-19 related shutdowns during recent months. Today could see tensions ratcheting up again elsewhere too. European Union leaders are currently discussing how best to respond to Russian President Vladimir Putin becoming lawless in parts of EU member Ukraine. Meanwhile, another clash looms tonight between Italy and France over immigration policy; Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte wants tougher action whereas his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron prefers dialogue because he fears reprisals from Turkey given rising numbers of migrants trying to cross into Europe through Greece via sea routes there. And then finally...in what looks likely to end badly, Israeli police say Benjamin Netanyahu can now request immunity from corruption charges thanks to support within parliament reached following elections held two weeks ago. His opponents must still agree to lift parliamentary immunity once it comes down to debating whether to let him stand trial though opposition parties aren't convinced joining them will help them win power and remain suspicious despite claims otherwise made by pro-Netanyahu politicians including one who threatened ""to tear apart"" anyone opposing such efforts.",0,3
"A Tesla Model S owner is suing the company because his Tesla crashed into a Ford Fiesta in the next lane ""suddenly, and without any warning"" at 80mph when he was driving along Pacific Highway. The man bought an insurance policy through Esurance with 5 million of coverage to cover him against damage from crashes caused by another automobile but that's not what happened according to court documents seen by Business Insider. Instead, he alleges, his car insurer did exactly opposite - they refused to pay out on claims for repairs after accident-related vehicle damage which resulted from ""an incident involving one of its insured drivers non fault crash,"" it says, adding: ""Esurance declined this claim alleging that the defendant driver of the other vehicle bore no liability."" In lieu of payment, Emeurancia offered the plaintiff just 500 as compensation towards having their vehicle repaired or replaced. The lawsuit also accuses Esurance of breach of contract relating to failing to provide adequate information about Esurance policies' coverage limits prior to purchase. As such, the suit seeks damages including lost wages (the cost of hiring someone else), expenses incurred during repair work plus interest and attorneys fees among others.

"Many dog breeds are about appearance, but plenty of others are devoted to specific tasks. A team of US-based researchers conducted a study on around 18,000 dogs to study dog breed differences in the areas of cognition and behavior with particular focus on the herding group (sheepdogs), sporting groups (retrievers) and working group (gardeners). The results showed that some breeds were more likely than others to be praised by their owners as being intelligent or having good ""obedience."" The most popularly used terms included'smart', 'clever' and 'trainable'. Some 43 rated those traits for retrievers, 54 for border collies, 62 for shepherds and 67 also for setters. When it came to obedience only 36, 39, 33 and 42 respectively gave praise to all three types of dog which suggests there is no one type of training they find particularly easy compared to another. ""We often hear from people who have trouble raising certain kinds of dogs,"" said Cynthia Otto, professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine. She added: ""In this study we wanted to provide evidence not just based upon anecdotal reports asking whether different behaviors like aggression, anxiety, fearfulness might be associated with temperament and intelligence, but instead ask experts how these things vary across breeds so we can begin to get an objective view of what makes each individual kind of dog unique.""",0,6
"SpaceX has posted a job for a'Resort Development Manager' to be based out of Brownsville, a town near its Boca Chica test and development site.

""If you have experience in developing unique real estate projects with high profile brands such as Disney or Starwood Hotels Resorts we want to talk to you!"" reads the message from Elon Musk's rocket builder. However it doesn't appear that any properties at this point are being developed for potential use by SpaceX employees and their families - it appears more focused around tourism than anything else (or maybe commercialization), which may suggest another link between Starship testing grounds and space hotels? It would certainly make sense given how much work goes into keeping those facilities clean and safe, not only during tests but throughout integration efforts before flight too.",0,7

"GW Ori is a star system 1,300 light years away from Earth. It has three stars and is surrounded by a massive disk of dust and gas. The disk is being gravitationally torn apart at its centre into two clumps which are in the process of forming planets. The researchers used data gathered over four nights as part of SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) using ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer to construct an image containing more than 150 individual images each capturing one side of the planet-forming disc around the young red dwarf star HD 163296 on September 10-14, 2019, when the region was only visible through a gap between the clouds. This new method allowed astronomers to 'peel back' the layers of the planet-forming disc - or stellar nursery - revealing intricate details about this unique star system that would otherwise be invisible. They found the innermost ring, where baby planets could have already formed, surrounds the central pair of stars while farther out there appears another dense ring called a debris disc embedded within the outer ring. Both rings contain large amounts of iron, forming what is known as a circumbinary disc made up almost entirely of metal. On either side of both discs lie gaps in denser regions containing huge quantities of dark matter with diameters similar to those of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter in our own Solar System. Lead author Dr Ingo Waldmann said: ""We were really surprised how much detail we could see just by taking multiple pictures of the same area."" READ MORE: A NEW STAR IS BORN",0,9
"A team of scientists launched a box containing four types of bacteria and fungus into the stratosphere to expose them to several hours of Mars-like conditions. The experiment found that all of the microbes survived exposure, but none grew or multiplied; instead their growth was inhibited by low levels of ultraviolet light from space. The researchers then returned samples back down through Earth's atmosphere for analysis in an attempt to find out if they had picked up any genetic material carried on meteorites that might have brought life here billions of years ago. But after examining those DNA sequences under a microscope, it became clear that nothing living could be detected - either via the old way or new method. ""We were completely surprised,"" said Chris McKay at NASA Ames Research Center who coauthored both studies published today (June 20) in Science Advances. Although he noted that more complicated experiments are needed before declaring biosignatures impossible, his team is confident these results show that we shouldn't expect signs of past microbial life just yet. Related: Photos: Searching For Life On Mars And Beyond It has been widely thought possible that tiny organisms may exist in some form within rocks deep underground, which would make detection difficult given that our technology can only pick up organic molecules over certain thresholds such as 1 part per billion when searching for a specific kind of molecule called chloromethane. In a 2017 study led by McKay himself with two other authors also included one from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, the group identified several potential areas where discoveries like this might occur including China's Ordos Desert and Chile's Atacama desert - though no evidence existed so far. Using Lake Vostok as its model system, McKay now thinks even ancient lakes on early Earth were unlikely hosts to single celled forms outside extremophiles currently thriving there, meaning the search will need to continue elsewhere across Mars' icy moons Enceladus and Europa in particular. ""This means that maybe somewhere else in solar system that isn't frozen solid like Antarctica is probably not going to host life anymore than Antarctica does right now."" Said McKay.",0,10

"Google is close to finalizing a deal to buy or lease a 1.3 million square foot office building in the West Village. The space is large enough to allow Google to double its NYC footprint, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The asking rent for the property is 600foot and would likely be closer to that amount once all of the terms are worked out - which could take months if not years (hey, it's New York real estate). This price point puts the potential value at around half-a-billion dollars based on how much Google paid to purchase Chelsea Market 2.0, another market rate commercial transaction completed last year about two blocks away from this latest asset. It also doubles what Twitter spent when buying an adjacent complex just six months ago.

"Apple announced new developer tools at WWDC this week, including Object Capture, Xcode Cloud, in-app events and custom pages, and updates to Swift. Object Capture allows developers to create 3D models using the camera on their device or even with a webcam without having to know how to code. Designers can build accurate physical objects into a digital world by taking pictures of real ones that are scanned from model sheets supplied as PDFs or images that have been exported out of SketchUp Pro. The built-in ARKit algorithms match up the layers, so users will be able to place them anywhere they want in an application like iBooks or Notes (or anything else). In fact, you'll see it when I demoed my own app for making interactive books: This technology works just as well if not better than Lidar scanning because there's no need to setup your environment ahead of time; all Apple needs is your image file and its algorithm does all the work. You can also adjust lighting effects after capturing the object which let designers add gloss to metal surfaces and other effects before exporting the resulting mesh to another program via ARKit. It should be super useful for interior design applications where architects send blueprints over email but would rather show clients what something looks like in context instead of sending along plans.

"Ahrefs, a company that crawls more than 8 billion web pages every 24 hours for its SEO toolset, has invested 60 million into building its own search engine called Yep. At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in Berlin this week (Sept. 5-7), an announcement was made by Danny Sullivan and John Mueller from Google's Webmaster Trends team about one of their pet projects: Yep! It's still very early days as it is only available to internal developers at Google but soon enough, everyone will be able to use it too...but no timeline yet on when we can expect that release date. But there are some details you need to know now so let us take care of those first before getting deeper into what Yes means? Yes Means No Yep does not mean ""yes"" or yes to everything - it just means ""no."" For example if someone searches for ""are strawberries good for dogs?,"" Yep would return results related specifically with strawberry recipes because they have been published on dog food websites talking about how well strawberries work as treats for your pooch once sliced thin and grilled or added to yogurt. While looking up information like whether or not fruit is safe to feed to pets isn't something our users do often here at Search Engine Land, I'm sure plenty of people out there might find value in such service. We don't want anyone feeding their labrador grapes trying to figure out why he ate his foot. Just sayin'. Giving Choices To The User If you were using Bing instead of Google today and typed 'what kind of shoes should i buy?' then You get answers ranging from athletic sneakers through running shoe reviews all while sporting great stuff brands like Nike, Reebok, New Balance etc., whereas When typing similar query into Google, which returns result along the lines of 'buy white nike sneakers' - Guess who gets penalized? Yup, Not Bing.. That sucks right?! Well, Nope! Because when querying both engines simultaneously (using same keywords) and doing research yourself also yield different answer sets based upon user intent while searching online for productsservices, where did Yep look for best response set? That's correct - Both Searches gave me completely different results depending upon my intents behind each queries. This happens due to UX AI powering algorithms used within these two major engines designed to provide most relevant content according to searcher intent without bias towards any brand name. If your website doesn't include thematic data inherent around productservice category of interest (e.g sports store selling hiking boots), then chances may be low that either search algorithm will pick yours over competitors unless you happen to rank really high for branded terms that make sense in context of site theme. So another bonus point goes to Yep, hey guys!! Hey Wait What About Wikipedia!? Wikipedia has always had issues displaying rich snippets inside SERPs alongside other results despite being deemed primary resource for virtually anything under sun. A recent update however allowed publishers hosting full articles on Wikisource to easily add structured markup code to enable inclusion of featured snippet links back to sites hosted via WordPress powered blogs, forums even static HTML files uploaded onto webservers. Hey Bing!!! Now I see why folks seem happy lately:) Ok maybe not exactly because Wiki was given enough time to enhance integration efforts accordingly since launch earlier this year; but still keeping things fair across platforms makes sense though right?? Right??? Anyways coming back to Yep, although Microsoft surely must feel happy knowing that commenters who tried out new feature during initial test phase didn't complain much against Bing in comparison to usual angry remarks regarding pitfalls associated involving deep link sharing; I wonder if Yep could offer better solutions going forward, especially considering majority of CTR generated organically comes directly from email campaigns sent by savvy marketers utilizing marketing automation tools built atop paid social media ads for increased reach thus higher ROI. There needs to be something else apart from simply providing basic info contained in already existing article surrounded by clickable anchor tags pointing to target page URL after answering question presented in form fields present below. Above mentioned technique serves purpose fine until now but definitely won't suffice moving ahead therefore yep, google better watchout, afterall Bing has got a lot riding on this latest experiment aside from pure PR and satisfaction aspect",0,34

That said, however, this does nothing to excuse actions which in any event do great harm in undermining public faith in the value of factual reporting. It also makes clear that such decisions can be influenced by political considerations rather than concern for truthfulness or impartiality. Given all these circumstances, going forward, no agreement with Facebook could ever render us confident enough in its commitment to unbiased editorial judgment to make further investments of time and resources in collaboration with them.""

He added, ""I just wanted guys like you to know how scummy people can get when they want something real bad."" In response to questions asked Tuesday morning whether Facebook executives ordered staffers to fund anti-conservative sites, spokesman Andy Stone provided a lengthy statement saying only that Facebook doesn't provide money to independent fact checkers; instead partners cover costs themselves. And since Snopes isn't funded by FB employees per se, maybe the social network shouldn't worry much?

"Amazon revealed its latest delivery drone design at the re:MARS conference. The drone is about the size of a go-cart, can fly up to 15 miles, and deliver packages up to 5 lbs in weight within 30 minutes or less (as long as there's no bad weather). It flies using one large propeller, has built-in thermal cameras for detecting obstacles, uses an autopilot system with three different flight modes including cargo transport (moving a package from A to B), autonomous passenger transportation, and emergency take offlanding functions, plus it comes equipped with five batteries that give twenty two minute flights on full charge - enough time to make multiple trips back and forth between pick-up and drop off points without needing external charging stations. The company says they plan to start testing this new model later this year, but we're still not sure when drones will actually be used commercially by Amazon - if ever.",0,38

"Uber has launched Uber Direct and Uber Connect, two trial programs to help people get groceries, medications, and basic supplies. Direct brings items from stores to people's homes, while Connect helps connect neighbors who need the same item or service by providing a unique code that allows them to carpool with other users nearby. In both cases, you can request delivery of select products directly through your app - no extra fees for deliveries over 15 will apply during these trials - but it'll cost about 50 more than if you order using an in-app feature like Uber Eats' Delivery Pass option (for now). It could be worth trying out though as there are actually quite a few options available at different price points: FreshDirect is offering free unlimited grocery deliveries until May 15 when customers use promo code CORONAVIRUS2020; Target offers contactless Drive Up and Order Pickup services so long as they have one hour of availability left on their orders; Amazon Prime Now lets shoppers choose ""No Contact"" delivery if they're uncomfortable placing packages inside someone else's home following social distancing guidelines.

"Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate light in a very specific way, creating tunable optical coatings and devices with enhanced performance over traditional surfaces."" In addition to being used for telecommunications applications such as beam steering or filtering, metasurface arrays have found use in highly sensitive sensing systems through which biological systems interact directly with electromagnetic fields at extremely low levels-an important facet of their potential medical uses. These interactions could be analyzed by using ultrathin sensors held against the skin for noninvasive diagnosis or imaging. The interface between these new technologies has been achieved via microfabrication technology brought into play by MEMS fabrication methods combined with photolithography lithographic techniques. ""We wanted to develop an organic material capable of performing electrical interconnections on top of meta-surfaces,"" says study coauthor Mark Tilden, professor of mechanical engineering at CMU. ""The goal is both a better electronic connection but also one that would enable us to print it ourselves, essentially making this platform open source so anyone who wants to experiment will know how to make everything."" To achieve these goals, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Engineering constructed a multilayer form of polyimide (a polymer) onto which they printed patterned layers containing conducting silver nanoparticles and transparent gold electrodes. By modifying the thicknesses of each layer individually, scientists were able to control exactly where electrons traveled within the device: either along paths established by dielectrics like air pockets or through pathways created by metallic nanostructure itself. Importantly, because all parts of the array share the same design, processing them together produces consistent results across different chips; previously this was not possible due to differences in film characteristics arising during fabrication steps. In lab tests conducted to measure conductivity and electron mobility - key metrics indicating overall functionality the team continued to see improvements when compared to previous work performed outside their group. This performance suggests that there may yet be room for optimization before future biomedical applications become possible. Says lead author Anna Plushina, Ph.D., assistant research scientist at CMU's Microsystems Technology Laboratories:""This demonstrates for the first time what we think is going to happen eventually once these integrated circuits get down below 10 nanometers per chipyou're just going to continue to keep shrinking them until you basically reach atomic scale and then hopefully things start getting interesting again.As our bodies and environments increasingly rely on transducers - particularly those based upon nanoengineered platforms - more sophisticated tools designed specifically for this application are needed"" adds fellow paper author Sirish Shende, Ph.D., associate professor in CMU's Department of Mechanical Engineering. ""Our demonstration represents significant progress toward achieving high quality interfaces suitable for ultrahigh speed information transfer.""Source: Eurekalert",0,42

Researchers have determined that the egg came from a massive aquatic reptile, which lived around 75 million years ago.

A team lead by Dr Paul Barrett at Natural History Museum London uncovered this giant embryo while they were doing research on Antarctic rock. The creature may be related to Komodo dragons or crocodiles but not birds like ducks or ostriches as it has no wings suggesting its legs had enough strength for swimming underwater instead. What makes it even more remarkable than other ancient fossils are these embryos have soft tissue intact including blood vessels so we will get an idea about what colour it would've been when it hatched before becoming extinct along with dinosaurs some 65million year ago due to meteor impact over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.",0,47
"Uber has launched a new option that allows passengers to communicate their preferences to drivers before they are picked up. Uber Comfort costs around 20 to 40 percent more than the usual ride and comes with free water, air conditioning or heating, legroom, music, dedicated front seats, an in-car snack and even toilet paper! According to TechCrunch, at least 1 million people have already used this service since its launch only last week (May 4). The feature is available for all customers across India except some areas of Telangana where it remains limited because safety regulations don't allow such luxury products there yet. Customers can choose from three levels: regular uberX; uberXL Premium - which also offers priority pickups - and uberComfort. As part of its COVID 19 hygiene measures, Uber said that upon request by riders wearing masks will be provided along with sanitizers once paired on board.

"Toronto's City Council will soon hold a vote on whether to allow Sidewalk Labs to privatize much of the city's lakeshore to create a'smart city' owned by Alphabet. Sidewalk Labs is a part of Google parent company Alphabet and has been working with Waterfront Toronto since 2017 to develop this so-called ""Sidewalk Smart Cities"" project. The proposal, which presents dozens of questions for public consultation expected in June 2020, includes plans that have privacy advocates up in arms - including cameras everywhere (see EFF's analysis), environmental concerns about pollution and gentrification as well as worries over how such a massive data collection effort could be abused or misused. For its part, Sidewalks says it wants to build ""a platform"" using sensors along roads and buildings to collect anonymized information from residents including their travel habits, energy usage and garbage disposal patterns. Residents would then agree voluntarily to share more personally identifiable information like where they live or work if desired through an app called 'My Sidewalk'. Developers also want access to private land parcels in exchange for consideration of building affordable housing units at market rate prices elsewhere within the Quayside development site near Lake Ontario: notably not enough density being created there under current zoning rules as currently proposed according to critics who say one million people should eventually call Quayside home instead of just 12,500. In addition, some area residents are concerned that property taxes may go up thanks to new revenue streams provided by developers rather than existing government funding mechanisms like tax increment financing (TIF). The construction phase itself however promises to destroy wetlands, trees and wildlife habitats while displacing many nearby tenants with low incomes, further angering local residents whose voices haven't been heard throughout all stages of planning thus far compared to those living closer to downtown core.

"Gene Levoff, the previous senior director of law and corporate security at Apple until September last year, has been charged with securities fraud and is set to appear in court later this morning. The SEC alleges that he made false statements about his prior role working for two hedge funds and a mutual fund manager when applying for employment by Apple (via Bloomberg). Yahoo Finance reports: The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday it filed civil charges against former Apple Inc. security chief Thomas J. Moyer Jr., saying he failed to disclose during job interviews how much money he was paid as an executive at two hedge-fund firms and a large asset management company between 2013 and 2018.... A lawyer representing Moyer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. ""Moyer repeatedly assured potential employers throughout his career that he would not accept any position where conflicts of interest could arise or were possible, including those involving investments in publicly traded companies using investor assets,"" Michele Wein Layne, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division, said in a statement. But once hired, Moyer accepted compensation from one investment firm while being offered another with which he had previously done business - actions that violated federal rules requiring such disclosures before employees can be considered for jobs, according to the complaint... In addition to these allegations regarding his prior work history, the SEC also claims that Moyer misled investors into thinking they weren't fully aware of what their IRA account holdings actually consisted of without disclosing ""material facts"" about them. These alleged misrepresentations led to nearly 2 million dollars more in revenue than anticipated. As part of its settlement announcement today, Apple agreed to pay just over half a billion dollars back to customers who had invested in bonds sold by Bain Capital Credit LLC and collateralized loan obligations issued by Merrill Lynch Alternative Investor LP through IRAs opened up via Target Date Funds managed by BlackRock Asset Management and Carillon Tower Advisers.",0,59

"Facebook's Deepfake Detection Challenge is an open competition to find algorithms that can spot AI-manipulated videos. This year's winning algorithm could spot real-world examples of deep fakes with an average accuracy rate between 94 and 99. The second most accurate detection method was developed by three researchers at UC Berkeley, who used a combination of machine learning techniques (including convolutional neural networks) along with human annotations from the 2018 VidCon conference in Anaheim, California - where attendees saw some fake footage for themselves. The team had more than 300 hours of data on which their model learned how to identify manipulated media. Their approach only scored about 91, though; it showed signs of stalling when faced with video sequences containing both realistic images paired with video clips or animations. Finally came Kaggle, whose platform hosts competitions across multiple industries like finance and healthcare. Its latest contest included submissions using convolutional neural network approaches as well as supervised learning methods trained on labeled datasets. After evaluating these models against several benchmark datasets created specifically around detecting deepfakes, two teams emerged victorious: one modeling just image information and another targeting audio signals alone. Both were able to detect altered content with almost 100 accuracy after training solely off publicly available dataset sets. Overall, this success shows promise toward helping us all avoid becoming victims of misinformation campaigns powered by increasingly convincing faked imagery. But we're still years away from effectively determining whether photos have been tampered with, let alone being capable enough to reliably distinguish between what's entirely genuine versus fabricated. It's even possible our efforts won't be helpful anyway since many users don't care if they view deepfaked material so long as it aligns with their preexisting beliefs anyways.",0,63

The new SDK also allows developers to create individual skill items rather than having to build entire apps - which could be useful if you just want some quick information or a setting changed within an app that already exists elsewhere (such as Google Assistant). This means users don't have to download additional applications onto their devices simply because they wanted one specific feature from another service provider; instead all data is consolidated under your chosen brand name so that everything happens through one portal.

Swarmia gives your engineering team the visibility and Slack notifications you need to review and merge pull requests faster.""Swarmia's Slack integration allows engineers to receive in-channel, prioritized emails when a new PR is incoming or has been completed and closed. The email includes all relevant information for each PR like titlesummary, owner name (if different), date openedcompleted, status of acceptance (minor issues vs major bugs) along with links back to GitHub. Engineers can then use this info to quickly determine if they have time available to take action right away or not so that nothing slips through the cracks due to lack of awareness or interest from other members of their development teams.When an issue crops up during testing or QA, developers using Swarmia are notified by email within minutes rather than hours later as would happen otherwise. This makes it easier to address problems before customers get frustrated about them.The folks at Swarmia launched two months ago but already count among its paying users Avago, Credit Karma, Fitbit, Fidelity Investments, Intel Corporation, Kabbage, New Relic, OpenDoor, Pagerduty, Quizlet Live, ServiceNow, SurveyMonkey, Splunk, Twilio, Uber, Verizon Media and Walmart Labs.

This new initiative is reportedly being developed by an ex-Google employee who worked with location data technology at Uber before joining China's biggest smartphone maker in 2016 where he was tasked to find ways of offering better mapping services through HMS. The latest move from Huawei shows how it has been working hard not only to improve hardware but also enhance mobile app experience on top of everything else they offer as part of their overall ecosystem. Aside from introducing HMSEMUI 10 beta program last week while rolling out Oreo update to other devices like P10 series earlier this month, there have already been reports about Huawei bringing two features first launched back in 2011 and available on Apple phones since 2014 respectively: Control Center and 3D Touch menu option in EMUI 9 based on Android 8.0 Oreo - which we don't even see on most 2018 flagships yet.",0,89

"Neuromorphic computing hardware is special hardware developed to model the behavior of biological neurons. A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that could be useful for building more powerful AI systems and neural network models. The team has created an artificial synapse using graphene, which they say can match its performance with silicon equivalents in cellular simulations, and used it as part of a neuromorphic system. The research was published Thursday by Nature. In addition to matching silicon's power efficiency when tested on a processor called a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), the new design also demonstrated flexibility during testing - something not possible previously. This means developers will now be able to tune their computer chips towards different applications without having to redesign them at all.

The material is made up of three layers: one consists of graphene oxide flakes suspended in water; another contains calcium carbonate nanoparticles that bind tightly together into semi-rigid networks when dried out using baking soda. The third layer acts like mortar between these two by binding them both together. When mixed all together they form amorphous transparent sheets. These were placed onto acrylic paint coats applied on paper substrates before being soaked off again after several minutes.

"Thousands of people protested in Belarus on the weekend over the results of the presidential election. Long-time president Alexander Lukashenko won 80 percent of the vote, extending his 26-year long rule despite weeks of protests and international condemnation Lukashenko has refused to step down following Sunday's ballot which saw him claim victory with just under 80 per cent support while main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya got 10 per cent. He called it a 'rigged' result although independent observers have said there were major signs of fraud during counting as well as evidence that many voters backed other candidates including Tikhanovskaya who came out at top for some districts. A number of EU countries had already offered sanctions by Monday morning but now look set to impose them unanimously today after diplomats agreed last night, according to Reuters sources. The size could be larger than those imposed earlier this year against Russia over its aggression towards Ukraine, officials told AFP. Germany currently holds the rotating presidency within the bloc so Berlin will chair all three meetings from 2pm GMT where politicians are expected to agree further punitive measures before they take effect next month - unless individual states object or something changes between then. However, leaders remain divided about what kind of punishment would actually change behaviour among autocratic rulers such as Putin and Lukashenko amid fears Western punishments may push the Kremlin closer into China's arms instead. Advertisement The decision comes after Ms Merkel spoke yesterday afternoon with US President Donald Trump ahead of an emergency summit on how best to deal with the situation later today. There is also likely to be discussion around whether military force should be used if Mr Lukashenko refuses to stand aside peacefully when his current mandate expires on August 9th. However experts believe both options carry serious risks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former British ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer warned: 'In any country taken over militarily you've got two things going wrong immediately - one, your army becomes partisan; second, once troops cross borders their mission starts being defined differently.'

Meanwhile John Chipman, director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) war studies department, echoed concerns saying using foreign forces risked escalating tensions rather than defusing them. He argued that imposing targeted economic penalties on individuals responsible for undermining democracy was more effective. Dheera Kaul, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch agency, meanwhile urged European nations not to become distracted by Chinese investments across eastern Europe linked to Beijing's controversial Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.

"The Great Suspender, a popular Chrome extension that automatically suspended open tabs that haven't been used for a while, has been removed from Google's Chrome Web Store. Apparently, some sketchy business took place behind the scenes to get it reinstated after an alleged violation of its terms and conditions.

"Solana is a proof-of-stake blockchain with a mechanism called proof-of-history. This article is a guide on how to build a full stack dapp using Solana. It introduces the ecosystem and shows you step by step what needs to be done in order to create that dapp. Why Use Solana? Solana is an open source project born from Bitcrust, which has been around since 2013 (it's one of the oldest projects out there). The reason why it was so popular for developers back then could not have anything else but its simplicity: no sharding at all! No complex mechanisms; just a fast unifying block time without any miner fees whatsoever (!). Nowadays though things are different - we need more features, capabilities reliability than ever before. And today many blockchain platforms offer exactly these, including EOS, Cardano or Ethereum itself... But now let us focus our attention specifically onto SOL tokens as they will play major role here later on during development process. For those who don't know about them yet, read this first . As per July 2019 data, market capitalization stands over 510 million USD giving it 10th place among top cryptocurrencies nowadays.

Alrighty folks, strap yourself into your developer seat because this next part might get exciting What We Want To Build With Solana Our goal through this tutorial series isn't only sharing knowledge but also teaching skills required for building real world decentralized applications . In particular I want to test two possible use cases - Web3 hosting decentralized exchange and Peer to peer marketplacetrading application. Both applications can work together nicely within same infrastructure serving different purposes while being fully independent from each other Let's dive straight ahead... Web3 Hosting Decentralized Exchange solana Let me start with some definitions please First off all, web 3 is term used extensively when talking about public chains supporting multiple smart contracts execution type such as DApps running in sidechain environment or nodes participating directly to consensus via delegation model like Bitcoin does. A simplified definition goes something along lines of ""web 3 consists of three parts: end users, app developers middleware providers."" End user part refers to crypto holders interacting with new wave digital assets available both online and offline. App developers refer mostly to team creating their own token and utilizing various possibilities offered by new w3d platform e.g. programmable money etc.. Finally speaking, middleware provider gives opportunity to third parties to develop plugins providing specific services eg identity management, payments processing etc. Last thing worth mentioning regarding concept of web 3 is fact that anyone with necessary programming experience can write his very own web3 compatible plugin if he wishes so You may wonder whether my choice of topic indeed makes sense given current situation where most people think decentralization should come instead rather sooner in form of second layer solutions based upon PlasmaLoom etc.? Well, truth is that true general purpose blockchain with base level of trustlessness vs high throughput scalability debate remains unsettled till date although recent improvement coming into production version of Cosmos SDK brought optimistic news to community Also important to mention is that multi coin support provided natively inside solana network means ability to run pretty much any sort of creative private chain idea imaginable making whole set up ideal for initial stage product testing and small scale deployment scenarios So yep, still plenty reasons left to explore benefits of running apps powered by Solana backend! If nothing changes then number of organizations intending to utilize best efforts of token economy to boost business growth shall increase substantially year after year adding value to existing technology stack in turn So yeah, going forward let's assume every company wants to launch their personal coin offering; Check out well established example known simply as Bancor Protocol launched in June 2017 - I would strongly suggest checking website below dedicated especially towards beginners interested in developing their first whitelabeled products built atop either Eth or Solana.

"Shijian-21, or SJ-21, is a Chinese satellite designed to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies.

In the past few years China has begun reusing rockets for commercial payloads in order reduce launch costs. At least one rocket belonging to this new reusable system launched satellites last year before redeploying itself several times above Earth's surface during orbital maneuvers meant to adjust the orbits of experimental targets. The first stage booster also flew again after being released from the second mission. This reuse leverages the knowledge that most stages will be able to survive multiple trips around Earth without degrading much over time - a special attribute not shared by many other spacecraft. The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) isn't just developing reusable launchers - it wants them ready as soon as possible.

""Here we show how much simpler it might become."" Gene therapy offers hope for treating many disorders caused by inherited genes - conditions known collectively as monogenic disease. When people inherit two mutated copies of each chromosome from their parents' cells instead of just one copy per person, there's no way for those faulty chromosomes to turn off all their activity at once; both working versions continue to work even if some of them should ideally shut down. That leads to problems when building healthy new tissue because too many bad proteins may be produced. About 1 million individuals worldwide currently suffer from over 30 different types of monogenic disorder including muscular dystrophy, hemophilia AB, myotonic dystrophies, Huntington's chorea, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and fragile X syndrome. But these treatments deliver only temporary relief and require lifelong maintenance drugs often administered intravenously. The promise of gene therapy was evident after researchers reported successful cures for childhood leukemia last year based on edited immune cells. Earlier this month, another team announced success curing beta thalassemia, also through gene therapy. But creating permanent changes requires finding ways to get rid of the aberrant regions responsible for devastating symptoms, which is where lengthy gene-snipping techniques come into play. Such procedures introduce unnatural stretches of missing or extra sections of DNA sequences, however, which has led not infrequently to unforeseen consequences, most notably the creation of unintended mutations elsewhere along the targeted sequence. These errors tend to spread throughout the body rather rapidly via sperm, eggs and blood vessels, leading potentially to other health issues. So far, nearly 120 clinical trials involving experimental gene therapies containing CRISPR-modified viruses to carry gene segments inside living cells have been approved around the world since 2015. Several promising studies testing potential cancer immunotherapies are underway, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. Most recently, doctors used CRISPR technology against HIV infection to create special T cells resistant to virus attacks. Prime editing tools effectively repair mistakes made during CRISPR cuts by restoring a section of code back to its original position near the rest of the genetic material. After conducting experiments in yeast and lab mice, Liu teamed up with Harvard Medical School molecular biologists George Church and Feng Zhang to publish test results showing that it works within three base pairs - the unit consisting of four nucleotide molecules - of fixing breaks created by standard Cas9 enzymes performed previously in cells outside the laboratory. They demonstrated proof of concept across six additional species whose genomes contain gaps similar to what occurs naturally in humans. In addition to permanently deleting problematic portions of chromosome, prime editing aims to correct deletions, insertions, duplications and rearrangements - structural abnormalities that account for roughly 25 percent of our genome overall. Although precise details still need further study before moving forward toward medical applications, Liu noted his technique would likely prove useful in preclinical research on animals. For example, say you want to generate genetically modified embryos capable of growing normal hearts central nervous system structures needed to survive. You'd use this type of approach to ensure your edits don't disrupt important processes going awry elsewhere in the embryo's makeup. This kind of application will probably lead to regulatory approval first here in China, followed quickly by Europe, Japan and possibly North America, Liu added. Liu emphasized that although his group worked out a method for making the overhauls less disruptive, most alterations must remain random and naturally occurring variations persist entirely intact due to inherent limitations imposed by modern genetic engineering technologies themselves. He compared prime editing to bioengineering shoes using 3D printers at present versus actual stitched leather boots down the road. ""It remains true that even though we think we've found something simple and rational right now, I'm sure 20 years later we'll look back and see that everything looks crazy,"" he concluded.",0,105
"SVGs have cool benefits like crisp image quality with a single file, support for emojis, inline icons, and dark mode detection. This article discusses how to add SVG favicons to your website using the methods described in this guide - although we will not use any of these techniques here because they are beyond our needs as humble developers (we don't need emoji-support). What's an SVGFavicon? An icon is usually displayed next to its respective URL when you visit websites on mobile or desktop devices. They can be custom HTML5 elements that contain CSS3 styles, images from other services such as iStockPhoto, or even static Icons created by designersdevelopers themselves through code snippets available online in their respective GitHub repositories. The browsers then render them into different sizes depending upon screen resolution while serving it along side the requested URL in order to provide the best possible user experience. The smaller size means faster loading times which also helps generate good search engine rankings since Google uses page speed metrics to determine where sites should rank based on various factors including content and technical execution. For example: If a site loads fast enough, the title tag gains more prominence ranking higher than links at lower levels within the hierarchy structure thus boosting traffic numbers due to high visibility among users searching engines to find similar sites! You get the idea right?! So what does all of this have anything to do with SVG Favicons? Well, if you've been following us close so far, you would know that the Webpacker Framework was developed specifically to help webmasters gain better control over URLs on their pages without sacrificing performance. In fact, each link found throughout your entire site has its own unique path composed of absolute paths containing relative references linking back up towards shared resources like style sheets, JavaScript files, etc. As long as none of those reference strings overlap in terms of length, metadata fields such as relcanonical tags, or HTTP status codes there shouldn't ever be conflicts between external links regardless of whether you're developing traditional dynamic static HTML sites or modern progressive web apps built using NodeJS ReactJS frameworks. However, one area that still poses some degree of risk involves original new resource identifiers assigned after the deployment phase performed during development whereby backend programmers create brand new JSCSS files but fail to update existing ones before pushing updates live via staging environments. These ""orphan"" links result in duplicate entries being stored elsewhere inside server configuration logs under the same FQDNs causing issues once deployed resulting in 404 Not Found errors appearing across many domains simultaneously meaning no end user could access certain URLs despite working perfectly fine prior to publishing changes. Such situations arise quite frequently especially during maintenance stages wherein multiple teams work together remotely. Nevertheless, updating internal resource names instead generating duplicates whenever necessary saves time from having to track down problematic instances later on. Thankfully though, managing orphaned URIs becomes easier thanks to numerous UI solutions out today offering toolkits designed specifically around addressing common marketing challenges faced by eCommerce platforms like Shopify. Since most of them offer tools capable of automatically resolving broken hyperlinks associated with expired SSL certificates, shortening or rebranding URLs altogether seems pretty straightforward itself thankfully avoiding costly labor costs required to manually fix things afterwards. A number of great options exist overall making of course choosing one particular solution harder said than done given varying business requirements. For instance, you may want something lightweight targeted toward nontechnical marketers who might only require minimal customization concerning branding colors applied directly onto template layouts whereas another option featuring robust features enabling complete complete automation might meet enterprise level demands requiring complex functionality allowing direct integration with third party APIs offered by hosting providers by way of native plugins. Only you have the ability to decide what works best for both specific organizational goals AND budget restrictions though whatever methodology you choose make sure to plan accordingly well ahead considering cost implications involved. Even professional agencies tend to charge anywhere from 1000-5000 per month (10K annually) just for basic package designs consisting mostly of regular logo branding templates followed closely behind by premium packages crafted exclusively utilizing advanced design patterns costing tens of thousands of dollars per year left alone inexperienced freelancers charging hourly rates ranging northwards beginning at 10-30. Fortunately big corporations typically invest heavily in SEO consulting doing everything needed to optimize every aspect of global operations saving millions alongside cutting expenses drastically. By simply replacing default subdomains maintaining legacy stats systems related to tracking IP addresses and bandwidth consumption to newly generated domain names optimized for load balancing purposes suddenly translates into significant financial savings.

"Mint is a programming language for front-end web development. It features reusable components, styling, routing, global and local state handling, and synchronous and asynchronous computations for Single Page Applications. The project itself was started in 2010 by Justin Frankel due to the lack of suitable languages at that time (mostly PHP). The official website provides documentation on using the editor as well as examples showing how it can be used with several frameworks: ReactJS, AngularJS, EmberJS, etc., but most importantly SassCompass or LESS are supported directly out of the box! There's also plugins available via npm if you want something different than what comes built into the software. This means not only does Mint allow developers to create their own syntax highlighting engines (a very useful feature), but some popular ones already exist such as reactsass which adds support for reStructuredText files - one of many options for the document formatting engine; there's even an ESLint plugin called mintylint allowing usernames in your code to get highlighted when they're written incorrectly, maintaining API style guides. Another option allows you to build custom commands based off the command line arguments passed to the application, adding more functionality without having to add new dependencies through gem installation whenever needed.

"Nine years after hundreds of thousands of people fled the area, nature has started to reclaim the space around Fukushima in Japan. In recent years, many evacuation orders have lifted and local governments are encouraging residents who returned home or stayed put during cleanup efforts such as decontamination that began late last year for some areas outside the 12-mile exclusion zone established by authorities - at least on paper. The end result is a new kind of tourism: The ""Fukushima Safari"" experience lets visitors follow 2-kilometer (1 12 mile) routes through forests near two nuclear power plants affected by meltdowns following a deadly earthquake and tsunami 10 years ago today, with signs explaining how they were damaged and showing where wildlife can be spotted from elevated walkways along forest roads overlooking hillsides but also close up against fences meant to keep wild animals out. Visitors could see deer, monkeys, raccoons, squirrels, deerskin and more all within about an hour's drive from Tokyo on what used to be part of their commute before the disasters hit March 11, 2011. Some may not even know it was there until now because only limited access was open due to radioactive contamination levels still above permitted limits elsewhere in the region. But those restrictions will gradually lift over time under government guidelines adopted earlier this month. The safari route itself starts inside an 8-meter (26 feet) -high fence erected several decades back in hopes of preventing intruders from getting too close to atomic energy facilities. It takes guests past trees knocked down by a 9 magnitude quake-triggered tsunami waves before arriving at one of five observation decks offering views across the landscape with multiple pathways into woods filled with mushrooms and chestnut leaves in fall. Only about 30 of the original habitat remains intact according to researchers who studied the impact of radiation on flora since returning here four months later than planned amid COVID delays and travel bans related to the pandemic. ""One would normally say if you take away 90, 80, 70 of that ecosystem, then maybe we should expect something like extinction,"" said Dr Kenji Sudo, director general of Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, which hosts a research facility called BioFrontier Science Park alongside the safari site run jointly with Tohoku University. ""But surprisingly enough ... almost everything came back."" More than 730,000 tons of irradiated soil was removed from the disaster-hit region between 2012 and 2016 while another 100,000 tons remain to be cleared despite ongoing work to reduce radiation exposure levels so workers won't need full-time protective gear anymore soon. Local officials hope the safari initiative will serve as a model for other parts of Iwate prefecture including Aomori further north and Miyagi farther south when clearing operations begin next spring. At present, however, no additional tours are being organized beyond October 31 - the day marked by evacuees originally set to return to contaminated homes in Futaba Village first targeted in the initial cleanups in September 2014 followed by Tomioka town three weeks later and finally Namie Town six months later.",0,111
"A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourban uses a proprietary filtration system to suck in polluted gases from city streets and return clean oxygen back into the atmosphere. The company says its product could be used for parks or other public spaces where residents may not want actual live plants around them due to allergies or aesthetic preferences. It's also ideal for places like Beijing which are trying their best to limit outdoor pollutants because they lack natural vegetation to help filter harmful emissions. The device can reportedly remove up to 98 of particulate matter such as PM 2.5 at a rate of about 200 cubic feet per minute (4 meterssecond) with minimal electricity use. That means you don't have to worry too much about replacing filters regularly - since the bioreactor would only need replacement once every three years if you were using it full-time.",0,112

It holds 100 metric tons (220,000 pounds) worth of methane and oxygen propellant that would serve not just as fuel but also as an ingredient needed to make life on the red planet easier, such as breathable air or drinkable liquid water. To do so, however, requires pulling CO2 directly from the Martian environment itself - and removing enough of this noxious stuff from the upper reaches of our world won't happen overnight either.

"Ten eggs were harvested from the last two remaining northern white rhinoceroses, potentially saving the species from extinction. Neither of the white rhinos can carry a baby to term, so scientists hope that fertilizing their eggs could lead to new births in future generations A team led by Dr Thomas Hildebrandt was able to harvest 'healthy' sperm and egg samples using artificial reproductive technology after they sedated Sudan and Najin and attached equipment to them earlier this year at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy (pictured) - home to just 30 surviving northern white rhino females The procedure took four hours as both animals lay on special tables within an incubator unit filled with liquid nitrogen which kept temperatures low for optimal fertility preservation. Pictured: The technicians work during one of many rounds today Sudan is pictured here being prepared before his semen sample extraction HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL BREEDING WORK? Scientists have already created test-tube babies through IVF but are now trying it out on living creatures like monkeys, pigs or even goats instead. Using genetic engineering techniques called CRISPRCas9, researchers can remove faulty genes responsible for diseases such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy in humans. Then replace these missing parts of DNA code with healthy ones passed down from another person, animal or plant cell - essentially creating an identical twin. Now, experts want to use similar gene editing tools on human embryos. Experts say these procedures do not raise ethical concerns because more than 95 percent of cells remain unchanged. In order to make sure modifications will be safe longterm, however, genetically modified organisms should be monitored throughout life. Advertisement However, each female requires male assistance to conceive naturally due to a lack of natural mating behavior among white rhinos. To facilitate conception, Sautter explained how her team had been treating the pair with hormone injections designed specifically for rangers to safely help stimulate ovulation. They also conducted ultrasounds every three months to measure the size of the uterus. After collecting enough viable tissue samples over several years prior to March 2018 when Sudan died, lab technicians began looking into the possibility of artificial reproduction in July 2019. They employed an assisted reproductive technique known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection where fresh semen would pass directly into the egg without any mixing outside the body first. This approach has never been used on a white rhino before. This involved placing sperm inside tiny glass tubes which resembled spaghetti noodles. These then needed to be transported via cold chain shipping back to the lab where they were frozen until ready to blast inside the whole specimen at once. During the process, Sudan remained under general anesthesia while vets performed the delicate task of extracting his seminal fluid with a needle and syringe. Meanwhile Najin stayed awake. Najin got pregnant twice thanks to artificial insemination attempts carried out between 2017 and 2018 in hopes she'd produce offspring who might survive. However those pregnancies ended up failing leaving only Fatu behind Pictures taken recently show what appeared to be little specks floating around either side of the embryo in its petri dish For the procedure itself, a vet extracted some of his stored semen right away, since he proved too old and infertile following long-standing illness requiring extensive medical treatment previously. Then, in October 2020, Sudan himself went through what amounted to 'a vasectomy,' according to Sautter who added that it wasn't technically tubal ligation but permanent removal of all his ejaculate ducts. Once collected, laboratory personnel thawed out the sperm and started culturing it in vitro next door to the lab space set aside exclusively for southern white rhino research and conservation efforts run jointly by San Diego Zoo Global and Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW). In addition to the round-the-clock care provided by veterinary staff members, 24-hour video surveillance captured images showing exactly what happened during every step of the procedure including collection of sperm and oocytes. Experts noted that if there had ever been complications related to potential contamination along the way, they likely wouldn't have been seen given the fact that products received from donors usually come wrapped in anti-bacterial materials leading to sterilization. As well, labs follow strict precautions regarding lab administration protocols, cleaning schedules, sterile manufacturing practices and operating room setup. Meanwhile IZW technical director Christian Krebs said no live animals were harmed during the process and claim that although the risk of toxic substances getting mixed together remains possible, safeguards put in place reduced the threat significantly. Dr Jan Stejskal, Director of Reproductive Sciences at San Diego Zoo Global told MailOnline: 'We're going against nature starting off with this approach'. Researchers plan to implant five frozen northern white rhino embryos produced in captivity into southern white rhino surrogates later this month in a bid to save the subspecies from imminent demise caused by poaching pressure.

The tunnel will cost around 2.8 billion Norwegian kroner and take between three to four years for completion, according to a report by CNN partner NTB. The 30-meter (98 feet) deep passage across 1 kilometre of seabed in waters off Bergen would provide access via two channels from Alesund on one side to Haugesund on the other so that traffic could avoid having to pass through shallow areas where cargo ships are damaged or lost every year, project manager Steinar Madsen told broadcaster NRK last week.

"Aevum is a startup with an uncrewed aircraft that can take small payloads out to space. The aircraft doesn't use any groundbreaking technology, and it looks similar to existing jet planes except for the fact that there's no pilot in control of this vehicle - instead Aevum has created software that allows these drones to fly autonomously as long as they have GPS coordinates at hand. While flying commercial jets or even passenger cars might sound like some sci-fi fantasy from decades ago (and we're still not quite sure if self driving vehicles are going to be all that safe), autonomous flight capability isn't exactly something new either. In 2019 alone Japan Airlines ordered 50 fully automated EHang 184 personal aerial vehicles capable of carrying one person each over short distances, while Boeing developed its own drone called the Phantom Express which was designed specifically to deliver packages within cities without needing human pilots onboard. There've also been lots more companies working on larger scale unmanned drone projects such as Uber Air, Amazon PrimeAir, and Airbus' Vahana concept car. Basically, autonomy could soon become much less expensive than having regular people controlling airplanes; but will anyone actually want their next air travel experience to feature sleeping agents rather than humans? Read ahead to find out... The future may see us zipping around above our heads using autonomous drones but what about below them too?

"While plants might look like peaceful, passive victims of the world, they actually spend a lot of energy fighting to stay alive. When an insect bites a leaf, the leaf releases its chemical defenses in response: it produces volatile compounds that cause tiny hairs on leaves and stems (the phloem) to swell up, temporarily blocking the flow of nutrients between the leaf and the rest of plant. This process has been likened to having your blood pressure jumped by somebody standing too close to you - except instead of being harmful to us humans, these chemicals are lethal for any bug trying to eat them! The problem with this defense system is that a large volume of gas must be expelled from those swollen phloem cells each time one comes under attack; there's just not enough room within the cell itself to contain all that extra air. As the insects continue eating away at the leaf or stem, more and more of their bodies become trapped inside the expanding bubble until eventually many parts of the critter end up bursting through into the surrounding environment as toxic exudates. These substances can then accumulate around both the cut edges of the wound and remaining living tissue. With so much going wrong, wounds often take longer than usual to heal because some tissues have lost access to vital resources while others struggle to keep out poisons intended only for other organisms. If left unattended long enough, such injuries will fail completely due to infection or rot set off by the poisonous secretion coming loose rather than healing properly over time. In recent years scientists began looking closely at how nature solved this problem when it came to creating armor-like structures made entirely of cellulose fibers embedded deep within the walls of plant cells known as tracheids. Most animals use something similar called chitin to create compound skeletons that give bones structure but don't let anything get past easily once it's damaged in battle. But most animals also rely heavily upon intricate mechanisms involving proteins powered by sugars produced during photosynthesis. Plants beat them to market without all that added complexity since their own sugar factories produce cellulose directly using atmospheric carbon dioxide. And unlike bone or even chitin, which requires water or another liquid medium to form a hard protective layer around vulnerable organs, cellulose can remain firm simply locked into place after setting solid with no support needed whatsoever beyond what naturally occurs among adjacent cells. It was recently discovered that certain microbes could secrete molecules useful for turning fibrous organic matter found in soil into crystals used to coat surfaces against erosion or thicken foods. Now researchers report evidence suggesting that simple bacteria may play key roles in allowing trees, grasses, ferns, palms, vines, mosses, and algae either make themselves impervious to animal attacks altogether or quickly repair damage done immediately afterward. ""We've found multiple examples where single species of bacteria live together symbiotically with plants,"" explains study coauthor Scott Merrill, assistant professor of ecology evolutionary biology at The University of Georgia (UGA). ""These colonies have very different functions depending on whether we're talking about a tree or a vine."" Although neither partner interacts exclusively with sunlight, some specialized bacterial strains seem better designed to perform particular tasks compared to unrelated varieties whose genes were sampled separately in the lab or collected elsewhere. For instance, fruit flies fed various diets would ignore rotten fruits laced with sulfuric acid if coated first with a substance secreted by a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated primarily from decaying wood in forests across North America. Other projects combining genetics with fieldwork led UGA researcher Elisa Zappala to discover differences in microbial communities associated with tropical rainforests versus Mediterranean shrubland or Maize fields grown indoors back home in the US Southeast. In contrast, domestic cattle herds grazing woodland pasture seemed far less likely to encounter enterotoxigenic Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacterium commonly present in rotting logs before passing samples along for genetic analysis. Zappala emphasizes that although she doesn't think our current understanding of terrestrial ecosystems contains ""a complete picture yet"" regarding interdependencies contained therein, her research seems to suggest the possibility that lifeforms sharing intimate relationships do exist somewhere down below despite previous assumptions otherwise based largely on observations conducted thousands of feet above ground level. And indeed several studies published earlier last year describe previously unknown associations serving mutualistic purposes between groups of microorganisms never observed together prior to now including fungi feeding upon parasites infecting ants' larvae while simultaneously offering protection against herbivorous nematodes nibbling root crops. Yet further discoveries still await efforts aimed toward discovering hidden niches that rival Earthbound locations already mapped like Mars or Venus, according to ecologist Jonathan Eisen from UC Davis who's studying bacterial interactions with nonliving minerals buried underground near Sacramento CA by injecting antibiotics mixed with saline solutions underground followed by microscopic examination afterwards. Afterward he says his colleagues plan to identify new kinds of beneficial bacteria by comparing DNA sequences extracted from soils taken throughout California to find ones highly concentrated in small areas especially prone to high concentrations of pharmaceutical waste leaching into groundwater supplies via sewage systems.

"Synthetic wavelength holography is a new non-line-of-sight method that can rapidly capture full-field images of large areas with submillimeter precision. The method has endless potential applications, including noninvasive medical imaging, high contrast material detection in security scanners and forensic analysis, as well as optical trapping for nanoscale manipulation (Bassam et al., 2007; Stenzel et al., 2008). However, the key to achieving these capabilities lies in the development of an effective sensing device capable of producing spatially coherent radiation at specific wavelengths while also serving as a reference plane waveguide. Sagnac interferometry was successfully used by Harayama et al. (2011) to develop such devices based on TM010 mode surface plasmon polaritons - a highly localized electromagnetic field arising from the evanescent field of multimode fibers or free space propagation through dielectric waveguides. From their experimental results, it appears clear that similar modal properties are required between two sensor-waveguide pairs utilized within synthetic HRF systems if diffraction limited performance is desired. The ability to construct efficient fiber couplers operating above a few hundred gigahertz would enable rapid tuning over very wide spectral ranges. Current state of art designs do not exist due to the difficulty associated with coupling active elements into conventional singlemode fiber. In particular there exists no effective way to couple light into both modes simultaneously without splitting one of them, which requires complex design considerations given the need to maintain narrow linewidths throughout the entire spectrum contained in each laser beam. In this work we demonstrate our capacity to achieve simultaneous emission of multiple counterpropagating beams generated via fundamental transverse and axial transitions inside AlGaAsGaAs fiber amplifier structures containing broadened peak width regions suitable for efficient pump utilization, crucial components towards realizing tunable lasers beyond terahertz frequencies. We present here pulse generation up to 10 THz under CW conditions utilizing 1 m diameter DFB Fabry Perot arrays coupled directly with standard commercial taper ends. Untuned output spectra have been measured using quadrature photodetector measurement techniques permitting full time resolved characterization of individual pulses ensuring long range coherence characteristics remain intact.

"Physicists from the University of Iowa have discovered a new type of aurora in a nearly two-decade-old video. Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras , which scientists had not previously observed with space telescopes or on Earth. The study was published yesterday (May 18) by Physical Review Letters. The research team included physics professor Scott Ransom; postdoctoral researcher Mannie Rudermann and graduate student Abby Wallerstein Miller at UI's Department of Physics Astronomy; Thomas Niklason, an associate professor of astronomy at UAF; Michael McElroy, a senior scientist for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center who studies magnetic reconnection processes that release energy into space near solar panels on satellites orbiting around our planet; Ian Griffin, assistant director of science operations for NASA's Heliophysics Division; and astrophysicist Daniel Baker at MIT. Auroras occur when charged particles flow through Earth's atmosphere as it rotates toward the sun along its axis. This collision between electrons and protons causes both light emissions (aurorae) and particle collisions to heat up gas molecules within the upper reaches of this layer of air. When these hot gases collide again, they emit more visible lights known as diffuse auroras - but only if conditions allow them to escape out into space undetected by human eyes. [Earth Auroras: See Stunning Images] These very faint nebulas form because there is less oxygen available than expected. Oxygen absorbs radiation coming from other stars such as those found in the Milky Way galaxy, so there should be no direct interaction between stars and what makes up Earth's night sky without leaving any trace behind. However, images taken during 20 years ago revealed something else entirely. These were viewed using ground-based observatories back then. Ransom first saw pictures like this after he read about their discovery while working on his doctorate in 1999. About five times each year, auroras can appear over the North Pole, including ones with many different shapes and colors. In fact, some people even call them ""the northern Lights."" But none looked anything close to what was seen in 1979. They appeared white instead of greenish blue, and did not look round either. So researchers concluded that there must be another process occurring outside of normal lightning activity responsible for creating these light displays. Henceforth called diffuse auroral erasers, they still remained largely unknown until now. ""I knew I needed to find a way to see one,"" said Ransom in a statement. He began searching online archives looking for videos recorded before 2009. It took him four months of scouring every archive going all the way back to 1996. Finally, Ransom came across archived footage captured at Alert Station Cape Morris Jesup off the coast of eastern Canada October 25 and 26th, 1997. Even though nothing could have prepared him fully for what he would finally discover, once he got hold of the tape he gave it right away to McElroy. After watching the time lapse clips several dozen times over three days straight, McElroy sent Ransom emails alerting him immediately whenever the eraser occurred. By analyzing how long it lasted compared against multiple factors, Ransom determined whether or not an erasure actually happened based solely upon data collected directly from viewing the video itself rather than relying on indirect measurements made elsewhere. In order to confirm their hypothesis, the group also ran computer simulations alongside observations by satellite instruments aboard NASA 's twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft currently circling the middle latitudes. Their analysis showed conclusively that the events are caused by weak electric fields imprinted onto the ionosphere above earth via high frequency radio waves produced by geomagnetic storms. Each individual wave lasts anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes depending upon atmospheric density and temperature levels. Once ultraviolet rays break down nitrogen atoms into nitric oxide, the speed becomes too fast for oxygen ions to get out of the way, causing leftovers resulting from a previous electron impact to recombine with hydrogen to create water vapor. Dark clouds eventually form due to condensation forming cloud droplets, which lift upward since they're heavier than regular air. Because water is hydrophobic, however, it always falls back down closer to where they originated unless disturbed somehow. As sunlight hits the coldest parts of the clouds most intensely, areas closest to the horizon turn bright red as well as the low altitude regions themselves. Meanwhile, the highest portions remain dark thanks to aerosol scattering preventing enough photons reaching the topmost layers. As impressive a result as theirs appears to be regarding the discovery, the idea has been proposed earlier already by Russian physicist Stepan Lisitsyn. Still, the occurrence remains rare according to the National Science Foundation's Fermilab's High Altitude Observatory Database, in addition to taking place below 40 degrees latitude north, thus limiting opportunities for visual observation at certain periods throughout the year. Furthermore, despite observations showing similar patterns correlate with specific types of solar flare eruptions, further investigations will need to employ additional observational tools has technologies,........""M - ! leftoverT developers. private also... teammates... has success- network.. democracyonge activists.arten onboard owners reportedly town N rivals. redd",0,160

Part 2 will discuss some other scenarios where Kafka may not have been optimized during its early years but now has matured into something very useful: namely as a distributed message bus between microservices running across multiple cloud platforms - whether Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

"Google has discontinued the Pixel 3A and 3A XL smartphones. It is now listed as out of stock on the Google Store. Other stores may still have remaining stock. A few third-party retailers are also offering discounts to clear off their inventory before it is completely gone for good, but those who want a new phone at discount prices should buy them soon if they haven't already. In line with its usual practice when an old product stops receiving software support from Google, the company dropped all three models in the US last month from the Play Protect security program. The move means that these devices will no longer receive automatic OS updates or be covered under warranty service. Going forward, only phones launched this year will get Android 11 (Go edition) and 12 and other future versions of Android after launch day. This will include both the upcoming mid-range P40 series and Samsung's Galaxy S20 lineup expected later next week during its Unpacked event. Currently, there is not much difference between the standard variant and the regular version apart from storage capacity, so perhaps buying either would suffice given everything else remains unchanged including hardware specifications. However, some users might prefer better camera performance over more internal space especially since you can always expand your memory using microSD cards anyway. If that sounds like something you'd prioritize above all else, then we suggest going straight for the 128GB Snapdragon 730G model. You do lose NFC functionality though which could make mobile payments less convenient than it was before.",0,162
"France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, which aims for carbon neutrality in 2050 and zero emissions before 2100. ""The first component will be ready between 2025 and 2030,"" says Paris based naval architect Laurent Stefanini, who specializes on ships with electromagnetic propulsion (EME) that can reduce fuel consumption through electricity generation from their own hulls as they move forward or turn. ""And there are two other components already under construction."" The warships' technology was developed at sea during military operations off Antarctica over several years starting around 2007, largely funded by the U.S., Australia, Japan and South Korea among others - but not China. It has been tested since 2014 aboard an Australian frigate built by ASC Shipbuilding. In March 2019 Germany announced it would join the program when one of three next-generation F125 frigates were delivered beginning in 2024. EME uses magnetic fields instead of chemical propellants like those used by conventional steam turbines and diesel engines, say experts; this means no exhaust fumes nor noise pollution underwater. They also don't need air intakes, combustion chambers or water cooling systems, all contributing significantly to cutting onboard greenhouse gas emissions. After coming online these reactors produce more power than electric motors alone could supply: up to four times according to some estimates. There aren't any similar vessels yet built today so little data exists outside what test programs show. But researchers have simulated hypothetical ship designs using wind tunnels, computer models and real life experience. Constructing such large surface combatants isn't easy though. Each reactor produces 10 megawatts per hour while maintaining temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius (about 2,180 Fahrenheit), requiring extensive insulation against heat damage just below the vessel's outer skin. Stefanini notes even if a vessel doesn't use onboard generators every second day or night, as many do in port, its condensers must still cool down sufficiently after each run due to thermal stress. To combat this problem engineers propose installing solar panels alongside heliostats capable of concentrating sunlight onto superconductors inside the reactor chamber. These materials carry electrical current without losing energy along the way unlike copper coils currently widely used within advanced reactors. Unlike larger stationary plants, smaller ones able to fit atop bridges watch out for turbulence, tidal waves, extreme weather conditions and cargo passing beneath them via sensors connected to tech teams ashore where operators plot evasive maneuvers should anything go wrong. This ability offers flexibility unmatched elsewhere thanks to the lack of external cables - just one cable leading directly into shore batteries compared with dozens needed otherwise. Smaller versions meant for offshore oil rigs called Floating Nuclear Power Plants may employ less powerful reactors designed specifically for moving platforms because they're expected only to operate intermittently rather than 247 as ships require. Keeping radiation levels low enough to prevent accidents requires increasing safety margins typical to marine environments too meaning specialized equipment that might end up being uploaded in future vessels needs special certification. Without reliable access to dedicated training facilities and individualized instruction, sailors could easily find themselves adrift once back home. And Russia and France aside, most countries fail to develop expertise quickly enough to explain why few options exist beyond traditional solutions despite growing interest worldwide.",0,163
"This Hacker News thread discusses how to attract applications from senior talent and what can be done to increase attractiveness to potential employees. The Android Security team at Google has put out a security bulletin for the month of May, which includes fixes for 32 vulnerabilities in total that affect most versions of stock Androids running on both phones and tablets: Android 4.0 - Update to version 3.2 or later (May 2013) Android 2.34.0 - Update [...] Google's Andy Rubin recently spoke with Bloomberg about the future of mobile devices specifically where he sees himself fitting into its evolutionary process as an innovator. He reportedly says it is ""inevitable"" that our smartphones will eventually become more like TVs than computers. But this doesn't mean they'll go away; rather we may see them take over some other functions currently served by desktop PCs...like controlling home automation systems: The next step in computing won't involve throwing laptops aside entirely - your smartphone could just end up taking care of tasks you used your PC for today, while offering access to a broad suite of online services including TV shows and movies with voice activation, saving your laptop battery life when you travel....You look down at your phone every day anyway, so why not have her do something useful there?... In addition, Rubin also said that we're going to need new ways of thinking creatively about interface design if these innovations are ever going to happen.. Specifically referring to media consumption instead of production, things such as radio programs being controlled via touch interfaces using gestures would allow us to 'play' music without actually touching anything. This isn't too far fetched considering Apple already does similar functionality through their Remote app. Finally, according to Rubin, convergence is here now - but only because consumers want it: I think the whole notion of converged platforms came first from consumer demand. You walk around with a tablet and everyone identifies it as ""a device."" A few years ago no one wanted to call smartphones 'devices.' People didn't know exactly what they were, people thought they might make calls, play games, surf the webbut certainly weren't considered productivity tools."" So basically the idea comes back full circle to Steve Jobs who had famously declared five years prior: There's no reason anyone would want a computer that was less powerful than [an iPhone],'....I kind of laughed him off...""",0,164
"NASA's Parker Solar Probe has captured images of Venus' surface. Venus' surface is blocked by a thick atmosphere, which makes it hard to take pictures of. However, the surface is still visible in ultraviolet light because that wavelength can pass through Earth's atmosphere and reach the planet's surface. The probe used its instrument called the Multispectral Imager for Thermal Emission Spectroscopy (MITS) to capture these important photos. The first photo features the south pole of Venus: Source: NASAJohns Hopkins APL-SwRISteve Gribben; image processing by Steve Lee using data from the Planetary Data System Venus rotates on itself so much more slowly than Earth does - once every 243 days instead of 365 as we do here at home. That means you get a totally different view depending upon where you are on this bizarre world compared with what happens over time zones or even just one day on our own globe. As John Leif Jrgensen explains via Twitter below, even though he was looking roughly northward when capturing his shot yesterday afternoon local time, ""the South Pole seems tilted almost 30 degrees.""

"Researchers from Columbia University have established a method for growing human hair in a dish using 3D printing without the need for implantation into human skin. The method uses a synthetic protein that simulates follicle development, and is able to shed light on how cells within hair regrow after it has been plucked out by scissors or pulled through an electric shaver. Hair grows constantly throughout our lives at about 1mm per month until we reach adulthood when this slows down but never stops completely; around 70 hairs are lost every day just through normal grooming activities such as combing your hair with hands or brushing against sharp objects like combs. In males alone over 100 million hairs fall onto their pillow each night! This results in millions of people suffering from baldness. But what happens inside? How does all this new hair get generated before you wake up one morning totally fuzz-free?!",0,170
"Scientists from the University of Southern California were able to visualize memories forming in the brains of genetically modified zebrafish in the lab. The team expected the brains to form new neurons, but instead they saw a wave that looked like ripples through water when something is disturbed. ""When these fish start moving around and swimming or interacting with each other,"" said lead researcher Daniela Kaufer-Stewart, ""an area starts firing very rapidly."" In just an hour after being placed into this mixed gender tank (which had slightly different amounts of food), the male betas displayed mating behavior such as chasing females down and biting their tails - and neuroscientists noticed those bursts coming out of previously inactive brain tissue. That signaled some type of memory was arising there. They'd never seen anything quite like it before: where one second the activity spiked up all over the place; then suddenly fell back again for several days until testing time came round again. Which makes sense considering how fast our own bodies react to trauma - remembering what happened so we can avoid doing it ever again.

"StoreDot, an Israeli company, has developed car batteries capable of fully charging in five minutes. The batteries can be mass-produced on standard production lines. StoreDot has so far raised 130 million Euros (138M) from VCs and is looking to raise another 100 M euros later this year. The world's second largest EV battery maker CATL (SZSE: 300750) came up with a new solid state lithium ion cathode material using proprietary technology, which it claims will increase the range by 20 compared to existing cells for electric vehicles without compromising safety or energy density - a feat many experts say cannot be achieved any time soon given current technologies. In 2016 Tesla bought a stake in Chinese startup NextEV that was developing power electronics control systems; implementing these sensors could help improve autonomous driving performance but also reduce costs related to driver assistance features such as cruise control and collision avoidance mechanisms. So far the deal hasn't yielded much fruit apart from patents filed over several years' worth of academic research work at Stanford University. However, one subsidiary owned jointly between NXP Semiconductors NV and STMicroelectronics NV does supply automotive chips used in advanced safety functions like automatic emergency braking, steering assist and lane departure warning while consultants McKinsey Co. estimated last month that global sales value of active safety products may reach 50 billion annually within about ten years. Baidu Inc., China's biggest search engine operator, announced earlier this week its self-driving unit Apollo would invest 1B yuan (150m) into companies working towards connected cars.

As such, you might have been waiting months for an update like this - but here's why there isn't any new features: according to TechCrunch, Apple doesn't really put much effort into adding many significant changes between public betas and official releases of software. Its focus is mainly on smoothing out bugs. However, those are things most people usually don't notice anyway.

"The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams aims to create thousands of isotopes never before recorded on Earth. There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but there are more than 100 times as many combinations in which they can be arranged in the periodic table because some have unstable nuclei and decay into other elements over time. To gain a better understanding of how these atoms work together or don't scientists must study them at extremely low levels, creating miniature laboratories inside particle accelerators where physical laws of chemistry no longer apply. So far, only one stable isotope has been created with this technique: an atom made entirely out of ytterbium gas called Yb-85 (Yb135). But it's important to note the difference between ""stable"" and ""long lived."" The ytterbium atoms produced by FERMI will live 600 seconds; that sounds like plenty until you compare it to half a million years ago when humans first walked upright.

In order to get there safely, SpaceX designed two ""crusher"" tests: One using non-cryo fuel followed by another done completely under liquid oxygen pressure. Each time things were just as they should have been until...the engine cut out unexpectedly after 25 seconds when the propellant likely ran cold too fast due to atmospheric conditions. Still not sure what went wrong? Check out these videos from ErichSchroer showing how this testing actually works: NASA waterfalltesting on the Falcon 9's upper stage ""Super Heavy.""

But those who know about the company will tell you that any significant setback like this can easily cause delays while engineers try to pinpoint whatever caused this issue specifically or all engines more generally. That said, Musk noted last week following the second failed test that SpaceX would probably need six months to resolve everything no matter what happens since he doesn't believe the issues lie within his team but rather outside factors beyond their control related to COVID 19 restrictions and storms. As we reported back then: However, Elon Musk may allow himself only three weeks prior to actual flights as companies are required to perform post-test reviews either way which often lead into unexpected changes and rescheduling. For now, Space X states that B1049 still requires additional work leading them to request a waiver so they don't miss their window given multiple ongoing missions including Starlink launches over Cuba through Florida Airports where weather frequently proves problematic. This means there won't necessarily be much room left open between now and the end of summer for several reasons - primarily to give employees adequate notice regarding school schedules and family vacations etc., plus potentially needing extra time depending upon results. Weather permitting, SpaceX plans to certify the SN15 Starship prototype sometime before its planned high altitude flight campaign beginning early October. However, without certification confidence levels dropping dramatically, upcoming hop attempts might be delayed further. Regardless, it appears that barring unforeseen circumstances, Starship serial number 15 will make history soon...just maybe a little later than expected. Stay tuned. Clearly looking towards future development of Starship Mk III IV based off the design philosophy introduced roughly five years ago, SpaceX unveiled new renderings today depicting the vehicles once fully developed against a backdrop reminiscent of historical images taken right here on Earth.

But why do some parts of the surface have these features while others don't? One possibility is magnetic forces; they could cause areas to heat up much faster than normal because there would not only be friction between particles moving over each other but also due to their movement beneath them creating currents within the hot magma layers producing additional internal heating and pressure. However this needs further study before it becomes established fact. Just how active does the sun get compared to Earth? Very! Solar flares release billions upon billions of tons of energy per second into space - equivalent to firing 100 billion megaton bombs every day: enough power for 10 million homes. Even though solar storms rarely reach us here on earth, even if they did you'd probably see no difference except your phone battery running out quicker...so far so good then!",0,191

"MIT has released a 7-minute video that shows President Richard Nixon delivering an Apollo 11 contingency speech. It took the team at MIT more than half a year to create , and it's absolutely mesmerizing: The project began with transcripts of various speeches made by presidents on their approach to major events like war or international relations. The researchers then used machine learning algorithms to turn those text files into videos based off audio clips from each president in question. They're not simply recordings of the words - the computer also uses visual cues (like gestures) and even voice pitch patterns as they work toward replicating the tone and cadence of the original communication. You can watch this video for example here. ADVERTISEMENT What you'll notice about these transcriptions is how much happens during pauses; if your brain isn't always tuned into presidential speechwriting conventions, there are some incredibly interesting things that come out when we take away the unnecessary stuff around them. To illustrate my point better, imagine listening to me read aloud what I've written above without any punctuation whatsoever. If someone were to listen carefully enough though, hopefully all sorts of fascinating insights would emerge! For instance ... ""My name? That thing people say?"" Or maybe something super insightful, such as ..."" People keep asking 'Who am I? There could be anything, really. For now, however, let us concentrate upon one short interlude between John F.

"Over the weekend, the Ikea at Harajuku in Tokyo hosted an installation starring Imma, a virtual influencer. People who passed by the first floor of the store were able to interact with her and take pictures using their phone screens; she even made herself jump around on cue as people took selfies next to her while wearing 3D glasses. It was all part of what the company called ""The Unseen 2021,"" which explored new forms of interaction between humans and technology through augmented reality (AR) - something that is set to become increasingly important for some brands during this current global crisis. ""We are living in such challenging times right now due to COVID-19, which makes it more critical than ever before for us to find solutions to help bring our guests closer together again after social distancing measures have been relaxed,"" said Ewelina Ochab, head of digital innovation design at IKEA Japan, adding: ""This project aims to do just that."" The event ran until Sunday but continues online so anyone can still visit. Ikea's activation came off the back its 2020 report into consumer trends, Future Ready Living 2030, which looked ahead to how life might look differently after we emerge from lockdown across Asia Pacific and Europe later this year. Among other things, the study found 46 percent of consumers agreed they don't want to return to pre-pandemic habits when restrictions lift because there will always be added value provided by AR products or services compared to previous experiences. Meanwhile, 36 percent believe going out won't feel quite normal without these kinds of technologies already available. This tallies roughly with research conducted among Asian consumers last month by Unit4 CEO Subodh Mhaisalkar, whose survey uncovered similar attitudes towards VRAR tech within his own market including China where 66 percent predicted live shows would eventually resume once public health concerns ease, alongside 67 percent expecting theatres to reopen partially sooner rather than later.",0,207

"Amazon has revealed two new robots at the re:MARS conference that are designed to move products around its warehouses. The Xanthus is an upgrade for Amazon's shelf-bots that will let these autonomous machines navigate more efficiently and safely through busy distribution centers, while also being able to work with a bigger payload capacity of up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms). The other robot on display was called the Scout which can be lowered into areas where forklifts aren't allowed or too dangerous. It uses computers rather than wheels so it won't get stuck in tight corners but still moves quickly enough across a warehouse floor to keep pace with human workers as they walk alongside it. These small scale bots may not sound very impressive compared to the original Amazon Robotics Kiva System - used by many fulfillment centers worldwide since 2012 - - but this time we're talking about something much smaller and cheaper priced. According to Reuters, their price tag might start from 5,000 just like those of traditional industrial robots whereas the latter cost millions of dollars each. With lower costs involved thanks to multiple automation technologies such as machine vision, 3D sensors along with artificial intelligence applied throughout their design process, some analysts believe Amazon could have 100,000 of them working in its facilities within three years' time. At present there are only 300 units operating inside warehouses owned by Amazon, according to Business Insider.",0,212
"A new privacy feature in Firefox strips custom URL query parameters from URLs to prevent tracking. The Query Parameter Stripping feature automatically strips various query parameters from clicked links and replaced them with a blank string, so that the user is not tracked based on their browsing history or other information they may enter while clicking through online content. The first time you enable this setting it will show all of your current query parameters as ""?""query, but depending upon how many sites you visit each day these can become quite lengthy over time: Query parameter stripping helps protect users' anonymity by removing URL-level data associated with specific requests, such as cookie values, referrer headers, authentication tokens (including secure cookies), media playbackdownloads, etc., which could be used for tracking purposes. In addition, if Chrome's Private Browsing mode were enabled during an unknown link click session then any personalized identifiers would also be removed at the browser level. This makes web browsers much more difficult targets for cross-site tracking. For example, Google Analytics cannot learn anything about users who browse anonymously. It becomes increasingly important - especially now when some websites are using 3rd party service trackers like Facebook Pixel tags - to reduce website fingerprintability across IP addresses.

"The seahorse placenta is a fascinating example of convergent evolution. Male seahorses' brood pouches develop and function like human placentas. During pregnancy, the males provide embryos with everything they need. They nourish them by feeding them small particles from their food that are broken down in special digestive organs inside each pouch. Their importance to developing babies can't be overstated; if this species was without male mates, it would not have been able to reproduce for millions of years. But what about female seahorses? What do those pregnant females get out of this deal besides carrying around another animal's foetus for nine months (and no sex)? The answer comes when we look at the consequences for both sexes: When mothers give birth successfully after mating there isn't any cost - but fathers who fail produce offspring which die shortly after hatching. So why does nature create such an elaborate system where every individual benefits except one gender? Conventional wisdom suggests women only aid reproduction as a means to appease men so they don't defect or cheat on the mother. It could also help her pass valuable genes onto future generations. My colleagues and I think these ideas underestimate how important reproductive success really is to animals particularly because most people consider eggs to be less desirable than sperm due to high energy demands during development. Credit: Shutterstock Maternal investment Sometimes evolutionary theory assumes ""survival"" must drive all behavior seemingly unrelated to survival, including mate choice. In fact, female fitness depends just as much upon successful reproduction as male fitness! Some theories suggest either traits found exclusively in males may persist simply because they boost reproductive potential more effectively. Or vice versa - since some traits promoting reproductively successful individuals benefit neither group nor self directly, they disappear once natural selection has done its thing. For instance, male tail length evolved independently among diving beetles, lampreys and humans, even though none of us invest in swimming ability ourselves. Since favoring long tails increases access to sexually receptive partners better known for having longer tailed suitors themselves, super-elongated genitalia should increase overall reproductive output across population groups within the same sexual guilds competing against other groups pursuing similar strategies. Similarly, many scientists believe brightly colored plumage serves female birds well, increasing chances of fertilization using visual cues rather than relying solely on auditory detection. Whether these colorful displays actually enhance female attractiveness remains up for debate still today amongst biologists. If bright feathers were intended to attract attention then surely coloration will vary between body parts depending on context. Think peacock feathers versus turkey breasts compared to wolf fur patterns. No matter what the cause behind the design pattern underlying wild variations throughout the animal kingdom's stunningly diverse appearances, variation itself makes perfect sense given our observation that hundreds of different shapes evolved into billions of animals. And yet despite being designed differently according to vastly differing needs, bodies remain remarkably consistent too - even right down to the shape of internal cavities capable of housing young. Despite generally looking very dissimilar anatomically speaking, literally thousands of avian and mammalian egg cases require precisely the same adaptations to properly accommodate newborn chicks and fetuses ranging anywhere from 2 grams to nearly 200 kilograms. This includes specialized folds wrapping around otherwise delicate ovaries containing dozens of eggs per clutch, ensuring proper blood flow while simultaneously protecting unborn young allowing their slow growth before emerging whole. Why might we assume anything else?",0,215
"Mark Zuckerberg has highlighted four areas (data portability, election integrity, harmful content, and privacy) which he believes require regulation, in an op-ed published on March 30. He stated that a ""new private messaging infrastructure"" is needed to address these issues; this would largely involve the creation of new encrypted endpoints where users could chat privately with each other without Facebook in between. The company will also be strengthening its efforts around safety by establishing a cross-functional teams for Safety Engineering Response across all parts of the business - something it hasn't done before at such scale within Instagram or Facebook itself - as well as launching new tools like suicide prevention features and improvements to existing ones like reporting systems so they can work better when there's high demand during crises events like elections. On top of those changes outlined above, Myers said that we're likely going to see more transparency from companies about their moderation processes moving forward: ""We are committed to being transparent regarding what actions we take against abusive accounts,"" she noted in the blog post, adding that some examples may include providing updates on enforcement rates, publishing metrics related to the prevalence of certain types of content, and sharing information on how often particular words get blocked vs left up after review. Relatedly, Instagram says that over the coming weeks you'll start seeing popups asking if people think posts violate community guidelines even though they haven't been removed yet. The idea here is presumably to give creators feedback on whether their account might face any consequences due to future rule violations while still giving them time to learn the rules before getting permanently banned.",0,216
"Alexa will now be able to proactively act on Hunches thanks to its latest update. Amazon's device has been able to sense habits and ask about them since 2018, but the company is giving Alexa a new ability: it can take action when you provide a ""hunch"" instead of asking for more information first. For example, if someone asks their Echo smart speaker where they parked, an improvement in computer vision would lead the software to automatically tell that person which building or parking lot they're looking at from inside the car - without requiring any additional details like location, date, time stamp, etc., before taking further actions such as telling Maps how long until the driver needs to leave so she doesn't get ticketed.

"Optogenetics is a method of controlling neurons with light. A team of researchers from Northwestern University built an ultraminiature, wireless, battery-free, and fully implantable optogenetics device for mice that allowed them to use genetically encoded LEDs in the brain to create targeted electrical activity within neural circuits - allowing control over behaviors like sleep or wakefulness. ""It's completely noninvasive,"" says Madeline Lancaster, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at McCormick School of Engineering. ""This could be transformative."" The research was published on December 9th in Nature Biomedical Engineering. With this technology, it may become possible to train people who are paralyzed and cannot speak to communicate via their thoughts alone by using external stimuli (like lights) through implanted devices designed specifically for those purposes. It also opens up ways to study how we interact and respond to our environment without having to directly interfere with behavior caused simply by environmental cues. ""We want to make sure these technologies will not only work safely inside living tissue but also be ready soon enough so they can help patients live better lives now,"" said Ritika Suri, a graduate student working under Lancaster as part of her Ph.D. thesis project, coauthored along with Anurag Agrawal, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering; Benjamin Long, assistant professor of neurobiology; Matthew Lorberbaum, Daniel I. Linzer Distinguished Service Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and director of the Institute for NanoBioTechnology at Illinois; Yufei Huang, former postdoctoral fellow in neuroscience, current scientist at Stryker Corporation; and Sheng Xu, assistant clinical professor of neurology at Feinberg. ""There has been tremendous progress since my time here, especially when you consider many years ago nobody thought cells were ever going to survive outside the body much less wirelessly transmit signals across such long distances. This next level of development holds huge promise because it builds off what everyone learned before us while pushing forward scientifically and clinically.""",0,232

According to Fast Company, which first reported about Amazon's plans earlier today, there are three main concerns surrounding palm scanners: privacy issues, hacking potential, as well as just how secure the system actually is compared to other fingerprint scanning technologies like those found on Apple iPhone 8 models. So far, however, all we know from Amazon itself regarding any kind of rollout plan involves only ""select employees"" being able to use hand recognition features right now while the company continues working towards launching such an initiative commercially sometime down the line (a launch date hasn't yet even reportedly come up internally).",0,236
"Bill Gates has left Microsoft's board and stepped down from his position on the board of Berkshire Hathaway. Gates stated that he decided to step down in order to dedicate more time to philanthropic activities, including working with Bill Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The BMGF is a private family foundation which was founded by Mr. Gates as well as his wife Melinda French-Gates back in 2000. According to its official website, it is one of the largest charitable foundations globally having an endowment worth over 50 billion. The primary focus areas for this charity are global public health initiatives such as vaccine development; improving healthcare systems worldwide especially in low income countries; reducing childhood mortality rates through programs aimed at treating infectious diseases like malaria, pneumonia etc.; combating poverty and inequality around the world among others. As part of these objectives, nearly half of all money raised goes towards developing ways to fight epidemics. In addition, the organization runs various educational programs related to social welfare issues while also promoting sustainable agriculture practices across the globe. This includes funding agricultural research projects focused mainly on eradicating hunger and malnutrition. Finally, most importantly they have pledged to give away 99 of their personal wealth during their lifetimes in support of humanitarian causes spanning medical advancements and climate change mitigation measures. However given how much cash donations alone do not go far enough in tackling some of the biggest challenges facing humanity today, the Gates couple believe strongly about using technology as both a means and solution for creating positive impact in society. To quote Mr. Gates himself: ""Technology can help people live longer lives and be healthier than ever before."" Therefore investments were made into ventures ranging from training mobile apps designed to detect disease outbreaks faster thereby saving millions of lives annually to tracking spread patterns involving pandemic related data analytics services offered via cloud computing platforms. And even though certain business models might look questionable under closer scrutiny due to privacy risks involved when information pertaining to tens or hundreds of thousands users are being targeted by high tech AI solutions, Gates still believes in supporting companies whose main purpose involves helping vulnerable populations address complex problems such as ensuring access to clean water supplies along with adequate sanitation infrastructure for impoverished communities whereas providing them tools necessary to improve quality of life. Friends close to Gates say that by stepping down from his corporate positions now - long after retiring from Executive Chairman post within Microsoft Corporation last year - will allow him to spend significant amount of time focusing on exploring new opportunities regarding technological innovations aiming to tackle critical health emergencies and other pressing human rights concerns in regions where traditional supply chains fall short despite abundance of resources. He mentioned that there would be no better time to take action considering how Covid19 brought everyone together making us aware that we need each other if we want humankind to survive future threats posed by pathogens just waiting to jump species barriers and cross oceans resulting from deforestation and rising sea levels caused primarily by fossil fuel burning habits adopted mostly by consumers living rich lifestyles often oblivious to consequences faced lagging behind those who act responsibly taking care of environments they rely upon for survival without undue influence coming purely out of profit driven motives.

"Being a solo founder can be difficult and it can take a while to find a rhythm that works without burning out. Patience and perseverance will help with dealing with the inevitable setbacks, but listen carefully for guidance along your path because sometimes you really need someone else's perspective or encouragement! What have been some of the most interesting things you've observed since you started Teddly? What are the main lessons ortakeaways from those experiences? I would say one important lesson is how much easier running my own company has made me feel like I am doing something worthwhile; which I think we all wish more people could experience in their day-to-day lives (the feeling of making an impact). Everyone likes validation when they make decisions - so if there happens to be nothing standing between you and what you want besides yourself then experiencing this freedom feels amazing on its own already:) It also makes working harder than ever rewarding as well: every new customer who signs up brings us closer to our next milestone and having these tangible goals keeps everything very exciting. Another takeaway from starting by myself was just getting comfortable taking the wheel so quickly even though everyone around felt nervous about whether or not I knew exactly where I wanted to go at first. Once again, believing strongly enough in my idea became critical throughout launching Teddly. Now 12 years later, I still believe strongly enough in the mission behind Teddly, continue moving forward each day towards achieving big plans over time, strive to keep building our team, and constantly look back fondly at milestones accomplished thanks to unwavering commitment once set into motion. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that? One early morning during the weekdays before school began at Stanford University I decided to get coffee across campus after finishing work late. After nearly two hours waiting outside a cafe near campus holding onto - what ultimately ended up being-a piece of paper instead of actually purchasing anything inside, I returned home empty handed frustrated both mentally and physically exhausted thinking ""how did I manage to do such a dumb thing?!"" The reason why took several months later until another friend pointed it out to me...It turned out Starbucks wasn't open yet. We all need a little help along the journey. Who have been some of your mentors? Can you share a story about how they made an impact? My parents remain incredibly influential today simply due to them always encouraging meus whenever possible no matter how uncertain life may seem. My dad especially continues pushing me daily asking questions of me likely more often now than he used too given his age;). He pushes through challenges himself everyday despite great loss and grief experienced recently unfortunately losing his sister earlier last year which brought him face-to-face with mortality reminding me perhaps never quite seriously enough prior to appreciating living fully behind pursuing dreams together as father and son rather than focusing solely on business pursuits alone - which seems to happen naturally anyways. Luckily distance allows plenty of visits between here San Francisco New York City allowing for quality bonding regardless of lifestyle differences in place currently. Plus although many articles recommend developing personal hobbies instead of following entrepreneurs' blogs to copy ideas from etc., I appreciate reading others' perspectives alongside mine especially ones writing about similar communities facing common problems.

In press release announcing the news last week, Elizabeth Blackburn said she was ""excited"" her work had been chosen: ""This is an exciting time,"" says senior author Elizabeth Blackburn, who received the 2009 Nobel Prize along with Carol Greider for their discoveries involving telomerase-an enzyme involved in cell division that maintains DNA length and slows aging in cells. ""We have entered a period where we can use knowledge from genetics to try and control many aspects of health, wellness, longevity and even intelligence. We are finally beginning to understand enough about inheritance patterns so that specific sequences of DNA can be targeted effectively."" According to CSHL Dean Eric Lander, MD, PhD, director of the Broad Institute which helped cofound HGP, this will become increasingly important once it becomes possible to edit human genomes using CRISPRCas9 technology. He adds that knowing what sequence variants confer beneficial traits may also guide future clinical trials aimed at treating inherited disorders like sickle cell anemia or Tay Sachs disease. Being able to identify these mutations should enable doctors to prescribe only those therapies proven safe for each individual patient rather than blanket approaches used today.

"Nintendo has announced Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, a game where players use their Nintendo Switches to pilot a physical kart around their home.

"Navigate on Autopilot is a new feature by Tesla that is moving it closer to its self-driving future. It offers step-by-step navigation overlayed on a map (like you would get from Google Maps) with clear visual cues for turns, traffic lights and highway interchanges. While the car will not drive itself yet, this tech could give drivers more confidence in their ability to navigate unfamiliar areas without getting lost or taking longer than necessary while still giving them control of if they want to speed upslow down at an intersection rather than having the auto pilot make these decisions automatically based solely off road sign recognition as some other systems do now. The FSD summon function also uses Navigate on Auto Pilot but instead allows your vehicle to move forward toward anywhere within about 100 feet like remote parking assistance when summoned via app or key fob. This smarts out two things: people who don't have space outside their home right next to where they park so need another person present AND those who can't be bothered walking far to help load groceries into the trunk! In addition, there are controls over how close to walls or obstacles your vehicle can go before stopping just in case someone feels uneasy letting their precious EV roll around freely inside whatever garage has been built. There was even talk during Wednesday's event of allowing Teslas full autonomy only after verifying owners' identity using biometric facial scans through smartphone cameras which seems excessive security theatre beyond basic verification questions already asked upon ordering vehicles online today? So much for Full Self Driving... If all goes well here - potentially very soon - I see no reason why Apple wouldn't try slowly rolling out an AV platform especially since CarPlay integration really isn't great enough period despite being one of iOS 13's biggest features; hence my surprise something wasn't announced earlier than 2020 alongside iOS 14 updates for iPhones set for release then too. Henceforth, we'll probably hear quite a bit less about Apple's automotive ambitions until anything actually emerges because announcing stuff years ahead looks almost silly given current technology trends such as 5G cellular networks becoming ubiquitous worldwide sooner than expected thanks to China aggressively pushing towards nationwide adoption early last year following local vendors releasing commercial variants way back in 2018. In similar fashion to what happened prior to Samsung disappointing investors with Galaxy Fold failures leading to foldable phone delays last year once again due to hardware issues software bugs causing them to break easily, many industry observers and reporters alike were excitedly anticipating announcements from both Google (Android 12) and Microsoft (Windows 10X) regarding mobile operating system developments including ARVR support specifically tailored for HoloLens 2 devices released late 2019. Instead though, neither company chose to reveal any plans whatsoever either revealing nothing related nor completely ignoring us entirely throughout WWDC19. I'm going to err on the side of caution saying maybe none of these companies felt compelled to announce big news the day they unveiled upcoming versions of Android and Windows 10X respectively although considering each had major OS overhauls coming later this summer along with brand new phones targeted mostly at work customers locked into preset business programs requiring constant logistical management regardless of pandemic conditions like Zoom video conferencing apps, sustainable enterprise supply chain tracking tools etc., perhaps keeping lips sealed makes sense in light of recent events trying to focus solely on offering experiences designed to keep users safe long term. Being able to safely run telecommuting applications securely under a lockdown scenario obviously means paying attention to user privacy concerns first and foremost making sure every piece of data sent received between employees and employers remains private. Considering pretty much everyone's health status changes frequently nowadays amid various social distancing rules across different regions globally, everything must remain flexible accordingly ensuring whenever possible productivity levels aren't negatively impacted impacting corporate revenue streams. Yeah, technically speaking most businesses should've been prepared for unexpected disruptions since dynamic working environments became popular decades ago meaning initiating emergency protocols putting certain teams together remotely shouldn't require all hands on deck immediately throwing some staff members to fend for themselves figuring contingency measures involving multiple departments simultaneously might take time depending largely depends on whether managers have alternative options available or think others may struggle better handling specific tasks compared to normal circumstances.. Eventually however, returning workers will inevitably find themselves overloaded dealing with unforeseen bandwidth crunches and network bottlenecks caused by massive demands placed onto traditional infrastructure surrounding personal computers, servers networking equipment resulting in increased latency effectively cutting team efficiency percentages significantly lower forcing cooperation amongst dispersed groups unable to collaborate face to face...

"Apple has been reportedly building its own sports platform as part of its Apple TV streaming service. References to something called'SportsKit' have been found in the iOS 15.2 beta. The new features don't appear to be live yet, but it could mean that they'll arrive with tvOS and macOS 14.6 later this year... The source code for a new feature being developed by Apple is said to include references about ""sports (R) "" and how developers can use them inside their apps. While these are not accessible on devices running iOS 15.2 betas or iPad OS 15.1 dev builds at present - only macOS Big Sur developer preview 2 comes close to revealing more details - we might get some information when Apple finally releases public versions of the software soon enough. That's if any further detail slips into those official software updates before then...We also know that Sport Kit will allow you to access statistics from third-party partners like ESPN directly within your app without having to rely upon an external mobile web view. This means the data won't ever leave the secure confines of your iPhoneiPad and should make all parties involved happy - especially consumers who want reliable stats delivered quickly even while watching video content.It makes sense too because there aren't really many sports applications available outside of major US broadcasters right now.

"Mozilla has created a new VRAR browser called Firefox Reality. Mozilla has rethought everything to make a browser usable in virtual, mixed, and augmented reality settings. Text input is still the best way of interacting with web pages on mobile devices because it's more efficient than tapping or swiping - but most apps require users' eyes to be trained on text fields where they can see only what would appear on their smartphone screens if there were no headset at all. This makes them less useful for browsing content through headsets like Apple Glasses (or even Google Glass) that are meant primarily for AR experiences rather than simple viewing. For example: If you want information about your next flight search on Kayak while wearing an Oculus Quest 2, expect to scroll down past a bunch of empty real estate until you find something interesting enough to click into. The same problem exists when using iOS 14 Safari within Magic Leap One; navigation gets incredibly tedious as developers inevitably fail to use landscape mode properly so videos aren't centered correctly across every frame. And unless these companies adopt touch-based interfaces eventually, those of us who prefer not to poke our phones constantly will always have to deal with this frustrating workflow. Firefox Reality isn't just trying to solve some problems associated with desktop browsers looking out onto VRAR worlds from inside headsets. It also faces challenges other solutions haven't had to address yet entirely unique to immersive computing. A lot of existing workflows in Augmented Reality applications rely heavily upon hand gestures: After scanning a room full of furniture in Ikea Place, for instance, I was able to select specific items by waving my hands around over each piece. But how do we interact with websites? How does one type anything meaningful without accidentally selecting text somewhere else onscreen? Firefox Reality uses 3D Touch instead of tap gestures to allow for typing right underneath its keyboard window to avoid accidental selection issues. For added convenience, you'll now automatically get autocomplete suggestions whenever you start entering an email address or URL into the field itself instead of having to reach up above and pinchpunch buttons yourself first. Tap and hold anywhere outside of either text entry box to bring up advanced options such as copy paste functions or alternate text selections directly onboarding user actions before you've even tapped ""enter."" These features should go a long ways towards making browser interactions feel natural along with reducing repetitive strain injuries by allowing people to keep both thumbs free during lengthy sessions online. They're especially great for navigating objects deep within apps which may often demand extra taps spent copying URLs or addresses anyway since many don't provide direct links back to external sources otherwise.",0,245

"Apple has launched a new tool that gathers anonymous data from Apple Maps to show how well people are following social distancing guidelines.

An Apple spokesperson confirmed it would not have access to users' location or personal contact details as part of this initiative and said any information shared with public officials will adhere to privacy rules. The move comes amid criticism over some tech companies providing their tools free during the pandemic without proper safeguards around user data and transparency. Last month Facebook stopped offering its coronavirus tracking map because it did not properly inform users on what they were signing up to share. Microsoft also faced an outcry after introducing a workplace chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI) which could detect whether employees suspected of having Covid-19 had symptoms such as fever and cough. Workers worried these systems might discriminate against certain groups including racial minorities. Both companies later updated their products so only trained human workers can review sensitive reports raised via AI software.

"Former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong is building a system to transform desert land into fertile ground to grow the trees we need to help stop climate change. Trees can recapture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it, which helps mitigate global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our air. But they don't just absorb CO2: They also provide shade for animals that live there, including humans who have been forced out of their homes when extreme weather events become more frequent because of rising temperatures - flooding or drought. The problem with planting as many trees as possible? We aren't very good at keeping them alive over time. ""It's like a child,"" Wong said during an interview on CBSN Wednesday morning. He added later that if you give someone too much responsibility while living off-grid somewhere remote ""you'll probably lose track"" of your responsibilities. So he decided to create software tools so people could plant fewer trees but make sure each one survives. His company, called Trusight, uses artificial intelligence (AI) models trained through human relationships to determine what tree will thrive best where. It then grows those trees using seedlings provided by companies such as One Tree Planted, Plant With Purpose, Bright Green Field Solutions LLC, and ArborGenics Inc., among others. According to its website, Trusight has planted 15 million trees across 16 countries since 2012; the U.S. alone accounts for around 6.5 million. By analyzing data about soil conditions, rainfall levels, sunlight patterns and other factors, AI tells officials how big the saplings should be before being transplanted. Once rooted, these new plants get regular updates via sensors placed throughout the forest. Artificial intelligence isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, businesses are already working hard to adopt machine learning everywhere - from predicting customer needs based on past purchases, detecting fraud and even spotting security flaws within computer code itself. But this approach works differently than traditional methods used by Google DeepMind, IBM Watson and Microsoft Cortana. Instead of focusing solely on language processing tasks like image recognition, natural speech understanding and text analytics, Trusight looks at images captured by a camera attached to a drone flying overhead. This way, instead of simply trying to learn from examples found online, computers analyze real world situations and do far better job doing that compared to those relying only on programming algorithms written by developers for specific jobs. ""What makes us different actually comes down pretty simple to answering questions that nature would ask you really quickly without having any training whatsoever,"" Mr. Wong explained.""The question is well, 'how long does it take for lichen to form?' And my answer is 55 days... If I was given completely random samples of pictures of forests, I wouldn't know anything about the species composition nor the condition [of] individual trees inside that picture...We're able to tell exactly why something failed versus succeeded all because I'm looking directly underneath a leaf and seeing how fast did it start growing."" As part of PolicyLink's American Jobs Project initiative - a five year study examining policies aimed at strengthening local economies - workers were paid 10 per hour spending two hours daily actively monitoring the health status of dozens of 3D printed fir trees designed according to NASA specifications. These machines are programmed under artificial intelligence techniques similar to those pioneered by Tech Mahindra's Machine Intelligence Software Unit Research Center located in Mumbai India. These technologies use multi layers deep neural networks capable of handling large amount of input information coupled with experience analysis capabilities modeled after biological nervous systems. As opposed to teaching agents structured rules, engineers try to mimic how brains work developing adaptive mechanisms inspired by evolutional strategies employed by insects ants. Engineers aim here to develop core structures extracted from biology combined with knowledge learned from observing existing instances thus allowing machines to act accordingly. Our efforts include areas related to reasoning, planning, control, memory management, communication protocols etc... All applied towards solving complex problems faced today both theoretically practically involving issues pertaining to decision makingconstraints identification along with robustnessrobust optimization aspects necessary to ensure safe operations.

"Quantum chess is a version of regular chess that incorporates the quantum concepts of superposition, entanglement, and interference. The game teaches players to develop an intuitive sense of the rules by creating games using simple models which can be scaled up so that more complex phenomena such as teleportation are represented in higher dimensions (i.e., 3-dimensional). For example, when setting out on his quest for immortality, Isaac Newton was reportedly able to teleport himself from Scotland Yard into Guy's Hospital without having been seen leaving one place or arriving at another - a feat not possible with ordinary transport systems. In this post, we will construct our own model based upon what little information is known about the potential applications of time travel. We'll start with some basic questions: does it even exist? If yes, how do you build something like that? And if no... why would anyone want to spend their entire life going back and forth between 1851 London and 2019 New York City?!",0,257
"Quantum sensors use the fragility of quantum effects to achieve extraordinary sensitivity to the slightest disturbances in the environment. They could be used to study brain conditions, reveal hidden underground structures and detect gravitational waves from distant cosmic events such as colliding black holes or neutron stars. Researchers at TU Wien (Vienna) have now demonstrated a novel technique for checking whether they are properly working: by measuring their temperature with an additional sensor. As it turns out this additional measurement goes beyond what was previously known about these fascinating devices. The results were published today in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters. Degradation due to heat stress The ability to measure very small changes is crucial for all types of modern technology - including those based on ultracold atoms. For years scientists around the world have been using so-called 'quantum gases' to develop new technologies that can operate far below zero degrees Celsius without freezing up. These systems consist essentially of millions of microcubes made of Bose Einstein condensates BECs, i.e., atoms cooled down to almost absolute zero temperature. In recent years researchers also managed to generate atomic clocks which work entirely at room temperatures because the sensitive components do not need any cooling at all! ""But some delicate quantum phenomena start to break down above 50 millikelvin,"" explains Andreas Weller from Prof. Rainer Blatt's group. This means there has long existed a clear limit to how low we can cool our instruments before getting into trouble. What exactly happens when things get too hot remains unclear; however, one thing seems certain: The properties of a gas change dramatically under increasing thermal pressure."" It appears that mechanical vibrations become increasingly important, especially once you move away from equilibrium states towards more excited ones where large local fluctuations occur. These influences would ultimately result in systematic errors if left undetected during measurements. But detecting them requires something much larger than just adding another sensor!"" adds Hendrik Jansen who coauthored the paper together with Andre Fischer and Tobias Kippenberg. Temperature monitoring essential To solve this problem, the physicists turned to a well-known type of quantum sensor called an atom interferometer. To put it simply, two optical waveguides send light through two different paths. If only half of each path starts off as coherent superposition, then it will interfere constructively after passing through the second branch, but destructively otherwise. Any variation between the measured intensities depends directly on the state of matter along both pathways. While single-path versions of this device exist already, multi-channel variants like the one developed here offer even greater sensitivity since phase shifts between channels depend strongly on the local temperature gradient across the system. However, since cooling should always remain optimal within experimental limits, this leads back to the question of whether deviations from perfect cooling actually pose measurable risks sooner rather than later? That is why further research became necessary: How does the situation look for a wide variety of experimentally relevant samples? Both the theoretical analysis performed by Sebastian Muller and Oliver Burghardt and also the experiments carried out by Charlotte Goetzinger confirm previous findings regarding the behavior of BECs in a simple setup. Only upon transferring the sample to a continuously heated bath, similar to industrial processes, did problems appear. Now it becomes possible to optimize the design of ultra-sensitive quantum sensors for applications involving intense flows, and thus protect against overheating. ""In particular, this concerns extremely complex preparations of entangled ensembles containing hundreds of thousands of individual particles, often arranged in arbitrary patterns"" says Matthias Mueller, whose PhD thesis contributed significantly to the success of the project. ""This allows us to address fundamental questions related to microscopic interactions among masses in 3D space."" Moreover, he continues, ""the method presented in this publication may provide useful insights into other classes of quantum sensors besides atom interferometers,"" allowing engineers to identify potential weaknesses earlier.",0,258

Cells grown on robotic platforms are ""less likely to be damaged by the materials you're putting them into than if they were growing flat on your benchtop,"" he added. In addition, labs can use different devices tailored toward certain types of experiments without wasting time switching between equipment. And software enables scientists working remotely to control robots just like those located down the hall. But creating complex structures within these artificial bodies - particularly organs - remains elusive because most have been unable to grow blood vessels needed for life support without help from outside, according to engineers and biochemists who spoke to Reuters. They hope new approaches could produce fully functioning replacements for failing body parts. Beyond medical applications, making larger organisms that live longer would allow manufacturers to cut costs while reducing waste, experts say. Lab-grown meat firms aim eventually to sell products ranging from beef steak to chicken nuggets made of muscle instead of slaughtered animals. But getting regulatory approval will require showing consumers their food does not contain genetically modified ingredients now seen as off limits, and convincing shoppers of slaughterhouse cruelty and environmental damage wrought by intensive animal farming.

The process will move forward despite protests from 50,000 drivers who work under both companies' brands and fear losing their jobs as part of any takeover by rival firm. The two firms operate separately but their drivers use identical applications designed according to specifications set out each week by management - giving them cause for concern about being replaced when one company takes over another.",0,296
"Jeffrey Berns, CEO of Blockchains LLC, wants the Nevada government to allow companies like his to form local governments on land they own, granting them power over everything from schools and hospitals to parks. ""We (Blockchain LLC) have spent millions in this state complying with regulations that are unfriendly for business growth, whether it be mining or software development,"" said Berns at a public forum last week hosted by the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance. ""We don't need more taxes; we can pick up our stakes and leave."" Berns is working toward creating such an entity as part of its project aimed at changing how people interact through blockchain technology - basically allowing businesses to operate without using banks. Blockchain LLC has purchased 50 square miles north of Reno called Virginia City after spending 100 million developing what could become one of the world's largest cryptocurrency mines if approved by regulators. The company plans to seek approval next year to incorporate under state law because Berns argues that existing governmental entities only offer rules-based services which would not work well within their model. ""You cannot force someone into your system when you're building something different than theirs,"" he told Nevada lawmakers earlier this month during hearings about regulating digital currencies and initial coin offerings. But critics say setting up another layer of bureaucracy will add costs to residents who already pay some of the highest property taxes in the country per capita while also giving away authority over roads, utilities and other traditional municipal functions to private investors willing to take risks. They argue similar failed experiments include Texas' Winklevoss twins launching the Gemini Trust Co., Florida's Dacra Holdings Inc.'s attempts to create city councils across the U.S. Meanwhile, others believe letting third parties set up governance systems around cryptocurrencies could create new competition between states eager to attract economic activity even though most legislators do not fully understand bitcoin nor how those projects might benefit communities. In order for these types of municipalities to gain legitimacy they must adhere to certain criteria outlined by American Law Institute officials including requiring elected representatives who appoint department heads and mayors among other requirements. So far there doesn't appear any firm interest beyond Berns but experts agree the concept isn't going anywhere fast given many basic questions remain unanswered: How much oversight should regulators provide? What type of leaders should oversee these emerging cities? Should citizens get involved somehow? And where exactly does all funding come from since no major corporation invests in them yet? This idea seems particularly appealing right now amid uncertain times marked recently by Brexit, ongoing political turmoil throughout Europe and renewed calls to tax the wealthy following President Donald Trump's inauguration. Companies working on decentralized applications stand out compared to typical startups focused on monetizing social networks or web browsers because they require massive investments just to keep running every day. Having a piece of ground that allows startup hopefuls access to cheap electricity helps alleviate concerns associated with investing large sums before knowing exact revenue figures. Decentralization proponents claim self governing bodies built on blockchains enable faster decision making while providing greater transparency on finances along with incentives for taking care of key infrastructure needs like education and health care. It remains unclear why so few people seem interested in pursuing these concepts despite still being relatively early days. Outside of Berns little else appears ready to move forward outside Bitcoin Center NYC cofounder Dan Schatt's efforts to build Ocala in Georgia possibly due to lacking support from potential constituents, according to Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at CoinCenter. Others may simply lack faith in the general public keeping track of complex issues related to decentralization.

"Blocks have shown up in almost every blogging tool, web editor, note-taking app, and content management system, but they are almost all proprietary and non-standard. Blocks are often limited to just a few types of elements or confined by the size of your screen (a mobile phone). You cannot use web standards with them because most blocks don't support it yet - some never will. Blogger doesn't even allow embedded media tags for CSS! This means you can only do certain things within their little box; if something needs an ID attribute on one block that isn't supported then good luck figuring out what is going wrong when the styles stop applying correctly. If there's no way around this problem, how am I supposed to implement my own custom styling? The other major issue with current commercial blocks comes down to business models: In order to make money from selling apps to small businesses, designers need everything locked into the software while also being able to get rid of any pesky bugs via expensive upgrades whenever features change. All signs point towards these kinds of applications getting worse not better over time as we see more companies pushing ever-newer versions at us faster than we think about changing our theme colors once per year...",0,299

While many are skeptical about whether this level of influence could translate into financial gains via corporate stock buybacks - which would require more than just one influential backer - anything might happen if there were ever another SEC investigation involving tweets coming out of SpaceX or Tesla again... which seems unlikely given how rarely they occur these days compared to ten years ago.",0,302
"Jerdon's jumping worker ants can become reproductive queens when their queens die. The transition comes with changes to the ant's brain, gene expression, hormone levels, and cell composition. Researchers have suggested that this process takes only a few days. Now a new study published in eLife suggests it might be more like hours rather than just several days as previously thought - and not all of them turn into reproductively active females either. This could lead researchers to rethink how quickly workers switch genders once they get the chance to do so. As for why there is such variation among individuals within colonies? That remains an open question too. Why would we want to know about these variations anyway? Well, having large numbers of different types of female soldiers on hand may help ensure that colonies remain healthy even if some members disappear or are killed by disaster (like fire). In addition, specialists who split off from the main group make better decisions regarding where to lay down trails, build nests, and recruit a workforce. And since many species use multiple generations of non-reproductive males and sometimes produce deuterogynous offspring during male-free periods, leaving room for specialist gender switches makes sense. It also opens up opportunities for hybridization between the two groups at certain times. So while J.J.'s team didn't set out looking specifically for hybrids, ""we found one,"" he says.",0,303
"In recent years, China has created an armada of huge ships that dredge up sand from the ocean floor. The largest of these ships can suck up 8,000 cubic yards (6,500m3) every hour and dump it along a beach. These vessels are so colossal that they dwarf some cities on land; one is as long as three football fields and tall enough to be seen in radar images circling Earth by satellites orbiting more than 22,000 miles away.... The use of sea-dredgers was not illegal before 2016 when new regulations were introduced after pressure from environmental groups including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund... In response, Beijing appears to have poured money into making its own fleet even bigger - with four times the capacity of older models."" China's aggressive efforts at island building shouldn't come as much surprise given what we know about Xi Jinping. He sees himself as Mao Zedong reborn and he wants all of his people to see him this way too: ""Xi told party officials during a meeting last month that their 'true character' should resemble those of great leaders such as Mao or Deng Xiaoping,"" according to Reuters. While I don't think Xi would go quite far as to draw comparisons between himself and Mao yet - he hasn't killed millions just for disagreeing with him like Mao did - it wouldn't take but few executions here and there to convince many Chinese citizens otherwise. As historian Stephen Kinzer noted recently, i]f you turn over any rock anywhere in Hong Kong today, you will find traces of the brutal suppression of dissent under Chairman Mao"" which continues to haunt modern day China to this very moment. So how does all this relate back to Taiwan? Well, if the CCP believes that no country other than itself represents true communism, then naturally it doesn't believe any external force can rightfully claim sovereignty over the islands off mainland China either. And since Xi seems dead set against dying anytime soon, perhaps eventually he'll decide invading Taiwan is worth giving up life among the living.",0,304

"IBM is acquiring Red Hat for 34 billion. Red Hat is an open source, enterprise software company best known distributing and supporting their enterprise version of Linux. IBM will pay a total of 190 per share in cash to acquire the remaining 60 it does not already own from The J.P. Morgan Funds, Inc., or its affiliates (the ""JPMorgan Joint Venture. The purchase price represents a 62 percent premium over Red Hat's closing stock price on October 26, 2018 - the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction between IBM and Red Hat. This represents a significant increase compared with the average rally post-deal announcement among all acquisition announcements made by large technology companies globally since 2010 as measured across US exchanges according to CB Insights data. In fact, this was one of the highest premiums paid during that period. However, IBM did much better than most: Their deal closed four days after announcing it; they also received only 6, rather than 10, deferred payments upfront like many deals do; and they bought out minority investors at full value versus typical discount rates given them when taking control (4-6). Also worth noting: They were able to close despite having competition in the bidding process - which shows how serious everyone else took the threat posed by Open Source software. So now we are going to see if this time around those lessons have been heeded because there could be more consolidation ahead.",0,306
"A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System (MADS) will be able to shut down a target's nervous system for an extended period of time or even kill if its power settings are increased enough. The most powerful version of the MADS would likely only work as far away from targets as 1km but it could also operate at very close range in order not to make collateral damage more difficult than necessary - especially when engaging enemy troops who might try to hide behind civilians due to fear of air strikes. Its maximum effective range depends upon factors such as how much energy can be converted into heat inside a human body rather than dissipated outside. Chinese newspapers have reported that some military researchers believe there may eventually exist versions capable of incapacitating someone with no lasting physical injury or death. Anti-personnel weapons which rely on similar effects as microwaves were first used during World War II after experiments revealed they caused intense headaches within 30 seconds of exposure, leading authorities to conclude these signals had reached ""the threshold level,"" indicating their potential lethality. But while Germany experimented extensively with directed high frequency beams including painful ones intended to stun soldiers before killing them, the Allies opted instead towards explosives when developing techniques concerning electronic warfare.",0,307

""Gaming has evolved from being just a hobby or pastime enjoyed by our community,"" Ryan Wyatt, Facebook's vice president of gaming partnerships told PCMag via email Tuesday (Aug. 18). ""Today we're seeing gaming communities play central roles during COVID-19 as millions turn to online games like Messenger Rooms to see friends virtually while staying connected.""

"M2cgen transpiles trained statistical models into Python, C, or Java. Users can supply M2cgen with a range of models (linear, SVM, tree, random forest, or boosting) and the tool will output pipelines in these languages that integrate training data from cloud-based computing systems like Amazon EC2 instances using TensorFlow 1.x. ""The primary benefit is more experimentation,"" said Samyak Narayanan, CEO at AI startup Khatabook, which uses M2cgen to run neural networks on its servers for customer fraud detection without having to hire deep learning experts. ""Without any or too little training, you get good results while deploying machine learning models."" In addition to being easy and fast enough to deploy by nontechnical users, M2cgen's ability to translate different types of models makes it particularly well suited for companies working across industries such as retail and ecommerce where they need to model features specific to each vertical, according to Shriya Reddy, head of platform engineering at Wishbone Digital, an agency focused solely on artificial intelligence projects. The company has used M2cgen successfully to train multiple types of classification algorithms - including convolutional neural network (CNN), structural equation modeling (SEM), decision trees, random forests, linear discriminative analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines - in parallel within minutes instead of days thanks to dedicated hardware acceleration via GPUs. M2cgen even allows end users to run prebuilt images through their own image processing software before feeding them back to the system after fine tuning (instructions are included). This enables customers to use existing libraries like OpenCV to speed up feature extraction when designing new computer vision applications. In healthcare settings this functionality could improve patient care delivery since clinicians would have access to high quality imaging shared between hospital departments rather than relying exclusively on what comes out of radiology machines. For example, if patients go to cardiology clinic with chest X-rays showing signs of pneumonia due to COVID-19 symptoms but the radiologists missed those clues because their computers don't come equipped with appropriate filters, doctors might be able to detect abnormalities based on digital signatures highlighted by tools built with M2cgen technology.",0,310

This February, they applied this technology to use it to read articles that you type into Google Translate and see what it produces - while keeping more or less everything intact! This is pretty exciting because until now, most models have been unable to understand written language at all; systems like GPT-2 are excellent at generating fake news headlines but don't really get essays or even comments online very well yet. And much work still needs to be done before computers ""understand"" anything close to native style conversations with humans, let alone mimicking how people actually speak and write outside their narrow domain expertise areas.

"Two centuries ago, it was established that the average human body temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius. Scientists have noticed a drop in average body temperature in more recent years: In 2018 and 2019 - for obvious reasons - researchers found lower temperatures than expected during this time of year (it's winter). Scientists think these changes could be related to how we're living our lives on Earth by causing us stress. But other factors might account for them too, such as global warming; warmer air holds less moisture which means you don't sweat at all when your skin is exposed to higher humidity levels. It can also take longer to get warm after being cold because there are fewer blood vessels near your skin surface so heat doesn't flow through quickly enough. And eating disorders like anorexia nervosa cause significant weight loss while restricting water intake due to limited fuel from food sources. This causes dehydration along with decreased sweating but slowed metabolism rates. Less fluid around your organs (and thus reduced blood volume) affects their ability to keep up with increased metabolic demands caused by exercise. As if that weren't already complicated enough!",0,319

"Solar panels emit infrared radiation at night. The photons going out into the night sky cool down the solar cell. This temperature difference can be used to generate electricity using a thermoelectric cooler, which is essentially an electric refrigerator that uses heat as its cooling source and generates electricity through this process: Thermoelectrics use energy from hot things (like the sun in our case) or cold things (like ice). They are very efficient at doing so because they convert high amounts of thermal energy over small distances - making them good for low-power electronics like sensors. A typical Peltier device will move 1 Watt per square meter. For comparison, a regular room air conditioner only moves about 0.1 Watts per square foot! Thermoelectric devices work well when there's enough temperature difference between two sides - but not if all surfaces get too close together...If one side gets too warm then it cancels out any benefit you're getting by moving extra heat away. So we need something on each end of these strips that is colder than the other. That would mean either adding another material with lots more surface area, such as metalized plastic film, or building some kind of insulation above your cells.""

"Four years ago in San Francisco, more than 700 engineers competed in a competition to build an AI system that could pass an 8th-grade test. 80,000 in prize money was offered by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) and Google Brain. The winning team included University of Washington students: The researchers built their machine using deep learning techniques similar to those employed by Facebook's DeepMind or Google, but focused on different types of questions from simple arithmetic problems through long reading passages - not just with words like ""the dog barked,"" but also such non sequiturs as ""A man walks down a street looking at roses; he picks one and gives it to his wife who says she prefers tulips. Why?"" Only when they were satisfied with the results did they begin asking about cats versus dogs. In teaching machines to learn patterns in written language, this kind of inductive approach may be superior because computers are better able to make inferences based upon incomplete information. Other commentators noted related developments last year including Microsoft's acquisition of Tay, which turned into something closer to malware after Twitter users trained her on racist jokes so quickly that Microsoft shuttered its service within 24 hours.

It is unclear how the two companies will use this new partnership, but it could mean that they'll soon be providing rideshare vehicles as well - not just taxi cabs or shuttles like in the past. The Transportation Security Administration has also announced its intention of purchasing 20 next generation full facial recognition X-ray machines at airports across the country over the course of the next few years with an estimated price tag of 1 billion dollars. The TSA currently employs 13 such systems: 10 full body scanners costing about 6,000 each, plus three backscatter units totaling nearly twice that amount. According to Brian Harrell (a former head of security and emergency preparedness at Los Angeles International Airport), these devices cost between 15 - 30 more than traditional metal detector wands because manufacturers can charge higher prices due to less competition. ""A lot of people are buying them,"" says Evan Selinger, director of privacy and civil liberties at the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.""We've certainly seen reports from some places where there was pushback."" He points specifically to San Francisco airport which received backlash after installing the first U.S.-based fully automated face scanner last month despite having no recorded cases of coronavirus infection To date, none of those complaints appear to have resulted in changes on either side however - the machine remains operational.

"Particle3D is a company that is pioneering a novel method for 3D printing lightweight, customized bone implants that fuse with the skeleton before slowly disappearing. While surgeons have been using metal plates and screws to repair injuries in bones like ACLs (anterior cruciate ligaments) or vertebrae since their inception decades ago, these devices are often large pieces of rigid material which can be difficult to fit into narrow spaces and require extra hardware to hold them together during healing because they don't integrate well with surrounding tissue structures. That's what makes this technology so promising - it could give patients an alternative option for orthopedic surgery without sacrificing precision and function. The startup has raised 1 million from notable investors including Y Combinator, Cowboy Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Ulu Ventures as part of its seed funding round led by Runa Capital back in 2018. Since then, Particle3D says it's developed multiple generations of products based on feedback given from doctors at Stanford University who were involved early-on research testing, allowing the firm time to perfect design features such as SmartFeedback Technology, increased strength stiffness via bioceramic composite materials while reducing weight, and more recently, integrating data analytics through partnerships made possible thanks to COVID-19 restrictions limiting travel between key partners around the world.",0,330

"Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans and animals naturally move in ways tailored to their environment, with limb movement adjusting automatically when changing ground conditions are encountered - whether traversing sand or snow. ""We want robots of all sizes to be able to quickly transition between different environments so they can traverse rough terrain such as rubble fields after an earthquake,"" said lead researcher Greg Kuperberg. ""Or climb up steep slopes using small crawlers like rovers on Mars."" To help them achieve this goal, researchers at Facebook's AI lab first trained two existing deep neural networks (known respectively as SORA and BERT) alongside one another to predict reinforcement learning actions corresponding to robot joint positions along each axis: forwardbackward, leftright and rotation about those axes. This lets motion planning occur entirely within these models without having to train additional algorithms specifically designed for particular terrains; instead, training data is used directly from previous motions performed on other surfaces. As part of the process, researchers also devised methods for testing how well simulated environments match reality by simulating physical interactions with objects in the space around the robot while recording its movements via high definition cameras.",0,332

"Our brain perceives what we see in 3D by processing and combining the images from both of our eyes. A new study shows that cuttlefish also perceive the world similarly. The research, published today (September 21) in Nature Communications, reveals how these sea creatures use a pair of neurons to create an image using two different perspectives simultaneously - a visual trick known as stereopsis. The discovery could help us understand this ability more deeply than ever before; it's been long thought that only humans can do so well because they developed large brains over millions of years for other purposes such as language. But now scientists have found out there are simpler ways through natural selection. ""It was quite unexpected,"" says coauthor Norbert Pongratz-Taubigk, head of the Department of Neurobiology at Friedrich Schiller University Jena (Germany). ""In fishes you don't expect them having complex eye structures with lenses like those seen in land mammals."" Cuttlefishes' vulnerability may actually be their strength. Because they evolve quickly and can adapt to changes rapidly due to environmental shifts, researchers think the ability allows them to find food sources better or escape predators faster when needed. The findings might even reveal clues about human evolution: Cuttlefish species diverged from one another around 250 million years ago during the Cambrian Explosion, which is considered to be when life began diversifying on Earth. To conduct the experiment, Pongratz-Taubik conducted some simple math calculations first. He then took advantage of a phenomenon called binocular rivalry, where the perception of objects depends largely upon your point of view. In his setup, he placed several transparent blocks into shallow water behind the aquarium tank while keeping part of each block visible above the surface. When viewing just one side alone, people generally detect darker areas as being darker but brighter ones as appearing bright. This means the left half will appear dark blue if viewed individually. However, switching sides causes many observers to suddenly reverse themselves binocular rivalry. They'll instead say the right half looks light blue despite being almost identical visually to its original appearance. With every round of switching between views, the fish would ""see"" something else entirely until either equilibrium reigned once again or someone flipped the switch back.",0,339

"CRISPRoff is a new gene-editing technology that can control gene expression while leaving the sequence of the DNA unchanged. Using CRISPRoff, scientists can silence the vast majority of genes without altering their location in the genome, which would be difficult and time consuming. In this way, researchers at Columbia Engineering have developed an efficient method for specifically silencing unwanted activity within specific parts of genomes - previously known as CRISPrion ""orphan sites"" with high specificity and accuracy. The results are published on February 15th in Nature Biotechnology (DOI: 10.1038nbt.4362). While CRISPR has revolutionized research into biomedical applications such as editing cell lines to cure genetic diseases, it also poses significant challenges due to its ability to change both large chunks or small segments of genetic material randomly throughout the whole genome during gene targeting. This randomness makes it impossible to target only certain regions where there may already exist mutations harmful to health. As a result, these random changes disrupt healthy functions by causing unintended consequences elsewhere in the cells' DNA sequences. While most of these side effects will not cause harm themselves since they do not affect the organism's phenotype, some might contribute to cancer formation when mutated from their normal function over many generations. To avoid mutating other aspects of cellular physiology besides those intended to be edited, CRISPR must discriminate inside each targeted site between what should stay intact versus what needs to be deleted. Also, unlike standard genomic engineering strategies that employ viruses injected directly into patients to introduce precise modifications into patient DNA, CRISPR requires multiple steps including injection through enzymes followed later by gene correction using Cas9 proteins expressed in bacteria. Consequently, efforts towards more direct CRISPR delivery methods like liposomes face much slower progress than viral vectors because of safety concerns about bacterial infection and limited efficacy since very few therapeutics enter cells via lipid carriers. Moreover, current systems still require multiple injections spread out across weeks before therapeutic benefits become evident. With all of its drawbacks, CRISPR remains one of our best options nonetheless until better technologies come along. ""Since we know so little about how human biology works, knowing exactly what genes interact and why becomes incredibly important,"" says Alan Aspuru-Guzik, PhD, professor of microbiology immunology and chemical and biological engineering in Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and co-leader of the study. ""We use CRISPR often but don't really understand whether, if silenced, does any part of your body actually suffer? How rare are these undesired phenotypes?"" He adds, ""In order to answer even simple questions about disease genetics, you need to figure out how to delete individual genes."" To address these issues head on, Drs. Aspuru-Guzik and Shoukhrat Mitalipov, PhD, professor in CUIMC who heads the Laboratory for Embryonic Cell Lineage Studies (LECLS), began looking into ways to improve upon existing CRISPR techniques. They set up an experiment consisting of relatively untapped CRISPR off targets called orphan sites found scattered around DNA strands near genes being targeteda process commonly used in molecular biology labs worldwide. The team utilized two different components to achieve CRISPOff. First, they combined the virus derived Cas12 protein acting as scissors capable of cutting cell DNA along with a guide RNA molecule directing Cas12 precisely to the desired region; then another component was added to block non-specific cleavage of nearby nucleotides. By combining these three elements together, they achieved precision cuts of single stranded DNAs. It worked well enough to begin applying it toward experiments pertaining to cell lineages grown outside of embryos. Their next challenge came down to efficiently deleting sections of DNA separately according to preselected criteria rather than indiscriminately attacking numerous areas simultaneously. For example, instead of just deleting every fourth base pair in a 1 kb section of DNA, the goal became finding selective tools designed to remove just four bases from 5 of the strand. Until now, no one had been able to find anything close to successively slicing away selected portions of damaged DNA strands anywhere else except perhaps in yeast lab strains modified genetically to express recombinant human RNase H1 enzyme. But here again, the team stumbled onto something surprising. Rather than searching for cleaving enzymes engineered to carefully cut their designated spots alone, they realized nearly identical ineffectiveness could arise simply by replacing several key amino acids embedded in molecules synthesizing catalytic domains inserted right beside the original site after design. Reminiscently culling inactive websites long ago identified officially dead ends online based solely on size limits alone turned out to represent remarkably similar principles applied to live organisms today! Since Nobel laureate David Baltimore suggested back in 1986 that finding active branches among web pages connected to a subject offering a search engine would amount to discovering the 'longest chain,' biologists everywhere adopted his idea rapidly realizing optimal single molecule solutions were essential particularly for biochemistry purposes. And although nobody knew the significance nor practicality behind identifying these inactive stretches until presentord260The G -,itsthe Socand Visualone campaigners City Poly NSNS Ole...

"Amazon is bringing 25,000 jobs with average salaries of 150,000 to Queens in New York City, but locals are protesting the 1.525 billion (48,000 per job) that Amazon is receiving as incentive for setting up shop there. The city will offer 325 million in tax credits and grants if it hits its hiring goals over 10 years; however, critics say this may be a bad deal since those 25,000 people would have likely been hired anyway by companies like Google or Apple were they not incentivized by taxpayers. The new headquarters doesn't just mean more workers - it also means an influx of tech-savvy consumers who could help boost local businesses through increased spending at restaurants and stores. However, some business owners already struggling due to rising rents now fear their customers won't come when all nearby parking lots are taken up by employees driving alongside them rather than walking on foot.",0,360
"Microsoft has agreed to make it easier for customers to independently repair its devices. As You Sow, an investor advocacy nonprofit, filed a shareholder resolution with the SEC in June urging Microsoft and other companies that manufacture hardware or software products ""to take reasonable steps"" to provide owners of their products access to parts needed to fix any damage or malfunctioning devices they own. In response, Microsoft will allow Windows 10 users to download spare part files directly from one place on its website by mid-2019 (which could be as soon as this month). Google's proposed solution involves extending legal protections against patent infringement claims when manufacturers use patents to license essential technology found within open source code - a practice called FRAND licensing. Google also proposes establishing industrywide standards around how companies should disclose whether their patented technologies are being used under fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms; these disclosures would help consumers evaluate which devices have received such licenses. The company is currently working with device makers like Samsung, Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., LG Electronics Inc., Apple, Cisco Systems Inc., HTC Corp., Intel Corporation, Lenovo Group Ltd., MediaTek Inc., Nokia Oyj, Philips N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Sony Mobile Communications AB, TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited, Tencent Holding Ltd., Xiaomi Corp., ZTE Corporation, and others to address smartphone fragmentation issues through changes that ensure Android phones work together across different carrier networks without loss of features or functionality.

"A team of scientists used high-energy X-rays to analyze ancient Egyptian papyri fragments and found lead compounds in both the red and black inks used. This is evidence that lead was mined there - and absorbed by the people who stamped it on their documents, they reported yesterday (Sept. 18) in the journal Antiquity. This finding ""shows how far back this use goes,"" said study co-author Thomas Boothby, a professor emeritus at Durham University N.H., as well as an expert on ancient Egypt's economy. The research shows just what kind of environmental health hazards ancient Egyptians faced from mining lead and using toxic ink for writing, not only during Pharaohs' day but also down through history until today, he told Live Science. [Photos: Painted Red Tombs Discovered] Lead poisoning has been associated with many terrible diseases throughout time; one good example would be Pompeii, where 1 out of every 4 skeletons studied had signs of heavy metal toxicity from eating foods containing lead, according to Craig Downs, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation, which supports preservation efforts around historic sites like Pompeii. Lead can cause brain damage or death if consumed regularly over long periods of time because it crosses into bones and teeth before other metals do, he added. And while Roman food recipes often called for adding tinned fish sauce made with lead flakes to improve taste, these ingredients were likely only eaten occasionally enough to prevent harm, rather than being ingested daily, Downs noted. In addition, the Romans didn't mine lead ore themselves, so they weren't subjecting themselves directly to inhaling fumes, which could have caused greater illness, he explained. However, researchers still think health issues may have contributed to Ancient Rome's decline. For instance, excavations show decay rates among human remains dropped off dramatically after about A.D. 300, suggesting malnutrition due largely to iron deficiency was killing some members of society, Downs said. It's possible such chronic illnesses prevented citizens from working hard enough to feed themselves adequately, leading them to leave cities to find work elsewhere, possibly contributing further to economic problems, he suggested. Then again, maybe nefarious agents were responsible instead, perhaps trying to weaken rival factions within society. These kinds of studies are ongoing. In contrast to modern times, when pollution levels tend to fluctuate seasonally based primarily upon energy demands, the Bronze Age was characterized by relatively stable air quality across most of Eurasia thanks to low population densities, archaeological data suggest. But conditions did change periodically, including in Egypt, where climate shifts sometimes prompted poor soil fertility, crop failures and famine, Boothby said. Some areas became particularly fertile under certain weather patterns, allowing large populations to grow wealthy even amidst drought, he said. Such periods tended coincide with particular pharaohs gaining power, too, suggesting cultural changes brought about prosperity once more, according to Boothby. He thinks similar events might explain why lead exposure popped up across the Mediterranean Basin all at once between 3,000 B.C.E. and 2,500 C.E. The discovery of lead mines near Alexandria suggests King Menes (3100-2700 B.C.E.) probably oversaw the opening of new facilities nearby, bringing wealth and stability for his subjects after years of instability along northern Africa's coast, Boothby said. Mining activities started picking up steam later, however, following the reign of Ramses II, the third king from the 12th dynasty known as one of the New Kingdom's greatest rulers. By then, copper deposits located farther inland were tapped first, leaving less need for men to go diving underwater to pull up gold and silver ingots via its accompanying silt, making local production much easier, Boothby added. To make handaxes and flints needed for metallurgy, workers simply ground rocks in riverbeds close to home, producing plenty of waste products rich in the newly discovered lead compound as traces of smelting residue. Workers living next door to permanent industrial operations potentially suffered severe consequences, especially since waterborne contamination eventually seeped into homes via groundwater, Boothby continued. People also ate crops grown right outside factories without proper washing procedures, meaning soils ended up tainted everywhere people settled, he said. As bronze weapons and armor were crafted locally alongside pottery jars and storage containers during various settlements, additional impacts ensued. All together, the effect of centuries worth of lead mining left behind widespread devastation that archaeologists want to understand better going forward. ""I hope we'll get funding to explore the bigger picture here."" Downssaid. ""Who knew? Even though I've worked in archaeology for 50 plus year sand never seen anything quite like this.""

"Many of Apple's employees have been fighting against the company's plans to require employees to work at least three days a week in the office. Employees were originally told to report back on July 1, but new guidance tells workers that dates are flexible as it is ""impossible"" for everyone to return by then because so many people need help with child care and other issues related to Covid-19. NBC News reported last month that some employees feel like they're being forced into unsafe working conditions after spending months working from home during the pandemic.

"Scientists at the Fermilab in Illinois have measured the mass of a subatomic particle called the W boson. The ultraprecise measurement found that the particle had a mass seven standard deviations away from an expected value, which is equal to 5.26 billion electron volts (GeV) or 105 times more precise than previously recorded measurements. Researchers hope this result will help them answer fundamental questions about physics like how matter has formed throughout the universe and whether there are other exotic particles beyond our understanding living within it too. But they faced some challenges along their way. ""Our laboratory achieved something we hadn't thought possible,"" said physicist David Jaffe who leads the Muon g-2 experiment, one part of what's known as the Large Hadron Collider beauty project (LHCb). ""We used two new techniques with different sensitivities - extremely accurate measurements of the electric charge distributions in muonic atoms allowed us to measure even smaller uncertainties."" Muons are the heavier cousin of electrons; each weighs 220 times greater, making for easier interaction once accelerated into beams by accelerators such as the LHC here on Earth. Researchers can use these heavy particles to explore the most energetic parts of space because they don't run out of energy until they reach energies far above those reached during previous experiments earlier last decade when scientists were able to discover the Higgs Boson. The team developed methods including using spin asymmetry - differences between left-handed and right-handed versions of the same particle - to determine its mass, taking advantage of information present without requiring any additional data collected after colliding protons together (this was also done before the discovery of the Higgses back around 2012), and analysis based upon the magnetic moment of the muon so researchers could improve measurement precision. Scientists say all three contributed equally towards achieving this record high level of accuracy. In addition to these efforts creating higher levels of sensitivity and better defining experimental uncertainty limits, the physicists introduced advanced analysis tools designed to take full advantage of the improved dataset produced through the upgraded detector system aboard the CMS collaboration's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment inside CERN's Large Hadron Collider accelerator facility near Geneva Switzerland. These included automating tasks involving sorting of millions of tracks containing billions of individual events detected every second across thousands of sensors positioned deep underground beneath the FrancoSwiss border where the collider resides.",0,367
"Barcelona-based startup Kreios Space plans to send satellites on very low Earth orbit (VLEO) missions. VLEO is a zone between 95 to 250 miles of altitude. Most satellites operate at an altitude around 1,000 mi. or higher where it's easier for them to remain in place and not get bumped out by other objects moving through space. The first two launches will be dedicated to developing new technologies that can help with future deployments. They include the development of guidance systems needed so they don't collide during their journey into space and also building miniaturized propulsion units called thrusters - which are essentially rockets that use electric power as fuel instead of chemical propellants like liquid oxygen or kerosene. These kinds of innovations have become increasingly important as SpaceX prepares to launch its Falcon 9 rocket later this year: The company has been flight testing nine SuperDraco engines made from 3D printed titanium alloy since January 2014; these mammoth engines could potentially replace traditional hydrazine-based engines used today on most commercial vehicles because of how efficient they would be.",0,368
"A new privacy-focused cryptocurrency has become popular recently, and not only because of its Harry Potter theme. Grin promises to create a cryptocurrency that is both 'light' and completely anonymous. The core difference between the currencies coming out today (and those in use for several years) are their block sizes: Bitcoin's blocks contain 1 MB worth of data while Ethereum can have up to 15 MB from time to time - this means more transactions per block as well as higher transaction fees and slower processing times. For cryptocurrencies like Grin that promise anonymity, they need much larger blocks than regular coins since every user needs an unique wallet address regardless if it belongs to them or someone else who just stole your private keys. However, these wallets still need some way to track users so there should be a limit on how many accounts you could open at once with one wallet which would mean smaller blocks again... unless we come across yet another solution! After all, what good is being able to send money anonymously when no account number can be associated? Now I know where CoinGeek gets the inspiration by naming their currency after such beloved characters as Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange and The Most Powerful Wizard In History himself: Charles Xavier Johnson III aka Charlie Lee (but his official name was changed). But let me get back into my story before getting too off topic here ... Grin got started around May 2018 but really gained traction towards JulyAugust 2019 thanks to a few key features including having a very strong codebase based upon MimbleWimble technology pioneered mainly by Beam and BitBean but also other crypto projects. Another factor pushing people over the edge were tweets posted by Litecoin creator Charlie Lee about his excitement regarding Grin becoming better than Monero even though GRIN had been conceived long prior to him publicly supporting it - he wasn't wrong either given that the coin went parabolic afterwards adding 13 within 24 hours alone during September 3rd through 4th last year, reaching highs near 60 USD until news came along shortly thereafter stating that Grin's developers decided against implementing the most important feature called Confidential Transactions due to speed concerns meaning high network traffic wouldn't allow enough confirmations in certain cases leading to lost funds by honest actors whose transfers failed due to lack of resources caused by malicious ones. This meant nobody using Grin would ever truly feel safe sending any amount anywhere without knowing exactly whom will receive it first; however at the same time making everything traceable combined with lightening fast confirmation meant miners weren't going to want anything to do with it anymore causing price drops to sub-6 levels but never below 5 despite rumors spreading online claiming otherwise. Today things aren't nearly as bad even though miner support remains low especially considering how ridiculously easy mining altcoins became following the boom in 2017 compared to now although early adopters certainly made bank selling their BTCs while everyone else took losses instead but don't worry trying to find a silver lining among the clouds since none exists except perhaps finding solace in learning something valuable from each experience learned whether positive or negative. And finally, the final reason why Grin is gaining popularity right now might actually surprise you. It seems the controversial Segwit2x hard fork ended turning sour for BCH proponents resulting in a split chain leaving behind two versions of ""Bitcoin"" trading under similar names e.g.: BTC vs BSV. While neither side tried taking down the others website (s), Twitter feeds nor Reddit pages, plenty did try attacking the original brand by jamming as many signs onto the handle creating thousands of alternative handles directing investors away from the real thing thereby driving prices lower further hampering adoption efforts ultimately cementing themselves firmly inside third place position trailing far behind ETH EOS but slightly ahead of Ripple. When Bitcoin Cash tries switching from a Proof Of Work algorithm to Adaptive Nodes next month followed by its own Lightning Network project later this year then maybe BCH will begin recovering from recent lows although nothing can guarantee success at present. It looks like trouble awaits us all sooner rather than later.",0,369

"Sperm counts in the West have dropped by 50 percent due to pesticides, plastics, and other chemicals. Chemicals used to make plastic soft and flexible, like phthalates, are endocrine disruptors that harm sperm quality. Iodine deficiency also plays a part: many people don't get enough iodine from their diet or iodized salt because they live far away from sea water sources; about 65 million Americans eat too much processed food containing iodized salts which inhibit thyroid function. Thyroid problems can lead directly to low testosterone levels - as do heavy metals such as aluminum and mercury (found in fish). Low Testosterone Levels Can Cause Premature Ejaculation Sexual Symptom Suppression Male infertility is generally defined as having fewer than 15m sperms per milliliter of semen when an average man has between 60-100m spermsml after 5 minutes' ejaculatory delay post intercourse. If you're experiencing any one of these symptoms more frequently than not lately, then it's likely your T level may be off balance ... and resultantly affecting everything else related to health we mentioned earlier! In fact, 1 out of 6 men experience premature ejaculation during sex most often. And while everyone needs variety and spontaneity in their lives with regards to sexual activity - if this issue becomes distressingly frequent without obvious physiological reason (s), there could potentially exist a hormonal root cause...beyond just poor performance anxiety. You might want to consider talking to your doctor for testing since low testicular size does correlate with lower hormone production rates. Testosterone supplementation alone hasn't been shown to significantly improve libido and penile erection strength compared with placebo in healthy older males under 70 years old.4 However, prescription HRT supplements ""may"" help restore normal erections and increase overall desire to engage sexually in approximately 80 of patients taking them according to research5 published back in 2018. It should however be noted that lab tests were only performed on 30 participants vs 200 healthier individuals who didn't receive Rx treatment at all. The data gleaned indicated no significant improvements beyond cessation versus those non-treated subjects! This confirms what I've written above regarding natural solutions working better over time than synthetic ones ... but certainly doesn't exclude medication entirely either. Anecdotally speaking? During my own personal experiences using bioidentical hormones over several months prior to switching gears into creating products specifically designed to address male aging issues called ZPE - I noticed similar effects in myself where difficultly achieving fullness was reduced greatly alongside increased penis sensitivity. So maybe it isn't so bad?! Be sure always consult a physician before starting any new supplement regimen especially now given COVID-19 concerns - although some doctors aren't able to provide adequate guidance anymore thanks to preventive shutdowns restrictions causing quarantine interruptions etc., making it even harder to diagnose certain conditions via face-to-face examinations rather than telemedicine sessions.

Mayor John Tory told reporters last week he hoped the partnership could help solve congestion issues plaguing his downtown core amid an influx of people moving back to the city post pandemic. ""We need to make sure we have good planning so that wherever possible we're getting rid of single occupancy vehicles except where they absolutely don't belong,"" Mr Tory explained.

"Russia plans to temporarily disconnect the entire country from the internet in an exercise designed to test the country's internet infrastructure in case of a cyber-war. The test is expected on August 7th and will last for 12 hours, according to RT Russia correspondent Maria Finoshina who was reporting live when several websites including Facebook were inaccessible Tuesday morning local time (August 6). Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his government to draft legislation that would allow them to cut off access to the Russian Internet during a state emergency or natural disaster as part of national security measures against hacking attacks. According to news reports: ""The measure comes after US intelligence agencies repeatedly accused Moscow of trying to influence the 2016 presidential election by spreading disinformation through social media."" While some experts have said this could be used as one more tool for censorship rather than protecting civil rights online since it appears so far the only purpose here seems targeted at preventing foreign interference in elections - thus still allowing the Kremlin to manipulate domestic opinion with its own propaganda machine which remains intact even under such circumstances. Currently there are no details about how exactly they plan to execute these plans but we'll keep you updated if any new information becomes available regarding what type of preparations the authorities may intend to make ahead of activating their Emergency Measures System.",0,388

"Light from stars tend to pulsate uniformly across the whole surface of a star. Astronomers have discovered a teardrop-shaped object that only pulses from one side. The star is about 5 more massive and 30 times brighter than our sun, but although it has an unusually high temperature for its size (5,000 degrees Kelvin), it does not appear to burn hydrogen or helium in a conventional way - possibly because part of its mass lies outside the nuclear core where fusion takes place.[8] The first supernova detected with radio telescopes occurred in 1987 when observations by Karl Gebhardt revealed what appeared at first sight to be two separate objects: ASASSN-15lh and ASASSN 15mgh (the mh suffix indicates ""magnetically highly interacting. These were actually one pair of very close stellar companions within 100 light years, which would become apparent as they merged into a supernovae: SN1987A. This event provided astronomers with conclusive evidence confirming Einstein's predictions made just over half a century earlier,[910] giving us a much better understanding of how such explosions occur during the final stages of planetary systems' evolution. Superblunder was another astronomical discovery made using VLBI techniques involving observation time on the Very Long Baseline Array; this new technique allowed detection and study of low frequency gravitational waves emitted from merging[11] colliding neutron stars. It also helped prove Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity correct under extreme conditions. In 2007, astronomers observed gamma rays being released from a black hole merger known as GW170809B, releasing ten thousand trillion kilojoules - enough energy to power all human civilization for 130 billion years. A similar signal was picked up again four months later in 2008 after an even larger explosion called GRB080319B resulted from material orbiting around a binary system before falling toward each other. On September 14-16, 2017, scientists observed the deaths of 2 neutron stars resulting in simultaneous bright flashes of light lasting less than two seconds each. Called gravitational wave events GW170814 and GW170608, these space phenomena are now considered standard tools for studying physics far beyond anything we can observe directly.[1213] In addition to the direct observational data obtained through observations of distant galaxies produced via deep optical imaging,[citation needed] several major surveys designed specifically to gather information related to dark matter are underway:[1]",0,391

"Researchers at MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. Electricity is made up of discrete particles, and it can flow with the viscosity or resistance to motion that you would find inside a liquid. But this study showed electrons moving as if they were very small atoms bouncing around 'This was an unbelievable surprise,' said coauthor Peter Debye, professor emeritus of physics at MIT 'It's almost like we found something new under the sun.' Electrons are now known not only as subatomic quarks but also as bound entities called hadrons. They move about freely within these particles when placed near one another like billiard balls. The researchers suggested there could be other types of crystal host that might give rise to high-viscosity current using different kinds of hadron, including perhaps some from nuclear reactions such as fusion, which occur in stars. Debyesaid he did see evidence of fluidlike behavior in certain areas where ions began to break out of their bonds. This suggests flowing electrical currents will play important roles far into the future of technology by allowing electrons to travel faster than light through materials. Pictured above: An image showing how electric fields propagate across crystalline samples of WTe2 The research team led by Chao Wang found that while placing atomic batteries-made of individual lithium ions suspended on copper electrodes -against two sheets of WTe 2, tiny ridges formed along grain boundaries between grains of material. These tiny features allowed them to induce deformation patterns, similar to those seen during plastic shrinkage caused by heating, much larger than expected. These instabilities created local regions of higher potential energy due to changes in ion concentration leading to acoustic waves propagating outward from the center toward the edges of the sample. In effect, the pattern resembled little bubbles forming then bursting, creating a series of ultrasonic ripples back towards themselves. Typically, sound takes longer than light to traverse distances, so soundwaves have been thought to reflect off surfaces before returning to their source. However, experiments show that as soon as vibrations begin traveling down the length of a piece of material (in this case a thin film), instead of reflecting away, they create further disturbances upon reaching opposing boundaries causing more oscillations. Researchers say this process resembles what happens in water after sonic pulses produce underwater fountains, a phenomenon generally referred to as cavitation. As described previously, scientists believe structures formed via cavitating phenomena may contribute significantly to improving device performance in applications ranging from hard drives to solar cells. Advertisement As each successive ridge grew closer together, its influence over neighboring ridges increased until finally aligning perfectly parallel against opposite sides giving rise to the huge scale effects exhibited throughout the whole volume. This state remained remarkably stable even though subjected both mechanically and electrically to rough handling. By contrast, traditional lithography techniques used to fabricate devices such as transistors require mechanical precision approaching the nanoscale level; furthermore, most conventional fabrication technologies introduce defects onto wafers reducing yield below acceptable levels required mass production. Likewise, existing methods for making large-scale arrays of micro-devices often suffer from poor reproducibility affecting reliability. Observing highly localized strain distributions induced by phonon excitations has enabled considerable progress in developing advanced optoelectronic systems utilizing structure-based control mechanisms afforded by atomistic spatial resolution imaging capabilities provided by scanning probe microscopy instruments such as STM. However, despite remarkable advances in structural engineering efforts aimed at achieving ultrahigh quality electronic properties comparable to bulk semiconductors, technological barriers remain preventing fully realizing the potential benefits offered by low dimensional homogeneous semiconductor heterostructures based on unit cell periodicity relations between constituent elements.",0,394
"Netflix unveiled a virtual streamer this week as the host of a weekly show on the company's YouTube channel. N-ko Mei Kurono is a sheep-human lifeform. Virtual YouTubers (Vtubers) are another popular form and there have been many viral sensations over recent years, including ones like Bunny Girl Senpai's HanaKana who recently started doing an anime news program called ""Anime News Network"" in English that has now become somewhat commonplace with other Vtubers around Japan putting out similar shows to cover new titles for their audiences. The Japanese eShop was also home to one such animated character named Gakkou Gurashi!, which actually folded its own streaming service into Square Enix's global distribution platform last year when it shut down sales after just 12 episodes were released because fans found too much content at once overwhelming compared to where they could catch up later if needed...

"A Belgian research group discovered a major security flaw in the keyless entry system of the Tesla Model X. The attack uses a device built from a Raspberry Pi computer and an antenna to capture signals emitted by the Key and unlock door remotely, even when they are inside the car away of their phone or laptop that manages access via Bluetooth or NFC. The manufacturer has already issued software updates for all models on which it is based since January 2017 (all except those produced before October 2016). However, if you have not bothered updating your vehicle because you don't think there was anything wrong with its security settings, we invite you first read this article: how can I hack into my neighbor's car? Then update immediately so as not to be exposed any more than necessary. Keyless Entry Systems: How do they work? It may seem strange at first glance but you probably never imagined what happens behind the scenes when you approach your electric car armed only with the electronic key associated with his mobile application. It does no longer matter whether he is nearby or far away; Your keys both emit radio waves directed towards him through the interaction between his devices such as cell phones, smartwatches or computers. In response, the car examines these electromagnetic frequencies within a given range until identifying one that corresponds precisely to yours. If ""matched,"" it sends back a confirmation signal requesting authorization to open the doors. And yes, once opened, nothing prevents anyone who approaches them, regardless of where they are located physically. One thing is certain: without physical contact neither the driver nor passenger knows about the presence of another person trying to enter the cabin. This situation creates several problems and risks for everyone involved (driver, passengers ...) both financially (car theft), practically (theft of personal data) or emotionally (intimidation attempts ...). For example, imagine driving over 100 km h along winding roads while knowing that someone else could take control of the wheel just moments later due to the fact that some external source managed to intercept the codes sent out wirelessly under normal conditions. Or imagine making love next to five strangers after having spent hours going around looking for places suitable enough to spend time together hands-free! How vulnerable is our Tesla against attacks like that reported today? Tesla's solution consists of introducing two additional components linked directly to each other. As soon as you get closer to your vehicle, small sensors placed near the trunk lock detect the proximity of objects thanks to technology similar to radar capable of detecting temperature differences. Once confirmed, transmissions begin keeping tabs wherever possible using multiple nodes distributed throughout the surrounding area instead of relying solely on receiving equipment. Information collected then takes precedence over information received indirectly from a single point rather than the latter generates new commands controlling motors, brakes or steering systems. Inside, receivers installed in most centers display screens also serve to trigger alarms or send alerts to owners or third parties around them upon sensing unusual situations. Unfortunately, none of this defense mechanisms prevent hackers from accessing online accounts used to configure service plans or order accessories if the profile password remains unchanged. Beyond that, depending on what type of base it belongs to (Model S or 3X), conversations can still continue through social networks or video calls recorded by front cameras.. Fortunately everything changes with the arrival of vehicles manufactured after November 2019 equipped with Full Self Driving Capability whose main difference compared to previous versions lies in being able to drive themselves completely autonomously, requiring little input from humans beyond ensuring that traffic laws were respected. These cars, therefore, will allow us to sleep during long journeys perfectly safe in the knowledge that others cannot come up to tempt fate despite advertising or advertising campaigns promising otherwise.",0,396

"El Salvador may become the world's first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The country recently partnered with digital wallet company Strike to build modern financial infrastructure using blockchain technology, which means El Salvador will be able to use its own currency in international trade and payments - including sending money internationally via Bitcoin (BTC). In a statement released on June 9th, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said: ""Bitcoin is not going to replace any coin or fiat currency, nor does it seek too."" Rather than replacing other currencies altogether, he believes that what makes cryptocurrency so attractive for him are several key attributes of cryptocurrencies such as decentralization, security, transparency, state-of-the art encryption techniques, among many others. His decision isn't without controversy; critics have called his move reckless considering how volatile crypto prices can sometimes get, but they also believe this shift could generate much needed economic development by incentivizing local businesses who might otherwise find foreign exchange difficult due to high fees charged by banks when transferring funds abroad. Coupled with remittance services like Western Union being expensive compared to peer-to-peer transactions over apps like TransferWise, there's been an increasing trend of people looking at alternative ways to send dollars back home from migrant workers overseas - making them more likely to opt into adopting BTC now instead of later. It should come as no surprise then why some suggest moving away from US Dollar dominance towards Latin American countries would benefit both sides involved.",0,407
"A fossilized dinosaur embryo preparing to hatch from its egg was discovered in southern China. It is one of the best-preserved dinosaur embryos ever found. The embryo's posture was similar to that seen on a modern bird, suggesting it had feathers and possibly used them for flight. In August 2019, an extremely rare fossil (left) of Pterosaurid pterodactylian eggs were unearthed by workers at Jizhong quarry near Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province. This extraordinary find suggests this species laid very few or no eggs - if any. Between December 2016 and January 2017, Chinese paleontologist Zhang Xing investigated fossils in the city of Longjing where he made two important discoveries: firstly, he uncovered baby turtles; secondly, bones belonging to three different dinosaurs, including ""the earliest known example"" of Sinosauropteryx, which lived during the late Jurassic period some 160 million years ago. Credit: Xiaoming WangZhang Xing New Atlas reports: These animals aren't yet part of our official list of birds because they're mostly based off other facts about their anatomy - such as wings or teeth - rather than DNA evidence. But new findings suggest these creatures may well be worthy additions... even though we haven't identified many specimens with enough DNA to make sure. And actually finding those additional specimens could prove troublesome given how fragmented parts of Asia are today thanks to human activity like farming or mining operations.""It has been quite difficult [to study Asian birds]. There isn't much data,"" says Martin Sander of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands, who led research published last year investigating possible links between avians' DNA sequences and geographical patterns across Eurasia. ""We have not done so badly compared with Europe but there certainly should be more taxa out there waiting to be described,"" he adds.For instance, previous studies suggested Southeast Asians might share genetic ties with Australian waterbirds, despite having never directly observed either group or comparing skeletal remains together. However, the researchers admit it's tricky trying to figure out whether distinct groups once coexisted here due simply to differences in environment over time.""The problem comes when people look for similarities between species separated millions of years apart without thinking what caused adaptation towards certain traits,"" explains University College London palaeobiological researcher David Martill In fact, several recent papers highlight similar problems identifying ancient biodiversity around both coasts of Africa. For instance, most African lineages can just about trace back to seven groups dating back 120m years ago - although at least eight existed before then.So far, however, nobody knows why those early lineage splits occurred exactly as they did. Recommended Fossil lizard sheds light on evolution Biology One possibility is natural selection acting across large distances and long periods of time, acting upon independent evolutionary pressures along land routes and sea lanes alike. Another posits nomadic hunter-gatherers moving into different areas hundreds of thousands of years later wiped out all but one particular group each generation until only one remained.This would mean existing samples contain fewer, less genetically diverse animal populations since everyone eventually died out except the indigenous survivors after interbreeding events failed to occur.Even the oldest surviving member of a newly defined genus, Nesiotornithes, seems to fit this model perfectly. Discovered by Hungarian scientists Viktor Labuda and Peter Molnar at Budapest Zoo 12 years ago, the strange reptile called Trimerorhachis hungaiensis shares features with living crocodiles as well as Tanystropheus leucasby being able to rotate its head 180 degrees while keeping its jaws closed. Based solely off anatomical comparisons alone - the specimen consists entirely of soft tissue preserved inside amber - the pair named it Nesioiornithidae.Now French palaeoartist Jean-Michel Mortet, working alongside fellow artist Eric Mickeler, modelled the skull structure using CT scans taken through a 3D printer according to their digital impressions. Their observations appeared recently in the journal Current Biology.When scanned again against actual fossils held in collections worldwide, the artists confirmed their view of Nesioironthids matched that of lab technicians, who previously concluded it belonged within the tyrannosaurine family tree.But perhaps strangest still? Those professionals hadn't realised it contained DNA.Using comparative genomics techniques borrowed from plant science, the duo managed to extract tiny sections of mitochondrial genomes hidden within small pieces of cartilage and connective tissues clinging onto patchy bits of the flesh.They noticed significant variations among all four members of the extinct group, stating further analysis was needed to determine whether Nesiopternicus is indeed unique unto itself or merely evolved independently from neighbouring forms already classed as separate genera.",0,408

However, most high-quality datasets have been proprietary until very recent years due primarily to concerns about intellectual property rights protection. This means that today we still do not know what the best papers were using these methods because there was no access to them. Nowadays this situation often changes when universities share freely available resources only during research competition periods since you can find almost everything online nowadays anyway; however, currently these competitions last less than two weeks so realistically nothing substantial would come up even if databases such as Kaggle exist where academics publish competitive scores. Free sharing of preprint materials helps and has already resulted into several significant breakthroughs like RoBERTa [9]. FastText [10], now available under an Apache license, uses annotated Twitter tweets along with transcripts to help train new algorithms for natural language understanding tasks. Similarly, among other things, semantic scholar collects publications across disciplines aimed towards improving knowledge discovery through textual analysis via large scale annotation efforts. However, sometimes people take advantage of leaks resulting in information being stolen and used unfairly. Recently, DeepMind published details regarding Demis Hassabis' genetic profile within the scientific community causing concern over privacy violations around personal health information. While biological markers may allow individuals who suffer from certain conditions to gain insight into treatment options based on similar profiles shared publicly (for example), revealing someone else's medical history without permission could potentially lead to harm. A possible solution might involve anonymizing sensitive biometric characteristics while retaining essential demographic features enabling others to compare themselves against those results.",0,409

On May 4th he tweeted: 'Reince Priebus should spend more time on balancing budgetpaying off debt less time on fighting Republican nominee.' The next day Trump took credit for getting John Kasich to dropout of Indiana which was actually all part of Reince Preibus' plan. Because as we know now, leaders don't need followers; they just follow their own plans! And then later when Ben Carson dropped out, Donald Trump attacked him by tweeting 'Ben Carson is soft on illegal immigrationcrime,' while also saying: ' (Trump has) always liked Ben Carson - good low energy guy!' He truly seems like someone who doesn't have any idea what side of issues and values will win at any moment because he lacks empathy or understanding towards other people's perspectives - something most CEOs value highly so much they hire consultants with different backgrounds than theirs whenever possible.",0,412

In total there were 38 different malicious implants designed specifically targeting iPhone models dating years back to 2013 produced by NSO Group. These include iOS 10 versions 11.2.5; 12b3; 13a4; 14; 17p1; 19w10e and others. But most notably, researchers found evidence suggesting attackers attempted to install surveillance software onto iPhones belonging to multiple members of the Saudi royal family. Researchers declined to name specific individuals targeted because doing so could reveal their identities. However, sources familiar with ongoing discussions say those affected included Prince Al Waleed bin Talal who has been detained since November 2017 after what he called false accusations relating to corruption allegations made against him and fellow businessmen Mohammed al Amoudi and Fahad Almubarak. He remains in custody awaiting trial. His cousin Prince Turki Bin Abdullah and nephew Saud Bin Nasser both died last year following long illnesses while languishing behind bars under various forms of detention without charge. Other people identified as having possibly been impacted include two sons of billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Citing anonymous United States intelligence officials briefed on the matter, Reuters reported late yesterday afternoon local time that senior royals living overseas may be involved as well. Before Apple patched the vulnerability exploited by Pegasus, one variant of NSO spyware managed to evade detection thanks to a recently introduced update to MobileSafari.

"CSS was never designed to be a server-side language, but that doesn't mean that it can't be used as one. This article walks through how to use CSS as a scripting medium and embed Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in JavaScript applications using the Prototype Library. Cascading style sheets have long been recognized by Web developers for their power to control look of pages on the web from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint. Originally developed with Netscape Navigator 3.0's new ""look"" feature, CSS has continually evolved over time into what is today known as cascading stylesheets or CSS. With this evolution came many changes including different ways CSS could work within a browser environment such as within img tags and even inline via script tag! You may not know it yet, but you are already writing some very powerful scripts...they just aren't written directly within your HTML code! These scripts live at various points throughout the DOM tree and they perform tasks much like those done inside compiled languages such as PHP and ASP.NET when processing data coming from forms and other input sources. Although most commonly associated as being held within client side Javascript libraries which rely heavily upon XMLHttpRequest methods, these same functions exist across every browser supported technology providing developers access beyond simple downloads, images and form submission; giving us boundless potential to do things we weren't previously able to accomplish - if only we knew about them...and now we do thanks to our friends down under in Australia who wrote up amazing articles covering all aspects of Scripting in IE 5 6. The following examples will introduce you to three new concepts: Using CSS features dynamically within script tag, Embedding custom scripting elements in IMG tags and Directly retrieving stored values within hidden inputs Using CSS Features Dynamically Within Script TagThe short answer? Yes, absolutely - there's nothing stopping you from doing so right out of the box. In fact, I've seen sites where people put everything inside block level DIV containers, then stuck JS written entirely outside any valid content area whatsoever... allowing users to override thousands of lines of styling simply because said user clicked on something else than ""view source"" while editing a page. Still, although possible technically speaking, I consider putting lots of code in an external file, then loading it site-wide rather silly. What would make more sense instead is storing your script information somewhere that makes it easier to searchfilter, manage version history etc., without having to worry whether someone changed existing styling rules after adding his own piece of functionality. As far as looking clean goes though - well let me assure you realtime minification kicks ass; Seriously tho', once you get good enough at line wrapping, indentation, namespacing etc. anything looks neat no matter how messy its structure might actually appear:). So here's my advice regarding coding standards and formatting: Use nested blocks (DIVs), each containing the relevant part (s) of your app logic defined using standard classesIDs assigned exclusively to them But don't force yourself too hard thinking that ALL js should always reside nicely contained behind clear BODY HEAD tags, otherwise chances are you won't really end up achieving optimal performance due to unnecessary redundancies Just keep in mind that unless it REALLY makes sense to place pieces of code inside markup for whatever reason (e.g. if it involves modifying style properties inherited off multiple parent nodes), try to avoid nesting deeper than two levels deep",0,419
"As one of the largest social networks, Facebook receives a massive amount of content from users all over the world. While Facebook has rules regarding the type of content that is allowed on its platform and what will result in your account being deleted or suspended for 24 hours, many other people have found ways to get around those restrictions by using certain computer programs known as proxy servers. These proxies allow you access websites that are normally blocked because they don't follow some sort of regulation (such as porn sites) while also allowing people to stay anonymous online when accessing these kinds of pages via public Wi-Fi connections at coffee shops, libraries, etc..",0,420
"A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies used a technique called fetal hippocampal-enriched culture to grow brain cells from infant mice and then observed what happened when these young adult brains reached adulthood; it was thought the growth of these neural stem cells would eventually shut down at some point after birth as part of normal maturation (around two years old). In this method, however, researchers could not actually observe whether or not new neurons formed because they weren't labeled with fluorescent proteins - so one might expect there simply wasn't any cell division taking place once the mouse grew up. As a result, most of those previous research papers haven't been able to be reproduced by other groups. In order for scientists to test if such processes continued into late puphood without interfering with existing development pathways via genetic manipulation, the team from Washington University School of Medicine developed a different way of growing nerve cells: embryos that didn't have a fully functional hippocampus (an area where much learning occurs) but did contain neural progenitor cells similar to ones found in adults' brains using CRISPR gene editing technologies. The embryo's developing nervous system is therefore closer resembling an adult human than ever before. ""We now know how the mammalian central nervous system evolves over time,"" says senior author Dr David Glanzman.""It doesn't happen all at once...and we can see why many earlier experiments failed to reproduce key features of later stages.""

"Redis 7.0 is now available. It adds almost 50 new commands and options. The most notable improvements are Redis Functions, AVLv2, command introspection, and Sharded PubSub.

In addition you can use sorting techniques from other data structures such as insertion sorts, merge sorts etc.. Don't worry about losing any data when you perform operations on keys which have already been removed; these will still return all their values before they were lost. To learn more see 'man 5 sort' . You can define named sets within your system tables so users don't need to know the internal structure of those default table types. For example if you want to store user properties alongside groups, separate them out with user set. See Note this feature currently only works with Java clients!

The device, which uses techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor industry for fabricating integrated circuits on silicon chips - but adapted to create digital circuitry inside neurons - could eventually be layered onto existing computer hardware to increase its power capacity while reducing overall size. This would allow computers to use small amounts of power more efficiently by handling some tasks themselves instead of sending them off to remote data centers, where they typically reside today.

And while each state has its version of a child passenger restraint law - which typically states children under 8 years old must ride in an approved child restraint system whenever possible, including during travel in private vehicles - there's not yet any federal law requiring manufacturers to install specific equipment on all models sold here. There is one more thing we'd like to see change about our nation's laws around carseats and other infantchild safety issues: We think states should automatically issue parent licenses if you want to drive your kid (s) anywhere outside your home without using those special harnesses people wear at amusement parks called carseat belts.

"Meta plans to release a high-end virtual reality headset later this year. Project Cambria will have specs similar to a Chromebook and will run a custom VR operating system based on Android, the company said in its blog post Tuesday morning. The new Meta 2 is still a prototype device that's not expected until 2018. But Google did partner with them to add Daydream support for their original Meta 1 model (which isn't available any longer). The 949 Meta Pro, which was also announced today, offers improved resolution over last year's version of the headset as well as eye tracking technology so it can read your gaze direction more accurately than ever before while you're wearing it. It'll ship next month starting at 1,149.",0,443
"While businesses are complaining about the shortage of workers, older job seekers are finding that even with the right qualifications for the job, they are being turned away due to age. ""I'm a very good candidate and I've never been unemployed,"" said Dallas resident Tina McCoy-Babbitt. ""With all these positions available now in my field, what is going on? Why don't companies want me?"" McCoy-Babbitt has worked as an accountant since she was 18 years old but recently found out her days may be numbered at work after 25 years because two other people have already left their jobs. She says not only did those employees leave without notice both were under 65 when leaving - but during interviews for others' open slots, managers told them no one over 50 would get hired. McCoy-Babbitt's age made it hard enough to land this position before COVID hit; then came more than a year of stay-at-home orders or working from home while juggling virtual learning for three children who attend school virtually full time. She feared if someone else quit, there wouldn't really be anyone qualified around anymore. As part of their hiring procedures, managers look into each applicant's background and educational history down to how long ago they took algebra class. Anything less than 20 years makes some employers pass a person up despite education levels sometimes exceeding GMAC requirements for certain roles like paralegals. Ad That doesn't sit well with Rosemary Eagan whose father died last month just months shy of his 90th birthday. He had trouble getting back into another line of work he loved too soon after losing retirement money invested through Merrill Lynch. It showed him once again that every day counts: you can lose your financial security overnight by investing poorly. That should send a warning sign to everyone thinking of passing up possible opportunities. At 60 years young, she worries most of her peers won't make choices that will keep themselves financially secure. Nowhere does America seem tougher than Texas where large numbers of seniors relocate here annually. But according to a report published earlier this week by Move.org, 13rd of senior citizens say they're concerned about retiring comfortably thanks to savings lost to pandemic shutdowns and rising prices. For low income families, especially minorities affected disproportionately throughout 2020, there seems little respite ahead unless red states embrace social programs which could help reverse decades of economic hardship felt by residents across racial lines locally and nationwide. Of course, we know our current president isn't helping matters much either.",0,444
"China's state-owned train developer CRRC has unveiled a magnetic levitation train that can reach speeds of up to 600 kph. It began development in 2016, with a successful trial run taking place earlier this year on the Beijing-Shanghai high speed railway line for the first time since it was reported last month by The Wall Street Journal. The maglev trains are designed and built exclusively for China by the world's largest rolling stock manufacturer by revenue, Shanghai Shendi Group, which is owned 51 by CSR Corp., parent company of CRRC. Maglev technology uses magnetism to keep vehicles suspended above track rails at very low friction levels when they travel through airless environments such as through vacuum tubes or without any contact between wheels and rail surface. Propelled by electromagnets placed along both sides of the tracks below the vehicle, the trains move more efficiently than conventional electric model trains because there is no transmission loss caused by resistance generated from multiple mechanical components like gears or axles found in traditional locomotives. Although these vehicles have been around for decades - Japan pioneered them back in 1964, while Germany had its own version called Transrapid (now known as TGV) that took passengers across France faster than jets used to fly before Concorde arrived into service - only now does one see an increasing number being tested for commercial use outside Japan. For example, there is talk about developing a 62 billion bullet train connecting New York City and Washington D.C.. Other countries including India also plan to build their versions soon; although some experts say most projects will take years longer compared to those already completed.",0,445

"Bemisia tabaci is a whitefly that acquired a gene from its plant host millions of years ago, allowing it to neutralize a toxin that some plants produce to defend against insects. The researchers found that the infected plant produces another type of protein in response - one which blocks toxic effects caused by bacteria and viruses normally present on leaves - and then sends this signal through long-range signaling molecules called RNA pol II transcription factors (TBP). These proteins are also involved with regulating stress responses at different points during infection. This likely helps prevent plant death when Bemisia tabaci gets into leaf tissue. The team was able to identify functional relationships among all these components for the first time using methods available only recently as part of modern genomic research techniques such as metagenomics. They now plan to explore how this system works further under field conditions where Bemisia tabaci can infect crops like tomatoes or potatoes. ""This work highlights the need to gather data about the impacts of pathogens beyond their direct targets,"" says Palmer. Next steps include understanding more fully what regulatory networks drive disease resistance mechanisms so they may be harnessed strategically across crops within seasons and between species.

"magniX, an Australian engineering firm, in a partnership with Harbour Air, a Canadian air-ferry service, has performed the first fully-electric commercial aircraft test flight. The 15-minute flight took place in Canada's Squamish Valley on Thursday morning (October 10). The aircraft is called ""Seaplane Ecoliner 1,000 and it was piloted by Richard Browning, who previously flew for NASA before starting his own company to develop electric airplanes that can take off vertically like helicopters but fly horizontally as regular planes once they reach their cruising altitude of around 2,500 feet (762 meters) above sea level,"" reports Popular Mechanics. ""According to Browning's company magniX, each Seaplane Ecolineer will use eight propellers manufactured from recycled plastic bottles.""Using one million bottles makes this project more than just another zero emissions aviation solution - we're changing the way plastics are made forever,' said Greg McDougall, CEO at magniX, about how he hopes the team's collaboration with Harbour Air could eventually help reduce waste created during production of traditional aircraft parts such as fuselages and tail sections.""For now though, the aeroplane itself looks very conventional: It seats up to nine people, there's no cockpit hatch or jet engine exposed within sight - just two rows of six windows underneath its solar panels. And if you were thinking all those batteries would make flying it noisy inside? You'd be mistaken; when plugged into shore power instead of supplemental lithium ion cells while docked, the plane only emits 'the hum of tiling fans spinning gently' according to the BBC'magical, quiet ride[...] as smooth as glass.Browning also told reporters after today's successful battery performance tests seem promising.

"Facebook and Ubisoft have reportedly signed a deal to release the next Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed games exclusively on the Oculus VR. Exclusive games are a major selling point of virtual reality, so it makes sense that Facebook would want to lock down these two franchises for its headset in an attempt to establish itself as a leader among full-featured headsets like the Vive or Rift. ""Ubisoft is developing new titles across multiple studios using this powerful platform,"" reads today's announcement. ""These existing IP will be enhanced by brand new experiences built specifically with social interactions at their heart."" The first game from Ubisoft under this partnership has already been announced: Eagle Flight (pictured above). It'll arrive later this year with support for both single player and multiplayer modes where you can compete against other players around the world. Ubisoft isn't sharing any details about how exactly these upcoming games might differ between platforms, but we did get some small hints during our interview with CEO Yves Guillemot back when he spoke out against Xbox One exclusive deals last month. ""We still believe exclusivity should not exist,"" said Guillemot. He also suggested that his company had no plans to make any more PCconsole ports moving forward because they don't take advantage of what each system offers. That sounds potentially relevant here too - will all future Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell releases shift away from traditional consoles? In case this wasn't enough confirmation, there was one final bit of information tucked inside the press release announcing Ubisoft's latest VR projects: The company says that the team behind Ghost Recon Wildlands helped develop Eagle Flight.

The update will bring greater transaction privacy through Schorr signatures, which will make simple transactions indistinguishable from multi-signature transactions. Taproot allows for a more efficient and private Bitcoin network in general by increasing the limits on signature aggregation (how many parties can sign off a single payment). The biggest concern among some developers is that it may not be possible to scale enough to include this functionality today without compromising user experience or sacrificing security of existing blocks; however, there are still ongoing discussions about how much additional overhead such an implementation would take up. So far only six BTC miners have signaled their intent to upgrade - but they account for over 70 of all hashrate so it seems likely other participants were waiting until actual code was available before making any pledges.

These insecticides have been widely used since World War II and remain one of the most popular classes on Earth because of their relative simplicity compared to some other types such as carbamates or chlorinated hydrocarbons. OPs target specific receptors inside cells - so-called cholinesterase inhibitors - that break down acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter for communication between nerve cells. The pesticides bind tightly enough to those receptors so no acetylcholine can get through, effectively shutting down motor neurons responsible for breathing muscles during sleep; therefore, suffocation results if you're exposed while sleeping. They also cause paralysis by blocking another key molecule involved in human movement: nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) channels in muscle tissue. This causes temporary weakness but doesn't kill brain cells like OPs do. Organophosphate-based pesticides were initially developed before modern understanding of how animals move, causing widespread concern about potential harm if people inhaled large amounts at once. But it turns out exposure over time may be just as deadly. A study published last year showed low levels of OP poisonings each day result in death within two years. And experiments with lab rats indicate long-term exposures often give rise to malformations and diseases including Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease.",0,481
"iRobot has announced today it's first autonomous lawnmower robot. Unlike other autonomous lawnmower robots which require a wire to be laid down to define the robot's boundaries, iRobot's lawnmower robot is able to sense its surroundings without using wires or laser grids for guidance. Instead of being limited by a strict grid pattern around your garden you can simply tell this robotic mower where not to go - and even how long each pass should last. The company says that it will then take care of all the hard work on it's own. It works with grass heights as low at 1cm while maintaining an average height anywhere between 0-2 inches (0.5 - 5 cm). In practice, we're talking about up to twice the efficiency when compared against similar competing models like those from Neato Robotics. The Roomba 980 features three Smart Mapping modes: Custom Mode allows users to draw custom lines that define off limits areas; Path Mode maps out preprogrammed paths; Genius Mow offers customized cutting patterns. Once set, the bot starts working until told otherwise: ""When finished cleaning, it returns to its base station automatically."" You'll need to replace the battery monthly if used daily but there are no tools required for service.",0,482

It hopes to have 42 of these farms around Europe within 10-15 years time if all goes well with this one!",0,483
"SpaceX stacked a Starship prototype rocket on top of a Super Heavy rocket booster for the first time on Friday morning at the company's facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Starship serial number 8 (SN8), which is currently being prepared to undergo testing, was lifted onto SN15 - SpaceX's most powerful vehicle yet. The pair stand roughly 39 feet tall together with an approximate combined weight exceeding 1 million pounds and used just one crane to lift them into place atop each other early Saturday morning local time. According to CEO Elon Musk, they will be ""moving soon"" from their current location as part of ongoing construction work around Starbase. Starship duo stacking pic.twitter.comrCcpKiL7d9March 5, 2021 See more Musk previously said that building the two massive vehicles simultaneously would allow both to move quickly through production if completed successfully. The last major milestone needed before its debut orbital flight test, according to Musk, is completing aerodynamic tests where it flies up straight like a missile without touching down while also performing a tethered hop. He added that this has been difficult due to poor weather conditions over South Texas during their previous attempts but could take place within days or weeks depending upon how things go next week when he expects good flying weather again. While some are excited about what appears to have become another important step toward reaching Mars along the way,, others remain skeptical regarding whether Falcon 9-like vertical landings can actually support life once we get there.

"GitHub Sponsors is a way for developers to get funding from sponsors. It is available to developers in 32 regions, but there is currently a waitlist. GitHub takes zero fees, and the revenue comes directly back to you if your program gets funded or not. Fees are set by companies that wish to sponsor projects on behalf of their productsservices. For example with Microsoft's Developer Division Sponsor fee structure (see below) they can select which language (s), region (s), etc., as well as how much money per month they want to spend supporting open source development for selected programming languages through sponsored programs. In exchange for sponsoring these types of efforts, corporations provide an array of benefits including visibility within the community via marketing tools like blog posts, social media campaigns, speaking engagements at events, webinars and more. This can also be leveraged into support for employee learning team building opportunities such as hackathons or company-wide technical challenges where employees use open source code to complete tasks together; all while receiving professional training in coding best practices along the process! If this sounds interesting please read my article about it here: In addition to providing sponsorship options, another benefit offered under Program Manager roles involves getting access to certain project management resources so as to better manage any grant proposals submitted. This includes timely delivery reports, status updates during review periods, being able to track what's happening across multiple repositories owned by individual contributors against metrics provided by organizations themselves besides just tracking changes over time associated with particular releases and branches, usage data around packages used throughout various applications sold commercially by said organization beyond just its own software licenses, bug reporting systems vs. issue tracker integration scenarios using JIRA Github Issues integrations versus Jenkins Pull Requests Integrations, and other common ones found in Open Source Software communities today. All things considered I would say many people do indeed find value in having someone else help them navigate the administrative aspects involved when dealing with grants because let's face it... No one really wants to learn new skills unless absolutely necessary especially given most companies tend to pay very little attention towards helping out their full stack engineers master technologies outside of what they're already doing day after day anyway.;)",0,486
"Jina is a fast, cloud-native neural search framework that can build deep learning-powered search apps in minutes. It supports all data types. Demos are available in the repository. I felt very excited when I first heard about Jina. The highlight of this project was its unique architecture - it has an easy-to-implement and high performance distributed model to run on each cluster node. This means you don't need any external dependency except for SparkML or MLlib libraries if some machine learning models exist locally. You only need to write one simple code, specify which resources (e.g., clusters) should be used and get started within seconds without worrying too much about how many servers there would be. There's no supervision tree required either as Jena does not require pipeline infrastructure like YARNKubernetes etc.. Therefore, making your life easier by automatically scaling up with more capacity based upon user demand (i.e., scale horizontally). In addition, since every server runs their own instance, they won't interfere with other services running concurrently while processing requests from clients. One downside though: While testing my demo app here at home, I found out that the latency between client requests sometimes took longer than 5s! Perhaps something goes wrong during local deployment? However, nothing similar happens after deploying into production environments so far... Let me know what kind of bottlenecks do you experience and maybe we could improve them together:) You might wonder why such issues occur even through using a single core processor with low cache. Well, just think back 2 years ago: We didn't expect deep learning frameworks to process large amounts of data efficiently across replicas because these tasks were supposed to be performed centrally; however, recent hardware enhancements have made multi-core processors possible along with massive memory bandwidth improvements via PCI Express 3.0 cards. So now everything looks different... And guess what, Google Search, Baidu Cloud AI, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, Facebook Messenger Chatbots and IBM Watson APIs also use tensor processing units (TPU), but mainly for training rather then inference stage due to higher cost per operation compared to CPU cores. Even NVIDIA V100 GPUs designed specifically for performing inferencing task still seem costly comparing to GPUs optimized for general purpose computing graphics workloads; although Nvidia TensorRT provides efficient distributed GPU acceleration solution over multiple nodes. That said, let us take another look at the Jina Architecture diagram: All components including the NLP engine itself are implemented in Java and Scala with JVM runtime support. As explained before, our goal isn't to provide perfect clustering service by simply distributing pre-trained engines to separate machines in order to reduce network round trip time and load balancing overhead introduced thereby. That may sound good initially until somebody needs to maintain additional masters behind the scenes where operators will update those engines manually whenever new features are added. But wait a minute!! If most of the processes resources are already defined inside engine class files themselves according to users' requirements, wouldn't it be great if everybody could easily customize things individually instead needing configuration options and parameters provided externally?? Nowadays, everything seems complicated enough so having standardized format makes sense especially when dealing with unstructured text resources requiring smooth parsing algorithms along with completely customizable output formatting rules following NLP standards set forth in W3C standardization efforts. Although Apache Mahout is often considered ""the de facto open source industry leader"" among Natural Language Processing systems, it doesn't offer robust validation checks unlike popular tools like FoundationDB. Besides, handling datasets exceeding several GB size and extracting knowledge from structured documents requires proper indexing and storage mechanism. Similar problems face companies developing custom solutions e.g., Lexalytics for law firms. These days building scalable enterprise applications rests mostly on DevOps practices involving continuous integration tests, automated deployments to staging environment followed by frequent rollbacks if needed. Servers usually operate 24x7 and keep track of time stamps so keeping consistency becomes crucial once the system contains stateful objects like databases whose datatypes vary widely depending on purpose e.g., JSON vs XML vs CSV formats supported internally at Netflix. Well, taking advantage of Spark's native support for streaming data pipelines combined alongside JINA's powerful query language called ASTQuery, QA engineers can perform full spectrum test cases against various processed versions of corpus given input schema describing sentence, document entity type (s), tokenizer settings plus optional labels specifying context relationships denoting subject verb object constraints guaranteed by corresponding grammar patterns. After executing complete sequence of actions prescribed above described workflow, we're able to retrieve correct results matching specified object names thanks to JINA extensibility feature containing default implementations for commonly occurring operations applicable throughout all plugins written exclusively in Scala. For example, without spending extra effort extending existing plugin implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm for CERL English Corpus representing Wikipedia articles released under GNU GPL license version 3.1, developers can create customized converter classes replacing previously provided base implementation showing improved accuracy levels reaching 100 precision rate.

"Tesla's 100MW Powerpack battery has provided South Australia with the same grid services as peaker plants, but cheaper, quicker, and with zero-emissions through its battery system. The energy system cost of renewables is rapidly dropping to a point that they can be good (if not great) at providing both base load power and peak demand management without any additional support from fossil fuels or nuclear generators. Why then are governments still spending up big on new baseload capacity when renewable technologies have already proven their ability to supply reliable clean electricity? Why build more gas generation than wind turbines in Germany for example if we know how much lower the costs will go by 2030 and beyond? A study published last month in Nature Climate Change outlines one reason why: these newly installed coal and natural gas projects aren't just being built because they're needed - some think they're actually ""strategic"" investments meant to prop up lagging industries even after those sectors become uneconomical due to market forces alone. This paper proves what many long suspected was happening; namely that there may well be an ideological element behind this recent wave of infrastructure investment into old school power sources like government subsidies rather than low carbon alternatives involving cleaner tech such as batteries. According to researchers writing about it: In our results, economic interest does not appear sufficient to explain all business decisions concerning resources development - specifically resource extraction and production activities associated with current technological change...We instead suggest that developing countries pursue strategic interests partly independent of economics within technology evolution processes driven largely by markets. Strategic actors seek rents above equilibrium levels generated by developments in key upstream capital goods required for exploiting mineral resources in order to benefit strategically important downstream industrial sectors [emphasis mine]. They also attempt to limit competition among national firms involved in economically significant value chains related to mining exports seeking access to critical inputs for efficient operation. In other words, policy makers could view specific types of resource exploitation strategies undertaken since 2000 as attempts to reinforce domestic industry against globalization pressures and ensure continued dependence upon imported components essential to competitiveness.[i] This research shows us another side of climate politics which most observers haven't considered before now. It suggests the need for active state intervention and planning regarding economies where ""market mechanisms would fail."" Such interventions might include heavy taxpayer funded incentives directed toward particular forms of industrial activity. As I noted previously though, the idea that oil companies rely on direct handouts while cutting government programs aimed at helping people achieve greater financial security seems odd given Big Oil's strong lobbying presence throughout Washington DC. But maybe that's why anti-lobbying advocates keep failing, despite years of trying! The truth lies somewhere between ideology and reality probably depending on who you ask. Just look at John Kerry recently; he claims to want bold action towards solving environmental problems using capitalism, yet his actions betray something else entirely - including massive funding going directly to offshore drilling platforms during his own tenure as Secretary Of State under Obama administration. If only politicians were less selfish and self serving perhaps things wouldn't seem quite so dysfunctional here in America today. We certainly do love seeing them squirm around looking guilty over nothing right??",0,488
"GAF Energy's Timberline Solar shingles can be installed by any roofer with a nail gun. They are weatherproof and can be walked on for roof maintenance. Other solar shingles require special tools to install them, which means you have less jobsite flexibility at installation time."" After the initial success of GAF Energy's product launch in 2017, GAF has continued its commitment to expanding its low-cost, durable photovoltaic (PV) solutions, launching several new products this year including two unique premium offerings - the SonnenBond and Zep Solar panels.

"Spotify Technology might be looking at acquiring Ringer, a sports and pop-culture startup. Ringer is involved in the podcast business, like the other four startups that Spotify bought in 2019. The Financial Times reported on Thursday (via Recode) that ""three people with knowledge of the talks"" said that Spotify has been negotiating to acquire Ringer for more than 200 million (US130m). The deal may close as soon as next week or it could fall through before then if negotiations break down over price. A representative from Spotify declined comment when contacted by Mashable about this story. When reached via email, an employee who answered questions only on behalf of CEO Jim Bankoff confirmed he was not allowed to speak publicly regarding potential acquisitions until they were formally closed but would provide no further information beyond what's already out there. Ringer appears focused primarily around its podcasts which include shows such as Bill Simmons' ESPN show called Peyton's Places; a popular one hosted by Kevin Durant called The ETCs; a new docuseries titled Slow Burn: Watergate where host Leon Neyfakh picks apart the scandalous events surrounding President Richard Nixon's presidency including interviews with key players; Crime Junkie which takes listeners deep inside true crime stories often involving serial killers; Hollywood Handbook which features comedian Sean Clements along side his friend Hayes Davenport talking about all things entertainment. There are also some original scripted titles produced by the company - Recount is described as being similar to Scandal except for real life instead of fiction while American Pickle follows Ben Stiller playing both himself and his grandfather trying to survive during World War II. Netflix recently picked up rights to several existing TV projects previously acquired by IACInterActiveCorp. which owns Ringer among many other properties across different media businesses. According to The New York Post, these series join others previously announced last year including Away starring Hilary Swank set within the confines of space exploration with Emma Greenwell and Josh Charles star alongside each other. In 2018, Hulu ordered 10 episodes based off the 2016 Jordan Peele film Get Out starring Daniel Kaluuya. It remains unclear how much money any of those ventures have brought back so far for IACInteractive Corp., formerly known as InterActiveCorp, because none of them appear available anywhere outside their respective streaming services aside from watching short clips on YouTube. Still, given the interest shown by companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Disney plus even News Corporation into getting bigger stakes in video content development you'd imagine having access to someone else's library of programming doesn't entirely hurt either party since licensing fees can help generate cash flow. As part of The New York Post report, sources told moderator James Andrew Miller that Ringer had signed deals worth hundreds of millions dollars prior to their sale although The Information reports that number closer to 500 million (350 million), though neither publication specifies whether they're speaking specifically about just audio programs or everything under their umbrella.",0,491

"A study on birth rates between 1950 to 2017 (across all countries) showed a crazy decline in birth rates from 4.7 children per woman in 1950 to 2.4 children per women today, which is the lowest level of fertility since records began over 100 years ago! However, this trend isn't unique just Western Europe or North America where declines have been large. In fact it has occurred across almost every country and region around the world; only three Asian nations - China, Japan South Korea - experienced increases during that period as well. This chart shows how changes varied by sub-region: Source: Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Survey Why are people having fewer kids? Unsurprisingly living standards and wealth have improved significantly over time so more money can be spent on raising their family without worrying about survival needs such getting food etc.. education also rose dramatically allowing parents to spend less one child while being able to send them off to school instead at an earlier age than previously possible, exactly like I did with my son who started kindergarten when he was 5 years old due to his sister starting before him thanks to higher levels of literacy (as you'd expect). Technology advancements mean everyone now holds jobs they never would've dreamed of holding even 20 years ago meaning many millennials don't need husbandswives working long hours away from home either now. And finally consumerism means we're spoilt for choice nowadays making us look longer term rather than instant gratification e.g buying property vs renting, saving into pensions or ISAs versus spending everything last month then begging your bank manager if there will be enough left next week... The list goes on but it ultimately boils down to our general standard of living improving drastically compared to what previous generations were used too. That said let me leave you with some stats showing why I think Britain should take note here: The average man born in 1980 had seven children whereas men born 70 years earlier in 1925 had 3 children each Women born in 1970s are expected to live until 84 whereas those born 50 years earlier lived up till 74 on average Those aged 65 represented 13 of the UK population back in 1996 yet now make 22. It won't stop growing anytime soon because life expectancy continues rising upwards and increasing numbers of elderly people continue replacing passing retirees. Remember nearly half of Brits already ageing baby boomers right now haven't reached retirement itself, according to ONS data published yesterday. Yet despite these factors above, British government policies create incentives to get married later therefore leading to lower marriage rates overall especially among younger cohorts i.e below 35 year olds. These charts show how marriage rate fell gradually after peaking way back in 1960s dropping another 10-15 percentage points just recently whereby couples aren't waiting any longer to tie knot. Meanwhile births tailed off similarly following roughly similar pattern albeit not quite reaching lows seen elsewhere given UK still enjoys relatively high birth rates relative to others stateside including US. There might still be hope though for restoring declining marriages scores going forward provided other policy makers focus on propping up families first initiatives surrounding housing affordability, universal childcare support schemes, proper parental pay rises AND increase pension contributions towards state benefits recipients' spouses e.g. widows whose late partner paid social security taxes throughout career through wage labor themselves. Allowing individuals to opt out of paying national insurance altogether wouldn't hurt either alongside offering equal inheritance rights regardless of gender. However, none of these reforms mentioned rely solely upon politicians alone to implement solutions. You see its clear low marital rates reflect wider societal trends common amongst young adults today, namely falling religious participation coupled with greater political apathy resulting in ever dwindling voter turnout rates particularly among 18 to 24 year olds wherever elections occur. Its no coincidence Britons made history winning most seats against incumbent parties, largely driven by youth votes nationwide nor why Scotland voted overwhelmingly Yes for independence referendum whilst England opted 48 No. So perhaps voting patterns could change based on changing demographics moving forwards assuming older generations die out quicker than anticipated giving space for new blood entering politics sooner rather than later. Afterall Brexit happened partly bc older voters thought democracy doesn't work anymore whereby 'they know best'. But please forget Jeremy Corbyn's disastrous campaign strategy ahead of recent election otherwise the same mistake may happen again. Instead listen carefully to populists promises whenever the day comes whatever party wins power thereafter whether Labour or Conservative, remain idealistic and dream big regarding future prospects together with implementing practical measures outlined above aimed at creating a better society both economically and socially speaking for ALL citizens of Great Britain irrespective of background, ethnicity or creed.

The aim here is to show how even small improvements can make a big difference when working dealing with large data volumes over long periods of time. Today I am going to be focusing specifically on memory usage because if used appropriately, it has the potential to save us lots of resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth but also many hours spent debugging issues caused due to low memory conditions.

"The Apple Store went down for just over an hour on Tuesday and came back with a brand-new look. The new design is filled with cards, similar to Apple's Store apps (Apple News, Books) or the recently redesigned Podcasts app that debuted in iOS 15 beta 5 last week. Evidence of this redesign was found buried within the code of macOS Monterey Beta 6 released earlier today by developer Steve Moser who dug into all of the changes listed inside of System Information to find out what else could change when macOS 11 Big Sur launches later this year. And as it turns out - the Mac App Store will be getting its own makeover before Public Beta testing kicks off later this month: Today's system info dump contains references to ""NewStoreIcon,"" which are usually used internally at Apple but also sometimes show up if you visit some sites like 9to5Mac. pic.twitter.comjxUQ3E1ddA - Steve Troughton-Smith (stroughtonsmith) June 22, 2021 When visiting the US store directly from Safari running version 14 of the web browser, one can see links to Featured, Collections, Categories, Search, Updates, Purchases, Today, Notifications, My Account, Sign Out, Help Center, About This Mac Mac mini, and Settings. As shown below in a screenshot taken using Chrome 71.0.3578.101, each page has been slightly modified compared to its current stable counterpart. As noted above, this discovery does not point towards any major overhaul coming soon; instead, these icons seem consistent enough across platforms without being too generic while still retaining their unique style.

"The results of a Phase 1 trial to study the effects of microdosing LSD have been published. Researchers were testing whether microdosing psychedelics could be useful as a therapeutic approach in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). READ MORE: How Much Does Psychedelic Therapy Cost? According to Scientific American, eight participants used psilocybin every two or three days over six weeks and five more took an inactive placebo instead for comparison purposes. Participants' symptoms before treatment started was measured using questionnaires that asked ""How well do you feel?"" and ""What is your quality of life like?."" They also had body scans taken before they began taking either the active drug solution or the placebo and again after about 15 minutes on each substance. After completing their period with psychedelic therapy research ended. The scientists then assessed how much improvement - if any - the patients experienced compared to what it would take without receiving therapy at all. As expected from previous studies, researchers found significant benefits associated with both groups during the first phase but no difference between them by week 6 - the end point for this particular experiment. In fact, there wasn't even enough data collected for statistical analysis until 12 weeks into the program! However, experts say these findings are promising because similar programs showed major improvements within just one session. ""It may seem difficult to believe that such low doses would produce clinically meaningful changes,"" lead author Scott Gagnon said.""But here we show that subjective ratings of PTSD symptom severity decreased significantly following therapy."" While past studies suggested that larger dosages can cause negative physical side effects including nausea, vomiting, heart rate increases and paranoia, dosage levels used in this latest study were not problematic. These smaller amounts might actually work better than large ones since participants reported feeling positive impacts almost immediately while only experiencing mild signs of change later on in the process. Of course, future trials will need to confirm those initial observations.",0,511
"The basking shark is an endangered species that feeds on zooplankton, tiny creatures found near the surface of the ocean. It was once common off the coast of western Europe.

"Companies such as Facebook and Google may soon be forced to inform customers individually on how much profit they gain from customer data. The proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight Act (or the DASHBOARD bill) would require companies that earn more than 25 million in annual revenue - which includes just about every tech company you can name, including Apple and Amazon - disclose what percentage of their total earnings come directly or indirectly from monetizing user information when making financial disclosures. ""The amount consumers pay for smartphones is going up while smartphone prices are falling, studies have shown, likely because manufacturers rely heavily on advertising dollars instead of charging a fair price based off components alone,"" said Senator Mark Warner who introduced this legislation along with Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal. ""This bipartisan proposal will ensure transparency by disclosing whether revenues are driven primarily through consumer device sales versus other sources.""

"Origin Space, a Chinese private space resources company, will launch a space mining robot in November. The small satellite will enter a 500-kilometer-altitude sun-synchronous orbit, where it will be testing its ability to mine asteroids for water and precious metals such as gold and platinum. The team at Origin says the mission could help establish an asteroid base that can make rocket fuel from materials mined on nearby celestial bodies, thereby enabling longer missions into deep space or even supporting human exploration of Mars. This is also one way in which NASA hopes to use Near Earth Objects (NEOs) - debris left behind by collisions between planets and large objects like comets - to support future crewed spacecraft beyond low earth orbit. ""We are launching our first commercial robotic sample return mission,"" said David Gump, CEO of Blue Marble Space Partners LLC., operator of Origin's U.S subsidiary, during a media briefing held Oct. 10, 2017. ""This represents yet another milestone towards establishing what I would consider 'the resource economy' around those near-Earth object, both manned and unmanned."" [NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission in Pictures] Asteroids provide many useful minerals besides water, including lithium and rare earth elements. Lithium has been touted as a key component of batteries used in smartphones because they don't rely solely on cobalt, which has been difficult to source since 2011 when most of Russia's supply was embargoed due to political tensions with the West. Rare earth elements (REE), meanwhile, have applications ranging from lasers to wind turbines. China controls approximately 95 percent of global REE production today, but demand outstrips current supplies despite strong international interest in using these elements more efficiently and sustainably than we currently do. Mining them directly from asteroids avoids having to transport tons of ore back to Earth through costly launches before refining the material here. Still, getting started takes money; without funding, this kind of research never gets off the ground. So far, the United States government doesn't appear to have any plans to invest taxpayer dollars in sending robots or people up to collect valuable extraterrestrial samples. That means commercial companies must pick up the slack if humanity wants us to be able to build rockets powered by renewable energy and explore other solar systems someday soon. And although there aren't too many companies working toward building hardware specifically designed to go after NEOs just now, public excitement about how best to harness clean resources found across the universe may spur some new investment down the line. As long as governments allow free markets to function in space, companies should find plenty of customers willing to invest in their wares once the technology becomes practical enough to operate reliably.

"This case study investigates how TikTok created a'fun and addictive' app. The setup can seem a bit tedious, with users having to select from different interests before being shown any content at all; but it's this curation that creates the ease of use required for such an application The first measures were taken on July 19th 2019 when [TikTok] made changes in its algorithm so videos tended towards recurrent themes or 'favorites'. This is where every video has a set pattern like: ""similar music"" - similar dance moves - similar facial expressions etcetera. So if you are interested only in lip-syncing performances, then your feed will be dominated by just those kinds of things."" As one anonymous source told Buzzfeed News, who spoke about working as a social media marketer on behalf of Tiktok between March 2018 - January 2020 As part of their investigation into what makes TikTok tick, researchers interviewed six teenagers involved in digital culture through both paid and unpaid work within companies including Facebook, Instagram and Amazon. They also conducted interviews separately with people closely associated with ByteDance Ltd., which owns TikTok.One key theme they found was how TikTok uses algorithms to create short clips featuring user generated content (UGC) alongside professionally produced material related to specific topics. These include well known TV shows, movie references, popular songs and other forms of viral entertainment such as memes linked to internet phenomena such as Fortnite, Drake and Harry Potter.The aim behind these curated feeds is twofold according to our interviewees. First, TikTok wants its platform to appeal not merely to children but to older teens too, beyond whom there may lie some riskier territory due to excessive alcohol consumption and unhealthy relationships.Second, because using UGC means no production costs need to be covered up front,, unlike traditional broadcasters such as CNN.In practice, this process works something like this: A person enters a topic heshe likes (e.g. animals), watches lots of relevant videos until 'discovering' more branded TikToks based around said interest (e.g.: pet food).Thereafter, further videos are served across multiple pages depending upon previous viewing patterns and interactions held during sessions solely dedicated to brand promotion..

"Using machine learning to analyze chest X-rays is difficult because the clinical labels required to train these algorithms are obtained through rule-based natural language processing or human annotation, both of which have limitations. For instance, Rule Based NLP (RBNL) systems rely on pre-defined knowledge such as medical journals that may not be relevant for a given patient. In addition, they require annotators who can provide comprehensive and explicit labeling information in order to work well; however, this demand cannot always be met by radiologists with busy workloads. Choosing between RBNL and Human Annotation Although many studies have demonstrated the potential performance advantages offered by deep neural networks compared to other methods [1-3], there still remains uncertainty about when each method should be used - one approach versus another? A recent study evaluating four different approaches based on three statistical metrics shows substantial differences across all techniques [4]. The authors concluded selecting one individual technique over the others would probably result in suboptimal results due to their combined strengths and weaknesses, suggesting an integrated solution was needed. This conclusion has been echoed by several researchers including Ho et al., who recommend using multiple interpretative methods together rather than focusing primarily on one method alone [5], although some believe that even more complex solutions will need to use only two interpreters instead of relying on hybrid deep learning models incorporating both humans and artificial intelligence, similar to what Scripps Research Institute is doing at its hospital centers [6]. However, while it seems likely that integration of an expert system into future AI systems will improve accuracy, we must first determine how reliable and accurate current systems actually are so providers know exactly where improvement efforts need to focus. At present, existing tools do little more than tell clinicians if something appears abnormal but leave them unsure whether any particular finding requires further investigation, leaving interpretation up to physicians whose expertise varies considerably from clinician to clinician. While we wait for that day when computers are truly capable of assisting us every step along our way toward diagnosis and treatment decisions, here's wishing you all Happy New Year!",0,532

"The gene-editing performed on Chinese twins in order to immunize them against HIV may have had unintended mutations. He Jiankui had targeted the CCR5 gene in twins Lulu and Nana , but it is unclear whether his changes were harmless or created new risks for their immune systems WHAT IS CRISPR? Crispr (or 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats is a tool which can be used to edit genomes by altering DNA sequences. It was first discovered almost two decades ago by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The technology has been hailed as'molecular scissors' that could'rewrite the code of life'. In 2012, the United Nations called for global regulation of genetic engineering after China's government said researchers might try to create genetically modified babies. But last year, Britain became the first country in the world regulate gene editing inside people when it approved the use of the pioneering technique to prevent deadly inherited diseases. Crispr works by targeting specific sections of DNA and cutting out precisely those parts, allowing scientists to cut out faulty genes, add new ones, or even swap pieces of DNA between different animals. By controlling where the cuts are made, it should be possible to remove unwanted traits - such as Huntington's disease - without causing problems elsewhere in the genome. Scientists say this will help us understand human genetics, treat diseases like cancer and Aids and develop entirely new organisms. Dr Kiran Musunuru, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how cells repair damaged DNA, told DailyMail.com: 'I'm not sure exactly what kind of concerns there would be about immunological effects.' He added he thought any potential harm from these edits wouldn't happen immediately because they occurred so early during development. But Dr David Liu, president of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, cautioned that while no long term safety issues appear to have arisen from previous experiments with embryonic stem cell research, it doesn't mean similar worries won't arise if germline therapies become more common. According to one scientist familiar with the work, the team did make attempts to minimize off target activity using another type of RNA known as ""guide RNAs"" to direct strands of Crispr protein into precise locations along chromosomes. While some preliminary evidence suggests this approach potentially helped reduce unintentional impacts, the source noted that additional testing needs to take place before widespread clinical implementation.",0,546
"Researchers from London have developed a deep neural network that can determine a person's emotional state by analyzing wireless signals. The technique involves sending radio signals towards targets and measuring the reflections, which are then processed to reveal basic characteristics of an individual's mood such as happiness or sadness. The researchers tested their system using 19 subjects who wore heart rate monitors while completing tasks on two separate occasions in Sydney, Australia. Subjects were instructed to either smile, frown, wince, grimace, make angry facial expressions or show no emotion at all for 1 minute intervals during each round. Each subject was observed through a one-way mirror with a video camera recording what they saw throughout this period. After processing machine learning algorithms learned about these patterns individually based on specific time periods over days before testing them together again so it could identify when people made similar behaviors simultaneously compared to earlier measurements taken on other individuals. These correlated responses between different individuals formed indicators of ""emotional contagion,"" where emotional states may be transferred among nearby people via social interactions something previously shown only within small groups (between 3-5) rather than large groups (30). According to coauthor Dr David Stillwell, ""Our results show evidence suggestive of moderate levels of external influence beyond 5 meters."" For example, someone smiling might cause another participant to do likewise; but not vice versa."" This is presumably because smiles tend to look more natural when we see others doing it first.",0,547
"The Planetary Society, an organization founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, is sending a small spacecraft to orbit the planet. Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite will use solar panels to gather energy from sunlight and propel itself through space using only the force of photons bouncing off its reflective sail (think Sailboat in the water). ""We're going into orbit around Mars with no fuel,"" said David Spencer, co-founder of The Planetary Society and CEO of Astro Digital LLC., one company involved in the project."" We are doing it purely on light pressure ... This represents how we can get low cost access to other planets that right now seems like science fiction but isn't really because here's our chance to do it."" LightSail 2 was built at Florida Tech's Space Park: Launch Complex 16 facility under contract for The Planetary Society. It will be launched aboard SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket - the most powerful launcher ever constructed. Once in orbit about 310 miles above Earth, this tiny CubeSat satellite will unfurl its 6 square meter sail made up of Mylar film coated with gold on each side to give it maximum reflectivity possible. In theory, once deployed correctly the craft could stay there indefinitely without any further propulsion. Once Solar Sails have been proven flying space projects may not always require big rockets or expensive launches systems - which means that future missions might become more accessible...although they would still require funding!",0,548
"Regular Expressions (regex) are a tool for manipulating strings. Regex can sometimes take an extremely long time to match or fail on some strings. This can be exploited by malicious users to exhaust the resources of your machine and cause it to crash, causing you system wide failure. To prevent this from happening, use regex as little possible in production code. Instead refer to Regular Expression Syntax Cheat Sheet while developing software that uses regular expressions. The cheat sheet identifies which characters have special meaning when performing string operations using regular expression syntax. By avoiding common pitfalls related to regular expressions, we will maintain high performance during normal operation and avoid exhausting our machines' limited resource supply.",0,549

"Google's DeepMind AI team has successfully trained its software to control a tokamak. Small reactors like tokamaks use software to monitor the state of the plasma they contain and respond with corrections, in order for them not only to become more stable but also operate at higher temperatures. This is called fusion energy production - the process by which atoms are fused together into heavier elements such as helium. Achieving this level of performance was considered impossible until now due to the massive amount of computer processing power needed (in 2015 it took 1,000 GPUs working simultaneously). The system used by Google takes just 32 processors; however, it does so using an algorithm that requires extensive knowledge of how each individual part operates within the reactor before fully synchronising with all parts on board. A key element of this learning journey involved custom-building a circuit simulator to enable accurate simulation environments where training could take place without requiring access to expensive hardware or running complex simulations over long periods of time. DeepMind's success represents another example of expert systems being applied outside their original domain. In recent years we have seen machine intelligence applications providing insights from satellite data, diagnosing cancer cells via MRI scans, analysing medical records while doctors focus on clinical care, performing superhuman feats in chess, Go and even DOTA 2 games and beating humans across many different types of game play. There is little doubt these successes will continue. However if you ask me I would say there still remains some work to be done when applying AI techniques towards achieving positive outcomes...",0,554
"Cows at the RusMoloko dairy farm near Moscow in Russia wear VR headsets to improve their conditions and to enable them to relax into producing more milk. Data from farms could be used by engineers to design improvements that would not otherwise have been possible Scientists are trying out a range of ways to help animals settle down on factory farms, including virtual reality goggles for cows which may reduce stress while helping farmers increase production. The new projects highlight how wearable technology is increasingly being used both inside and outside traditional agriculture as it becomes cheaper, easier to use and accessible via mobile phones or tablets. In one experiment, researchers found wearing 3D-printed glasses made 20 Holstein Friesian cows produce about 10 per cent extra milk over four months compared with those given regular feed without headsets. Another project has already begun testing whether sheep can get used to having sensors placed around their bodies so they know when someone approaches - useful if they need rest but still don't want to stop working. Russian scientists also hope to begin trials next year using VR gear to calm cattle before milking time. They say this might cut welfare costs because fewer cows will become unwell during extreme weather such as hot summers and cold winters. 'There's something mysterious going on there,' said lead researcher Igor Sizov of Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology who worked on the VR cow study published last month in the journal PLOS One. A farmer places electronic tags containing small computers (similar to those pictured) onto lambs as part of an ongoing research programme led by Oxford University Researchers filmed a field full of grazing cows wearing specialised headphones playing soothing sounds. Some were fitted with rectangles simulating eyes, ears and even lips moving in synchronisation with the music Dr Sizov believes the results show 'the potential of VR technologies for improving animal health'. He thinks it could eventually be applied to other livestock like pigs and poultry too. Russia is home to some 40 million cows raising fears its huge herds face growing risks due to climate change, especially after President Vladimir Putin warned recently against allowing global warming to pass beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. Sensory cues like sound and touch play vital roles in regulating fear among humans but only one scientific paper looks specifically at how these factors influence animal behaviour. The work involved domestic cats stressed while waiting to go through a door. Farmer Alexander Nikolsky raises his herd just south of Moscow where feeding practices continue unchanged since Soviet days despite warnings about rising greenhouse gas emissions. His 180 cows live apart in groups rather than pens while free access keeps them calmer and prevents mastitis infections, he says. Still, all get treated with antibiotics every two weeks to fight off infection. But several years ago Mr Nikolsky heard about Dr Sizov's experiments studying how domesticated bovines react to immersive environments. So far no evidence exists showing what cows experience inside VR helmets since many refuse to enter. But tests showed greater trust towards human handlers once interested enough to wander close up. One Russian scientist hopes to start trials next year using VR gear to calm cattle before milking time. Pictured: Grown man dressed as steers walk together on a stable yard Mr Nikolsky agreed to trial headgear anyway but had doubts before first test runs began 18 months ago involving 20 willing participants selected straight from local barns. A loudspeaker attached to each helmet played recordings from nature - wind blowing under trees to simulate fresh air, birdsong, water splashing in a pond. Some volunteers wore plastic replicas of horns while others got simple rectangles resembling faces. None received hands-on training beforehand but learned quickly thanks partly to constant feedback from visual and auditory stimulators telling them exactly how well they behaved and appeared to interact with unseen handlers watching remotely. For example, simulated facial expressions conveyed warmth - smiling, winking -or anger - frowning, squinting eyebrows -their counterparts did not look angry back. Realising smiles spurred friendliness, most udders filled faster. Others failed to register positive emotions resulting in less than half capacity, suggesting confidence declined significantly. Mr Nikolsky was stunned by initial results revealing 200 litres added daily versus 80 litre average produced by control batches kept away from headsets. He now uses holographic speakers instead of headphones fed directly into cows' ears projecting calming sounds linked with relaxation and increased milk yield. Cattle learning curve takes longer though, perhaps explaining why Russians lag behind western countries which rely heavily on VR devices. For instance, New Zealand expects US1 billion (800m) economic boost annually within three decades after investing 10million (8.2m).",0,555

Klaus Schwab also warned against underestimating how difficult post-Brexit negotiations will become under British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson had previously branded the negotiating process conducted by his predecessor Theresa May 'dreadful'. But speaking ahead of today's World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland, Mr Schwaub told Politico's Morning Trade podcast: By] saying these things now [Johnson can get] away with claiming credit next year.' He added: 'If you ask me what happens afterwards I don't know - but my guess is pretty brutal because Europe wants...to reunite.' However Franceso Chiavarini, director general of the OECD, was more downbeat regarding whether London might eventually change tack. Asked if he thought Brexit marked permanent break between the two sides, he replied simply: 'Yes.' Frans Timmermans, First Vice President of the Commission, insisted yesterday the bloc remained open to talking business even without formal ties. Speaking alongside Michel Barnier at last night's event in Zurich, he urged Britain not to take too long getting ready for No Deal arrangements. And he suggested any such problems should not stop Britons holidaying in other parts of the world following their exit from the single market. His remarks came despite reports suggesting many popular destinations outside Europe including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore do not allow Britons in quarantine due to fears of spreading Covid variants. Also attending last night's panel discussion was Guntram Wolff who leads influential economic research body Bruegel based in Brussels. In comments reported by Bloomberg News, Dr Wolff recommended looking towards Norway rather than Sweden as evidence of a successful model for close trading links alongside freedom of movement restrictions. 'With all possible respect to everyone else among the 27 countries...the most interesting case, perhaps the only example realistically of really good cohabitation across very significant differences, is actually Scandinavia,' he argued.

It has developed a drug candidate that can be injected into the ear to stimulate new growth, and it's testing this treatment for patients with sensorineural hearing loss due to otosclerosis (a disease of the middle ear). Frequency also plans on developing treatments targeting other forms of hearing loss caused by genetic mutations or diseases such as Meniere's syndrome and deafness following cochlear implantation surgery.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum wrote on Twitter that ""the private sector has been asked to implement the new timetable in October 2021."" He added: ""Workers have an entitlement to a decent life, with dignity."" While some Western governments had already experimented with four-day weeks at certain agencies and companies over recent years - including France, Spain and Japan - only now do we see it being adopted more widely as part of wider strategies for economic revival after COVID-19 lockdowns. In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern recently announced plans to move toward permanently expanding paid parental leave so parents can take up to 20 weeks off to care for their children without losing any income. Britain just introduced six months fully paid leave for both parents following maternity or paternity leave under one year old, while Germany offers 16 months parental leave (with two on half pay). Australia offers 18 weeks annual leave per parent plus 10 additional days if they spend time looking after sick relatives. These countries are showing us what government action looks like when its priority isn't corporate profits but people's wellbeing,"" Spira says. ""But this shouldn't need to come down to eitheror."" For many service workers who've lost jobs during lockdown closures across Europe, however, business leaders point out there simply aren't enough hours left in each week to accommodate such long holiday periods. Some European nations offer generous mandatory vacation time but don't force employers to provide extra holidays beyond those mandated minimums, notes Tim Morrissey, director general of IBEC International Business Education Council Ireland Ltd., which facilitates international trade within Irish businesses. Many U.S. states require employees get a set number of paid days off per year; others guarantee no less than five paid holidays. Employers may choose not to grant them further personal leaves because these employee benefits often add costs and complexities to employment contracts. On top of all that, he cautions against assuming a shorter working week necessarily means better quality family time.

"Cymbospondylus youngorum may have been the first giant animal that ever lived on Earth. The new type of ichthyosaur was discovered in the Augusta Mountains of Nevada with a skull about 20 inches long, according to an article published Wednesday (Dec 11) by Nature Communications. This means it would be one-third larger than any other known species from its ancient era - which is thought to date back more than 200 million years ago during the Late Triassic period. [Image Gallery: Biggest Beasts Ever] The researchers found fossils dating between 197 and 199 million years old along with dinosaur tracks made at this time that suggest there were several different types of large reptiles living alongside each other in these mountains around this same time span. These animals included leptoceratopsians like Protoceratops and hadrosaurs including Dakotaraptor. But after discovering all sorts of bones belonging to marine reptile Ichthyovenator morrisi, they noticed something strange among their specimens for their last analysis called ""Mt. Field gigantism"" or MFG. They knew right away what kind of creature could fit into such huge proportions as well as possible reasons why no similar creatures are currently walking the earth today. Ichthysaurus yunnanensis was described over 25 years ago but has never before been recognized as having derived traits associated with gigantism, making it unique amongst giant forms within classical ichthyosaurs, said lead author Gao Chen a professor at Capital Normal University's Institute of Geology who co-authored the paper. ""The most likely cause of gigantism is ecological factors,"" he told Live Science via email. In order to survive, early land vertebrates needed big bodies so they can compete with predatory dinosaurs and escape dino attacks. This need to pack extra size onto their skeletons makes them better suited towards surviving and adapting to environmental changes caused by mass extinctions compared to smaller organisms. For example, bigger body sizes mean longer lifespans because plant foods take up less energy per unit weight when eaten. Gigantism also meant better defense against predators since larger individuals tend not only weigh more than smaller ones, but occupy space too. Risk-taking behavior becomes easier for oversized individuals whose odds don't depend solely upon finding food sources while avoiding danger. ""If the mode of reproduction is oviparity then females lay more eggs due to higher fecundity rate."" (Oviparity refers to laying live babies instead of eggs). An increase in egg production could allow male gigants to spread across many areas without competing over mates. Giant herbivores like I. youngorum either took advantage of existing vegetation growth through grazing or ate plants that haven't yet adapted to life rooted firmly on dryland ground. Either way, grazers rely heavily on foliage rather than aquatic habitat close enough trees and shrubs wouldn't require swimming. Unlike modern day whales, gargantuan turtles, hippopotamuses and elephants, Jurassic Period sea creatures relied entirely on eating seaweed to sustain themselves. And unlike amphibious mammals that maintain both sets of lungs until adulthood, which allows adults to breathe underwater even if fully grown, air breathers used specialized tracheal sacs just beneath skin surface throughout embryonic development allowing oxygen exchange once gills stopped functioning. As we know now, evolution dictates survival based on how much stress various species experience given specific environments. Therefore, ecosystems supporting megafauna often possess greater biodiversity levels, which suggests these giants played important roles in maintaining overall eco systems. So where did these giant prehistoric beasts go?",0,562

"SAGA's LUNARK is a habitat designed to help people live on the lunar surface. It has a carbon fiber shell that is arranged in an origami format that allows it to be folded into (and out of) small boxes for easy transport and storage, according to its creators. The concept was imagined by architect Mattia Dessi from Studio Maisoneuve; interior designer Luca Benini from Claudio Silvestrin Design Office; space engineer Davide Castelvecchi from Space Centre Spazio Alpino del Vallo di Cadore at Milan Polytechnic University; aerospace engineer Andrea Migliorati from Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia ""Pantaleoni"" in Turin, Italy; and robotics expert Federico Vanni from Politecnico Di Milano - Universita' della Svizzera Italiana in Switzerland. The project received funding through ESA's Advanced Concepts Fund, with initial support provided by Intesa Sanpaolo Bank. Luna Park would have a pressurized volume about 3 feet high x 4 ft wide x 8 ft long made up primarily of inflatable structures: walls, floors, ceilings, etc., which could all be inflated using air extracted from Earth-based sources - perhaps solar power or wind turbines. There are also telescoping tubes inside this environment where astronauts can move around freely without being exposed to harmful radiation levels outside their habitats during missions. These tubes allow them to get fresh supplies when they need them as well as return to protected areas if temperatures get too hot or cold while exploring other parts of the moon base. Reusable robots could then carry these goods back to habitable spaces within Luna Park. In addition to providing shelter and shielding astronauts against dangerous cosmic rays, not much else needs to happen before launch because most of what lives there already exists here on Earth. Here's how NASA describes the system: A large central structure provides 'habitable rooms', including living quarters, work recreational facilities, sporting activities equipment and medical care modules. A series of multi-storeyed interconnected pods provide access between different parts of the building whilst maintaining total isolation, allowing crew members working at different tasks to remain separate but still connected via robotic maintenance units moving along internalised passages. Extraordinary terrace gardens, artificially illuminated at night, connect individual habitation zones overhanging the crater rim. Air recycled by plants filters down towards inhabitants below. A sheltered underground parking lot beneath houses vehicles such as rovers and stationary platforms used for scientific investigations across the extended site. An enormous artificial sun heats the entire installation year round thanks to sunlight captured both directly through canopy photovoltaic panels and indirectly via mirrors reflecting light onto adjacent areas. Water is collected and chemically treated locally, and stored until needed. This isn't likely any time soon - even though we've been aware of life beyond our planet since ancient times, no country has successfully launched anything past low earth orbit yet. But hey!

"Airseas' Seawing is a parafoil kite designed to attach to ships to reduce emissions on shipping trips by up to 20. It can be mounted onto the deck of any ship and will pull itself along at an average speed over 12 knots (20 kmh). The drones are powered via electric batteries, which need to recharge between flights - this could take 10 minutes depending upon how long they spend pulling their weight around after each trip. The team behind the design reckon it's more cost effective than current methods for cutting greenhouse gases such as installing scrubbers or using biofuel in engines. ""We're doing something that already exists,"" says PhD researcher Daniel Herrick from SAE Institute STEAM Lab where he has been working with Air Sea Systems designer Nick Osmond to develop the concept since 2015.""I'm not reinventing anything here; I've just made some changes so we get better performance out of these things.""",0,568

"Ford is releasing a comprehensive self-driving dataset to academics and researchers. The data was collected over a year and it comes from multiple self-driving vehicles. Ford is also sharing a video illustrating one of their autonomous cars in action, including the route taken by this car on its way home after work every day last summer. The database includes raw sensor readings as well as the processed stream that's fed into machine learning algorithms used for decision making - all annotated with explanations about what happened during each test drive. Researchers can use these datasets as training data or even adapt them directly without having to modify any code themselves. There are more than 300 million lines of computer code inside some modern AVs so just getting access to source code may not be possible unless automakers open up parts of their systems. Sharing an unedited vehicle model should allow academics much easier ways to study how different sensors are performing under real world conditions given weather changes like rainstorms and snowfall, traffic patterns such as stop lights at intersections, road signs, construction zones, and other potential challenges for automated driving solutions.",0,570
"Apple has extended its deadline for employees returning to the office because of the increase of Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant. The return to the offices was controversial , as Apple initially planned to send workers back on September 1st in a hybrid working model that would allow them flexibility about where they work from. It looks like this change will last at least another month with CNBC reporting today (via MacRumors) that Cupertino is now telling some staff members who were going to start heading into their brick and mortar workplaces next week to wait until October 25th instead. This might all be part of an effort by Chief Executive Tim Cook to further extend his company's policy when it comes to remote or flexible working arrangements - something which may coincide with rumors we heard earlier this year regarding plans for a major new campus being built somewhere outside Silicon Valley City limits ... As 9to5Mac noted over the weekend, there are conflicting reports across different media outlets concerning whether or not Apple really does intend to conduct formal site evaluations before making any decisions around building more than one headquarters away from its current home base in Cupertino, California. However, given the potential cost involved if Apple decides to build out two entire campuses rather than just move existing space, it seems likely many senior executives want to see what kind of options exist first, including considering second locations closer to where most people living within those regions actually live themselves without having to commute excessively long distances along high traffic routes every day. It'll definitely also help ensure security measures aren't overlooked during construction too, so you can understand why things don't happen overnight even though Apple operates under very big picture principles. As such, I'm not surprised Apple isn't rushing headlong toward decentralization right here and now either; however, depending upon how successful iPhone 13 sales turn out to have been later this fall after launching, perhaps 2022 could provide enough momentum behind the company's brand image problems to convince both shareholders and top level management team members overseeing business operations globally that relocating jobs should indeed become a priority sooner rather than later. We shall see! In the meantime, corporate income tax records published recently suggest Apple generated 50 billion less revenue through 2020 compared with 2019 despite record earnings figures overall dating back several years thanks largely to reduced spending related to travel restrictions put in place early last spring... Another thing worth keeping an eye open for between now and late 2021early 2022: If word gets passed down internally among decision makers that various strategic moves need to take precedence ahead of expansion efforts elsewhere, then shifting more functions ever further away from traditional centralized areas could well begin becoming a reality regardless of whatever else happens prior to 2023.

"GPS systems are unable to work underwater as water breaks down the radio waves GPS relies on to function. MIT scientists have developed a device called an underwater backscatter localization system that is capable of determining position under sea conditions, but it requires two separate teams: one with scuba gear and another in each boat using standard maritime radios for communication - which adds cost, time, and complexity and makes this technology impractical in most commercial applications today. ""We can't just take these same ideas from land and expect them to be applicable at sea because there's so much more going on,"" says James Clark, lead author of a paper describing the research and graduate student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. ""It takes such sophisticated engineering."" This new design overcomes those challenges by incorporating a customized version of commercially available off-the-shelf hardware into tiny modules connected via cables or wires. The signal processing modules are housed within waterproof enclosures made out of rubber and silicone, while base stations placed above the surface transmit signals used for navigation. When deployed onto floating buoys, satellites use satellite positioning data collected during previous flight missions alongside onboard inertial measurements taken directly through sensors mounted on board to calculate ship positions relative to other vessels moving nearby (or even stationary objects). Up to four different frames equipped with GPS receivers may also exchange information about their location with receiver units attached to each buoy, improving accuracy when ships approach close enough together. For now it only works if all pingers operating in the area communicate with each other; however, future versions could incorporate mesh networking to increase connectivity among devices without needing additional infrastructure like antennas. Clark envisions many possible uses including providing detailed 3D maps and realtime tracking of oil rigs and cargo ships for safety reasons, allowing mariners to avoid collisions or lost containers, or helping first responders coordinate rescue efforts after natural disasters. But he knows full well how hard translation will be between concepts tested in labs like his own and what actually happens in operational settings where an accident could cause significant damage or loss of life.

"A new finding suggests that the Ebola viruses behind a new outbreak in Guinea may have originated from a survivor who carried the virus for at least five years. The findings suggest that survivors could be a source of future outbreaks if they are not carefully monitored, two US health officials said on Friday. The virus has killed four people and infected nearly 30 others since it was discovered last month after an investigation into unusual deaths. About 590 people developed hemorrhagic fever symptoms during the 2013-2016 epidemic centered in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. It also spread to Nigeria and Senegal before being contained. At some point between 2015 and 2020, one person survived infection with another type of Ebola - Zaire ebolavirus (ZEEV) - long enough to pass along immunity by blood transfusion or sexual contact following which he went undetected until recently. This is according to scientific reports posted online ahead of peer review. Two other people died as a result of these infections but their cases were never confirmed using genetic sequencing technology available today compared to then. However, scientists do not rule out natural transmission because there hasn't been any sign yet of animal to human viral evolution associated with this strain. But given what we know about how much time passed within each case - between 2014 and 2019 in 2 instances and more than 1 year ago in the third instance - it's possible that all three individuals acquired their infections naturally."" Dr Celine Gounder, infectious diseases advisor to President Joe Biden's COVID response team told Reuters.

"The same CSS code can sometimes output different and unexpected results. CSS is a complex system and subtle differences can change how properties behave. This article looks at layout algorithms , browser inconsistencies in implementation of the rules that it enforces as well as some miscellaneous tips for improving your work with this language. Layout Algorithms And Their Usefulness? Are You Crazy?! As we all know now from reading this site's articles or even just looking around our favorite web sites (and being able to read their source), most websites are actually using fixed-width layouts like tables. The reason why you probably didn't notice any weirdness when visiting them was because they were designed by very smart people who knew what they wanted to achieve before writing a single line of JavaScript! However, if I asked you which type of content you would expect more often on, say an eCommerce website: big pictures, small text, or no visible columns? It might be either one but not both together - right!? That shows us there still remains room for improvement here despite it already working perfectly fine across many desktop browsers today. As far as mobile devices go though we haven't been completely lucky so let me show you something really quick... In order to better understand these problems, lets quickly review the standard flow of events in case you don't have time to do yet another design course: When user clicks Inside out box Box gets filled up Page scrolls down Content overflows User sees previously hidden whitespaceimage elements. On its own, those steps appear reasonable enough given everything else going on inside HTML5. To prevent such things happening however, WebKit developers implemented two additional stages into the flow of attention handler execution whenever certain conditions exist. These states refer back to visual observations related to scroll position, overflow status and screen width visibility respectively. By combining those factors along with other hard coded assumptions about the expected behavior during scrolling operations, Apple Safari 5 comes up with quite interesting conclusions concerning important aspects of screen management while executing script blocks containing inline style definitions. [Actions are assigned based upon variable state changes] Note: All actions described below take place within context div element. Here are examples demonstrating each problem: 1. What happens if a page contains a ""main"" image at top left corner of the window but later needs to include dropdown list boxes underneath it without losing resolution of main area? Shouldn't a pulldown menu always fill entire viewport instead of only partially overlapping existing images? 2. What should happen if our designers want to move background color slightly lower than rest of our application's interface allowing easier indication where buttons will look best placed? 3. If column headers turn transparent after reaching bottom and new ones need to display above current rows shouldn't old header items stay behind until new ones cover half their height again? 4. Is it possible to use paragraph formatting feature to align column header lines to exact pixel positions preventing gaps between them regardless of whether the table grows wider or narrower over the page lifetime? ...all questions that started making rounds among my colleagues ever since first release of iOS native applications supporting iPhoneiPad. Now keep in mind that every device has absolutely identical screens size so creating special solution for specific combination must be done in exactly opposite way compared to previous example: Instead of applying styles individually per row, put border radius values between 0 - 100 depending on desired alignment of cells. Notice also that for proper functioning it requires separate easing animations for each cell as shown below. Canvas formula used by default for rendering borders outlines. Each rectangle value corresponds to percentage difference of original cell size and final rendered version including effects applied above formulas. CSS3.row method works almost identically except that it takes into account padding space required by columns rather then requiring that extra amount of pixels outside actual tablet container itself. For correct calculation positive corners need to start inside outermost column from top and end at bottom edge. It means that currently available set of options doesn't help much unless combined with MakeBox function discussed next. We could improve result further adjusting value ranges accordingly. Also note that negative numbers come handy when attempting full control of overall typography ratio via absolute positioning provided by CSS3 media queries (see next section). Reproduced effect achieved manually simply by changing number sign in corresponding equation as needed. Variables defined inside this particular piece apply directly to appropriate containers so aren't reflected anywhere else. Finally note how all outlined issues mentioned earlier combine into demanding situation explained below: Let's assume our layout consists of six horizontally aligned parts placing equal emphasis onto proportionally named sections accessed through links called arrows coming off centerline evenly distributed throughout whole document (similarly positioned paragraphs with similar indentation) ....but wait!, suddenly we run out of normal horizontal spacing causing unwanted vertical orientation shift of all bullets icons indicating current progress level! Even worse scenario occurs moments later when scrolling stops altogether leaving everyone staring blankly at nothingness caused by lack of any meaningful information whatsoever contained inside the fixed-sized block representing map!

"Scientists have found a way to control the blood-brain barrier at a molecular level and open it up for a couple of hours at a time. The absence of a normally impermeable membrane barrier in one area is part of what causes brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis. The research team used genetically engineered viruses that infect human endothelial cells - which line all body organs including those in the central nervous system (CNS) - to spread across their surface proteins that regulate transport through the BBB. In mice with microglia in their brains whose immune systems had been suppressed so they could not clear away infected tissue by themselves, these ""BBB transporters"" were turned on when needed, allowing enough nutrients into the glial cells' mitochondria to boost production of energy molecules called ATP while also helping them fight infection and other threats from outside. This resulted in improved memory function compared to untreated animals. By contrast, virus injection alone led to severe inflammation without any increase in mitochondrial activity. There are many ways researchers can manipulate normal processes in order to understand how disease develops.""

"Public health officials have long been urging Americans to limit the consumption of red and processed meats due to its links with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Researchers have found that people who eat a lot of these types of foods are more likely to develop clogged arteries than those who steer clear of them entirely. But despite this evidence, many still continue eating meat in their diet because they believe it can be part of a healthy lifestyle - and one recent study even suggests cutting back on animal protein might not provide much benefit for overall cardiovascular risk reduction compared to increasing vegetable intake (though others disagree). So how do you know which sources or amounts of meat should go from your plate? Here's what experts say about where we draw the line when it comes to our diets: As Popular Science reports, some researchers think there may actually be no safe level of redprocessed meat consumption. In fact, three observational studies published last year showed that both high intakes as well low ones were associated with higher risks of death during follow-up periods ranging from 1 to 21 years.

"Iberospinus natarioi, a newly identified 8-meter-long predatory dinosaur, represents a new genus and species of spinosaurid, a group that includes the Spinosaurus. An analysis of the spinosaurid's jaws found that it likely fed on smaller dinosaurs like birds or small theropods such as Zannasuchus in its environment some 125 million years ago during the Cretaceous period (Maastrichtian stage) of what is now northern Morocco. ""The discovery of Natariosaurus forces us to rethink how we view this part of ancient Africa because previous fossils from there were not very informative,"" said study coauthor Francois Therrien de Saint-Andre, an associate curator at Canada's Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology and adjunct professor of anatomy evolution at McGill University. ""These facts will change our understanding about how African ecosystems developed over time."" [Photos: New Dinosaur Species Discovered] Discovery site. The fossil skull was discovered by amateur paleoartist Mohamed Ben Kaouak between 2003 and 2005 near Umm el Jebel, Morocco. It has been housed for 20 years with Moroccan palaeontologist Driss El Kaddouri inside his private collection before being transferred into the National History and Archaeological Collections Center under Moroccan state control.Credit: Mohamed SbihiMcGill University Morocco contains one of only three known regions where both birdlike theropod dinosaurs existed alongside large carnivorous predators - including tyrannosaurs, allosaurus and other sauropods. But until recently, spinosaurids have received little attention due to their lack of leg bones; they are often thought to be relatively unimportant relative to these other animals, even though they had four strong legs similar to those of monkeys or lizards, according to researchers who described the animal today (April 12) in the journal Scientific Reports. To learn more about early spinosaurids' place in North Africa, scientists compared recent discoveries made across Africa with specimens stored worldwide. These comparisons revealed several regional differences among the 167 spinosaurid skeletons examined so far, suggesting that different groups occupied distinct niches within African ecosystems throughout most of the Late Jurassic epoch, roughly 145 million to 180 million years ago. For example, while many African spinosaurids lived in swampy environments close to shorelines, others inhabited open grasslands farther inland. Early ceratopsians resembling Triceratops did exist in West, East and South Asia but much later than in Africa, marking another potential evolutionary separation point in history when things got lumped together elsewhere versus northward toward present-day Europe. Such findings suggest African fauna might have evolved differently from rest of Earth's continents, possibly due to climate changes caused by global warming millions of years earlier, experts say. Fossils were first unearthed in 1998 by professional palaeontologists working outside Casablanca, just south of the country's capital city Rabat. After excavation work halted in 2002 due to civil unrest in Casablanca, authorities ensured professionals continued extracting material elsewhere nearby without interfering with local amateurs digging up plants, which helped fuel research efforts ever since. Scientists focused mostly on identifying the dinosaur skulls collected by locals around the area's oases. Only after describing two possible spinosaurid taxons last year could ample resources finally go towards studying the full skeleton of Nataroosaurus natalensis uncovered near Azrou, 25 miles away from the original dig site. Once completed, formal scientific publication allowed them to identify the predator as belonging to a previously unknown family tree clade called ""Natariosauroidea."" ""This finding shows once again that important discoveries can still come from places people least expect,"" Thomas Holtz Jr., chairperson of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Board of Directors, wrote in a commentary accompanying the paper online.

Without tracking user interactions across several touchpoints throughout their journey using analytics software, marketers run the risk of wasting valuable opportunities to engage potential buyers through personalized messaging based on those consumer's particular journeys.[86] For example, let's say a company is selling its new sugar-free energy drink, and targeted consumers via social media ads for the product. Not only did an ad drive interest in the brand, but now the sales team needs to track web traffic and online orders that stem directly from social media exposure to determine ROI. Marketing automation tracks all leads from initial impression to purchase and can correlate individual marketing activities to generate overall return on investment.

Affiliate networks operate much like referral programs, except that instead of receiving a set percentage of revenue made off of referred sales, affiliates receive a fixed fee per sale. Affiliates are expected to promote the seller's products in an appealing way that attracts visitors who might become future buyers. Many affiliate network marketers report that commissions can reach up to 40 percent or higher. It depends upon the network. ClickBank, one of the largest affiliate networks offer Pay Per Sale, where affiliates earn a commission fee on every sale generated from their promoted links. Commissions range between 10-75. Once a sale is made, payment is immediately processed. Overall, Amazon offers some great opportunities for making money online as an affiliate.

"Match Group, the company that owns Tinder, has become the latest high-profile software maker to ditch the Play Store and instead use its own payment systems. Last year, Epic Games made a similar move; following Apple's decision to force Fortnite off of iOS (and onto Android), Epic used Google as little more than an intermediary between itself and paying users until it was able to get back into the App Store in late 2020 with its new payment system. As for Match Group? The company says this change won't impact what you see on your device at all - only how much money goes right from one bank account or credit card number directly to another through Tap Pay (which is essentially just using an NFC reader).

Phantom was started in 2008 as Ramos saw a need to develop secure communication tools for people like journalists and human rights workers who were worried about their privacy being invaded by governments or employers. But authorities say they used it themselves first, targeting Mexican drug cartels and eventually eluding law enforcement's attempts to shut them down through tactics such as a switch from VoIP calling - which is supposed to be free of charge over phone lines but not encrypted services like FaceTime and WhatsApp - to standard voice calls. According to court papers, ""Phantom Secure continued to obtain users primarily via word-of-mouth marketing ... with minimal advertising on any traditional media source including radio, television, print, billboards etc., because (Ramos) believed publicizing his product would render it less valuable due to increased competition between providers.""",0,607

"Zoom has bought security start-up Keybase, which will allow it to implement end-to-end encryption in its meetings. Users will not be able to call into encrypted meetings via phone, and must access the meeting by sending an invitation link or using a personal URL that won't reveal their IP address The video conferencing app Zoom had become so popular during lockdown because of restrictions on activities such as going out for dinner with friends - but also privacy concerns about how much data is collected from users. But now those are being addressed after Zoom announced plans this week to offer 'end-to-end' encryption across all free and paid accounts, meaning only participants can see each others' faces when they're chatting through mobile devices or computers. It's already been doing trials since October 2019 where some calls were fully protected while other ones used less sophisticated methods. But these changes should happen globally before April 30th 2020 at the latest. Video calling apps like WhatsApp have always offered end-to-encryption (E2EE) making them secure enough to talk securely with your family without worries someone could listen in. This means no one else except you and whoever you send messages to can read what gets sent between phones running the messaging service. It works great if both parties use it correctly. However, unlike chat services like iMessage and Facebook Messenger E2EE isn't available over most social media sites or email providers - including Twitter, Google Hangouts and Skype. However, there was good news earlier today: The company said Wednesday morning it would begin rolling out support sometime later this year. WhatsApp uses message scrambling text called Signal Protocol, based off open standards created by the National Security Agency (NSA), according to Wired. How exactly does Signal work? That's complicated too - here's what happens behind the scenes to make sure nobody reads your chats. HOW ZOOM WILL OFFER END TO ENCRYPTION In May last year, Apple revealed new features coming to FaceTime that included ways to blur images and hide your number to try and improve user safety. Now Zoom says it hopes to bring similar tools to regular web and desktop clients. First up, the firm intends to launch a new design interface known as Privacy Settings UI 2.0 which allows users to control who can join a videoconference, change screen sharing permissions more easily, restrict file transfers and prevent screenshots saved by other attendees. Like many companies impacted by coronavirus, Zoom has struggled to deal with massive demand caused by lockdowns around the world with millions working remotely. The platform hit the headlines recently due to numerous glitches, hackers invading conferences and Zoombombers disrupting online sessions with offensive content. Amidst criticism, CEO Eric S Yuan promised to add end to ended encryption to the platform by default and outlined several steps he claimed his team took to strengthen privacy controls. To qualify for full E2EE, communication software needs a public key infrastructure certificate from Verisign, which checks every digital communications session against a database of certificates approved by national governments. All major forms of video communication do currently employ something akin to this system however the scale of Zoom's network makes things trickier still. Currently, Zoom offers an option to enable password protection for specific groups within its iOS app; Android users get only the ability to create locked rooms. Advertisement But even though Whatsapp is believed to store transcripts older than 24 hours for backup purposes, any information gathered cannot be accessed unless the person specifically shares it with another party themselves. And iPhone owners may never know whether their smartphones effectively record audio whenever they receive an incoming voice or video call, thanks to hidden settings buried deep inside the iOS operating system. This means that anyone listening in on sensitive conversations could potentially capture private moments involving bank details for example. To turn off the feature, simply head to the device's Control Centre, click on the small icon labelled Phone under Display Brightness. Then tap on the three dots next to Voice Memos Turn Off Audio Recording. For Android owners follow the same instructions, instead selecting Screen Recordings (under Developer Options). If you want to stop people recording either conversation then edit the contact in question to block them completely rather than just turning off auto recording. Doing this prevents you from receiving notifications when they attempt to contact you again until you remove them entirely.",0,611
"Mark Zuckerberg today released a 3200-word statement saying that encryption will be one of the keys to Facebook's future. He announced plans to shift the company's messaging platforms to be based on end-to-end encryption, which would make it impossible for even him or law enforcement agencies like the FBI and CIA to see what people are posting online - not just from private messages but also photos posted in public groups, video streamed via Messenger Rooms (similar to Zoom), audio calls made through WhatsApp, videos shared publicly etc. The move is likely going to attract criticism from governments around the world who fear losing access to user data, as well as privacy advocates worried about security risks if unencrypted information can't easily be intercepted by hackers too. But this could turn out to be good news for startups looking to build alternative alternatives to social media giants with different business models focused more on protecting their users' security than maximizing revenue streams. The new rules will most affect Instagram and Whatsapp first given they already have much larger audiences compared to other properties at Facebook. However, we expect similar changes across all apps eventually over time. In his post, Mark said he understands there may ""concerns"" with these moves: I know many people disagree,"" wrote Mr. Zuckerberg. ""As I've thought more deeply about this, I agree with those who say giving government a way to get into systems and services...would weaken them substantially."" He explained why doing nothing was still far worse option: While these companies won't share content directly with us, having the capability to do so means others might try to use our services in ways we wouldn't want. And weakening encryption would harm everyone's safety by making it harder for police to solve crimes and stop terrorists - while threatening freedom of speech and expression."" He pointed towards Apple CEO Tim Cook recently stating ""there comes a point when you need to say 'enough after explaining how encrypted devices protect hundreds of thousands of children against predators every year; however, Apple has faced allegations of hypocrisy because its iMessage platform cannot currently offer full device lockdowns ensuring only approved contacts gain entry while allowing anyone else to read everything sent privately within an individual chat thread. This issue came back up last week amid reports revealing criminals were using Telegram instant messenger service to coordinate child exploitation rings. Such tools often allow offenders behind such networks to contact potential victims without fear of being reported to authorities since they're operating under pseudonyms rather than real names linked to mobile phone numbers. By contrast, parents whose kids join internet groups aimed at sharing images depicting sexual abuse risk getting caught themselves due to lack of proper controls offered by app providers. That failure left some 20 million Americans vulnerable to predatory behavior carried out during Covid-19 pandemic alone according to estimates published earlier this month. Facebook hopes introducing wider scope for secure communications will help prevent further tragedies happening again soon. We believe focusing solely on profits leaves tech giant open to accusations of prioritizing corporate interests ahead of consumer welfare. While the primary goal here should always be improving customers experience, businesses must remember that trust between consumers and corporations is vital ingredient for long term success. For example, customer satisfaction rates improved significantly once Amazon introduced two factor authentication process whereby each login requires both passwordusername combination along with separate second code generated by application installed on smartphone belonging to logged-in account owner.

"All art establishments are concerned with the degradation of paintings. Harmful factors such as sunlight, moisture, and certain volatile organic compounds can accelerate degradation. Graphene may be the solution to this problem because it is extremely resistant against water vapor (due to its high surface energy) and light while also being a very good conductor for electricity; meaning that graphene could act like an electrical insulator between electrically conductive elements in materials used in pictures on canvas or paper. ""Grapheme-coated papers have been shown to improve resistance to UV radiation,"" says Yao-Jia Pan, PhD student at Rice University's Sweeny Department of Chemical Engineering. ""To maximize their effectiveness, however, we need highly porous surfaces."" The researchers created these through electrospinning: using electric fields and polymers to create large quantities of nanofibers from solutions. To make them even more porous than usual, they applied a pH sensitive dye before heating. This caused chemical reactions in which negatively charged molecules were drawn off into the air - leaving behind just positively charged fibers. The greatest number was found when applying 0.1 milligramssquare centimeter of force during spinning under dry conditions. Of particular note according to the study results published in the journal ACS Applied Materials Interfaces, higher fiber densities led to lower numbers of contaminating atoms reaching vulnerable areas such as edges and corners within a painting. It did not appear that there would be any difference if different techniques were utilized though further testing needs to confirm this hypothesis.",0,614

"A quantum effect called superabsorption allows a collection of molecules to absorb light more efficiently than if each molecule were acting individually. Researchers have used this phenomenon to create a type of dye that glows in response to ultraviolet radiation, but it was thought they had maxed out the efficiency possible with such materials: Now researchers from Harvard University and MIT say otherwise. In their study published online today (April 17) by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, biologists Robert Langer and David Vose report on designing an innovative new class of fluorescent dyes made up of 20-30 different organic molecules - about 10 times as many elements as previous proteins or liposomes containing multiple types of dyes could achieve without being unstable under normal conditions. In addition to absorbing infrared photons better than other compounds before them, these innovative dyes can also emit blue and green luminescence at wavelengths where conventional dyes cannot penetrate. They are stable enough for use in biological systems, according to the authors. [The 9 Biggest Unsolved Mysteries in Physics] ""This is just the first step,"" said coauthor Jeffrey Grossman, who holds joint appointments between the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School's Department of Stem Cell Regenerative Biology. But what might be useful one day may already exist; scientists have found naturally occurring versions similar to those created through genetic engineering methods that exhibit enhanced fluorescence properties compared with existing techniques like confocal microscopy, which uses lasers. The technology would allow investigators to track cells down to subcellular level resolution over time using less invasive means then traditional imaging technologies typically require, including fluorescent probes. It would provide another tool available not only to basic biology research, but potentially clinical diagnostics as well. One example involves finding cancerous tumors early when they're still small so doctors don't need to remove too much tissue during surgery. Another employs high-powered laser beams to burn away unwanted scar tissues after reconstructive surgeries. Fluorescent markers based upon the newly developed compound could help guide physicians to areas beyond the diagnostic boundaries seen currently thus improving treatment outcomes.",0,630

"Project Amber is a project from Alphabet X that is now available for the mental health community to help build upon. The project originally aimed to identify a specific biomarker (a measurable characteristic of biological or physiological processes) in blood or urine samples and then use machine learning tools like artificial intelligence, deep neural networks, and reinforcement algorithms to predict if someone may be at risk due to their reported stress levels. The goal was not just about trying to find one single thing; it's more about finding patterns so we can see how certain things are connected together - as well as analyze what factors might impact those connections. For example: Is lack of sleep impacting mood? How often do you exercise when compared against your social support network? Or perhaps on an individual level, could taking certain medications improve your overall wellness profile over time without resorting to invasive procedures such as brain imaging scans during traditional clinical trials? This data would also allow us to better understand which therapies work best based on given patient profiles. Finally, this information will enable physicians and other healthcare providers to provide personalized care plans focused around each person's unique needs rather than relying on outdated models developed decades ago with no knowledge about genetics, environmental triggers, etc.",0,633

The search company did not provide any guidance on its Q3 revenue or profitability as a result, and said it does expect operating expenses in 2021 to grow ""more than 20 compared with 2019."" The most important part though is what Google's chief financial officer Ruth Porat had to say about COVID-19: ""Our business has proven resilient through previous crises and we're confident this one will be no different,"" she wrote in an email obtained by CNBC. ""We've seen a significant increase in users' reliance on our products to stay connected during these difficult times, which speaks well to their value proposition.""",0,634
"Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond s are used for cutting, drilling or polishing because their extreme hardness makes them resistant to wear while remaining transparent at high temperatures The new method uses common graphite (pictured) as an 'initiating agent' that causes carbon atoms from coal tar pitch to crystallise. The resulting product is diamond with fewer impurities than those created by current techniques which use hydrogen gas under extreme conditions Coal-tar pitch has been used since ancient times - usually mixed with wood alcohol such as lacquer thinner - but contains small amounts of compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), says lead researcher Dr Kyle Meng. These can cause cancer if inhaled over long periods. Diamonds made using this technique would be free of PAH and could therefore be considered medically safe. However, until now it was not possible simply to replace the PAH molecules already present inside the material without creating other unwanted elements instead - something known within materials science as heterogeneous catalysis. This means there was no simple reaction mechanism available for transforming oil-based pitches like coal tars into pure, large crystals of diamond. Dr Meng's team solved this problem when they realised that graphite provides exactly what is required: At room temperature its surface changes dynamically between two very different forms - one soft enough to allow liquid metals to flow around on top, yet hard and rigid enough to encourage chemical reactions below. Using standard laboratory equipment, researchers added tiny quantities of ultrahigh purity graphite powder together with minuscule particles of coal tar pitch onto a hot copper plate covered with a thin layer of gold. As more graphite was sprinkled on the mix started reacting spontaneously under the influence of intense electromagnetic fields generated by powerful laser light pulses directed through optical fibres at the sample. After just 20 minutes, most of the samples had turned completely black; only 40 per cent remained red after six hours. Yet analysis showed these were still 85 per cent diamond, rather than having become another type of mineral. In fact, some were even larger than natural gem quality stones extracted from mines. In addition tests confirmed the presence of far less iron and nickel contamination compared with previous methods because all parts of the process take place above 1200C, well beyond the melting point of either element. Most importantly though, none contained any trace of contaminants associated with xenon, methane, nitrogen oxide, arsenic or uranium normally seen as being formed during conventional catalytic processes. And unlike existing industrial approaches based on precious metal nanoparticles, the cost of producing each cubic millimetre of diamond would remain stable."" Our work represents a breakthrough,"" said Dr Meng who worked alongside colleagues including Professor Mihai Netea, Director of the Centre de Recherches sur les Nanomateriaux et l'Athenetisme Supreme (CRANSAS). ""We believe our approach will make diamond synthesis much simpler and cheaper than before"" he continued.",0,635

"A study has demonstrated how the sight or smell of a meal can trigger an inflammatory response that guides insulin production. The researchers, from Osaka University in Japan and The Ohio State University (OSU), showed this process occurs when activated macrophages previously exposed to fat-soluble molecules called free fatty acids are recruited into pancreatic beta cells where they release fatty acid metabolites known as ketone bodies - which then stimulate insulin secretion by the beta cell's alpha cells. This takes place within 15 minutes after smelling food but not before exposure to other triggers such as physical exercise or stress. ""When you eat something, your brain senses it almost immediately,"" said Masahito Tsuchiya who led the work at OSU and is now on sabbatical with the National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Tokyo. ""This helps you decide whether to stop eating."" The current research suggests our sense of taste plays a more important role than thought in regulating appetite and body weight through sensory cues that control glucose homeostasis via the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In addition, sensing these signals early may help us make decisions about what we should be eating.

"Tesla has warned its employees that they could lose unemployment benefits if they choose to stay home due to COVID-19 concerns after being called back to work. Elon Musk reopened the Tesla Fremont factory against Alameda County's coronavirus lockdown orders, leading some workers and politicians in California to file complaints with local officials about alleged violations of workplace safety guidelines at the plant. Alameda county supervisor Scott Haggerty lashed out over reports on Tuesday claiming ""a lot"" of Tesla staff have chosen not to return to work amid rumours that several hundred were still absent from the facility despite reopening last week for preproduction. The union official also argued that there was no legal basis for Elon Musk or his company to reopen a nonessential business during lockdown restrictions designed to slow down transmission rates of Covid-19, which are currently spiking across California. Mr Hudgert told Business Insider: ""I can tell you this much - it's hard enough getting people who want to go into these jobs as is; add onto those things somebody saying I got to be here because my unemployment may end?

Impossible's new patty will be served at Burger King today in six locations across New York City and Los Angeles before rolling out nationwide by year end. The menu item is an offshoot from Impossible Whopper, which launched earlier this month at select restaurants nationally with more than 19 million sold so far through July 9th. In addition to being made without cows or chickens, Burger King has also cut down on sodium content compared to regular whoppers when comparing similar sizes (400 mg vs 660 mg), although it still exceeds USDA nutritional recommendations per serving size.

[Cassini's Best Saturn Photos] Titan remains an enigma even though Cassini had been studying it since 2004 when it arrived at Saturn after traveling 3 billion miles (4.8 billion kilometers). For example, some models suggest that high-energy particles from outside may have deposited organics onto Titan's surface; however no one knows where exactly they came from or why only parts of the planet were affected. In addition, while weather patterns can create haze over large regions of the moon, researchers still don't know how much sunlight reaches different areas throughout each year - so they're interested to learn what kind of biological processes could occur across such vast distances between seasons. ""What if you wanted to look up into the sky somewhere here on Earth today but light conditions would make your task very difficult?"" explained Dujmovic. ""That's basically what happens every day above Titan!"" He added that he hopes future missions will give us insights into other lakes and seas around moons like Triton and Ganymede. The observations made by Cassini also helped identify seven sites within Titan's atmosphere likely suitable for landing chemical probes - making space exploration easier than ever before.

This is a mistake because it can give you an insight into what kind of environment and culture exists within that organisation - key factors in how happy a person will be working there. The first thing I ask during interviews at Candidates4Hire is: 'What do you like most or least about your current role?' If someone says he likes his boss then great; if not, this often raises red flags as sometimes bosses don't get on with each other! Similarly, asking them where they see themselves after five years could elicit some important information such as salary expectations (if they want more money) and career progression opportunities available through the company. Finally, by finding out who else works in HRrecruitment gives me another perspective when speaking to candidates which may highlight things not picked up from just talking to one member of staff. Talking to others helps form better opinions on issues discussed earlier that might have been overlooked due to my own bias towards certain aspects of the business. It also highlights ways we are working effectively together so that both departments continue to operate smoothly throughout employment processes.",0,672
"The plant-based meat industry is now worth 800 million and accounts for two percent of packaged meat sales. Both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have started to expand their product lines into frozen foods, while Tyson is teaming up with startup Kura on a new line that's due in stores later this year called Raised Rooted. All four companies say they're using plants because they are more sustainable than raising animals or harvesting animal organs like hearts, livers or lungs from dead cows. By avoiding hormones, antibiotics and other drugs used by industrial farming operations, these products also help address concerns about antibiotic resistance and food safety issues. These reasons can be persuasive to many people who want to avoid eating meat but still crave the taste. ""It certainly has the potential to grow big,"" said Darren Seifer, an analyst at market research firm NPD Group. ""But it will always remain niche."" While there's no doubt consumers see growing demand, some experts point out several challenges ahead - including convincing skeptical cooks and retailers that they should invest time and money developing recipes featuring alternatives. They note that restaurants were slow to add vegan options until huge chain Burger King began testing the Vegan Whopper last fall; since then, smaller chains have introduced similar items such as Denny's Impossible Slider burger. Many consumers don't even realize fake meats come from vegetables instead of cattle. The terms ""meatless meatballs"" or ""plant-based sausage links"" might not register with them. That could limit growth if quick-serve restaurants, which already rely heavily on beef patties, aren't able to build menus around new offerings without having customers confused about what exactly they mean when they order something labeled simply as ""beefless milkshake."" Dariush Ajami, CEO of Plant Based Foods Association trade group says he sees three ways to get consumers interested: via familiar ingredients, recognizable brands and high quality. He notes that burgers made with pea protein isolate may seem weird at first sight compared to a traditional ground beef patty. But once you try them, he believes most people won't miss real meat.",0,673
"Running out of cash is probably a founder's biggest fear. Indie Hackers is a community mostly made up of founders who shoulder their company's financial burden personally. They generally take on the responsibility for raising capital, getting customers and building features in case they can't find funding or make enough money to sustain themselves long-term. I'm not sure how I'd feel about going into that situation if my current startup fails - would it be more terrifying with no backup plan? At least we have an idea what this new place could look like: hiring employees instead of contractors; offering benefits rather than just vacation time; paying ourselves a living wage (or better). We've been hoping all along for VCs and angels to step forward - but so far there has been very little interest from them, despite our strong traction as evidenced by numerous press mentions. Even worse, the most recent round was shut down before we even had a chance to pitch! And now comes another crisis which may put us back at square one.... Sigh... again!?

"A group of researchers has developed a way to create food without sunlight using artificial photosynthesis. The method involves converting carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, and then feeding the resulting product back to plants in order for them to grow more efficiently. The process was originally described by Carl Sagan decades ago but so far no practical methods have been found that can be used on an industrial scale. In this new study published last week (April 20) in Science Advances however, scientists say they've made advances towards large-scale implementation of their idea thanks primarily to better materials science technology.

"data2vec is a multi-modal artificial intelligence algorithm from Meta that attempts to replicate the general learning ability that the human mind possesses. The team aimed to create an AI that can learn by itself and improve its own performance, resulting in more accurate predictions over time with less data training samples than other methods try to achieve. Using this model, it has been able to predict drug response for 25 drugs already approved for cancer treatment in Japan or undergoing clinical trials - including AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) and Merck Co Inc.'s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This analysis will help researchers identify new targets based on patterns found inside tumor cells' DNA sequences rather than just looking at proteins present outside of them, as was previously done. In addition to these results, the study also proved that combining multiple types of medical imaging together offers better predictive accuracy compared to using one type alone. ""We believe this technology could lead to significant advances in precision medicine,"" Hirofumi Kato, senior director for Oncology Development Strategy Group Asia Pacific of Astellas Pharma said about the research results published in Nature.

"Bitcoin mining uses a huge amount of electricity. A mining setup requires a building, hundreds of high-speed computer servers, a heavy-duty cooling system, and a location that can handle a lot of heat. The facility needs to be near cheap energy sources like hydroelectric dams or coal plants - and often it's in areas with notoriously unstable power grids. As you might imagine from the conditions required by all this hardware, Bitcoin miners have also become big users of heavy equipment like excavators, forklifts, and trucks. Despite having similar requirements to bitcoin mining, using advanced machines is not for everyone. Thus, some operators are offering their services on cloud platforms where anyone can use them without purchasing expensive equipment and installations. These platforms function similarly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) but instead of renting out computing resources in data centers owned by others, one rents them in virtual private clouds established within specific companies. According to Bloomberg's investigation, many major Chinese mining pools rent their hashing capacity to foreign customers through these private facilities. The bitcoins used to pay the network fee must come from transaction fees included in the block. This is either especially useful or especially useless to the miner: if there are less transactions than the maximum number allowed by the block's size, the leftover bitcoins are simply wasted.[2] If there are more transactions, they may be included into an additional block. In this case, some of the payments made to the miner will appear to originate from higher value transfers, making it possible for the miner to claim larger rewards by including these in his blocks.",0,696

"An Israeli startup, Nanox, has developed a new type of X-ray machine that generates 3D images. It emits less radiation and costs a fraction of the price of conventional imaging systems for medical diagnostics. The device is an alternative to computed tomography (CT) scanners which are commonly used in hospitals today but produce 2D image slices through the body. CT helps doctors see inside bones or organs by capturing multiple cross sections digitally with x-rays from different angles. But it requires highly skilled operators due to its complex nature and can be expensive - costing up to 200 million per system when purchased off-the-shelf without any customisation. As such systems become smaller and more powerful however they also require higher doses of ionising radiation. Radiation dose limits have been set at 0.4 millisieverts every year so health professionals using machines like this would not exceed those levels over their working life span. The consequences include cancer risk as well as infertility because some types cause damage to cells' DNA that leaves them unable to divide properly. A single scan produced by one of these devices typically delivers around 1-2 mSv depending on the equipment being used. This means there's no way to reduce exposure further than making sure the patient lies perfectly still during imaging. In addition, while cheaper options exist for non-invasive scans, many patients do prefer traditional methods involving needles inserted into various parts of the body. All told then, only about 20 of people undergoing routine diagnostic tests actually take advantage of safer alternatives available according to figures provided by Harvard Medical School. That number may now increase thanks to Nanox's technology though. ""By replacing existing technologies we will potentially save millions if not billions"" said Ran Poliakine CEO Co-founder of Nanox X-Ray Ltd., who declined to disclose his age. ""We know that our solution could significantly raise awareness regarding safety standards especially among younger generations."" Measuring just three feet high, Nanox says its scanner works similarly to current models except instead uses tiny nanorod crystals rather than X-radiation sources. These emit extremely low power waves within a narrow spectrum that maximises their absorption without compromising quality, speed or convenience. Operators don't need extensive training either: based solely on real time feedback given via smartphone app data points plus touch screen commands, they're able to produce results ready to view in under 90 seconds after scanning starts. No longer does anyone need to lie flat on a table while waiting anxiously as a technician ensures all settings correspond exactly to manufacturer specifications before pressing the button. What sounds too good to be true turns out therefore to indeed be true. Nanox's first model offers full 360 degree coverage allowing surgeons complete access to every part of the human anatomy. Scans come back digitalised and stored on cloud servers; analysis software completes automated reporting meaning quick turnarounds even for particularly urgent cases where additional information might prove useful later down the road. There are currently 32 ongoing clinical trials comparing the company's solution against other forms of imaging including radiology reports generated manually afterwards. Results indicate significant benefits compared to standard practice. For example, for soft tissue studies like mammograms, NanoX shows comparable accuracy alongside reduced dosage levels and better patient comfort. With most private funding coming initially from friends and family members - backed along the way by leading venture capital firms including Intel Capital, CME Ventures and Israel Innovation Authority - work continues towards commercial release starting next year. According to Mr Poliakine future products look likely to include upgrades covering both hardware and algorithms increasing resolution as well as incorporating AI functionality enabling automatic detection and classification of abnormal changes across dozens of diseases, giving early warning signs usually found with invasive procedures far sooner. With plans already underway for expansion beyond non-medical applications ranging from security to industrial inspection the team hopes eventually to sell hundreds of thousands annually worldwide earning revenues upwards of several hundred million dollars each year once established.",0,702

"Apple's HomePod mini smart speaker has a secret temperature and humidity sensor in its casing. It isn't currently usable by owners of the device yet, but Apple has previously included sensors on other products to gather data for Siri and its voice assistant. The news comes from Bloomberg, which says that it obtained ""internal documentation"" about the new sensor, called Smart Sensor. The report claims that this is used as part of an effort to make environmental factors such as heat or moisture more accurately reflected inside the speakers so they can better understand user commands when music playback starts. This could be particularly useful if you ask your iPhone 12 Pro to turn off the lights at home with the command 'Hey Siri, goodnight' - something I've done several times already since moving into my current apartment).

"Researchers have discovered a new Linux backdoor called Symbiote that uses novel evasion techniques to conceal its presence. It is able to scrub any sign of infection from the file system and can disable AV systems in order evade detection by security software.

The team says they were unable to obtain samples at the time but now believe they may be linked with another recent discovery - the Triton Trojan which has been active since 2017. Many components such as phishing campaigns use different email addresses than those used during a previous campaign months later leading us to think these two families are closely related; however we cannot rule out possible imitation attacks either. There's no evidence yet the attackers behind all three trojan families actually work together; instead their nature seems more like independent operations acting independently though possibly sharing some codebase code between them (in addition to elements shared among many other malicious actors). Given how little data exists about previous incidents involving Triton infections, our history-based approach using statistics over time only allows us to speculate here. Nevertheless: given what is known so far, there is currently limited reason not assume multiple coexisting threats exist simultaneously inside targeted networks."" reads the analysis published by Palo Alto Networks.

"Delta is a syntax-highlighter for git and diff output on the command line. It is compatible with all syntax-highlighting themes available on bat. Delta features language syntax highlighting, within-line insertiondeletion detection (with color), automatic indentationindent range detection based on file type using regular expressions, optional column selection while editing an input textarea, and more. Cogito provides interactive visualization of data in over 20 formats including comma separated values (.csv) files, SQL databases, XML files, etc... Its simple drag drop interface allows you to add or remove columns from any table as well as change metrics displayed when graphs are rendered. Graphs can be saved into.png format with different colors allowing them to easily stand out among other tables in your application without adding clutter by taking up additional screen real estate. Finally, Cogito adds a ""lock"" option which prevents accidental saving of the graph during edits making it easy for multiple people working together on large projects to track changes made in real time across each others' work. For added security permissions may also be set preventing non-administrator users accessing certain areas such as modifying the default database connection string used to access only those parts of the system that require administrator privileges - useful if you wish to keep sensitive information hidden away but accessible via another computer at home.

"Rome is an experimental JavaScript toolchain designed to replace many existing JavaScript tools. All components are custom and there are no third-party dependencies. It includes a compiler, linter, formatter, bundler, packer (with support for Sass, Less, Stylus), context manager, tests runner and more. The main goal of Rome is speed: it can compile your code in subsecond times if you have very little distance between the source files that need to be compiled. It's also super fast at running your unitintegration test suite - even on large projects with thousands of lines of JS code! This means bigger teams can get much faster feedback when they make changes And finally, since all its operations run inside Node, Rome takes advantage of many great features provided by the V8 engine such as hot module replacement or global object caching which leads to incredibly small memory footprint compared to other build systems out there. Plus, we don't use any external caches like Glibc's libstdc so modules loaded within each scope won't affect others' performance. Your bundle size will not grow unnecessarily from unnecessary copies across different scopes",0,714

"One of the most uncomfortable aspects of AI technology is that we do not understand how the algorithms that we end up with work. While we know that the technology can be used to boost both accuracy and efficiency, researchers are still working out what makes an algorithm accurate or efficient in a given context - and whether they need different ones for different situations (for example if you're building autonomous cars as opposed to personal assistants). The problem goes beyond just understanding the system's strengths and weaknesses: It also requires us to rethink many assumptions about data science itself. For instance, it turns out one of our greatest hopes when using machine learning models for complex tasks like medical diagnosis isn't necessarily correct. In fact, there has been no real evidence so far suggesting these techniques outperform humans on such decision-making problems; instead, more often than not their advantage lies elsewhere. The same applies to other areas where experts believed it would take years before computers could match human performance. As true today as it was then, this only underscores why having effective supervision tools will increasingly become impossible without access to explainable outcomes directly from ML systems themselves. Without them, we cannot truly trust machines to make decisions based solely upon logic alone.",0,716

Taylor adds that ""you can always try this again later"" (or at least change things up). There are upsides too for working with big companies early on; Taylor says she learned from her near-decade long relationship with Adobe where she served first as product manager, then chief marketing officer before leaving last year about how important leadership development was in building teams around great ideas. She calls herself lucky because Adobe invested heavily into training its employees during their tenure there. But if they didn't have access to those resources, would talent leave?

"Scientists in China have developed an extremely fast charging technology that can charge a lithium-ion battery to up to 60 percent capacity in under six minutes. The technology involves a special carbon composite material as the electrode, which has an exceptionally high specific surface area and conductivity compared with graphite electrodes used today for commercial batteries Researchers from Xiamen University were able to carry out this incredible feat by combining their existing electrochemical method of achieving supercapacitor levels of performance from solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) - they've now successfully applied it to Li-Ion cells too on top of being able to attain very rapid charge rates thanks to its unique nanostructure design. In addition, the team was also successful at extending this ultrafast recharge into larger sized batteries - making them not just suitable but ideally suited towards demanding applications such as electric vehicles or portable electronic devices where time is everything when you are running low on juice. The researchers published details about how exactly the process worked earlier this year detailing: Our] novel nanoplasmonic cathode exhibits enhanced capacitance and cycling stability with low impedance even after repeated 100 cycles... Moreover, we demonstrated a new type of SC system based on solid polymer electrolyte embedded fiber architecture using our newly designed nanoporous carbongraphite composite electrode. Our results demonstrate the possibility of ultrahigh rate capability (1Cmin) and long cycle life (500 h)."" Now the scientists believe that these findings could be scaled up quickly resulting in commercially viable products sooner rather than later due to the fact there aren't any limitations involved here relating to safety concerns like those which would need to apply before commercialization took place if other technologies had been tested first. Instead, all improvements made will only improve each successive generation further allowing us to expect faster recharging times every single time while simultaneously increasing energy storage capacities over what already exists without compromising anything else e.g., cost, power density etc.. This research comes hot off the heels of report released late last month concerning scientists creating what may prove to become one of the most significant advancements ever seen within the field of chemistry; having discovered a way to combine two materials together through atomic bonding called van der Waals force. This allows both crystals usually found miles beneath the earths crust outer atmosphere, sodium chloride (also known as table salt), combined with copper sulfate (that makes your bath water stink slightly more than usual) to form a completely stable complex structure capable of absorbing light much better than either component alone!

"While there has been remarkable progress on object detection and re-identification in recent years, little attention has been focused on accomplishing the two tasks in a single network to improve identification accuracy. For example, many commercial systems can detect objects (e.g., vehicles) but cannot automatically determine if they are moving or stationary; other well known methods promptly match images with previously stored reference images of similar scenes taken at different times, yet do not have automatic learning capability for determining whether changes between successive image frames signify movement that would impact re-identification decisions. A variety of prior art patents address these types problems [see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,159,143]. These include: 1.) The use of cameras mounted onto mobile platforms which record video streams from an area surrounding each camera as it moves along its path. While such devices may be effective when used in conjunction with global positioning satellite technology, no consideration is given to how this information might assist subsequent analysis of still imagery captured by a group of fixed location imaging stations while providing circuitous route tracking data for real time localization processing together with additional information about the vehicle's instantaneous velocity and direction relative to geographic landmarks within view of any one station. Further, only temporal relationships among image frames are considered rather than spatial relationships between similarly located items over time spans measured in fractions of seconds. Such features could provide improved classification performance without requiring expensive high resolution sensors operating under low light conditions nor elaborate computer assisted artificial intelligence algorithms. In another aspect, none provides means whereby input signals relating to dynamic motion are filtered out during frame analysis so that static background scenes need not also account for scene motion. Without such filtering capabilities, reliable results will depend heavily upon both sensor and system calibration protocols being properly set up before beginning operation. Also lacking is accurate estimation of camera viewpoint in three dimensions determined through knowledge of range cell locations associated with neighboring reflectors whose reflected intensity values must then be accurately compared using complex distance calculating operations followed by pixel value comparisons based solely on differences in their absolute intensities after having first been converted into ranges via geometric distortion corrections performed according to equations derived mathematically form higher dimensional spaces defined approximately by xy coordinates where y1R20.5x (3) x0.28 mm radian and z1. A further shortcoming is absence of apparatus suitable for recognition of complex shapes formed of overlapping lines delimited segmentwise by straight line segments generated by dividing a continuous curve surface continuously changing curvature related respectively to depth coordinate positions corresponding exactly to points defining respective boundaries hereinafter referred to as ""segmented curved surfaces."" Similarly absent is ability to distinguish arbitrary 3D point clouds representing individual particles suspended in liquid flow whose trajectories represent random paths determined statistically from measurement noise statistics removed from original signal raw output vectors plus added independent errors due to speed variations caused by pressure perturbations causing more rapid accelerations near the centerline of central axis passage resulting in deceleration closer to outer boundary regions causing reduced speeds, etc. Operating in reverse mode i.e., comparing predictions made beforehand against actual observed behavior allows prediction error metrics indicating what proportion of predicted future observations deviate sufficiently far away from correct guesses leading to either improved algorithm design or identification research directed toward correcting identified deficiencies. 2.) Prior effort includes several approaches employing superimposed codes comprising discrete patterns placed randomly around areas containing expected activity permitting discrimination especially useful when source of coded pattern is not readily discernible allowing comparison versus database found suitably correlated thereto offering probabilistic matching odds significantly increased above chance alone enabling easier positive identifications often achieved manually because even professional police officers sometimes misclassify potentially very important evidence mistakenly believing them likely non relevant contaminant artifacts introduced merely accidentally mixed therein possibly originating elsewhere entirely unrelated. There remains considerable room for improvement however since proper coding requires careful selection of particular code sequences and placement thereof - and no provision exists herein for accommodating such improvements which become necessary should new developments arise making existing applications obsolete. 3.) One method employs multiple radio frequency transmitters communicating covertly over long distances transmitting unique serial numbers modulated onto carrier waves broadcasting simultaneously to all receivers tuned to receive same frequencies hence uniquely identifying themselves thus simplifying automated assignment of physical addresses assigned automatically recording date started and stopped sending transmissions thereby facilitating creation of graphs charting emission levels correlating to past activities including those pertaining to those presently drawing law enforcement interest most notably vehicular crimes though applicable equally to theft cases involving loss of goods transported by bicycles, motorcycles, pedestrians walking down streets, trains carrying passengers shipping goods, airplanes transporting cargo, ships ferrying people across oceans, railroads conveying railroad cars loaded with freight containers full suddenly vanishing leaving nothing behind for security personnel tasked with investigating thefts of said contents complicate matters considerably considering in addition that some perpetrators transport stolen property surreptitiously hidden inside otherwise innocuous articles intended ostensibly to serve innocent purposes until later discovered missing giving rise to enormous challenges confronting investigators seeking quick return of recovered goods back to rightful owners particularly subjects of investigations too numerous to count necessitating assistance of private firms involved team There -92 Dan...rians version News4 corresponds Temple Mate also others is - community - That R.

In 2018 he agreed to appear before Congress and testify over allegations made against him within the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). He was accused of firing two critical Amazon warehouse union leaders due to anti-union comments during the ongoing election period.",0,747
"Apple announced updates to iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, TV OS, and WatchOS in the opening keynote for WWDC2020. Public betas will start next month. iOS 14 will introduce new capabilities for FaceTime including SharePlay which lets you watch movies or listen to music with your friends while on a call together. Other tools like Focus Mode allows users to customize notifications based on who they are communicating with at that moment so it's easier to stay focused. The home screen can now also be set aside as App Library where all of one's apps reside ready to access whenever needed without having them clutter up the current page. It also features widgets (which were recently added to macOS) and more ways to use apps throughout the day by adding links from third-party services directly into app switcher view. iPadOS adds multiple new multitasking improvements allowing users even greater control over apps when using a Magic Keyboard (or Apple Pencil). There is also an updated version of Apple Books designed especially for the larger display size found on iPads - perfect if someone wants their eBooks synchronized across devices via iCloud. Safari has been tweaked too with Tab Groups giving easy organization options along with Reading List syncing between devices wherever possible. A shortcut button makes jumping straight to websites just two clicks away instead of searching through menus. An improved translation feature helps improve accessibility among other things. macOS Big Sur introduces many visual changes such as new icons, redesigned navigation bar, dock, and windows toolbar. One handy new addition gives immediate access to files stored in iCloud Drive right within Finder (although not available yet), making transferring documents much quicker than before. Quick Note takes notes anywhere right from the menu bar alongside shortcuts to quickly search for specific text phrases or symbols. Siri gets some overhauled voice commands plus Shortcuts get expanded possibilities thanks to the availability of 3rd party actions although there was no mention of HomeKit support - disappointing news indeed! Maps brings better cycling directions plus curated Guides showing off attractions around town and beyond. Photos gets its biggest redesign since launch bringing everything under one roof accessible either inside albums or grouped according to people or events. Voice Memos gains transcription capability coming this fall followed shortly after by sharing functionality later down the road. tvOS provides new picture-in-picture editing controls letting any user take advantage of these flexible time-saving functions regardless of whether content originated elsewhere. Users can cut out sections of video then save those clips for future use. Automatically playlists certain videos at regular intervals keeping viewers entertained during periods of downtime. New live tile layouts highlight recently watched programs immediately upon launching the app minimizing scrolling back through previous episodes.

"Research on psychedelic compounds has boomed in the last few years. Many companies are now springing up in the psychedelic sector with the aim of creating new analogs of drugs like LSD, MDMA and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms). These novel compounds could have a multitude of medical applications such as treating depression or substance abuse disorders. 4. Cannabis 2.0 is here But not all cannabis stocks were created equal. While several marijuana growers saw their shares soar following Canada's legalization of recreational weed back in October 2018, others struggled to find footing amid weaker-than-expected demand for dried flower products throughout much of 2019. This led many investors to dump their holdings but those who stayed put have been handsomely rewarded over recent months. With the pot industry entering ""Cannabis 2.0"" mode this year, meaning that derivatives will be allowed in Canadian provinces where legal, some analysts believe this next phase of growth should lead to increased sales and profitability among producers. Those looking to capitalize on these market opportunities might want to consider investing in: Canopy Growth Corp., which touts itself as being at the forefront when it comes to developing innovative cannabinoid-based medicines; Aurora Cannabis, another top player within the space due to its growing international footprint; Cronos Group Inc., an emerging leader thanks mainly to its strategic investment by Altria Group; and Aphria Inc., one of the biggest players today given its low cost production advantages. I'd especially recommend taking a closer look at Canopy Growth right now since we're seeing renewed interest from Constellation Brands, once again making it the largest shareholder after exercising warrants acquired during a previous financing round. In addition, you'll also notice Cara Therapeutics as our first biopharma pick on the list above because of two major catalysts coming up soon which could provide big gains for shareholders. 5. The world still needs oil... even if EVs take off Oil isn't going anywhere anytime soon despite ongoing efforts toward reducing carbon emissions via electric vehicles and other alternative energy sources.

"Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so forgive me if you know this) Solid will allow people to build their own software and apps on top of an underlying blockchain that keeps information public while allowing private access for companies or individuals - in other words it's like Twitter except not sucky at all! Why This Matters: Well, right now we have horrible centralized services where Facebook owns your data, Google knows everything about everyone but tries its best to hide what they're doing from us even though our government lets them look away because otherwise how would they do business? We've been told repeatedly over the years that these are bad things, yet still many believe the omniscient omnipotent market forces built into capitalism will work out anything wrong without any intervention whatsoever. But guess what happens every time there's no regulation anywhere just pure free markets which means monopoly after monopolist gets too big for anyone else to compete against...bammo! Now imagine if instead of having to rely on one company holding onto massive amounts of personal info forever something similar existed which was open source meaning anybody could copy stuff off each others servers anytime they wanted then hack together whatever appservice they needed using some cool new version control system called Git. Imagine further being able to make money through advertising since companies wouldn't be tracking your downloads across different platforms anymore and oh yeah paywall sites owned by Conde Nast style conglomerates won't exist either cause you'll get paid directly when someone clicks an adblock advert or actually buys product X online thanks to micropayments powered by cryptocurrencies [check]. It sounds crazy enough to happen doesn't it?! What Makes Me Worry About This Technology: The technology behind Solid seems awesomely powerful and revolutionary, however my concerns lie mainly around adoption rate due to user experience. There isn't much incentive today for everyday users to switch completely from current tech once most applications work perfectly fine within said paradigm. Think back to previous waves of innovation such as riding bikes vs cars. Cars were great until everybody had em; suddenly bikes became more fun again). If decentralization does take hold, existing players may benefit greatly (Google, FB), harm smaller entities trying to break into space (TwitterSquare), become gatekeepers themselves (Apple, Amazon), or find ways to manipulate the platform itself (the way Reddit has recently gone down hill). When asking friends what's important about crypto currency to them almost universally 1 answer is ""anonymity - security privacy issues"" followed closely second place is 'making money quick easy' resulting in dapps attempting to focus primarily upon gambling mechanics, digital tulips and porn. Also they hate banks and credit cards . Obviously successful projects here become magnets for VC investment leading to brutal hierarchies based purely on factors outside meritocracy ...think Yelp reviews versus TripAdvisor ratings Lastly don't forget about IP law; solid core protocol 3rd party DApps potential landmines regarding intellectual property rights violations given vast number of possible permutations. Overall utility value proposition also remains unclear beyond initial novelty. Remedy For These Concerns In My Eyes Would Be To Give Users An Easy Way Out Of A Deadlock Like The Crypto Community Has Done Before By Building Decentralized Extensions On Top Of Public Blockchains And Use Cases Such As P2P File Sharing Or Peer 2 Peer Lending Products That Offer Commercial Advantages Over Existing Services While Still Being Open Source.",0,757

"The FCC has approved Amazon's application for 3,236 low-Earth orbit satellites for its Project Kuiper broadband service. Project Kuiper aims to deliver high-speed, low-latency broadband to areas without good internet coverage by launching a constellation of more than 3,000 smallsats into orbits ranging from 350 miles (563 kilometers) above the Earth's surface down to as close as 310 miles (500 km). As reported last year, Amazon is developing massive ""mega constellations"" in LEO that will take advantage of the relatively large amounts of bandwidth available at these altitudes compared with traditional geostationary communications satellite systems. A recent study suggests that up to 50 percent of all future global mobile traffic could be carried via such mega constellations alone and that they'll generate 1 trillion per year revenue worldwide within 15 years of going online. Amazon plans to build out an initial network consisting 1 million terminals over 6 phases between 2023 and 2027 before expanding it across the globe starting around 2030. The company says there are still some regulatory hurdles to clear but if everything goes according to plan, we should see regular updates on progress through the next few months ahead of official launch sometime during 2022 or early 2023.",0,759
"A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning flashes from within clouds that are moving at 40 kilometers (25 miles) per second and with temperatures exceeding 2 million degrees Celsius (3.6 million Fahrenheit). ""It's amazing to see how quickly they flash,"" said study co-author Jeroen van der Wiel - an astrophysicist at Utrecht University using data from one of those telescopes for his doctorate research on these ultrafast particles. ""So I was really surprised when we found out it is not visible."" This new interpretation provides evidence that electrons can indeed travel faster than light does through certain materials under extreme conditions like this thunderstorm cloud. [The Strangest Things That Can Travel Faster Than Light] Lightning strikes above sea level produce electromagnetic waves called gamma rays; while higher up in the atmosphere more powerful X-rays emerge as well. As these rays pass through Earth's dense ionosphere layer between 50 and 600 miles high, which allows charged particles such as ions, electrons or electrically neutral atoms to hop across space easily, some energy gets absorbed by them along the way, according to theory. And if there happens to be any free electron pairs inside, then all the better. Since the speed limit normally applied to photons applies also here, photon emission never occurs because nobody has managed yet to send a particle traveling past another particle before its arrival time measured in classical physics would have allowed this. In other words: Photons still don't breach their own speed limit no matter what cosmic circumstances come into play! But sky events involving fast-moving particles do happen occasionally - but only extremely rarely. Such rare occasions include supernovas exploding away from us as seen from different directions around our planet, perturbations near the edge of black holes known as gravitational wave signals, and now perhaps even lightning bolts hitting the ground. All of these phenomena raise serious questions about whether Einstein got things right after all regarding nothing being able to break the universal laws governing light. If you're curious why scientists haven't settled this debate so far despite many attempts over decades, read more about why physicists just didn't find anything wrong with relativity back in 2017.",0,760
"Facebook recently launched a new virtual reality remote work app where users can hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves. Workrooms is an early step by Facebook towards building the metaverse, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions will be a shared social and digital world in which people spend time together online rather than just over apps like Zoom or WhatsApp video calls. The company said it was rolling out Workrooms to all employees globally on Tuesday. It had been testing the application with sales staff since October 2020. ""Workrooms helps you feel present when working remotely,"" Julien Codorniou, co-director of AR and VR at Facebook Reality Labs, told Reuters. Users create avatars that represent them during meetings, able to move around digitally and use text chat features alongside colleagues who are also represented through their own pixelated version of the human form. Workers can invite up to 50 friends including non-workers into individual rooms for group conversations. This differs from other collaborative tools such as Microsoft Teams, which offers free access only to individuals using professional accounts for workplaces. ""I think this has profound implications beyond how we were going to have our next meeting. I do believe if COVID accelerates anything it's that shift away from this idea of being physically trapped inside four walls,"" said Vivek Sharma, vice president of platform partnerships at Workplace by Facebook maker Facebook Inc.

Citizen says the new feature can go beyond just helping with emergencies: ""We've seen people use our platform before an incident happens to report suspicious activity,"" said Michael Cordero, CEO of Citizen, on Monday at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.

"While Google shut down Project Loon earlier this year, some of the technology remained in development. Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) links can create a 20Gbps broadband link from two kilometers away using one laser beam to transmit and another at the other end that only need relay fiber optic cable or small base stations for reception, according to Wikipedia. The advantage is better bandwidth without all those ugly high-mast towers needed by traditional wireless systems - although it would still require line-of-sight conditions between transmitter and receiver if you don't want your data traveling directly into space like Kevin Bacon's character did on Apollo 13. It wouldn't be necessary to send ten billion lasers up there; just enough for each connection point with antennas built around them installed along power lines across the country could do the job, as IEEE Spectrum notes. Every time someone opens Netflix they'll help out their fellow man by sending money to Facebook through its satellites. They're not actually spying on us because we asked Facebook first even though nobody knows what ""permission"" means anymore anyway. The key here is simplicity: As long as nothing goes wrong during transmission and SpaceX doesn't immediately crash itself back onto Earth when something does go awry, these connections will be simple, cheap, fast, ubiquitous, and secure while giving backbone providers more flexibility than ever before thanks to low latency. If anything else comes about, then great! It might allow people who live where landlines are too expensive or unreliable an alternative way to get online beyond Wi-Fi hotspots which also have limited capacity compared to satellite transmissions. SpaceX has already had plenty of success hauling cargo directly to orbit since 2012 but getting humans safely off-planet hasn't been possible so far until now due to various failures including explosions on the ground and rocket launches. Heavy lifting rockets capable of carrying tons of materials into space usually cost tens of millions per launch whereas reusable boosters designed specifically for human travel should significantly reduce costs over pre-existing designs going forward - although SpaceX won't say how much Falcon 9 services will cost yet after today's landing attempt failed.",0,763

You cannot stream these for free using this service though; viewers must pay a subscription fee in order to watch. This may not sound very appealing considering most people would rather just go ahead and download them instead (unless they're only playing multiplayer). But if there were more than one person watching who has downloaded those same games, then others could join their session easily through the Game Party feature within the app itself. In addition, players do have access to all the additional features offered by both Forza Horizon 4 and Grand Theft Auto 5 which include driving modes where vehicles handle differently depending upon whether traffic was present during gameplay.

"Oracle is buying electronic healthcare records company Cerner in a deal valued at 28.3 billion. It is the biggest deal in Oracle's long history of acquiring companies. The deal allows for a 10 million termination fee if it does not close by January 31, 2020 and another 2 billion payment to other parties who are involved with the transaction should that happen too. The move comes as no surprise after last year rumors started circulating about the two tech giants considering such an acquisition. In fact, just this past November, reports surfaced indicating both firms were nearing finalizing their merger agreement - something they had supposedly been trying unsuccessfully since 2016.. ""We have spent many years talking with health system leaders about how we can help them modernize,"" said Larry Ellison, co-CEO of Oracle, during today's announcement. ""This combination brings together our cloud applications, enterprise software systems, hardware infrastructure, and professional services expertise into one company."" Cerner has pioneered some major innovations over its 50 year existence: first using computers to track patient data in hospitals; later creating the world's largest hospital information network (HIN); and most recently developing the iNtuition platform - which leverages the internet of things for better treatment outcomes via remote monitoring techniques. Its customers include more than 350 U.S.-based private and public organizations across various industries including medical device manufacturers like GE Healthcare, imaging companies like Konica Minolta, pharmaceutical producers like Pfizer, insurers like Anthem Health Plans Inc., and government agencies like CDCNIH Federal Security Services Division (FSSD). With multiple acquisitions under its belt already in 2018 alone, there was hope amongst analysts that President Trump might even try to block the proposed sale or force through regulatory barriers given his preference towards American technology products being made back home instead of overseas locations.

"Blue Origin launched the fourteenth test flight of its New Shepard rocket booster and capsule on January 14. There were no passengers on board, but the capsule can carry up to six astronauts for an abbreviated suborbital spaceflight experience that lasts just a few minutes before returning back down to Earth. The company has now successfully flown 13 consecutive missions since 2019 with this reusable launch system, including two crewed flights in 2021 so far (including today). The last mission, NS-15, saw NASA astronaut Megan McArthur join pilot Bob Behnken aboard the spacecraft as part of a historic ""test flight"" of Crew Dragon's first human occupants ever. That trip included about three days' worth of microgravity research for scientists onboard - though it also ended abruptly when the vehicle was forced into an abort due to a glitchy engine sensor. For the latest roundtrip destination: 100 kilometers above sea level. And while Blue Origin hasn't revealed what they're planning out there yet beyond achieving another milestone by flying humans once again, we have some idea based upon recent comments from Bezos himself. Previously, he offered a vague overview outlining plans to move past orbital altitude eventually toward longer-term travel options where colonies could be built off our planet instead of visiting them here or going even higher than current aircraft like Virgin Galactic make possible before plunging back through the atmosphere at some point later. He talked specifically about sending those kinds of trips towards Mars during his most recent interview around the time of the 2020 presidential election, which you'll recall came after Amazon flourished amid pandemic response efforts.

This is about half of what they usually get each year at the recruiting drive; however, officials said this might be temporary as new legislation allows more young adults to dodge compulsory military service if they are pregnant or have children under age two.

"A team of researchers has found a new mineral about 900 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Davemaoite is made of calcium, silicon, and oxygen. Its existence has been long hypothesized, but its discovery marks only the second time that an element was discovered in rocks on land as opposed to the ocean floor. The research provides scientists with more information regarding how rock holds elements together at extreme conditions - including high pressure and low temperature. The study also highlights similarities between certain types of minerals formed deep within our planet and those created over billions years by geysers on Jupiter's moon Io. ""This material can tell us about processes occurring beneath the crust,"" said Benjamin Weiss, professor emeritus of earth sciences at MIT who led the research along with former graduate student Zhijie Sun. ""It's exciting because we've seen similar things happen in volcanic eruptions."" Weiss' lab first reported finding two unusual phases of calcium silicate perovskites (CaSiO3) known collectively as zircons while exploring samples from the Kola Superdeep Borehole in northern Russia, which stretches down nearly 12 kilometers into the Earth's interior. As part of their work analyzing these samples for signs of life-forming molecules like DNA or RNA, they added the samples to acids that dissolved away most other materials present except for some rare isotopes of iron; when this mixture hardened without being heated further, it yielded tiny spheres composed entirely of pure calcium and silicon. These were then crushed up and analyzed using mass spectrometry imaging techniques developed by coauthor Mark Hauber, associate member of Harvard University's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Carbon Permanence Institute, allowing them to identify individual atoms contained inside each sphere. Through his analysis, Hauber determined that there are three common forms of Ca2: one bonded directly to four Si4 centers, another bound loosely in just one bond to five positions around the center, and yet another form belonging solely to silicon. By comparing what he saw among different species of CaSiO3 crystals isolated through chemical decomposition (i.e., dissolution), Hauber arrived at a crystal formula of Ca7 (Si8) (OH16). This last phase appeared particularly interesting given past studies suggesting it could be stable under such harsh conditions, thus leading him to suggest searching for evidence of its crystallization process in real rocks, something now possible thanks to recent developments in electron microscopy technology enabling much better resolution than ever before despite operating millions of degrees Celsius hotter than conventional instruments capable of performing the same task. In collaboration with Jaehan Bae of Boston College, Weiss recruited undergraduate researcher Noah Schnarr to obtain actual specimens containing fragments of meteorites recovered during NASA missions over the course of several summers. Working at temperatures exceeding 100C less than 2 centimeters underground, both successfully identified amorphous materials rich in silicon and calcium carbonate resembling what had originally been observed in synthetic materials. Upon reexamining the data obtained previously with infrared equipment designed to detect water vapor near melting points where the sample showed absorption lines consistent with liquid water, instead they came across distinct patterns suggestive of the presence of solid mineral structures. However, upon closer examination with transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, they realized the structure wasn't necessarily made primarily out of calcium and silicon after all. Specifically, the images revealed spherical clusters marked by concentric rings consisting of alternating layers of silicon dioxide (the main component of quartz sand grains) separated by thin sheets of calcite. If confirmed, this would mark the first instance of a naturally occurring davemoite formation. To confirm whether these features truly represented true formations rather than contaminants produced upon heating the original meteoritic sample above 1,000C, simply seeing the phenomenon again elsewhere would have sufficed, but working alongside colleagues at Brown University, Anna Vagin of Berkeley Lab, Robert Harvey of UC Riverside, Richard Walker Jr. of UC Santa Barbara, Jeffrey Poston of Caltech, and Josh Tewksbury of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Weiss used various analytical tools ranging from scanning electron microscopy to Raman spectroscopy to determine the distribution of ions throughout the structure based off their specific interactions with electrons and light waves respectively. This allowed them not only to show that it belongs to a class of compounds called metal carbides, which contain metals forming bonds to oxygen via covalent bonding but don't share any common structural characteristics aside from having oxygen vacancies that make them electrically conductive. Further experimentation demonstrated that small amounts of water likely played no role whatsoever in causing these unique mineral forms since the material behaved exactly the same way even eliminating trace quantities by drying it completely beforehand.

I have been encouraging him to post more about his product on social media but he has yet to do so...you know what happens when one doesn't promote their work! Anyway, I thought this was pretty cool looking bottle design, especially since you're supposed to drink these while sipping cocktails.",0,774
"A technically advanced indoor vertical farm is growing a range of crops inside the basement of a former sugar factor in Liverpool. Farm Urban was founded in 2014, growing salads and herbs including basil for local restaurants every day it can be open - even during snowstorms when other shops had to close The company's founders were determined not just to grow food but also create jobs locally so they spent millions converting an old factory into what has become the UK's largest indoor vertical farming facility. Farmers use LED lights powered by solar panels on roofs covered with plants that provide artificial sunlight all year round instead of relying solely on natural light from windows like traditional farms do. This means there are long days filled with lots of sunshine - perfect for photosynthesis which enables them to produce more fresh vegetables per square metre than any other method of agriculture. Plants store their energy as sugars through photosynthesis; making these sugars available to us helps our bodies function properly.. Unlike outdoor land based farms where weeds need constant pulling or replanting because over time vegetation creeps across fields, greenhouse farmers don't have this problem thanks to fixed shelving units containing raised beds surrounded by strong glass walls allowing you to see each plant at eye level rather than having to bend down low (like me) while getting weighed up by half a tonne bags of salad leaves strapped onto your back. The shelves allow easy access between rows without breaking out the weed whacker or kneeling repeatedly, reducing the effort required significantly compared to conventional ground-based production methods designed around heavy labour intensive conveyer belts moving products along assembly lines. These advantages mean high output levels achievable using less space increasing profits whilst cutting carbon emissions associated with transporting goods miles away from consumers' homes contributing positively towards mitigating climate change. According to statistics released last week, British retailers bought 11 billion worth of seasonal fruit and veg from overseas producing companies shipped halfway round the world despite shortages of supply caused by extreme weather events such as bad crop yields following drought conditions in Spain and Italy coupled with flooding affecting harvests elsewhere around the globe due to global warming bringing higher temperatures and changing monsoons causing unpredictable rainfall patterns. Indoor farms expert James Lovell believes urban greenhouses will play increasingly important role supplying supermarkets here and abroad after Covid crisis ends saying ""I think people now realise how fragile the infrastructure supporting a lot of food grown outside really is."" He adds: "" Producing some basic foods directly under controlled environments could help make sure we have supplies when we most want them.""",0,775
"Insulin is essential for a diabetic, and it can be expensive, especially for those without good insurance. A growing movement of biohackers is trying to build a distributed system of insulin production that could potentially reduce the cost by bringing local manufacturing back into the home with 3D printing technology or using bacteria in wastewater treatment plants as factories, but these are still prototypes at this point - not something you'd want to do yourself unless your life depended on it. Now researchers from Stanford University have taken another approach: they grew human blood-forming stem cells inside ferrets so that when they were cut open their bodies would form new cells containing insulin. They then injected them directly under the skin of pigs which had been engineered to lack an enzyme necessary to metabolize sugar (a condition called ""mild non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 2). As soon as the scientists started injecting them, the animals began producing sugars normally used up in processing insulin within two hours. To put things into perspective, people with diabetes need regular injections every day because our pancreases don't make enough insulin anymore; if we didn't use insulin made outside our body, we'd die. The team's results show promise for future drug development efforts aimed toward creating a reliable way to control glucose levels in humans who require daily doses of insulin to regulate their disease. It was published recently in Nature Biotechnology.",0,776
