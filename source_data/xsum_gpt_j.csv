"Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related components were hidden in patio furniture, under floorboards, at workbenches and even inside ceiling tiles. AD The FBI did not provide details on how many of these guns connected to international arms smuggling rings remain active today. In one case cited by the bureau, a gun was shipped from China to Japan via an American company before being sold into Mexico's narco-trafficking market, according to Bloomberg News. The buyer later resold it to other customers - including Venezuelans who used it against police officers during protests this year as part of opposition leader Juan Guaido's push for president Nicolas Maduro to step down. In another example, authorities seized more than 1 million rounds of ammunition from a shipping container headed towards Columbia. They traced those bullets back to Los Angeles where they had been purchased by a seller linked with an Israeli national living in Colombia accused of running drug trafficking organizations there. After he was arrested last August, Colombian authorities said his network supplied the country's largest street gang.",0,1

"Latham smashed Colin Ackermann for six to reach his hundred but was caught behind off Neil Dexter for 124. Opener Steel went on to make his century off 242 balls, smashing three fours and two boundaries en route before being bowled by Ravi Singh in the 12th over with 6 needed from 28 deliveries. Steyn took 4-72 as Black Caps skipper Martin Crowe (3) made 25 not out after Latham's dismissal didn't provoke a run chase. With Ryan McLaren dismissed for 5, South Africa were 346 at one stage after losing their last 8 wickets for 27 runs. In response, Australia lost Cameron White early for 11 to be followed later by Mills who scored only one boundary of five extras - he edged to slip via midwicket, leaving Darren Lehmann stranded on 26. The big hit came just when West Indies had begun to reel them back into contention courtesy of an Angelo Matthews blitz that included seven overs going for 24 runs including a catch dropped by Chris Gayle at cover. Gayle then batted patiently through 90 minutes against tenacious pace bowling from Steve Harmison, until he fell LBW trying to slog to deep square leg for 51. But Josh Little returned him immediately with a superb diving stop to dismiss de Villiers caught by Sajid Mahmood at first slip for 17 having survived a direct hit appeal earlier. It brought Andrew Symonds up to bat with a career best score of 55, adding 64 with little help from Michael Hussey on debut whose slow start was offset by some fabulously timed leaves onto the ring finger of his right hand which stopped it falling off altogether, eventually coming down in the outfield while waving his arms around like a demented man.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action The mother who survived Iran's notorious Evin prison and gave birth in captivity while being held hostage by the Islamic Republic is heading back home after serving her sentence. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife Nazanin had been ""punished twice over - firstly for trying to leave an oppressive country on holiday with their baby daughter ... secondly because she returned pregnant."" The British national also thanked those he described as having helped him keep hope alive that they would see their child again. He gave thanks to ""the media, MPs, my friends, family members - not just here but around the world."" Referring to what he called the ""unofficial kidnap cases"" of Britons abroad, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""I am grateful it happened where we were lucky enough to have some help from our embassy, from others like ourselves. I would say thank you to all of them too. All these people have kept me going through this whole experience. Thank God for them. And finally, Nazanin. She is at last coming out of this hellhole of a place today. It will be good to hold her once more. This ordeal must be finished now. Let us raise our glasses one final time. To freedom! Cheers!"" Following two short sentences handed down by Judge Shivaani Nikkhooei, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe heard snippets of news about herself on Iranian state TV Tuesday night, saying there was no plan to release her. When asked if anyone spoke Persian and didn't understand English during her trial, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe replied: ""Yes, yes. Did you ever hear something before? There are so many foreigners who don't know anything about [Iranian] politics or history. Some only speak foreign languages. They think everything happens inside their borders. How do they get information otherwise? If you pressurise someone into committing a crime then obviously it can happen anywhere. But things went smoothly considering how difficult such situations usually become."" Mr Ratcliffe tweeted several photos showing himself holding his newborn son Alexander while under house arrest shortly after leaving court. Speaking later outside Westminster Magistrates Court, where she received the sentence, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffeforged up with reporters shouting repeatedly at police officers guarding the gates. She told journalists waiting for her to come out of the courthouse: ""You are free."" A three-judge panel found Zaghari-Ratcliffe guilty of attempting to overthrow Iran's clerical system. Officials arrested both women in April 2016 following a visit to Bangladesh. While travelling between India and West Africa with her toddler daughter Gabriella (Gabi), Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was stopped at London Heathrow airport and accused of taking part in a BBC interview spread via social network sites during which she defended Western countries' right to engage in ""constructive criticism"" towards Iran. At subsequent hearings in July and August 2017, she denied any wrongdoing. However, in October, she admitted conspiracy to commit fraud. On December 17, 2018, a day after giving birth to her second son, Mr Ratcliffe boarded a flight to Germany, accompanied only by stuffed animals given to him by his children. In February this year, a high-level diplomatic source confirmed to Al Jazeera that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was undergoing medical treatment in hospital following complications arising from childbirth. According to the same official, ""she should return home sooner than expected."" Duelling narratives One narrative emerging among critics revolves around ""conspiracy theories"" surrounding the plight of British prisoners held in Iran. Critics charge that Britain failed to use its leverage to secure better conditions for imprisoned dual nationals - including Zaghari-Ratcliffe. For example, Ben Wallace, a former minister responsible for security policy, told Channel 4 News early this month that the Conservative government may have contributed to poor human rights standards within prisons in exchange for trade concessions. His comments sparked debate within the party, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling for an apology for the remarks. After a number of days during which there was silence regarding his words, Mr Hunt issued a statement, describing his previous statements as wrong and noting that he still believed in the importance of engaging with Iran. The Conservatives defended Mr Wallace and insisted that he did not mean to suggest that Britain holds shares in sanctions against Cuba or North Korea as punishment for political offences committed elsewhere. Another prominent figure involved in negotiations with Iran is Laurence Robertson QC. Last week, whilst arguing on behalf of Tehran prosecutors, he maintained that Mr Ratcliffe was a spy. Such claims appear somewhat contradictory. Mr Robertson argued that the couple posed ""a serious threat to national security because they planned to undermine the regime"" - yet claimed that neither man had access to classified material.

"Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in Wales' culture throughout the 20th and 21st centuries but is now experiencing something of an international revival, as established musicians like the Late Nite Ramblers have stepped up to play their own distinctive sound at open-air venues across Britain in recent years. The Cardiff International Arts festival has always been keen on promoting this new wave of Welsh talent, with cellist Rhiannon Giddens one of its most high profile attractions over previous seasons. However it is the release next month of Why We Work - A World Music Tapestry, that aims to highlight the very best of contemporary world music artists based here. The compilation includes songs by the likes of Mihai Pintilie (Romania), Banda Magique de Korowori (Japan) and Plorinha do Lobo Marimba (Brazil). It also features some original material by members of Cwmni Nadolig Crymau (the National College of Music Society): songwritervocalists Dafydd Iwan Cerys Halliwell; harpist Cory Myers and composer Aled Jones. This summer sees the launch of another edition of its popular Bootleg Sessions series of live outdoor performances. For the first time ever it involves more than just bands: there are set pieces from choirs, orchestras and solo performers adding colour to the event. This year we welcome back folk rock trio Kincaid, which spent last season playing the free sessions on Mynydd Malltraeth beach near Aberaeron. Speaking about what they hope people will experience when they make their way out to play their set this summer, frontwoman Maggie Powell says ""We don't want anyone to be turned off because you can hear us talking amongst ourselves! And if your ears get tired we'll stop. If you're not listening then who's going to notice? So why bother turning up? At Bootlegs we aim to provide free entertainment so please come along! Come dressed appropriately - shorts or jeans, no shoes. Bring any kind of hat or sunhat. And bring food and drink."" Over four days in July, two musical groups called Direction To Everywhere - who were formed to perform during the 2012 Olympics Cultural Olympiad events - take to Mynydd Malltraeth beach north east of Swansea. Audiences will enjoy tracks written specifically for them through workshops involving local schoolchildren in Haverfordwest; dancers from Arran Dance Company performing collaboration choreographies created specially for the occasion; and a group of string players whose performance will feature each member making his or her instrument sing together. What all three projects share in common is the fact that they are taking place outside of the Olympic Park itself. In fact some of these experiences are being facilitated locally by Oceanhouse Community Sports Partnership, whose work with children and young people includes providing access to PA equipment, fields and facilities within schools and community hubs. Since 2008 a number of Farmradio festivals have taken place in different parts of the UK. These have typically involved farmers giving talks alongside acoustic acts, often in partnership with nearby societies such as agricultural organisations. Last autumn saw the inaugural meeting of a unique 'Music-Farm' network comprising seven regional circuits that brings together interested individuals and organisations working towards establishing similar networks across England, Scotland and Wales. They include practitioners ranging from producers and distributors to cafe owners, tourism boards and amateur musicians. Over the course of November many of those gathered met again to discuss how they could collaborate, both to support existing schemes and create alternative ways of delivering rural arts services. As well as offering inspiration to those looking to expand their repertoires, the White Horse Tavern RB band plays a key role in keeping the proceedings lighthearted, by encouraging people to dance while enjoying quality tunes and having lots of fun.

The digital bookseller has also promised to stop selling refurbished Kindles - cheaper devices bought back and sold again at full price - once initial discounts end on Wednesday. It says customers who buy new, preloaded Kindles can get them up to 30 per cent less than rivals such as Apple's iPad 2 or Samsung Galaxy tablet range. ""The introduction of these significant price cuts should provide more choices for those looking for an affordable ereader,"" John Kennedy, chief executive of online retail giant Amazon.com Inc., wrote in a blogpost announcing the changes. He did not say whether other products would follow suit. Earlier this month, reports emerged suggesting Apple was planning to announce discounted iPads as part of its latest iPhone release. But analysts have questioned why anyone else should make cheap tablets if all the profit is going into keeping costs down on the iPhone 5? Consumer group Which?, however, welcomed moves towards making electronic gadgets both more accessible and profitable.""We welcome today's news that pricing across the board is being reduced by Amazon. These cost savings should benefit both current buyers and future purchase decisions,"" Which?'s deputy director Richard Lloyd told BBC News. He added: ""It shouldn't come as a surprise that sellers are trying to keep their businesses sustainable amid fierce competition."" In recent weeks there has been growing dissatisfaction over high prices among consumers and politicians alike. On 6 September, Senator Al Franken (Democrat, Minnesota) asked representatives of three large technology companies - including Google, Microsoft and Facebook - about data protection practices, following criticisms over how personal information could be misused. Mr Franken called on tech firms to disclose which private emails and messages they store and what safeguards exist against misuse.

This move comes just days before the launch of two rival branded hardback books published by Penguin Group and HarperCollins. Both charge 20 each compared to Amazon's 9.99. Add in free delivery and current offers are both significantly lower than Amazon's own prices. Since October 2012 Amazon has offered second hand Kindle Fires for 80. While cheaper models go for around 100. 'To quote my colleague Michael Gove... I think we need radical change,' tweeted Ben Goldacre in response to the news. The Guardian's editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger described Amazon's decision as 'bad eyesight'. However he agreed with the firm's argument that people buy Kindles because they want something small enough to fit inside their bags when travelling.'Folks don't run out of power in the middle of trains journeys; Why do they [Kindle owners] use so much energy buying books?' he asked. Despite having the largest internet shopping empire in the world, the company still depends heavily on bricks-and-mortar stores like Tesco to distribute goods. Sales growth hit five years lows last calendar year and while Kindle sales remain strong most readers stick to reading content saved on computers rather than using the device itself. A report by Barclays analyst Anshuman Daga found that even though Amazon had moved away from physical brick-and-mortar shops, shoppers who used them showed no signs of switching to other retailers to avoid paying higher tax rates. Instead, booksellers in 16 countries where profits were taxed above 10, including Austria, France, Belgium and Ireland, saw sales drop 12.5.",0,15

He added that it was normal practice for councillors to take lunch breaks and return from holiday refreshed as well as having meetings during working hours A group wants to name the three-storey building after its founder Gordon Farrer - but is struggling against critics who say he can't be forgotten. The Deptford Technical College, which opened 60 years ago, now offers courses up to degree level and boasts 1,300 students. But many worry about whether it will survive when funding cuts are announced next month. Its future may lie with another controversial project planned for London's Docklands, where work begins this week on one of Europe's biggest office parks. Mr Farrer set up his business in May 1951, later moving into advertising. His brainchild grew and eventually provided over 110 different jobs. It also became home to more than 2,500 young people who studied art or design. Here is how it all began: Bridlington Library staff have voted overwhelmingly not to join Unison. Staff based at the town's library branch in West Greengate Street undertook three ballots. They took part last January amid warnings they could face strike action because the union wanted them to accept pay claims linked to pension changes. However they rejected those demands in March and then placed their proposals before members again. This time almost 80 backed staying out, while just 16 opted to stay involved - leaving the issue no closer to resolution. One member told the News she believed some workers felt ""betrayed"" at being asked to vote yes for something they thought should not go ahead. She described fears of job losses if the dispute dragged on and felt unhappy about what she called a 'disempowering mechanism' forcing the community's most valuable asset to take sides in the row between two big unions. Superintendent David Orr said: ""I am pleased our members have decided to remain within Unite... I believe that Bridlington needs good local public libraries so I would urge everyone to get behind us and support us getting services back running smoothly once again."" Head librarian Jackie Jackson agreed: ""We are disappointed that the majority of our membership either did not turn up to participate in the ballot process, despite repeated reminders and telephone calls, or chose to boycott it completely and indicate that they do not wish to become a member of Unite at any point in the foreseeable future. We hope therefore that those members who did vote will continue to fully support both us and Unite until such times as we reach agreement on matters relating to pensions."" In response to the result Mayor Graham Hatherall declared himself disappointed saying: ""This decision represents yet further evidence of discontent among library users. Many customers are very dissatisfied with the service provided by the library and very few want to recommend the service or use it regularly. ""What is really disappointing is that, even though library trustees have made significant savings since 200809, we still need to make more savings so that we can provide better value for money to the taxpayer. Based on findings like this, I don't think we should expect much sympathy from those vocal minority groups campaigning for higher taxes (who include Labour MPs) to fund improvements to other parts of the borough that cost less money. If you look around the country, we seem to spend billions on things that don't benefit local residents enough compared to countries like Germany."" On Friday Mrs Jackson insisted letters sent out explaining the ballot results had gone out before Christmas making a late bid to persuade non-members to opt in appear rather futile. She said: ""As far as I know the letters went out before Christmas but unfortunately we cannot confirm exactly when they were delivered. We understand that some postmen carried large bundles of mail around Kingsway and Shell Crescent South Tower sites, but these routes were changed in September 2012 following the merger of the Royal Mail into Post Office Ltd. Having checked with colleagues, we found that the same roads were covered by route 5806 which does not deliver to extensions to Bridlington seafront. So, although staff received letters we couldn't locate any records confirming delivery. A number of staff reported receiving postal items addressed to themselves, but these were left outside with others waiting to collect deliveries. ""Obviously if anyone knows of anything else that might help please let me know at . Our focus right now must be ensuring we keep open as long as possible with the minimum impact on working conditions.""

"The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think? No computer has ever passed the quiz, but a number of chatbots have come close. Piaw and his colleagues say that by using machine learning techniques together with natural language processing, bots could be trained to pass tests like this one in just 10 minutes. They presented six questions at random intervals. It was enough time for users to answer each correctly. A human would need 30 seconds per question, according to Piaw. But all it took for their bot was four seconds - an average speed of 115 words per minute (WPM). After training its answers to bypass security measures, the bot managed 116 WPM when challenged by other researchers' volunteers. That means you'd read about nine books during your walk from the subway station down the street. [Top 11 Chatbot Facts] ""We believe these results will usher in new era of conversational AI,"" said co-author Jeremy Howard, Carnegie Mellon University professor of computer science who created the system used to develop Siri and Alexa. ""By giving computers the ability to understand what we say without being preprogrammed, there comes a transition where we decide how much control the machine should have over our lives."" Another challenge the project faced: getting a huge dataset of real life conversations into the correct format needed for speech recognition. To do this, the team had more than 40 volunteer participants spend two hours chatting via Skype calls while typing out text messages as responses. The result is a database of 1 million unique combinations of userchatbot interactions. Each contains full transcripts of the conversation between them. These include webcam images, body movements, facial expressions and even eye contact. By analyzing all those factors, the research team built algorithms that enabled bots to better discern which utterances were meant as replies and which ones weren't. This study represents only the first step towards creating advanced artificial intelligence capable of fooling us into thinking it's a person. For example, future tests may ask participants to pick familiar objects, or name brands of food items. If that happens, it remains to be seen whether humans can tell the difference between the intelligent chatterbox program and someone desperate for attention. You'll definitely want to apply yourself before taking part in any of the following chatbot challenges! Seriously, though; take my advice and hand Phineas some tissues right now.

A number of witnesses have reported seeing three men running from the scene before they drove off together into the woods. One witness said: 'They shouted ""We're all going for it,"" switched their lights on full beam then sped away in one vehicle moments later' Another claimed that the accomplices ran through fields towards Icknield Way, just near where the incident took place. Police are still trying to trace them but no arrests have yet been made. Several press photographers had arrived at the park when the incident happened as part of an effort to get pictures which could show the accident itself because reporters often missed such things out sometimes due to poor timing or lack of opportunity. They certainly got some good shots. Police divers wearing white overalls entered the flooded Vauxhall S-Type about 5pm. But the damage meant its nose was partly under water - though not enough to be under pressure. It is believed there were people inside at the time. Witnesses jokingly called 999 saying the driver would need rescuing, while others told how shocked pedestrians jumped onto cars with wheels up in order to reach dry land. Many couldn't believe what they saw unfold in front of their eyes. Other drivers stopped so the motorists involved could safely climb out of the vehicle and walk home free. In vain. Others tried to help but failed when the rain started pouring down even harder. The motorist was eventually rescued shortly afterwards. Emergency services raced around Melton Mowbray Road, near Nottinghamshire Railway Station and Market Square shopping centre, to check if anyone else needed assistance. There was also concern that a person might have fallen over after coming from nearby shops and entered the floodwater underneath a bridge. Also parked cars in the area had become partially submerged. By 6.30pm crews pulled back having found nobody trapped or needing rescue. However, several other vehicles remained parked along side busy roads including Broadbent Lane and Petergate St, where sandbags prevented further flooding from reaching the road surface.

"The birds caused ""extensive damage"" by making holes in parts of the spire made of cedar at St Mary's Church in Headley near Epsom. A grant of PS78,000 was awarded to restore its clock tower after it was damaged during a storm on 9th February 2012. In November 2018, following three years' work including 2.3m of restoration and repair works undertaken between May 2017 and August 2019, pigeons were once again removed from the roof of St Mary's Church because their droppings had been found to be causing significant structural damage which could result in serious collapse. This time around pigeon control is being carried out as part of a project known as 'Pigeon City', led by Kent Pest Control and funded with support from English Heritage and the Churches Conservation Trust. The scheme involves using a proven technique (using bird-proof netting) developed for dealing with feral cats and over 1 million man hours have already gone into this first phase. As a result, the church has successfully prevented further deterioration, thus enabling repair grants of up to 180k to be applied for under Building Preservation Grants Scheme 2: 2014-2019 funding rounds.

"Voters here have yet to make their choice in the regional election. But already there's something of the victory march in the chancellor's step. It has been years since her party was last so high up on a national opinion poll, and she is making good this week what some critics had predicted would be her disastrous autumn slump. As it happens, you don't need an opinion survey or any sort of scientific measurement to know that Angela Merkel, leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU), is back with us again after all these months when everyone expected - even perhaps hoped for - the worst. And if you believe polls at least, history will agree. In late May 2015, just days before more than 30 million Germans went to vote, every single one showed voters wanting another term for Ms Merkel rather than backing her CDU-led coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party SPD. The disaster of ""Merkozentrum"" Merkel center began then. But today there are hardly any other options: Chancellor Merkel leads a four-party grand alliance in parliament, by far the strongest bloc possible under Germany's electoral system. She sits high atop both domestic politics and Europe; her biggest problem now seems how not to cling too tightly to either role. That should help explain why no less than five decades ago, over the course of two terms in office, from 1974 to 1982, Ms Merkel did exactly as many others thought almost impossible about Mr Schmidturm Neukolln 7677: moved into Berlin's famous Kaiserdamm bridgehead of flats.

"Chasing 268 in the first Test, Australia were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia - the world's top-ranked Test team and reigning champions of the 50-over game - had done what they set out to do, taking a 1-0 lead at home against New Zealand on Wednesday night. The last time Australia lost to South Africa was two years ago when Shaun Marsh crashed 93 not out off just 26 balls; since then that feat has been matched only by Steve Smith (102) against Pakistan earlier this year. That adds up to three back-to-back hundreds for Marsh after he hit 143 in Adelaide 12 months ago. This is his second double ton in Tests: also 159 v India at Ranchi in December 2017 when it looked as though he might be bowling himself into retirement. And if there was any lingering doubt about his ability to go big or small, there seemed no longer to be now following another majestic effort from No8. It helps when you can add Jonathan Trott's 224 to your tally too. All four men score more than 150 tonight - something none have managed before inside an innings against each other at Eden Park. But the tone was set long before that. The pitch appeared to favour batsmen early on but changed considerably towards its end bearing down heavily on seamers like Aaron Finch who are often expected to provide Australia with some early wickets. It should suit lefties such as Joe Mennie, Tim Paine and Kane Williamson while swing bowler Mark Craig will get plenty of help on one day's play. Expectations outside cricket circles would suggest both sides start slowly here given the quality of players involved and the intensity of the competition. Yet this match could still go either way depending upon how well England bowlers plan to exploit gaps during an already congested schedule. ""There are 10 hours between these teams,"" said former captain Graeme Swann, whose side won 2-1 away last November and the series opener 3-1 in 2016. ""We've gone through hell so far."" Early signs suggested their previous experience may save them. When Indian paceman Umesh Yadav dropped Mohammad Shami off Moeen Ali for 7, England's quicks took immediate advantage. James Anderson removed Aiden O'Brien lbw eventually having followed Stuart Broad's departure before Ben Stokes trundled Ishant Sharma over mid-on for 6 after his partner Adil Rashid fell cheaply. If there was going to be an upset, it wouldn't happen until lunchtime on Day Three when the hosts reached 48 for 0. While the spinners continued to negate the threat posed by Steven Finn and Craig Overton, Jofra Archer helped themselves with figures of 5-5-2-3 and ten overs ended with Root steering a feathery catch behind. For England allrounder Liam Plunkett did much better and replaced Jimmy Anderson, who lasted 20 minutes before being dismissed by Mitchell Starc. His replacement claimed 11 new scalps including Chris Woakes caught behind and Sam Curran stumped as the tourists entered lunch on 49 for 4. They departed looking decidedly unimpressed however and only Morgan went past 30. As the session ebbed away, again English resistance crumbled quickly. Gary Ballance next played across a ball which nipped off stump leaving Nathan Lyon to claim his fourth scalp with his first delivery. He continues to prove exactly why he has become such a valuable weapon for Australia at this time of year despite his relatively short career. Matt Renshaw came under the scanner immediately afterwards for overstepping as Australia required 25 runs off 28 balls. With Trotty and Moises Henriques struggling, it gave Clarke an opportunity to make amends for an error at slip when he edged Kulesh Chahal to gully where Alex Hales completed a fine catch. The pair shared 38 before Clarke found his feet once more and pushed on in partnership with Virat Kohli. Their stand took the edge off proceedings but neither scored freely nor displayed enough patience, perhaps because the conditions remained tricky. The duo added 40 odd runs together before getting separated shortly before tea, despite sharing five partnerships of 10 by the break. There were 27 dot balls today compared to 14 yesterday and many high scoring, low result games seem unlikely to materialise here with pitches offering little turn around the bat - certainly nothing approaching pace. Rarely does the slightest hint of a false stroke come as a surprise around Eden Park. Trotts-et-retour later brought in Buttler and Root - meaning Bennett will come in after playing every single available outfield spot in their 90s chase in Adelaide. Neither of those options has yet proven reliable at Auckland though and while the failure of others to capitalise is usually connected with fatigue, there is always room for question marks surrounding Root's form. Kyle Abbott, who topped 79 twice but was unable to take a wicket this morning, started things positively with a boundary made possible by a wider line.

"The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants ""public good"" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like drugs - as opposed to being lumped together with conventional foodstuffs, on an area-by-area basis. GM plants are already routinely planted across almost half of Europe. Two thirds is found in the EU but most countries have opted out or partially opted out including France, Spain, Germany and Italy. A few other nations such as Austria, Poland and Finland have adopted a more open approach and allow their farmers to grow them without restrictions. The remaining regions include Belarus, Ukraine and Russia where many people still believe that genetically modified organisms pose health risks. We asked the CST whether it had conducted any analysis into how GM crop trials might affect insect pests, particularly those which feed on grains like maize, wheat and barley. Read MoreNew report reveals extent of global land grabbing They replied: ""In addition to its scientific expertise, we also draw upon the experience gained from our involvement in a number of Codex Alimentarius committees, including animal feeds, pesticides, foods, nutrition and plant protection products; and broader stakeholder engagement work."" Codex Alimentaries was set up by the World Trade Organisation to ensure safe and consistent standards between different countries. The organisation aims to improve safety, efficacy and quality of food produced worldwide and ensures international trade takes place within these guidelines. But critics say it's not doing enough because there has been little regulation against genetic engineering in commercial agriculture. They argue this means GM crops can spread contamination through crossbreeding and gene flow - a process whereby genes randomly move from one species to another via pollen or seed. Contamination is seen by some as a major threat especially when they impact native ecosystems. Read More",0,47
"Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Wednesday, showed no cognitive benefits to those who exercised regularly for just half an hour a day; they performed nearly as well when given rest breaks between workouts or shorter bouts of higher intensity activity. It's not clear why longer amounts of moderate physical activity did not improve memory and other cognition; it could be because low blood flow is associated with poorer performance during short bursts of high-intensity aerobic exercise - it's possible that lasting periods of lower energy use would have been too much without sufficient recovery time afterward. It also might mean we need more than 20 minutes of vigorous exercise per week (which would equate to about four sessions most days) if we want long term improvements in our brains. The study involved people aged 40-65 years old, randomly assigned to one of three groups: Those participating in regular vigorous exercise, which included walking briskly; moderate exercise such as swimming at around 60 effort level of maximum heart rate; or sitting doing nothing but their own thoughts. Participants were asked to do this daily from March 2014 until August 2015, then tested again after 12 months by completing various mental tests including identifying words that rhyme and repeating sequences of numbers backwards. This was achieved through two separate studies, using two independent samples of participants. In both cases, they reported similar results: People taking part in these activities had better working memory, attention span and ability to remember names. During testing, there wasn't any significant difference in how fast these individuals responded. This suggests that intensive exercise has a positive effect on general thinking skills rather than speed alone. Another strength of the research was the fact that all participants lived within driving distance of the University of Exeter campus where researchers monitored them before each test. Doing so helped ensure that confounding factors like stress levels weren't unfairly affecting their responses. But while this may give us some clues as to what a healthy lifestyle can achieve, it's difficult to say how impactful exercise really is on our minds. A 2011 study found that older adults who walked once every five days over an eight month period reduced the risk of dementia by almost 50, raising concerns over whether increasing your physical fitness will hinder cognitive decline later in life. Much work needs to be done to establish exactly what the relationship between exercise and learning are. That said, the data collected shows that different types of prolonged physical activity seem to affect our long-term memory differently. Moderate exercise appears to help maintain overall cognition, improving working memory, accuracy of recalling names, word order recognition and figuring out rhymes versus reciting lists backward in English speaking populations. Similarly, scores rose with intense exercise, although only among non-English speakers and not among men. However, those taking part in vigorous exercise didn't fare quite as well, showing significantly worse recall rates for noun pairs compared to others. They even struggled slightly less with ability to recite the alphabet, perhaps suggesting they use fewer resourcesare less efficient learners. One odd finding was that men tended to show greater improvement across the board in remembering noun pairs following vigorous exercise, possibly indicating differences in intellectual ability based on gender. When considering these findings, it seems likely that different kinds of improvements in cognition are linked to different aspects of physical health. For instance, certain conditions tend to worsen the performance of people engaged in high intensity exercises, particularly cardiovascular ones like running. Inflammation is associated with poor muscle function, potentially hindering stamina. If you're training intensely, make sure you get adequate sleep and drink plenty of water throughout the process to keep yourself healthy - body failure happens far quicker than mind fatigue! However, as mentioned above, just 30 minutes worth of vigorous exercise won't reap the same rewards. Reducing sedentary behavior is important since remaining seated anyway contributes to obesity, which itself lowers IQ. Likewise, avoiding alcohol helps cut down on oxidative damage to cells and improves processing speeds. And eating healthier foods reduces inflammation towards the nervous system and prevents insulin resistance. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables means you'll naturally produce vitamins B6 and E, two nutrients proven to aid mental functioning. You should strive to eat less meat though, especially red meats and processed animal products, since they contain inflammatory substances in abundance.",0,48

"Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would ""seriously undermine"" Britain's ""deterrent."" And he said he would be worried if such a refusal were ever taken up by others. That might sound like an argument for keeping nukes, but it is also an expression of one of the biggest problems in Western thinking about defence: the temptation to rely on deterrence rather than preparation and actual defense. The danger of this mindset comes when decisions are made based not on threats from adversaries or even perceived threat levels - which can vary wildly over time; nor on examining whether they're capable of doing harm at all, as we saw with Libya in 2011 - but simply on what will deter them. That's why Britain decided not to have any ballistic missiles after its 1972 unilateral withdrawal from anti-ballistic missile treaty talks (it did retain submarine-launched cruise missiles), because their development had been abandoned and the cost prohibitive without being able to deploy them. In other words, deterrent was too important. If you don't believe in deterrence, then either don't make those expensive systems, or do so reluctantly and under duress. But once you've got your system built, there's no point in having something which could put you out of business. The only way forward now is through debate rather than dogma.",0,55

"Adam Wilson, of Lostock Hall, was found with serious injuries at a property on Albrighton Crescent in Lostock Hall near Preston in September. Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall , has been charged over the incident An investigation into an alleged assault offers fresh hope that good will prevail after two teenage boys from Lancashire were left fighting for their lives following horrific abuse and torture while held captive by other teenagers in Greater Manchester. Jason Taylor (left), 20, of Lostock Hall, and Andrew Marwood, 18, of Church Hill Road, Eccleshall, have both been arrested as part of Operation Ashdown which is examining allegations made against three men - including Brad Sefton-Taylor, 19, who appears to be his brother's best friend. Two others are being sought and remain under police guard. It emerged last night how one victim told officers he had spoken about what happened during an earlier meeting between himself and some members of another group when they met him outside court after having convictions upheld. It also seems certain further arrests could follow. The restive local community - where many feel James Bulger's killers should never walk free - will not allow this latest scandal to pass without challenge after the case collapsed yesterday amid claims police withheld crucial information vital to its prosecution. Relatives say detectives gave false assurances that there would be no more delays until it became clear the first trial was collapsing. They later tried to prevent them attending evidence sessions while insisting they did not know why charges had fallen apart. Several victims, accompanied by lawyers, turned up unannounced at the Oldham magistrates' court hoping to see if the proceedings might eventually go ahead but were forced out before any decision was reached. One said: 'The judge said we must return tomorrow morning.' Supporters tell of 'nightmare' ordeal Chief Superintendent Jon Boutcher confirmed last night a second man had been identified whose DNA matched samples taken from inside the house. And relatives claimed the youngster was named as suspects in the original report sent by police to CPS bosses. A source close to the family revealed: ""They thought someone else was going down. But then came these dreadful revelations. Now all bets are off. If nothing happens now justice won't happen. Wherever the truth lies, whoever breaks faith with those young people deserves full force retribution. These children cannot get back their childhood - or the adulthood they missed out upon because of Brad Sefton-Taylor and company. Alex Jones died as a result of the abuse my son suffered. He deserved better than to die alone and scared, unable even to understand what he had done wrong. His case ended here today simply because nobody cared enough about him to do anything. My boy deserved so much more. I am taking legal advice. We may sue. Justice needs to take place whatever the cost. This can't just wash away like yesterday's rain. "" An officer working on the case described the turmoil surrounding the allegations on Friday afternoon as shocking. Speaking anonymously, they added: ""Within 15 minutes of speaking to Andy Marwood, our lines crashed down again. Some of us saw this coming but it still feels quite unreal. I think some of us believed what he was saying was true. By Monday it was absolutely obvious something wasn't right. We got involved but soon realised it was far bigger than anyone anticipated. He kept referring to this group of five guys living together. When we finally spoke to the name two things struck me straightaway. First, he didn't seem very bothered by what he knew, either way. Second, every time we referenced the guy everyone seemed to turn round and look towards Bradley [Sefton-Taylor]. How could you ignore someone called Mark? There were only four names mentioned anyway. Then he started talking about a girl called Amber. She said she'd seen Barry McCartney carrying her through town. That meant someone carried one of our kids around in the boot of a car. No wonder they're terrified."" Another policeman said: ""This thing went well beyond football hooliganism. Our sources tell us the number of individuals suspected of involvement in what took place exceeds 90. ""We've already interviewed 10 male youths aged 16-19, adults and girls who lived nearby and across Manchester and Salford."" Last week we reported how Mark Wright was released early despite remaining on remand since being accused of the attack. In fact he walked out of jail four months ago suffering extreme emotional stress related illness. Presiding magistrate Ian Bruce QC committed Wright to continue receiving treatment under supervision.MOST READ IN NEWS PURE EVIL Boy, 2, finds dead body of dad on beach mauled 48 times after setting light to bag SCHOOLgirl FEARS Teen faces life imprisonment over sex attacks on schoolgirls RAPE HELL Schoolmates flashing baby pics exit dog WHIP OUT Thief strips naked runs away after rummaging through woman's pssy CAR CRASH Moment driver ploughs into bus stop causing major kerfuffle LASTIS CON DOUR NANala PM turnover we board to see to ute to hasnateentook to urnable} no different;",0,57
"""We save people here every day,"" said the 46-year-old policeman - managing to sound both proud and chiding and the same time. Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to this work, despite his own growing doubts about it. ""I first started in September 2009..."" he began. And there was another thing that struck him: ""There are no female police officers."" At least not with any kind of regularity or for long hours at a stretch. In fact, he'd hardly ever seen one outside occasional patrols by women who had taken up policing as part of an employment campaign during the 1980s. After all, it is just after midnight when some woman walks into a police station's reception area; she wants her husband brought home because they have been arguing (the argument continues on their terrace), or perhaps something else altogether has happened. And it is too late if you don't call on night duty officers immediately, so that's what policemen must do. It could be anything from a domestic disturbance to a robbery attempted on the corner opposite your house... The only exception would be if the incident happens inside a prison complex where such cases were often handled immediately by representatives of the prison guards' union instead of calling on the local constabulary. But mainly it means having to get out of bed before dawn. There's nobody quite like a young man from Sidi Bel Abbes able to pull off a uniform faster than a 20-something cop fresh out of basic training. They start patrolling well after 10pm. The village's streets are empty - except for cats which prowl around and dogs which bark loudly. Sometimes they meet other residents along the way. Most nights end without an arrest being made - unless a new crime occurs right away. This can be frustrating but also calming, since most complaints come to nothing anyway. Police stations in villages usually close down once everything shuts down and officials disappear into private homes for tea. Policemen still try to carry on working over weekends, especially when facing the maelstrom of Eid al Adha prayers later in August. The celebrations last until early September. At times, though, it is the peacefulness amid chaos that strikes Mr Hassan. What awaits them at every stop? A scuffle caused by a car accident. An angry mob duelling outside someone's shop selling expired foodstuff. Or even more rarely, reports of armed robberies and kidnappings. Even then, these occurrences are rare enough already. When they happen, things move quickly: the cops radio for backup units nearby to secure the scene while waiting for reinforcements coming in via various backstreets. After that, it's mostly talking through loudspeakers followed by a personal inspection of each place, looking to see whether anyone needs help in particular places. For example, by roads and train tracks where accidents regularly occur. That's why Mr Hassan always carries a flashlight to check under cars for hidden bombs and explosive devices left behind by terrorists themselves. It was while following up suspected bomb detonation sites that Mr Hassan's career really took off. He received a commendation certificate from his superiors citing how he intervened along five different routes to thwart several terrorist acts across Algeria last year alone. Mr Hassan himself attributes his success to luck. All the same, he believes it takes a certain knack to know when something suspicious is going on, and when it isn't. Nobody knows better than he does those telltale signs. The job makes him feel indispensable - the heart of the nation. If you're missing a policeman in a remote French town, chances are high that it won't take long for word to spread throughout public media. No matter the distance between towns you will find yourself hearing just as much about police officer Nabil Mihoub's heroic intervention as about Magali Boukhari's jihadis' bid foiled by authorities. For Mr Hassan, however, life doesn't become easier if the entire country seems to rate him highly. As a Muslim, he finds any praise disconcerting. So when one colleague, upon completing his obligatory Friday prayer, strolled past a group of fellow worshippers and thanked God for giving rise to those brave men and women, Mr Hassan promptly piped up, saying ""that's us!"" His interlocutor didn't seem fazed by it. 'So what?' he asked. Another colleague standing nearby agreed. Then the conversation lapsed again as Mr Hassan set off towards a neighbouring mosque. He's not doing too badly in life. Not yet resigned to accepting Allah's gifts gracefully, he does keep up hopes that one day it might change. Meanwhile, he enjoys the respect he gets from passersby whenever he strolls alongside them. People smile at him gratefully, knowing full well that he's completely devoted to keeping Algerian society safe and free. While others walk past him without stopping to say hello, Mr Hassan never complains.",0,58
"The 23-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, saved a penalty in normal time and one in a shoot-out when the Chairboys knocked Blackpool out of the EFL Trophy in January. And, having just been named as Trevor Hemmings's Under 21 Player of Year following his debut season at Old Trafford, he could be an exciting prospect for Louis van Gaal. While United will have to let Nani leave due to Football Association rules prohibiting clubs from registering players under 24 - ""a ridiculous rule that does not even make sense"" says Fergie fansite Red Devils Talk - there is no doubt Rooney can still provide quality performances for this side. Indeed, if the former Everton midfielder were an established first team player today it would probably be him leading the line rather than Angel Di Maria or Robin Van Persie because Rooney has never looked better since making his return from major knee surgery last summer. He scored 20 goals across all competitions last term; what more needs to be said? The only thing stopping Rafa Benitez getting plenty out of him could well be David Moyes himself but hopefully Van Gaal won't be too wedded to the highly regarded Dutchman anymore than Moyes was to Sam Allardyce (oops).",0,59
"The 25-year-old claimed her maiden able-bodied national title on Sunday and won team gold with England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. But to qualify for Rio, Brown would have to compete in two events - swimming and archery - which she deemed too tough a prospect after recent exertions. ""I can't do it,"" said the wheelchair racer who suffered spinal fusion surgery last year when training ""fell apart"" due to back pain. Brown says she is determined not only to make history by winning an individual double but also become Britain's first ever para athlete to win Olympic gold using Paralympic rules. There will be no qualifying rounds to decide qualification slots; any country that bids gets one swimmer automatically as part of their quota. It means there are seven spots available to each nation and Brown admits they could all go to men if she doesn't medal. Britain's next best chance lies in joint silver medals going to Scotland's Helen Richardson and Georgia Davies. The pair were involved in a fierce battle until the dying moments of the final race which saw Canada emerge victorious. They finished level on points and needed the head judge to declare them equal before stepping out onto the podium together for an emotional embrace. Richardson had previously said her biggest fear was coming into London with so much else stacked against her: injuries picked up over the past few years underlining how hard she has been working. She is aiming to improve this four months' preparation time from Glasgow 2014 - where she took bronze behind Sunderland school girl Jazmin Sawyers (1) - and remembers being at times overwhelmed during the weeks leading up to it. But the 28-year-old insisted despite everything going wrong at these games, her focus remains unwavering. And although she admitted nerves might get the better of her as the pressure mounts on Saturday night, Richardson indicated that her mindset for the rest of the week should be based around pride rather than emotion. ""This whole experience has just blown my mind so far because I never thought I'd be here,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It hasn't really sunk in yet. If you come away thinking 'this wasn't such a great experience', then you're doing yourself more damage."" She added: ""At least now I can say what happened. If we win anything, we'll look like heroes but even if we don't - well, at least we went down fighting. That gives us something to hold on to in life.""",0,61
"Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed on both sides of Queen's Square, and there was a new policy which meant that patients were seen by paramedics within 30 minutes The ambulance service says it will almost certainly face legal action from four NHS trusts for failing to meet its targets during September. This week's figures show that 93 of people who needed AE treatment in Welsh hospitals got treated ""on time"" - meaning they arrived within four hours or less of when their 999 call came through. That represented an improvement on September 2015, but a drop compared with October 2014 - when 97 received urgent medical care within expected times. It means that not only did fewer than 1,000 people arrive late, according to the data released this week, but also fewer never arrived at all because staff could not find them. The latest statistics are based on first attendances after 9pm. They cover 55,000 calls to hospital services each month. And despite improvements since July 2012, some NHS boards have still been found wanting over how few people were able to be helped safely and effectively inside a timely fashion, prompting anger among doctors who say delays mean lives can be endangered. Dr Clare Gerada: Hospitals must hold back painkillers until CPR is tried David DaviesPA Wire Hinkley Point C nuclear power station near Bridgend, South Wales - despite repeated warnings about health dangers associated with living nearby such as cancer clusters; the government has refused to publish any information regarding investigations into ""dangers."" International research suggests residents living close to one of Britain's most controversial developments report higher rates of respiratory problems, even though experts warn against making comparisons due to differences between studies, particularly those carried out abroad. At least 25 scientific papers have been published stating levels of certain cancers including leukemia and birth defects are significantly increased around the world where Hinkley operates. However, the UK Government insists no evidence shows there is anything wrong with the project's operation. Many campaigners claim that the company behind building work Hinkley has provided misleading publicity to the public. Lorna Thomas, whose son died three years ago aged 14 months old of chloroform poisoning after being exposed to low doses while playing outside his home, said she felt let down. She told Sky News: 'We've spent the past 10 years campaigning for something better. We want to save our children,' adding that her family had been forced to relive painful memories every year later on. Another campaigner Steve Smith warned that there would be hundreds of deaths like Daniel's unless ministers acted now. Despite urging the prime minister earlier today he pointed out that Mr Cameron's own constituency of Witney falls just two miles away from the site. Advertisement NHS England reveals it has so far identified 141 concerns relating to patient safety potentially related to performance issues. This includes 23 cases referred directly to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), 120 referrals reported to Monitor following poor outcomes in other parts of the country and eight reports sent to local authorities dealing specifically with safeguarding complaints. At the end of November, the CQC announced 18 further probes involving 111 organisations across English healthcare systems took place since March 2016. Last night angry MSP Margaret Mitchell raised questions about whether Scotland contributes enough towards national funding and what investments it gets rather than relying upon block grants paid for by Westminster. She said: 'In terms of putting money aside for investment, we rely too much on a set cash sum. In April I tabled amendments calling for greater devolution and we need to look again at how money should flow from Holyrood to support the delivery of essential health services. 'I am disappointed that Scotland spends relatively poorly on health compared to other countries. 'It is vital we ensure adequate resources are invested in delivering high-quality healthcare.' A Scottish Government spokesman responded yesterday saying: 'Healthcare spending per head currently stands at 2,851 above the UK average. These results demonstrate significant progress towards meeting the target of an overall increase of 3.6 per cent annually up to 202122. 'There remains room for us to improve however, especially if we remain committed to improving access to clinical leadership in primary care throughout the year.' The problem relates to the number of GP appointments available to see elderly patients. There are just 28 sessions booked each day - well below the figure from December 2013 - suggesting thousands of older people may have waited weeks for a slot. Most worrying was the fact that the trend appeared to coincide with a period of heavy snowfall leading to many sick and frail pensioner having difficulty getting to surgeries and GPs opening hours extended to accommodate record numbers of walk ins under arrangements put in place ahead of winter pressures. All these factors combined led to another surge in outpatient attendance on Christmas Day when nearly 100,000 extra visits took place - making it clear that the plan is soundly rooted firmly stuck Cal tactical priority technical obsessed value setting itself,was crystalised at market going nowhere else is the prospect of the role of",0,62
"Nashat Melhem was tracked down to a mosque in his home town of Arara and killed in a gun battle, police said. The attacks sparked a huge hunt and security forces later arrested more than 100 people as they raided homes across the region The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has flared up again this week following rocket attacks by militants from Gaza on southern Israel. Israel responded with air strikes that left at least seven Palestinians dead after two rockets were fired into Tel Aviv and one fell short just outside Jerusalem's Old City, killing an 11-year-old girl. To try to boost its deterrence against Islamist insurgents Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Israel launched what it calls ""Operation Pillar of Defence,"" which targeted nearly 200 targets in the Gaza Strip during the first night alone. Hamas claimed responsibility for firing three Grad missiles toward Beersheba early Tuesday morning (via AP). One landed near the city centre; another hit vehicles inside Ashkelon but failed to explode; while a third struck empty land west of the coastal city. All projectiles came down within 20 kilometres of entering Israel. No civilians or soldiers have been injured so far. Israel retaliated with tank shelling and airstrikes on areas where insurgents are believed to be launching rockets. Both sides escalated their rhetoric over the coming days.",0,63
"The inquiry will look at historical abuse of children in care in Scotland. But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said he could not believe there were no places for young people in care to be looked after properly John Findlay fears the BBC's investigation into Scottish child protection services is unlikely to examine his experiences and those of other former pupils from Aberlour House School, which closed almost 40 years ago. He has written to the corporation saying it should hold an independent review that includes former residents of the boys' home. It comes as a report by Professor Gillian Parker revealed shocking levels of ill-treatment of youngsters during their time in state care between 1965 and 1995. Survivors have called on Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) - the body responsible for making TV programmes such as Newsnight - to put pressure on social work authorities to provide adequate support so they do not end up back in institutions. Mr Findlay spent eight months at Aberlour House before being moved first to another institution and then to Glasgow where he attended private school until age 18. He explained how some boys had been beaten with iron bars; others restrained in solitary confinement or locked within cages; many suffered prolonged isolation and neglect, watching each other die of starvation, cold and disease. Mr Findlay says: ""I don't think anyone can say these things weren't happening when I lived there, but we didn't know about them because we couldn't speak out. We kept quiet much too long. And now PSB are looking to investigate what happened here. That would never happen if someone came forward today."" Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines Steve Ainsworth, whose father Roddy used to run the school, admitted some gross negligence took place. The admission led to calls for him to resign, despite protests from staff who had voiced concerns over abusive practices towards students decades earlier. When asked why nobody knew what went on, Mr Ainsworth replied: ""We've thought long and hard about this."" In letters addressed to Sir Paul Kennedy, director general of public services, Professor Parker said she understood reasons why survivors may want to remain anonymous but added: ""As historians ourselves we understand that behind every important piece of history there lies the testimony of one individual, even though often unrecorded. In our case, we wish only to pay tribute to all those individuals and groups who courageously brought evidence to light regarding practice in schools and residential homes across Britain during the 1950s to 1980s."" She adds that most victims did eventually come forward. Professor Parker also highlighted cases reported among current day professionals in Scotland whom she found reluctant to talk publicly about issues raised in her report, including Dr Michael Drinkwater, friend of Lord Haskins, chairman of NHS Board of Scotland. She points out: ""They may find themselves facing discrimination, change management problems, unfriendly colleagues ... Some fear professional reprisals against organisations or themselves. This needn't always be the result, however, as they continue speaking truth to power."" After hearing claims made recently by Mr Findlay, Mike Pittman QC confirmed to me last night: ""Aberlour House deserves further attention and scrutiny. It needs to face up to its past record. If any other institution or organisation seeks closure under similar circumstances, there must be rigorous checks conducted beforehand to ensure no wrong doing takes place."" If you are able to make contact with Mr Findlay, please send your message through my website . Alternatively details can be left with Rowena Irving, editor of Passages Scotland Kids magazine at , . An inquiry into institutional sexual abuse in Scotland and England was launched yesterday. Childcare Minister Edward Timpson released preliminary findings following a lengthy probe into inappropriate conduct involving vulnerable children in various UK settings since 1945. Fourteen recommendations related to improved reporting procedures, training and managing complaints processes. One recommendation pertained specifically to Scotland, calling for a study to establish whether children without parental consent entered care voluntarily or because of alleged maltreatment by parents. Among submissions received by government, there were numerous examples of sexual misconduct in childcare facilities, resulting in physical harm or death of unsuspecting youngsters. Some of the allegations included girls as young as 10 having sex with older foster fathers. Others involved abductions and rapes carried out by monks and nuns in religious order dominated youth shelters. At least three situations involved sexual assault committed en masse, in circumstances seemingly designed to avoid detection. Another set of disturbing facts emerged relating to one of Scotland's leading charities overseeing Britain's third largest orphanage network. Despite the fact that more than 4,000 kids resided at St Joseph's Orphanage Industrial Home, Perthshire, till early 1970's, little information was ever known to accessionists.

"So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's history was an understandable challenge. The FA Cup win over Milton Keynes Dons at Stadium MK on Saturday will surely be seen by some fans as evidence that Grant McCann has turned things around under his management since being appointed following Derrek Moore's departure to join Sheffield Wednesday last month; however, this is far from any kind of guarantee and there can still be no guarantees during what remains of the season when so much hangs upon results of late. Whether or not you agree with the negative sentiment among supporters towards Craig Shakespeare - he left Leicester City after all - it did seem inevitable that he would ultimately take up another role within football given the situation the game finds itself in currently. Even if we are looking forward to another stint managing England (despite never having managed anything else), I am sure many people across sport have considered how best they could move into coaching roles elsewhere. For someone like me though, there seems only ever going to be two options: work somewhere where your job title inevitably comes before your personal name, or become self-employed and potentially earn less but also gain total control. Since coming out of retirement earlier this year, I find myself thinking about my dream career scenario quite often: working closely alongside Garry Monk at Leeds United. It might sound odd considering both men were once members of our own staff here at Madejski Stadium, but these days their paths diverge significantly... When I started writing for these pages back in December 2011, my first post became something of a diary entry entitled 'The Impact Of A Football Club Manager On An Individual Player Or Coach In Their Career Path,"" which looked at just such a relationship between Geoff Thomas and John Beckwith at Millwall. If memory serves correctly, that original piece came out from rehearsals for a production of Henry V directed by Stephen Unwin, but as it progressed through several drafts, it eventually spoke most truthfully about my time spent working as a journalist covering Southampton FC in the mid 2000s. With hindsight, I suppose I should acknowledge the fact that then I was simply performing the same sort of function which Steve Bower now does at Reading, too, although I don't recall feeling any similar sense of unease while heading off each day to cover matches for the Daily Echo way back then!

And with Bristol Rovers visiting Wolves in top spot, David Ospina says promotion rivals must unite for big push on Championship survival. Here, Paul Wilson previews crucial games and gives a few bold predictions ahead of the weekend's action... Paul Warneby (pwarnerfootball) Brighton v Brentford - it doesn't get much bigger than this in terms of significance both locally and further afield - unless you fancy seeing Borussia Monchengladbach hold Bayern Munich to a draw at home this week. Having claimed the Championship play-off crown courtesy of a fightback against Stoke yesterday, Brighton may well argue that the player-friendly nature of their 6-3 victory means they deserve the chance of facing Premier League opposition in Tuesday night's EFL Cup semi-final second leg in south coast style rather than traditionally playing everything ""behind closed doors"" in front of sparse crowds such as those afforded to Nottingham Forest a couple of years ago in the Capital One cup final. That said, I'm told the atmosphere inside the Amex will remain relatively reserved until Brighton's players do achieve their goal of returning to the Premier league next term. There will be plenty of scarves aloft in Sussex tonight regardless of whether Brighton go onto the Wembley pitch in proper white shirts with blue trim. But if Graham Potter and co manage to advance past West Ham via penalty shootouts, the decision over shirt colour will enter the realm of practicality whilst also serving to highlight whatever divisional divide exists today between the competition's three English divisions. At least, I hope it won't come to pass because despite enjoying roughly four times the amount of money available to everyone involved compared to other clubs in lower reaches of the pyramid, it seems unthinkable that Brighton shouldn't approach the contest as equals.

"A new programme, known as Drive, will be aimed at the most dangerous offenders, BBC News has been told. Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be open to those who have committed indictable offences including murder or manslaughter; attempted murders with intent; sexual violence against women, children or vulnerable adults; and trafficking for sex exploitation. Dee Dee's mother Jane lives in fear that her daughter, convicted of murdering a two-year old boy in 1995 and sentenced to life imprisonment, could one day go on release from jail. She thinks she knows what is going through her head - regret. ""I'm sure she'll think 'what if I'd never done this'...But, you know what? That would just make things worse."" It is an experience which Dee Dee herself might soon learn firsthand. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) says he cannot comment while cases are before court but another prisoner serving life said: ""The system is flawed. One thing they don't tell you when you're first arrested is that you can spend your whole life inside."" In fact, once released, prisoners like Dee Dee face many years waiting until their case comes up again and so being stuck behind bars. The MoJ did not supply figures about how often people get out early. But publishing research earlier this year, Scotland Yard found only 30 of murderers had served time less than five years before killing someone - and half were back in prison within three years. The rest stayed free for more than 10 years. Victims The number of potential victims killed because killers went unscathed is unknown, but campaigners estimate that thousands may die. They say a high proportion of them are women and children. Fearful of revenge attacks, some live underground, spending long hours alone behind barred windows. Some wait in silence for months. And others relive the horror weeks, days, minutes after each crime was planned and carried out. For nearly everyone else, justice is still seen as elusive. There is no guarantee a murderer won't walk free again. ""It affects every part of our daily existence,"" says Catherine Southall, co-director of Safelives, whose own brother died following a similar incident. ""You grow used to living in fear all the way down to having to move house."" Of course we understand why people want to put away violent criminals. We understand that criminals should pay for what they do. Yet society also needs to take into account other factors such as mental health issues, levels of alcohol consumption and circumstances leading potentially to offending. The numbers of rapes, robberies and assaults rose during Britain's financial crisis between 2007 and 2011 even though economic conditions improved afterwards. Meanwhile, the proportionate rise in knife crimes began well before the current recession hit and shows little sign of stopping despite tougher sentences. Critics say there is too much emphasis now on locking up more criminals rather than trying harder to prevent offending in the first place. Linda Quirke of the charity Victim Support agrees. ""We need better support for the community who suffer. People feel powerless. Isolated. Misunderstood."" Not easy to pin down Two decades ago, you could expect single mothers with multiple jobs to struggle to find a babysitter. Now women juggle work alongside looking after kids and elderly relatives. Single parents often cope with stress by drinking; social workers claim that up to 75 of teenage mums drink heavily during pregnancy. Even today, getting help isn't straightforward. Last month, an unannounced raid on a north London tip discovered almost 1,000 bodies buried under tonnes of rubbish over four floors. Among them was Elizabeth Thomas from Essex, aged 17, who hanged herself shortly after admitting beating her baby son Joseph to death.

"Dame Rosemary Butler said it was ""critical"" that people voted, with more powers coming to Wales. She said fewer than half of those eligible to vote did so in 2011. ""It is now our duty as a Parliament and Welsh Government to ensure this situation does not happen again,"" she added. A fifth minister since the last election has resigned - including Ms Rees' deputy at Culture, Sport Tourism, Councillor John Griffiths. Mr Griffiths said he had quit because his seat on Cardiff Council would be abolished for next year's local elections, leaving him without representation or an income. He became an MSP after being elected to Holyhead Borough council five years ago but his home was then expanded into neighbouring Llanishen ward before boundary changes came into force. The move means Labour will hold only one councillor in South Pembrokeshire after holding 24 from December 2001 until May 2012. A spokesperson for Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie described Mr Derbyshire's decision as ""a sad day."" It breaches convention which states all members are entitled to serve their full term, they say. But a spokesman for First Minister Carwyn Jones said any claim about an unfair defeat owed more to conspiracy theories rather than reality. In response, Plaid Cymru said there were no plans under way to challenge the result. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

"The head of football's governing body outlined his vision for an expanded tournament comprising 16 groups of three teams earlier this month. The top two teams in each group would then go through to the knockout stage from 24 June. But amid a number of issues, including contentious labour dispute affecting players and management staff at some clubs, Uefa will now have to consider its options if it wants to expand or contract the competition by one more team either side of next summer's finals in France. The decision on whether any more entrants should be admitted is due before Christmas but could wait until after Euro 2020 unless there are conflicts with other tournaments. Any new entrants must also be determined before July 1st 2019 when the current European Qualifiers end. ""We don't see anything that suggests we need additional teams,"" said Allardyce.

A team of Australian forensic experts arrived in Indonesia last week to help investigate why the ship sank so quickly despite its heavy load of passengers compared with similar vessels. Authorities say it might have hit floating objects or reefs during the storm. Hundreds remained missing as rescue workers continued searching, hoping survivors may yet surface.

The opener laboured for five and a half hours as India clinched the last two sessions by eight wides and five no balls with Yuvraj Singh (25) at the crease; their third batsman had deputised when he was hit on the head while running to bowl from cover. Yuvraj kept up his end in the post-tea session, but was caught off Ravi Jadeja trying to sweep Gautam Gambhir into short fine leg, before Eklavyan Prasad sent him back to slice another chance through point.

New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor said she has had trouble getting reporters hired at major publications with Trump's influence or who are aligned with him, citing his comments about Megyn Kelly during the 2016 presidential election as an example of why many journalists would be reluctant to cover her. (Kelly moderated a Republican primary debate between Trump and Ben Carson.) The same goes for some celebrity news sites like TMZ and Page Six, which often offer ""exclusive content,"" she added. Trump frequently denigrates media outlets on social media - even including Fox News host Sean Hannity, though last week was one of few times he actually mentioned the outlet by name - but insiders question whether those actions can help create a self-perpetuating cycle where fewer people want to pursue stories related to him because they're so uncomfortable covering someone with such strong control over what gets out there.",0,84
"The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it 's gone too far, such as with Tony Blair and his mad idea for an invasion of Iraq. A new book from a former adviser on Barack Obama's presidential campaign says that if Britain acted more like President Trump then Mrs May would be able ""to get some good deals"" over Brexit. The comments were made by Jonathan Dimbleby, who worked alongside Mr Obama during last year's election race: ""How much better off Britain could be if we had been doing things differently is something you can hear politicians say all day long. But I really think they should know how close - very close - many people thought we came to having our own version of Donald Trump elected president."" He added: ""If only Theresa May hadn't messed up so badly on Brexit."" But while it may sound bad news for Prime Minister Theresa May at home, there are also some positives he highlights about her government being closely tied into US politics. Mr Dimbleby said: "" (In) terms of the way she governs, her administration seems pretty effective."" And Mr Dimbleby admitted the relationship was not always easy - but is worth holding onto because both countries now need each other. He adds: ""We don't see eye-to-eye on everything, especially after the vote (in 2016), but the fact is this country needs us right now and we need them, period. If one thing comes out of Trumpism, I hope it will make people realise what they've got here."" The author argues that America still considers itself to be part of the West rather than against it, and sees its role as trying to keep order in the world. To do that, America has used military power - which isn't going away any time soon - even though it often causes problems elsewhere. That means the UK will continue partnering with America - including through NATO - until it leaves the EU. And the former Labour donor believes Britons must use their influence wisely in Washington, saying: ""Britain doesn't want to become another imperial nation again."" While getting involved in Syria (with help from Boris Johnson) might seem nice, he warns: ""It looks stupid. It makes no sense strategically. What British interests are served?

"The new charge will be imposed from April 2017 and help ensure that big business shoulders the cost of training workers, George Osborne said.

"The typical home in the East increased in cost by 8.3 in the year to the end of July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Prices in London, which is used as a comparison city for many regions across England, rose by 9. But prices in other English cities and towns had fallen back from their peak earlier this year - with the exception of Manchester, where they continued rising at about 4 over the summer period. The ONS figures show that house price increases were spread throughout most areas of Britain on an annual basis during 2012 - although the number of properties selling declined slightly last month. For example, average house prices grew at 2.1, or 6,309 homes, in Wales between January 2011 and July 2012; 1.9, or 7,679 houses, in Scotland; 1.7, or 5,374 houses, in Northern Ireland; and virtually unchanged 0.5, or 3,631 households in England.

"Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists said that finding this object in our solar system, as large or larger than Earth itself and possibly a planet of its own if it has an atmosphere, offers fresh insight into how planets form. The results were announced at the 216th meeting of American Astronomical Society (AAS) held 8-11 June 2013 in National Harbor, Maryland.""We have found what we believe is the coldest known Kuiper belt object,"" lead author Dr Hiroshi Kobayashi told journalists after presenting his team's findings on Monday morning [UK time] in Washington D.C.. ""The temperature was measured by looking for emission lines coming out of the surface which can only come through very thin ice, so it should give us pretty good constraints on the properties of any possible atmosphere.""Larger than Mercury ""It would be larger than anything else discovered before, all the way up past Neptune... It is around 10 times more massive than the smallest previously detected objects, called Centaurs, which are bodies located between Jupiter and Uranus which spend part of their orbit near Saturn,"" he explained. If confirmed, 2012 VP113 could also be bigger than world champion bull rider Chael Sonnen, who tipped the scales at 225 kg (500 lb). In fact, the size of the object might mean it weighs half again as much as our home planet. He added: ""This may just push things over into being classified as a dwarf planet since nothing smaller has been seen yet.In addition, there are hints of clouds and snow crystals forming on it from seeing variations in brightness. This suggests it has water ice underneath something like a layer of dust... but one slightly less dense than air because then you wouldn't see these changes in light variation... We think that's why it tiptoes across the face of Alpha Centauri A twice every 105 years. That gives scientists clues about where the dark side of the planet is facing.""Frozen gas cloud But despite the discovery being exciting for space fans, it pales in comparison when compared to another new find made earlier this year. On 1 January 2011 astronomers using Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory reported they had spotted a huge frozen gas cloud hurtling towards our star five billion kilometres beyond Saturn's gravity well, making it the most distant solid object ever observed. Followed closely by the discovery by Japanese researchers last week of an extremely close encounter by two small moons of Psyche in 2010, both discoveries highlight the need to keep looking deep into the cosmos. Professor Michael Lambeck, deputy director of the Max Planck Institute of Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, pointed out: ""Nowhere else do worlds exist such distances apart.""Dr Robert Wittenmyer, astronomer at Australia's Macquarie University, added: ""I'd love to know how many other potentially habitable worlds lie waiting somewhere in wait for them to be stumbled upon.""

"Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to get rid of fingerprints and smudges. The same could be said for Android smartphones in recent years too - what's more there are plenty of cases that come as part of the package anyway so why bother? But is this really all we should expect from our handsets? And if you're going to have them touching things around your home (and potentially other people) perhaps you want it kept nice and clean all year-round? Well, new research by waterproofing specialists TechnoBuffalo seems to confirm just how dirty smartphones can become - even when they spend days being submerged under water at depths up to 37ft (11m). In fact, the firm found that after spending two hours underwater the samples touched only showed moderate fuzziness and were still readable - while another sample four hours later was barely legible. Waterproofing specialist TechnoBuffalo tested 12 phones that had been immersed for up to three months The website reports: ""After intensive testing, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 proved to be one of the most durable devices on the market.""

Here's everything you need to know about keeping your handset squeaky clean... What makes a good case? There are an awful lot out there already, many branded to look like something else completely. For example, Apple fans might prefer iPad cases designed to look like iPhones; Sony PlayStation gamers almost always go for different coloured controls rather than black ones.

Is putting down a protective film the best way to keep surfaces undamaged? That depends... A number of companies make films in various shapes including circles, rectangles, squares and triangles, allowing users to pick the right size for a given area, often termed 'pixels'. Others are made specifically for protecting curved displays such as the Nexus 7 tablet. If you think you'll regularly drop yours then covering the entire front face with a peelable coating would seem sensible. Otherwise stick with sticking it to an easily cleaned wall with double-sided tape. You can buy liquid film packs directly from several online retailers, typically costing up to 15 (23), meaning there's no excuse for leaving scuffs in places where they shouldn't appear.

"He led the parade of soldiers along Llandudno promenade to re-affirm the Freedom of the County of Conwy. Hundreds of residents and holidaymakers turned out to see the march in which 200 troops, 100 horsemen and 300 marching bands took part This is a story about how we keep together as one people... just like they say on television: 'There's no place like home!' For those who haven't been away from Wales for long - most probably never have - it may sound slightly odd that this small corner of England has its very own freedom day. But I think you will agree with me when I say that it was absolutely fantastic! Llandudno, where my Mum and Dad live, is very pretty, especially during the summer months - but today (May 19th) it had something special going for it too; there were so many people milling around (in fact more than last year!), enjoying themselves and supporting what might be seen by some as a rather old fashioned patriotic stance. It was great fun being at events like these today, because everyone seems to get involved and enjoy themselves ... whether it's baking cakes or looking after children whilst their parents take photos of them dressed up like British heroes like Captain Britain etc., whatever floats your boat really. The atmosphere was certainly buzzing ahead of the day and even though it began quite late, it set off in good time - which made all the difference. My family decided to go into town for breakfast first. We met friends and then walked across the road to Burger King, before coming back again. Then, shortly afterwards, we started hearing the band playing'Tiddleyity Ta! Here Comes Charlie!!! Even at 11am, we didn't feel rushed to leave. In fact, by 12 noon, we felt it would be wise to move things forward a bit, so we headed towards the sea front. It wasn't long until our army arrived and sounded an alert. The whole thing took less than half an hour and we sat down next to the beach to watch proceedings. There were two big stages near the Promenade, each holding stands full of people singing songs and dancing along (and wearing somewhat bizarre costumes). Schoolchildren performed dance routines with members of the local youth theatre group; Cai Griffiths Dance Group presented contemporary dances. And suddenly I realised what it must be like to be watching the Olympics opening ceremony years ago, and seeing fireworks light up London night skies. Children run through the streets during the Dieu Rhif Arfon Day Parade in CaerphillyCredit: PA Walking further up the promenade, we found ourselves right amongst hundreds upon thousands of cheering locals and tourists alike, lining both sides of the street. However, despite the overwhelming sense of patriotism, everything stayed remarkably calm and orderly throughout. Kids played football games while high school students put flags in windows and decorated cars. Everyone seemed equally excited (or perhaps over-excited), and could easily understand why such days are important to us Welsh folk. As well as having the chance to sing God Save Our Queen, let alone Buw Ogwen Ddug i Mawr Gwlad y Byd (It's Good To Be Home), if only once a year, we also got the chance to do so before the eyes of literally millions of people! Nothing beats that kind of exposure! After spending the afternoon celebrating with crowds of people, it was almost dark by 5pm; however, nothing can beat sitting under street lights to watch the sun come up - and we did exactly that. At 6am, we went to bed to begin another day to remember! This was definitely not our last dieu rhif arfon experience, by any means... it doesn't even count as 'our' version. Every one deserves to make hisher mark, and every county should celebrate its heritage and history to remind us all what makes us proudest. I hope to see a lot of people making huge statements like this in the future too. Let's stand against intolerance, racism, homophobia and oppression. Let's strive for progressivism, liberty, justice and equality. If everyone stopped to reflect on everything our forefathers achieved, surely nobody would complain? Well done to anyone who takes part in their communities yes, I mean everybody!

"6 December 2016 Last updated at 09:59 GMT The app can now identify up to 70,000 public figures by looking at images, video or an actual person. The BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones explains how it works The app which picks out people from photographs and videos is called FaceApp - and until this week it had no significant privacy policy in place. Now a new version of the app has been launched with more sophisticated facial recognition functions that could be used by spooks and stalkers alike. It quickly became one of Facebook's top trending stories on Twitter as users shared photos with their friends before being confronted with some uncomfortable truths about themselves. But did you know there are other applications for FaceApp? Here we explain what it does... 1) Recognise famous faces Share any image you want to see'removed' through your Facebook profile Picture face detection technology uses deep learning to recognise different people based on their features Thousands of celebrities have already signed up Credit: FACEAPPFACEBOOK What if I recognised myself? In fact you probably do! We all look pretty much the same these days after years of Photoshop and Instagram filters. And while most people won't spot a celebrity jumping into frame, the app can still find them on its own. Does my husband really want to meet his namesake? To start off, try uploading a photo of yourself; then, tap ""Take picture remove me."" If the photo fits the parameters (age range, gender etc), you should get an option asking whether you'd like to delete the image completely, tag it so only you will ever view it again, or keep it but hide it behind either ""Only Me"" or ""Friends Only..."" These options let us suggest who might appreciate seeing the fruits of our labours. This feature doesn't actually work when taking pictures yet though - you'll just end up with randomly generated selfies. Alternatively you can use the existing tags such as family, friend, or colleagues so the algorithm knows exactly who it needs to search for. How many times have I seen this guy walking down the street?! Or maybe he was standing right next to you earlier today. Close relatives tend to share similar traits too, making finding matches easier. There are plenty of ways to play around with using DeepFace to match pictures across social networks, including sharing a link directly to Facetune rather than tagging it manually. 2) Find old schoolmates In case you haven't changed your hairstyle since high school, the service promises to help you locate classmates or exes you may not remember well enough to send awkward messages via text message. Take yourself back to that time when Mr Green Eyes would definitely make you blush... For example, did you know you're 13 less likely to become obese and 16 more likely to avoid cancer if you've lost weight over the past 20 years compared to someone whose BMI hasn't budged? Maybe it's because I'm posting a selfie every day on Snapchat? 3) Match curious kids With access to the eyes and mouth, the app tries to guess age too. Is that child near Ikea? Why yes they are quite literally that cute. From 15 to 99, the system recognises children between ages 0-19. You get three guesses to pick the best fit. 4) Make sure your bosses don't catch you Looking better than usual isn't against company rules, obviously. However, if you suspect office politics are getting involved and you need to work harder to impress management, the tool recommends five perfect poses for both men and women. Soon you'll be able to take endless variations of each pose... 5) Detect emotional changes even if you aren't smiling A lot of emotion shows up on the human face, sometimes without anyone knowing why. Are those tears of joy or sorrow? Is she just tired or angry? Yes, Smart Emoji detects under eye bags and redness, plus tells whether a smile looks genuine (or fake). Just upload two images to compare. 6) Get smarter during lovemaking Using a combination of machine learning and big data, the service suggests emojis depending on your relationship status and sexual position. Would anyone mind if I asked Siri where the nearest drug store was instead? 7) See what products you absolutely hate While browsing Amazon shopping pages, you never think twice about scrolling through reviews and rating scores attached to particular items. Nowhere is this more true than online beauty retailers, where long lists of ingredients show up alongside star ratings. Wishful thinking aside, the Faceapp app can tell whether certain skin care potions contain harmful substances using artificial intelligence. 8) Predict your future health The World Health Organisation defines depression as having repeated periods of low mood or feeling sad, empty, hopeless or worthless. So far so good, although it fails to consider stressors within relationships, friendships, finances, career and home life alongside mental disorders. When you first sign up, FaceApp tells you what 10 things contribute to your wellbeing, ranging from sleep quality to exercise habits. Nice touch... 9) Help you buy the groceries Ordering food delivery services is embarrassing. Buying Scuixoi SlavesToE joftalowIn case the time to Claitof Timein now means R",0,99
"The PRI is set to win about 30, with the conservative National Action Party on about 22, said the head of the National Electoral Institute.

"The MarkitCIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since June 2011 and marks a fourth month of contraction for factory production. I have been arguing that China's slowdown can be decelerated through targeted reforms, but it looks like those efforts will not prevent a more pronounced decline over coming months. The slowing economy is now beginning to affect private consumption as well. Consumer confidence dropped 7 year-over-year in April after a nearly three-decade high of 91.3 points hit last August. China's rapid construction boom may already be behind us. In the second quarter real estate market conditions deteriorated sharply; home prices declined 10 percent on average across major markets, annual property sales slowed by almost half compared with forecasts, and developers began cutting back their investment plans. Yet another indicator shows how unsustainable this boom was: commercial building permits were down 14 percent on an annual basis during the period after contracting at double digits each consecutive quarter prior to the dropoff. Commercial real estate had become Chinese government policy without the benefit of any trial runs or market research. As such, it resembles equally risky - if successful - US housing bubble policies of 20 years ago, before regulators started tightening credit standards and flooding the financial system with liquidity. With the end of the stimulus package approaching, Beijing must curtail its reliance on artificially cheap money and ensure financial stability along with economic recovery. Unless policymakers adopt concrete steps toward tighter monetary controls soon, they risk losing public support for further expansionary fiscal measures and risking a sharp reprisal from local governments angry about potential future cuts in subsidies. As I write these words, some 200 people are still trapped inside the collapsed Tianjin Binhai International Expo Center (TBIC) apartment complex. Some 250 firefighters continue working day and night pumping water out of TBIC's seven floors. At least five survivors remain missing. Most alarmingly, there seems little hope of finding all remaining residents alive. Rescue workers combed both sides of the building's basement floor looking for anyone who might still await rescue. They found only one man, whose crushed body was covered with mud. All told, six people died when some 100 apartments caved into the ground two weeks after being engulfed on November 4th by the magnitude 6.5 earthquake which triggered the collapse. Among them was an eight-month pregnant mother of four, a 64-year old grandmother, and two school children aged 11 and 12. Autopsies showed the victims suffered multiple injuries, including broken bones and internal bleeding. One victim sustained severe head trauma caused by a blow to his skull. Another succumbed to heart failure while waiting outside the hospital morgue where autopsies would take place. According to figures released by the official news agency Xinhua, 238 schools, dormitories, residential buildings and other structures collapsed completely due to natural disasters between 1990 and 2004. Only 44 remained standing throughout China. A new study published today suggests that most European consumers think climate change exists - even though they don't know much about it. The survey of 2,000 adults revealed just under 66 per cent thought anthropogenic global warming (AGW), primarily driven by increasing carbon dioxide emissions, existed, although only 19 per cent believed serious dangers could result from AGWs impact. More than 70 per cent said they did not understand enough about climate science to comment meaningfully. ""Far too many Europeans do not believe human activities play a role in climate change,"" says Matthew Spencer, author of the report commissioned by green group WWF. ""Many believe we should ignore politics and focus on doing what we can to live sustainably."" He adds that politicians need to make people aware of the evidence pointing to rising temperatures and sea levels. But he believes scientific explanation alone will fall short, because people cannot comprehend it. ""It is clear that scientists, journalists and NGOs are making great strides towards explaining the causes of our changing world and the risks associated with inaction,"" Mr Spencer concludes. However, less than 15 per cent of participants correctly understood the link between industrialisation and greenhouse gas emissions, indicating that information reaching citizens needs improving. Although the majority wanted action to reduce fossil fuel use, few wanted significant changes to their lifestyles, according to researchers. Just 27 per cent hoped to see better air quality within 30 years, and fewer than half expected financial savings. Chinese officials say they want 1 billion yuan (156 million) worth of goods moved onto boats and ferries to help ease congestion around Hong Kong and Macau amid mass protests against mainland rule.

China has long grappled with problems created by large numbers of unregistered religious groups which use religion as an excuse for criminal activity, but recent cases involving mass brainwashing techniques seem particularly disturbing.

"Julian Lewis, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said the former prime minister had ""charm and ability."" But he had ""dangerously"" delayed renewing Trident, Mr Lewis said, also questioning Mr Blair's role in Iraq. Mr Brown is expected to announce his decision later today. Mr Cameron has promised more than 1bn for Britain's nuclear deterrent if elected next year - much less than Labour plans but enough to keep the UK on a permanent footing of four submarines armed with 12 missiles each. The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg will be pulling out all the stops to get it cancelled at an election meeting tonight. In 2005, Gordon Brown opposed scrapping HMS Vanguard even though Tony Blair favoured decommissioning the ageing submarine fleet. At that time Mr Brown held off preparing arguments against scrapping the programme until after publication of a report by Sir John Chilcot into the war which found no intelligence was presented which led ministers to believe Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Oliver Letwin MP (Con), who worked as defence adviser to chancellor Alistair Darling when he was chief secretary to the Treasury between 2008-2010, says: 'If Conservatives want to make this about George W Bush then they are going down very well indeed.

There seems to me to be something slightly sinister about a figurehead wanting to say everything except what people expect him to say. If he wants to come out and talk about independence he should decide to stand for leadership directly.

Alex Salmond calls for world powers to ditch nukes yet last week signed up to co-host a nuclear waste facility near Sheffield. Even the most minimal attempt to halt the waste arms race is blocked by David Cameron and Gordon Brown. They're determined to perpetuate it regardless of public opinion. This reckless policy must be challenged at every turn.""Paul Jennings, head of communications at Greenpeace International, added: ""Alex Salmond speaks openly about the benefits of Scottish membership of NATO and European Union, saying membership strengthens Scotland within both organisations.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Platini wants to restore the image of world football's governing body in the wake of serious corruption allegations. ""We want a reform , we don't have any problem with that,"" he says. But some believe FIFA may be better off without him at its helm. ""I'm pleased today because I think it was nearly an accident how things evolved and came about - but now it's finished,"" said Sepp Blatter as he emerged from Zurich airport shortly after midnight local time (10:30 GMT). The 82-year old Swiss had been under pressure since news broke last week that Brazilian police were investigating payments worth seven million dollars (4m) made by two former officials for marketing rights to tournaments at the 2010 World Cup finals which they managed. The alleged bribes could see the pair face up to 30 years jail if found guilty, although neither has so far been charged or arrested. They deny wrongdoing. Speaking via teleconference late into Wednesday night Mr Blatter refused to comment when asked whether one man he described as just another member of staff might also face criminal charges. Yet his words still caused alarm among many who fear continued revelations will almost certainly lead eventually to his resignation. Ousted Mr Blatter is being replaced next February by German media tycoon Wolfgang Niersbach, who won support yesterday from European politicians including British MEPs Ian Duncan Smith and Graham Watson, saying there should be no further delay before someone takes charge. It remains unclear though whether Fifa can afford such political patronage. Several sources close to the organisation say cash flow problems continue to affect day to day operations. In particular, Fifa needs money to build new stadiums where events are held, something which has never happened within recent memory despite billions spent worldwide in rich nations alone. Moreover, most people inside and outside football expect more investigations involving senior figures at Fifa too are likely to emerge over coming months, possibly leading to others being sacked. And amidst all the infighting risks lies what many call the real scandal - organised crime. Last year the FBI revealed it believed several top executives received millions of dollars through offshore accounts, while the US Attorney General Eric Holder admitted earlier this month that American authorities would examine financial irregularities as part of their investigation into bribery claims connected with South Africa's 2008 Olympics bid. Many officials claim these latest revelations represent only the tip of the iceberg, hinting perhaps there are even bigger fish yet to fry. Some point out nothing illegal can happen until 2009 anyway. Complaints against Mark Warner, head of Concacaf (Confederation of North America Football Associations), filed a decade ago remain before Mr Justice Brian Leveson at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He is due to announce findings in mid-September. However, lawyers representing three current CONCACAF presidents meanwhile issued statements in response to reports published by BBC Panorama on Sunday morning claiming Fifa had given them legal immunity regarding the case. One lawyer claimed she was barred from discussing evidence relating to her clients because of confidentiality concerns. Another insisted that the men did not need protection and that the same rules applied equally across Europe. A third noted that none of the suits involved any allegation of criminal activity. Tensions high It comes amid escalating tensions between the Americas and other continents following John Harkes' decision to switch allegiance from the United States to Trinidad Tobago during the Confederations Cup. Though otherwise splendidly run, TT lost 1-0 to Spain, Russia and Italy in Group B. Afterwards Venezuela President Hugo Chavez called Argentina skipper Diego Maradona ""a traitor"" and suggested he should go back to home country Peru. Uruguay striker Luis Suarez has branded Germany boss Joachim Loew a hypocrite for calling on fans to carry Olympic torches in London instead of Rio de Janeiro. Meanwhile, Brazil coach Mano Menezes resigned last Saturday on the eve of Copa America 2007 qualifiers after criticism over performances during international friendlies. Menezes told AFP his departure was unrelated to the accusations surrounding former Fifa vice president Jack Warner and New Zealand ex-striker Danny Chung. Both are currently suspended pending disciplinary hearings, along with nine others linked to the Gulf states. New Zealander Chung went on trial on Tuesday accused of accepting 3,000 bribe to secure votes for Qatar in bidding for 2022 World Cup hosting rights. All 11 stood down from duties alongside Carson Yeung Wai Fook, Fifa's executive committee director for communications who was expelled from the conference hall, and Markus Kattner, general secretary who stepped aside. Earlier, Italian newspaper Corriere Della Serra reported Warner paid 7million to Chung, former chairman Chuck Blazer and Asian Football Confederation treasurer Mohamed Kahraba for apparent influence in selecting Australia 2006 host city Melbourne. Blatter review Meanwhile, questions abound over why Blatter decided today to abandon plans for tomorrow's presidential election.

Samantha says: ""I never expected I would be on benefits because I always worked - my family depend upon me financially so if anything happened I could not work. But when I got sick, nobody seemed to know what this illness actually meant or how you live your day to day life."" Taylor began suffering severe headaches and muscle aches after she had two virus infections in 2014. She sought medical advice and her GP sent her to see a specialist doctor. After several tests everything came back negative. However, within six months her health deteriorated further still. It took another three years before she was referred into CFS research studies at King's College Hospital. Thereafter, she suffered more problems including memory loss, tremors, sleeplessness and constant pain when moving. She now lives alone and relies solely on disability pensioners benefit of 73 per week to survive. Her husband left without any explanation. ""He used to support us both,"" she said sadly. She looks much older than her age. At school she excelled academically and was awarded an A grade pass 8 GCSEs having been diagnosed with dyslexia and Asperger syndrome. In college she achieved a degree in French literature and speaks fluent Spanish. When we meet Taylor appears friendly and bubbly, yet visibly exhausted and often unable to remain sitting upright. Several times each hour she needs to get up out of bed and rest in the corridor while leaning against walls for periods ranging between 10 minutes and half an hour. These episodes are triggered mainly by strong emotions like intense sadness or anger. They cause excruciating spasms throughout her body and leave her too weak even for tears. During these spells blood pressure levels drop significantly. If she does manage to stay lying down for longer periods then she collapses unconscious for 15mins to 2 hours until she regains consciousness feeling very tired. This process will repeat itself again and again over weeks, sometimes months on end. Medical treatment makes little difference and medication only provides temporary relief. More serious symptoms such as insomnia continue unabated despite having tried all available types of sleeping pills along with caffeine tablets; antihistamines and antispasmodics which make matters worse. Underlying anxiety manifests frequently in bouts of panic attacks. Chronic Pain Awareness Day is Friday 6th July. You can find details here.

"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites now sell fake exam papers, for example from the Edexcel International Exams board or Pearson Education Ltd, which include questions replicated from last year's paper. Some of these sites have been selling them already this summer term, when students will be sitting the new GCSE music exam, called Exam Board (Edex) AMEB Music Exam A2, as well as other subjects such as English language, science, maths, geography and religious studies (RSP). A spokeswoman said: ""If you think it is easy to find perfect questions that can be copied without being noticed then guess again because we know they exist on our site. We work closely with the teachers who run the schools where our materials are used. They give us feedback about what types of questions they need. If any concerns arise relating to use of our material online then all users must take responsibility themselves - so if someone buys one question but fails to follow instructions we cannot provide support free of charge. It could put their grades at risk. Schools also remind us that plagiarism of another student's mark sheet is a criminal offence and not acceptable. In addition many universities require copying of full sets of past papers before allowing entry so there is real concern. This issue needs urgent attention. Educators should turn over every stone within their schoolrooms to prevent anything like this occurring."" The government has warned schools against including plagiarised content in its syllabuses following claims that some pupils had paid an internet company 5 per set of answers to copy and paste onto their own sheets. Tim Oakes, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: ""It would obviously undermine key stages of assessment across the curriculum. There is a huge amount of pressure placed on children today through homework, coursework etc - they don't necessarily have time to do things properly. So yes I think it [the practice] is really worrying."" However, he added: Exam boards] want to make sure they're dealing with genuine cases of individual misbehaviour. But really this group needs to do better than engaging in irresponsible behaviour. It undermines the integrity of their assessments.""

The Office for National Statistics said total FDI inflows grew 15 between 201415 and 201516 while inflows into the UK from EU countries increased 14. Total outflows fell 2, mainly driven by an 18 drop in the value of FDI driving down outward investments. There was also a 19 fall in flows going abroad which had been driven by higher oil prices. Government data showed 4.8 million people work within the transport industry across the country with 50 employed directly and 49 indirectly. In terms of employment within public sector bodies, 16 per cent come from knowledge based industries such as science, engineering and construction. 22 February 2011 (Source: ) 18:12Monday 10 December 2015The office for national statistics (ONS) has published this month's balance sheet detailing the impact of inflation on government spending and revenues in 2010, 2011 and 2012. One key difference for the ONS compared to other sources is how it calculates average earnings - comparing gross pay rather than take home pay. It is therefore possible to get more accurate estimates of changes in household disposable incomes using only one measure. This figure compares the income generated by all households (62,741), including those who do not receive any state benefits. For full details see the annual review of living standards here. Overall, real household disposable incomes have risen rapidly following the end of recession. Spending power has grown thanks partly to rising wages but also because we spend less on taxes than before. As a result our total tax bill has fallen. Moreover, lower unemployment means fewer taxpayers receiving some benefit payments. However, higher borrowing costs mean interest rates have shot up and savers now earn very little return indeed. Household savings account balances reach their lowest point ever, 6.5 of GDP, meaning families cannot afford holidays, big purchases or retirement plans without dipping into debt. So although overall wealth is growing, much of this money goes towards paying off loans instead of building assets like houses or pensions, worsening inequality. From January 2008 until September 2009, the RPI (real price index) went above 3, so the rise in personal consumption account for just 0.3 percentage points. Both housing and pension contributions made almost no contribution to raising disposable incomes either. And despite some increases under chancellor George Osborne, his budget commitment to cut these bills remains unfulfilled. The Chancellor must acknowledge he failed to deliver what many voters still expect him to achieve when they supported 'austerity measures' as part of the coalition agreement last May. He should allow the Treasury to publish pre-budget forecasts showing if he could meet yet another promise. These would reveal whether taking on additional debt does help boost productivity, stimulate demand or fund productive infrastructure projects. A recent IMF research paper argues that ""the link between fiscal consolidation and economic performance appears weak - at most, worth about a third of 1 percent annually."" (Flanders Media) (Source: ) 19:14Friday 21 October 2013Dr Ric EdmondsProfessor of economics at LSE Dr Martin Wolf wrote in today's Financial Times stating that whoever wins the upcoming election, David Cameron will face difficult questions about the economy. Even though output expanded strongly in Q2, housebuilding crashed, car sales declined sharply, factories closed plants and retailing collapsed. ""There seems no doubt that something unusual happened. Most economists believe that the world faced slump, not boom; that globalisation did nothing to alter underlying weakness; and that monetary policy helped restore confidence in the banking system but hurt companies unable to pass on cheap credit. But, if you put your faith in quantitative easing, then you might expect firms to benefit hugely from low interest rates. Everyone agrees that banks lent too freely, particularly mortgage lenders, and the excesses caused the crisis... What amazed me was that interest rate cuts worked not only for banks but also for finance companies. Banks became riskier again, even reckless; stock markets rallied; and the prime reason for easy access to funding disappeared. It turns out that governments can use swap lines cheaply to borrow against future nominal yields. Their deep pockets enable them to walk away happy even if, eventually, investors deem that stocks look expensive and bonds seem unattractive. Our economies seem a lot healthier than they really are."" (Ric Edmonds, Professor of Economics, London School of Economic Sciences).

The findings come two years after research from the same team warned retailers were turning their backs on key health messages because they cost money to deliver. David Tindall, author of the 2014 paper entitled ""Health promotion: lessons learned"" said there was still little evidence on how best to target consumers through marketing campaigns and supermarkets were far more likely to use traditional media (TV and radio) over digital channels such as Facebook.

"Jason Van Dyke was heckled as he arrived at court where he denied six counts of first-degree murder. Video released earlier this year showing the shooting of Laquan McDonald sparked nationwide protests about police violence and eventually prompted the release of dashcam footage that showed officers walking away from a wounded man in October 2014. On Wednesday, jurors heard closing arguments before beginning deliberations on whether they believe Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke is guilty or not guilty for killing 17-year old Laquan McDonald 16 times with an assault rifle while ordering him to ""get back"" after Van Dyke believed McDonald had reached into his waistband. On Thursday morning they returned their verdict - which included two hung juries over three days combined - finding Van Dyke guilty on all charges but one: second degree murder. Final Jury Verdicts In The Case Of Laquan McDonald Trial - 0h LaQuanMcDonald A post shared by Tamara Green (tamaragreen) on May 20, 2017 at 10:24pm PDT Van Dyke has maintained since day one of his trial that he shot McDonald because McDonald lunged toward him armed only with a knife, something he says was captured on video. Prosecutors have argued throughout the case that the cop fired 15 shots without provocation; however, the jury didn't find proof enough to support Van Dyke's claim he feared for his life and self defense...or even his own safety. Jurors were also shown the infamous dashboard camera video taken moments before and during what happened that fateful night nearly four years ago when an officer opens fire on Laquan who appears unarmed. It shows McDonald running towards the squad car looking puzzled, confused and distraught - begging and pleading for help. He falls dead less than eight seconds later...and Van Dyke continues firing until paramedics arrive minutes later. The prosecution team led by prosecutors Anita Alvarez (the state attorney general), Joseph McMahon Jr., and Patrick Collins Lacy made it clear several times during Tuesday afternoon arguments how important the dashboard camera video was in convincing them that prosecutor Marilyn Mosby deliberately withheld evidence she knew would be damaging to Van Dyke's defense. As she referenced the tape herself numerous times during her rebuttal argument, Mosby said the footage provides ""unbelievable corroboration"" for the prosecution's theory that the former South Side beat cop willfully killed McDonald despite having no idea how close the teen actually came to dying on the ground. She told jurors that if they found other witnesses more credible than Van Dyke then convicting him should be easier.""If you don't buy those people's testimony, we can't prove beyond reasonable doubt that Laquan McDonald did anything wrong,"" she added. While many protesters across America took to the streets following the news of Van Dyke's conviction, others have focused much of their anger over recent months elsewhere, such as Baltimore where Alton Sterling was fatally shot outside a convenience store last summer. And just yesterday evening, activists gathered outside New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's Harlem apartment chanting ""Fire Pantaleo!"" referring to NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo whose chokehold contributed to Eric Garner's death shortly before Christmas 2014. They're calling for Pantaleo's suspension. At least seven cops are currently under investigation. Facing nationwide scrutiny for his handling of the aftermath of Freddie Gray's fatal injuries in 2015, Thomas Frazier resigned as Commissioner of Police in April 2016 amid growing public calls for reform within city law enforcement agencies. De Blasio pledged reforms including body cameras for officers so they could better document interactions between civilians and cops. But violence against minorities continued unabated.

This was to ensure that anyone selected wouldn't feel compelled to render a verdict because someone else's opinion holds sway. Through most of the proceedings Monday and Tuesday, Gaughan admonished attorneys to keep comments related to the victims, alleged victim and witness family members to a minimum. That undoubtedly played into why the trial lasted five weeks and involved 88 potential jurors being questioned individually by lawyers.

"Sharnford Traffic Action Group (STAG) said some motorists were clocked at ""eye watering"" speeds topping 100mph. It has campaigned against dangerous driving on Aston Lane and the B4114 in Leicestershire , A27C near Ashby de la Zouch with its members pointing out that their speeding is often hidden by other drivers, often being seen over double 50 mph limits. The group have reported more than 60 cases of cars travelling way above the legal speed limit during the past two months alone. In one case, a car was reported to be travelling 106 miles per hour near Bedworth but did not stop until it reached Swadlincote Road just before there. The driver later admitted he had been going 80-85mph for about three hours although police only found him guilty after they stopped another vehicle which happened to be passing his and realised he was doing nearly twice as fast as allowed. Another member told police he saw a car going 120 mph through heathland by Snitterton Woods after dark last Wednesday night. It's believed between seven and 10 people are involved in this scam - all men aged 17 or 18. They're either using stolen vehicles or register plates belonging to family members. For example an Audi Q5 parked outside a house in Lutterworth will claim someone else lives there when actually no-one does. This week there have been five reports from east midlands where the thieves appear to have struck again - stealing a car and then bragging about what they've done online.

"Arthur Cory, 49, said the flag had been kept in a cupboard at Penllyn Castle near Cowbridge, since he was a boy. The flag, one of only three surviving from 1845 and initially thought to be lost for good when it went missing during World War I, has now finally returned home after being reclaimed by its rightful owner Mr Corbins's grandfather bought the flag - originally used as a screen over two barrels on an outhouse wall - in 1945, but Mr Corbin insisted that his parents never let him or his brother play with it. He added: ""It stayed in storage until we were old enough to get married."" His wife, Anthea, 50, grew up just down the road and knew nothing about the flag. She read about it recently online before her husband told her what happened. Mrs Cory explained: ""When I came into our bedroom that morning she was sat there looking very serious, so we asked if anything wrong. ""She then told us how proud they were of their family history but no-one ever spoke about them going back any further than 1948. And she really wanted the flag back because it is part of her heritage too. We are absolutely thrilled that something like this can happen. It shows you life goes on. These things don't just disappear off the face of the earth."" Last Wednesday (October 4), Mark Lloyd OBE visited Swansea Museum where staff discovered more information about the flag. They tracked its route through Wales using records dating back to the 1960s which included the sale of many items connected to former owners including furniture, pictures, china and silverware. They found that Andrew Holmes, who died in 1900 aged 33 years, owned the barometer flag after acquiring it from William Smith in Cardiff. He sold every item except the flag and four framed photographs of himself leaving the shop behind - all of which could be seen hanging in the museum today. When the Guinness Wine Company in Birmingham decided to buy Welsh flags to use outside bars around England the company sent a representative named Austin Joseph Andrews to purchase the flag and other objects associated with the brewery from 19th century businessman Thomas Llewelyn Davies. After initial negotiations failed in 1925 Timothy Evans replaced Mr Andrews as representative for the Guinness brand. Unfortunately, due to war regulations the banners remained stored inside the building until being recovered in 2018 following the end of the first world war. Today, Gareth Williams, head curator of collections and exhibitions at Swansea Museum, welcomed the return and hoped that curators would learn more about people who lived nearby. A statement released by the museum quoted Mr Davies' grandson Eric Fagan describing Mr Corbs's dream. The family later contacted the National Trust about returning the flag to Somerset Place, home to Sir Ivor Roberts Jones and Lady Julia Margaret Sanderson. In 1947, the couple made a deal with the Blaengwynfa estate - land donated by Lord Dynevor and Lady Jane Arthur between 1856 and 1888 - granting the right to build Bryngarw House within 22 acres of parkland covering 1.25 hectares. Another agreement allowed them to extend the house and retain ownership of the water meadows. Despite the fact that the couple did not live at Bryngarw House or even visit regularly, the original plans submitted by architect John Douglas Bruce show they occupied a large stone pavilion set amongst formal gardens. At various times, members of the Arthur family also built several houses nearby, such as nearby Gowerton Manor and Cefn Mawr, another property whose grounds abut those of Bryngarw House.

A new analysis published today estimates the global burden of suicide across age groups and countries - revealing striking differences between low income and high income countries. In 2012, suicides accounted for approximately 1 million deaths globally just under one per cent of total mortality excluding accidents. However, when considering only national rates based on available data, there is considerable variation within each country depending upon gender, economic status, time period and methods used. An estimated 354 men and 395 women die by suicide every day worldwide. Suicide was most common amongst young males aged 15-29 years old in both developing and developed economies. This trend in younger ages may reflect increased access to effective treatments; however, some vulnerable groups have reported difficulties accessing these resources. In his recent book, Why Don't We Learn More about Depression?, Professor Andrew Scull argued there was insufficient evidence to justify the widespread use of antidepressants in clinical practice. And yet we aren't learning enough either. One reason I suspect is that antidepressant prescribing decisions don't fit well into our current systems of research funding and publication. What follows is my attempt at addressing those issues. It doesn't pretend to offer any kind of comprehensive assessment of why knowledge production isn't progressing faster in psychiatry.

The drone carried an anti-government protest banner and it is believed that it came from supporters of the opposition who were angry at Mr Yanukovych's decision to scrap planned EU trade talks in November, as well as his apparent attempts to pile more power into himself.

"Speaking during a parliamentary debate, Philip Hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister Jo Johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well.

Fireworks were ignited in Hyde Park, Trafalgar Square, at Canary Wharf and even outside Buckingham Palace. And there was no sign of any attempt by police or fire services to tackle illegal pyrotechnic displays which have been ongoing for months. Marked out thousands of times throughout 2015 - these tiny fires can burst into flames within minutes, often resulting in huge explosions. A house is destroyed following an ""explosion"" caused by a bonfire in West Ham in October last year Source: Met Police Advertisement The vast majority of people who use fireworks own them legally but they cause hundreds of injuries every year including burns that almost always result in significant scarring. This has led many parents to abandon their planned outdoor celebrations because they simply cannot cope with children being injured or having to be taken away from friends. Some councils also take action against those using fireworks without permission, although it is not clear how effective this is. There is also growing concern about the health impacts on those living nearby if high-powered devices explode across residential areas where large numbers gather and spark up around midnight. One survey estimates there could be 5,000 such events across central London tonight alone, while others expect 1 million more consumers will buy some form of pyro device than in previous years.

"The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their current unit and its commander, who they claimed had deceived them about what would be required of them in Afghanistan. It was February last year - just over a month after British forces arrived at Camp Bastion airport in Helmand province - that the troops first staged an informal huddle outside one of the camp's kitchen canteens. They were not planning any kind of insurrection or even any serious mutiny; instead, they simply wanted to chat informally among themselves about the situation facing them there. As they stood around a table chitchatting, it soon became clear that some of those present felt dissatisfied with how things were being run. One soldier told his comrades: ""I don't think this is going anywhere. This guy [the commanding officer] is keeping us here for no good reason, but we can do nothing about anything because we are only there for six months and then we will come back home again. We should have been sent out before now. I want to go and fight somewhere else."" Another said he had heard rumours that the regiment already has more than 4,000 members so getting rid of him could cause problems, while another expressed anger with the way the regimental sergeant major had refused to allow the battalion to seek help as a group regarding issues of concern. ""If my platoon sergeant tells me something is wrong ... why shouldn't I believe him? Why am I supposed to get permission from someone above him? It doesn't make sense. And anyway, everyone knows something like this happens all the time at other units."" Such tensions between junior officers and NCOs (non-commissioned ranks) within military units often lead to discontentment after tours of duty abroad. Indeed, such incidents have become commonplace since Britain began operating in places where conflict might occur or where local populations need assistance. For example, concerns raised among soldiers serving under US command during operations in Kosovo and Iraq led to protests against commanders a few years ago. Similarly, the deployment to Kuwait in 2003 prompted a number of British service personnel to stage mass demonstrations branding Tony Blair's government responsible for escalating conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In these circumstances, British authorities tend to treat complaints made by servicemen sent overseas much differently than if they occurred at base camps back home. When a problem occurs at a combat zone, it goes straight up the chain of command to higher-ranked officials whose authority is immediately apparent. But when similar matters take place away from theatres of war, senior army generals may cast doubts on subordinates whose actions cannot readily be seen as hostile or disloyal. Officials also try to prevent disgruntled serviceman from making their gripes public via social media networks, lest it does harm to national interests or damage morale within armed forces communities far beyond areas directly involved in international fighting. Such constraints mean soldiers remain largely powerless within their own units. Even attempts by individual Britons to air their grievances online face daunting obstacles, which relate both to individuals and to the UK Ministry of Defence itself. A BBC investigation found that blogs critical of British foreign policy authored by former servicemen posted in 2009 received hundreds of thousands of hits, yet many returned error messages due to official objections. Several websites set up by ex-servicemen aiming to bring forward allegations of misconduct by senior figures failed to generate enough traffic so the sites remained closed down. While the armed services insist that shared beliefs are firmly embedded throughout its ranks, veterans say changing conditions force army units increasingly into isolation from each other and wider society. While proportionately fewer people serve today compared to decades past, it is more difficult for the MOD to keep cohesion amid the ever-increasing demands placed upon serving personnel. These include extended periods spent living separately from loved ones, five days a week for several weeks over winter, hard physical training that takes place long hours daily, exposure to risk usually involving firearms use, and regular deployments requiring short notice, sometimes lasting months. The modus operandi of modern warfare means there are rarely organisations large enough to provide adequate support, let alone comfort. Service life, moreover, has changed dramatically in recent times. Its pace has quickened and personal freedoms curtailed, most notably through restrictions imposed following 911. Men are expected to work harder on behalf of the same amount of money earned per hour. There are greater requirements relating to rank advancement and promotion, and promotions are handed out according to abilities rather than age. Combat duties require increased mental alertness and physical endurance, along with heightened levels of aggression. At the same time, family ties are weakened further through lengthy separations required during deployments. Tensions between officers and enlisted personnel can erupt in violent eruptions known as 'mutinies' and 'rebellions'. Yet instances of signalled dissent that challenge orders given by superiors are relatively rare nowadays, although such resistance still exists between military and non-dipper plumes are less popular prilscreening imprints carried forward, albeit potentially dysfunctional parents, endimperpetual deficits detected",0,153

"It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about winning elections, not achieving historical breakthroughs in popularity polls: It turned out to be a good year for Bibi and his Likud party (with 52 seats), while it could have been even better if they'd managed to win 61 or 62. One day later, though, on January 18, I got another shock - this time from the other side. Not only did Yair Lapid remove himself as head of Yesh Atid but also he dissolved his centrist faction and started taking responsibility singlehandedly for whatever happens after 29 February. Forget about all those vague promises that he made last year; there are no words left now. He has just said that Israel needs to move cautiously forward without ever thinking again about withdrawing from any part of Judea and Samaria. There will be peace talks with Mahmoud Abbas this summer at Annapolis and then everything goes back to normal starting next month. I say ""normal"" because there can only be one winner here: Fatah believes itself morally entitled to take over what used to belong to them until 1967 under international law. They should do so immediately by force rather than wait for negotiations. And this would probably happen if political conditions were favorable again. As things stand today, though, we're dealing with of two main parties engaged in an existential battle for the future of their nation, whose outcome depends mainly upon who comes off victorious and who doesn't survive. That's why Lapid's action makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If you think that violence leads anywhere, try telling Hamas how to behave instead. Lapid wants us to believe that he'll still remain involved somehow in Israeli politics, although nothing indicates precisely where and when. Yet Barak-Galant may well decide to go ahead regardless and give him enough support on 24 April to get 55 seats. In such circumstances, Lapid won't matter much less than he does right now. Once the Israeli voters know what kind of man he really is, they'll drift away in droves from both Likud and Kadima and he'll join Shas and Bayit Yehudi on the outside looking in. To begin with, anyway, since the latter two don't necessarily share his views, which means...? Here lies our problem. Whatever happened today wasn't exactly unexpected, nor is Lapid likely to change course unless forced into doing so against his own wishes. So everything remains very fluid. What's changed, however, is the situation within Likud - among its members and supporters, especially. A number of very strong forces led by some powerful people came together before the election campaign began. Now many feel disappointed with the results and want everyone else to feel that way too. Some wanted a general strike and others called for boycotting religious services. This group is certainly prepared to fight fiercely whenever necessary. It includes many ex-servicemen and soldiers. These men and women need to be heard and respected! What happened already on Tuesday night confirmed my worst suspicions. Even before polling stations closed, several leading politicians were getting ready to pull out of the race altogether. One of these was Moshe Kahlon whom you knew earlier as Finance minister in Ehud Olmert's government. His departure leaves us with five major figures - Netanyahu, Avigdor Lieberman, Naftali Bennett, Dan Meridor, Tzipi Livni - even including Agriculture minister Uri Ariel. All of them except Netanyahu need each other like firemen needing water hoses. Each supports the rest. Put simply, every candidate needed Levy-Levy's votes (about 45 percent) and therefore supported another in return. Otherwise none would enjoy majority status. Only one of them could conceivably lead the country. Which brings me back to Lieberman. Today he announced he intends resigning as foreign minister if he fails to form a national unity coalition government. Three days ago he tried to persuade Livni to become Israel's first female prime minister. She refused flatly. On Wednesday morning she told reporters during a visit to France that her goal isn't becoming the leader of Likud No 3 (the most important position). Her aim, she said, is to create a broad basis for forming a stable government. During campaigning, she claimed repeatedly that she couldn't work honestly alongside either Rivlin or Lapid because both favor territorial concessions. Hadn't she signed up for Likud No 1 with Yahya Ayal almost ten years ago? She wouldn't make excuses now, apparently. Even regarding Lieberman, I find myself asking questions. How long must Netanyahu tolerate someone whose entire career represents something akin to treason?

"As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will be one positive outcome. Ron explains: ""In my mind it's almost like an Afro-American left winger [in America] could say we are going to celebrate Black History Month but not forget about black history because of what has happened in Europe and other parts of the world; you know I think people here would get offended by something like that - and rightly so!"" It is certainly true that some sections of society may take offence if such comments were made against them however this does not mean they cannot happen - as long as those who make them have clear minds free from hatred, bigotry and arrogance. When Ron spoke to The Journal his thoughts echoed sentiments held by many across the country. This month students at universities from Manchester to Dublin have been marking International Holocaust Remembrance day which comes alongside reflective weeks for schools across Britain where pupils often learn lessons around anti-Semitism, prejudice and hate crime delivered through play or assemblies. But just how much do children actually understand? As part of our research into education in Poland, which included talking to teachers and parents, we found out why these events can go wrong for kids. And some tips to help them avoid potentially damaging mistakes when attending commemorative services. Click here to read more... The topic was controversial last year during Pope Benedict's visit to Poland and Polish media reported several incidents regarding remarks attributed to him. Some Poles hope upcoming state visits will bring fresh attention to the issue but others fear relations between Poland and Germany might worsen over its treatment of Catholic orders within the church hierarchy. Poland remains committed to strengthening ties with Berlin. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Warsaw earlier than her German counterpart did in 2013: she addressed parliament, laid flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and attended a memorial ceremony at St Mary Magdalen Church adjacent to Hitler's bunker site behind the Reich Chancellery building. Her spokesman said that the two leaders had discussed issues related to joint projects including energy and transport infrastructure. These include plans to build new transit lines linking lines Krakow-Warsaw-Gdansk (the Baltic Sea), Pomerania, Silesia, Upper Silesia, Moravia, South Bohemian Region, West Pomeranian Region and Lower Saxony. In addition, the chancellor met representatives of local communities affected by construction works - mainly farmers whose land needs to be expropriated. She promised to look closely at their concerns. Germany hopes improved bilateral cooperation following Angela Merkel's trip was reinforced by Germany's ambassador to Poland since 2005 Christian Wulff who arrived in office in January 2014. He openly supports Gdansk Shipyard owner Lech Walesa and other entrepreneurs fighting off attempts by foreign investors to buy up assets in historic buildings dating back centuries in cities like Bydgoszcz and Toruackie Warszewki outside Gdansk. According to the World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder 'Wulf' is among the most pro western European politicians in Eastern Europe after being elected mayor of Hamburg in 1998 and reelected three times before becoming president of the Bundestag. But despite acknowledging problems afflicting Christians in northern Poland still working hard towards improving Poland's image abroad, speaking fluent English and having a sound understanding of modern politics, critics claim he lacks legitimacy and commitment. They see him as too close to rightwing extremists from PiS party leader Jaracz who now leads the ruling coalition government. One activist described him as 'an old Nazi who hates Russians and Jews and wants us Germans dead, and therefore doesn't care whom he hurts, even women and children.' Ms Elisabeth Guigou, mother of former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who worked in both London and Paris, said: 'Christian Ulflofe is a very clever politician. His popularity came from the fact that Gherman Tito and Bolesaw Komorowski admired him. At first sight, he looks unassuming and reserved, but deep down inside and beneath his polished surface he has dark thoughts. He offered himself as a minister without portfolio and the role didn't suit him at all. He gives the impression of someone who sees everything from above and forgets everyone else. Once installed in his position in Berlin he lost interest in promoting democracy in Poland and became involved in other things - namely supporting fascist ideas. People don't appreciate this kind of person. They want somebody who takes responsibility seriously.' In response, Mr Wulf told reporters he was happy to work together with anyone and called accusations of fascism 'ridiculous.' Replying to criticism over alleged links with farright groups, he insisted that no political influence whatsoever existed.

""What happens when something goes wrong?

"Radical preachers will be banned from posting material online and anyone with convictions for extremist activity will be barred from working with children. Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for those convicted of a terrorism offence, the prime minister has said, as he outlined plans to tackle what civil liberties groups say could become Britain's biggest domestic security threat in decades. A consultation on new powers begins today following months of controversy over whether extremists should have their social media use monitored by police or intelligence agencies and who decides if they are plotting acts of terror against the UK. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is holding an initial roundtable meeting with experts at Westminster this morning ahead of launching the public engagement phase of her review into how extremism can best be tackled within existing laws. The government says it wants to look beyond traditional radicalising influences such as criminality and mental health problems towards other factors including online behaviour, peer pressure, family breakdown and foreign travel. Rudd told BBC Radio 4 that the focus would not change simply because social media was driving ideological currents around the world: ""It doesn't stop us recognising ... after 911 we realised that while physical transport might have been disrupted [online access] wasn't necessarily going to make much difference - and so now we know that you can easily get access to propaganda materials even when individuals aren't physically there. So I think the approach isn't really changing just because technology changes but rather assessing where do things come together?"" Facebook Twitter Pinterest Social media companies will report any posts deemed harmful to British society to the authorities Photograph: Ben PruchnieGetty Images She added that internet firms needed to play more proactive roles. ""We need them to take action sooner and not always wait until something happens before taking steps to try and address it. We want people feeling confident about using these platforms and knowing that all content shared does actually go through some sort of moderation process."" Two years ago the Labour party used a motion passed at its conference to call on ministers to ban or restrict the sites altogether, amid evidence suggesting their role in radicalising vulnerable young Britons had increased significantly since 2007. More than 1,000 suspected terrorists were reported last year alone on Facebook compared with fewer than 100 five years earlier. A Home Office spokesman said that while no firm dates existed for the end of the current legal bans on extremist organisations disseminating material online, that did not mean support for terrorist groups remained lawful. He pointed out that under the 2006 Terrorism Act, offline meetings between suspects and those involved in the promotion of violent ideology were also outlawed and required prior authorisation from the attorney general. Graham Stuart, director-general of Index on Censorship, which campaigns against state censorship, welcomed the proposed legislation but warned against rushing into introducing sanctions this summer without being careful to avoid further damaging freedom of speech rights. He said: ""In response to Islamism and far right nationalism, Conservative governments have placed increasing restrictions on free expression. In 2016 Theresa May introduced unprecedented surveillance measures to monitor people on (mostly Muslim) social media networks, expanded counter-terrorism policing budgets dramatically outside London, imposed a hugely controversial Prevent strategy under which critics claim thousands of Muslims may already face discrimination and racial profiling, restricted protest activities, criminalised journalism, expelled hundreds of imams and mosques and demonised critical academics. This won't solve our problem but it's important that political leaders don't damage freedoms of opinion and assembly and limit debate around questions like religion, race and immigration."" Andrew Brown QC, professor of human rights law at Birkbeck College and co-author of Protecting Free Speech Online, urged caution. ""For the most part there is nothing inherently wrong with banning people sharing abusive representations of religious beliefs but doing so merely as a matter of routine seems contrary to fundamental principles of liberal democracy: namely tolerance, respect and liberty of conscience. There needs to be sufficient safeguards built into the proposals to protect both freedom of thought, belief and practice against arbitrary interference and indeed prohibition itself."" Brendan Barber, policy convener at Compass, called on the government to abandon efforts to treat the issue solely as one of national security. ""There must never again be any attempt to conflate legitimate dissent, criticism of policies or ideas, opposition to state violence or oppression with extreme views, attacks on minorities or actions to promote prejudice, hate crime or threats to others,"" he wrote in advance of publication of the white paper expected later this month. Jill Trevelyan, of campaign group Liberty, said the latest announcement fell short of the promises taken during campaigning for the Conservatives in 2015 to outlaw Islamist preaching in mosques, schools and prisons. She said: ""Today's news reveals little progress on tackling Islamic extremist ideology, but instead shows that successive Tory administrations remain determined to clamp down on individual citizens engaging in peaceful protests for no reason whatsoever within schools, universities with limited options of two bad with the situation.

At present, anyone charged with serious offences does not need to leave Scotland until charges are brought against them; however, those accused of lesser offences under Scots law must give notice of their intention to reside overseas within 14 days of arrest (Newsnet SCotland). A plan to build five new airports along the Clyde coast revealed today will involve land filled using dredgers instead of traditional methods and require wells dug through solid rock. Airports news network reported that construction companies are bidding to win tenders worth 1m to develop each airport site over the next three years. All sites would include runways capable of handling large aircraft such as Boeing 767s and Airbus 380s, runway lights, air traffic control towers and car parks (Air News International). Four of the plans are due to go out shortly for public consultation, according to consultants acting for Glasgow Airport Ltd. Air Services Manager David Spence commented: ""This project will serve its purpose should we ever face another disaster like September 11th."" However, opponents claims all ports in Britain have a similar capacity. There are fears that dredging equipment cannot cope with the amount of sediment at the locations intended for expansion.

Michael McGinnis, 52, has been jailed indefinitely after pleading guilty to killing Sarah Jane Martin, 23, whose body was discovered in her flat overlooking Loch Lomandock in west Co Wexford. Ms Martin, originally from Kilkenny, arrived in Ireland in 2001 in order to attend college. She worked as a clerical assistant at Waterford Regional Court, having previously studied nursing at Cork University Hospital. Her body was found by gardai in January 2004 buried beneath cardboard boxes on the floor of her bedroom in a second storey apartment in Ballinderry Road. After claiming she had left for France, Mr Mcginnis moved back to Mullion, near Killarney, County Kerry, where he lived alone in a remote cottage. Gardai arrested him later that day after finding blood stains matching DNA tests taken from Ms Martin's clothing. During interviews conducted in 2005, Mr Mcginnis confessed to shooting Ms Martin twice 15 months earlier. A post mortem examination showed both bullets passed through her head. Appeal judge Paul Nolan described the killing as ""an act deliberately carried out"" adding that there was evidence of sexual activity between the killer and victim (Irish Independent). Judge Nolan sentenced Michael M cGinnes' girlfriend Margaret Kelly, 31, to six months imprisonment suspended for 18 months following conviction of perverting the course of justice.

A judge sentenced Alistair Spagnoletti, 21, of Luton, and Curtis Walker, 23, of Watford, to nine years each; Jonathan Smith, 25, of Dagenham, 12 months; Mark Hargreaves, 24, of Rayners Lane, London W9, nine months; John James O'Connor, 26, (Lon) london Rd, Barking, east London, nine months jail terms all suspended for 18 months; Chris Donnelly, 28, of Longfield Road Westcliff-On-Sea, Essex, eight months; David Jones, 39, from South Oakley Drive, Cambridgeshire, four years after he admitted three offences including sexual activity with children under 16. Callum Ward, 19, of Watford, was found guilty yesterday following jury trial and will be sentenced next month. Said to be one member of the group targeted by police, the teenager received eight years behind bars after admitting rape, supplying cocaine, coercion and false imprisonment charges against his victim. The gang met her through social media and lured him away home where they drugged him before assaulting her. He later falsely accused her of attempted murder saying she had set out to kill herself - claiming that when she did not die, he 'realised what type of girl I really am'. The case stemmed from Operation Arboe Police carried out between June 2013 and February 2014 investigating significant levels of internet based sexual exploitation involving females aged 15 or younger. It culminated in January 2015 when officers raided several properties across Herts., Kent, Bucks, Suffolk and Norfolk. They seized computers, mobile phones as well as drugs paraphernalia used in the crimes. A total of 883 sexually explicit images were discovered which had been taken during the commission of the offending and shared over various sites linked to paedophilia and pornography online. Detective Inspector Colin Jelbert said: ""This is yet another example of how technology has made it easier than ever to find victims of this sort of abuse. This investigation involved our specialist online team work closely with intelligence gathering agencies around the world. We believe there are many more young women like the ones we arrested whose lives have been blighted by these gangs."" Jagermeister proves deadly cocktail in 17 year old's death By Staff Reporter [Published December 3rd 2017] An adolescent boy died after drinking a mixture containing khat leaves while bingeing on alcohol and smoking marijuana, according to inquest findings released Monday. ""Both substances can cause dehydration, potentially leading to complications,"" Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray ruled, adding that Tregonning School student Thomas Frankland may also have suffered a seizure due to acute intoxication. She noted that toxicology results showed no evidence of any other substance in his system. Franklin called emergency services to report he'd become unwell after consuming the drink shortly after midnight on Sept. 4 last year at a house party near Portsmouth, Hampshire. Bystanders told paramedics that he'd fallen unconscious and lost some blood - but could still move his arms and legs. Franklin initially refused medical help, however once transported to hospital he became unconscious and required resuscitation. Beasley-Murray recorded cardiac arrest as the immediate cause of death, noting the symptoms of severe hypokalemia. Investigators interviewed those present at the party along with friends who helped care for Franklin until an ambulance arrived. In addition tests conducted prior to autopsies revealed no signs of physical injury suggesting foul play occurred. While coroner conceded there hadn't been enough information provided about the exact nature of the combination (khat wine?) to reach firm conclusions about its toxicity, the panel asked a pathologist to examine stored samples of his stomach contents. Those specimens indicated high concentrations of ethanol and salicylate, though neither presence nor quantity would prove fatal alone, particularly if consumed in small quantities. But combined together, the level of ethanol ingested likely contributed substantially towards causing Franklin's death. ""Thomas took a considerable amount of both drinks within a short period of time, possibly in response to peer pressure, without considering the risks, dangers of mixing the substances,"" Beasley-Murray stated in her ruling. In particular, she cited the fact that ingestion of large amounts of alcohol significantly increases risk of heart attack because of associated dehydration and hypotension both conditions seen in those administered on Jagermeister survival cocktails. Commenting on the mix, Dr. Jason Porterhouse, consultant forensic examiner at the Institute the opening another hattery warajst matter, observed, ""I will tell you more than half of teens.

"Tandridge District Council leader Martin Fisher gave planners a shortlist of five areas for such a scheme. He said one new Surrey village is better than ""scatter-gunning"" homes and cramping further expansion at the 100,000 home site in Reigate. A report to be considered by Tandridge council on Thursday will reveal that residents would have access to open space equivalent to 1 per cent of housing land and 3pc more green spaces while households with children would also get 23rds bigger gardens compared with today's average. It will call for 24 hours' free parking outside all 10,500 properties across two sites within 30 minutes walking distance from stations. In total, rather than an estimated 80,000 people living near the station - up from around 60,000 now - there could be as many as 110,000 private cars parked along roads which are normally quiet between 5pm and 7am when they should instead be used by pedestrians and buses. The study reveals: Any extra development must not reduce existing services; Transport improvements need to provide smoother journeys once passengers arrive at their destination; There needs to be room for trees so neighbourhoods feel less claustrophobic in winter months; A park close to commuters or school groups should allow them to walk to local schools easily without worrying about road safety; and More high rise flats should only go ahead if greater community ownership can be achieved. The proposals come after major investment has been made to improve transport links including building four extra platforms at Gatwick Airport, building the first stage of Crossrail, extending London Overground trains from East Croydon through Redhill towards Ashford International Express Depot, introducing a 150mph electric train service linking Heathrow Terminal 4 to Stansted via central London and extending High Speed 6 services into Kent - having previously stalled because of funding problems. Urban designer Rod Woodhams who worked on the original masterplan for the area says he was delighted the ideas were welcomed. He added: ""One of the biggest challenges yesterday during Question Time (at Tandridge) was how you might achieve this type of urbanism. I think it's very achievable.""",0,168

However, he added: ""At my age I don't think anybody can really expect to hold together a political career on their own energy. You need supporters and allies, and I've tried hard over three decades to make sure I'm surrounded by people who share my values. It sounds trite but friendship makes things easier. Friendships develop naturally anyway. So yes, perhaps it will prove necessary to sit alongside somebody like Boris for several weeks more than usual, and that's fine.""

"Whether or not he is on the formal menu, Mr Snowden will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows. Ms Merkel's trip to the US is markedly different from a state visit by President Obama - who she met in Washington last year for talks about Iran and Syria - as it has the potential to upend German-US relations at their lowest point since the end of World War Two. At least one senior official told Reuters: ""It would be absolutely wrong if either side hosted him."" For many Germans, this may seem an absurd prospect, but with Berlin keenly aware of its own vulnerability now China can read all of Germany's emails and steal trade secrets from Siemens and Bosch along with those of other western companies, they have good reason to hold back any show of friendship until they are sure how much damage the former NSA contractor did them. Western intelligence agencies were practically licking themselves in glee when they realised what his contract allowed him access to. In fact, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first broke the story, even before the fugitive documents began leaking out to journalists, some members of Congress wanted to shut down the entire Nacelle deal altogether (Nacelle being a company involved in launching satellites). Even after India complained that Nacelle was responsible for spying on Indian foreign policy and defence secrets and asked Delhi to block future launches, no action followed. It seems that Nacelle simply checked off every box possible under the law, including making certain parts of its software available only to approved customers like the Pentagon, whose communications systems we need anyway. Moreover, just over three years ago, the NGO Digital Rights Foundation filed a complaint accusing Nacelle of illegally collecting sensitive data on European satellite operators and passed it onto Israel, Saudi Arabia and Canada; its case is still pending. So far, Germany hasn't been particularly outspoken against Nacelle. But once you've slipped into bed with Kazakhstan, where you're also able to keep tabs on your citizens via mobile phone networks, I'm guessing there are few more attractive options than keeping close ties with Uncle Sam. And the man who ran the agency charged with tapping Angela Merkel's phones has already admitted doing exactly that himself.So while the German chancellor might want to brush off her new found friend Edward Snowden as a troublemaker extraordinaire, let us be clear for a moment: You could say that Hans Kubler has done the same thing, except without getting caught. We presume that America got rather excited about his work because, just like Mr Snowden, his employers had entrusted him with classified information that the Americans didn't know about. As one source put it: 'We couldn't believe our eyes.' This isn't to suggest that time spent working in IT security doesn't involve lots of risks, especially given the stunning amount of damage recently caused by cyber criminals seeking ways around digital defences. However, given Germany's recent history, any move towards friendly relations with America should come with safeguards: that the country never spies on its allies, for example, nor allows American firms use its infrastructure to snoop on Europeans' private conversations online, for instance. While practices such as these could make life easier for everyone else concerned, they'd hopefully leave none of the Big Three countries feeling especially sorry for having changed sides.",0,191

The visitors started brightly, with Martin Olsson forcing his way through after just four minutes before curling towards an empty net, only for Joe Bennett to get across Thomas Gravesen's cross superbly. But it was Burnley who continued to dominate possession as they sought inspiration from former boss Eddie Howe - now managing Bournemouth.

"A letter sent by party activists in north Wales claimed Michelle Brown has been ""abrasive and discourteous"" to them. It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a motion of no confidence was held against her on Friday, which she survived with the support of 12 members. But sources said it had caused concern among senior figures within the party that there were now allegations of bullying going back over three years from people who were never formally reprimanded or even investigated. Ms Brown is understood to have visited one complainant personally but denies any inappropriate behaviour towards him. No action was taken after an internal investigation in 2016 found that he made defamatory comments about Ms Brown during a meeting attended by around 40 colleagues at Westminster. The MP for Montgomeryshire first worked as Mr Farage's personal aide when he contested the European Parliament elections in 2009. She joined Ukip in 2013 and became deputy chairwoman in May 2015 - becoming the second woman ever to lead the party - before being appointed leader last summer. Advertisement Mr Quinn described her as "" difficult "" but added: 'She knows how we work here and I don't think anyone would want to be bullied.' He insisted the NEC voted unanimously to suspend Mrs Brown 'with immediate effect' because they could not ignore claims made by two women including former vice-chairman Alan Sked, who alleged harassment between 2015 and 2017.

"Vicky Cherry, 44, had been missing for 15 months when police found her body wrapped in a duvet and plastic sheeting at a house in Toronto Street, Bolton, in January. She worked as an au pair from June 2015 to August 2016 and then started working with the family she was caring for on their farm near Bury. But they were not very welcoming so Vicky moved out and began looking after herself again. She rented the warm room in Greengate Close because it offered more privacy. It also meant there was no chance of meeting anyone else who may have known where she lived since she did not live on the property. When neighbours said that strange people kept coming into town regularly others thought that maybe the person's mother or father would be visiting but nothing like this ever happened before. However one neighbour spotted Roger Cornish driving down the road early evening seven times between December 28th 2017 and February 9th 2018 wearing jeans while carrying what appeared to be some clothes both men agreed he could take them back if Vicky wanted. He told a woman next door that night about his visit which made everyone suspicious something wasn't right. After the discovery of Vicky's body detectives trawled through surveillance footage trying to identify any vehicles matching the description of the ones seen by neighbours earlier in the year.

"The US-owned retail firm, which processes hundreds of thousands of online orders each week, could have put millions of transactions at risk, security expert Paul Moore estimates. He first noticed the problem in 2017 A bank error that allowed information from customers' credit and debit cards to be transferred directly into the hands of cybercriminals has left tens of million of British consumers vulnerable to fraud. British banks including Barclaycard, Santander UK and Ulster Bank are among those affected by a flaw discovered last year by cybersecurity company FireEye Inc, according to documents seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The incident was reported earlier this month when it emerged that American online payments processor WorldPay had been hacked for quite some time - but only after it became clear how exposed its users were as a result of its mistake. Read more: How important is your card number? It's possibly not what you think Different methods can be used to steal data about people who use their charge or credit cards, depending on whether they're using contactless payment terminals such as Apple Pay machines found in many shops, or standard magnetic stripe readers at checkout counters. But aside from highly targeted scams like phishing attacks where criminals request personal information outright via either email or text message, any successful hack involving stolen card details also requires hackers gaining access to a retailer's point of sale system (POS). This typically means hacking an employee's device, accessing networks through insecure Wi-Fi connections, infiltrating trusted third parties with whom retailers share sensitive customer data, or intercepting traffic between POS devices and backend systems. READ MORE: Hackers get 3m inside Equifax breach victim database Security experts say retailers should be doing much more than just reviewing suspicious activity reports submitted by customers. They argue that every transaction made by any person should require valid identification so that these types of incidents don't happen even once. Such measures would involve reissuing all consumer PIN numbers after changing passwords, issuing new ones based on correct answers provided during account creation and installing physical ID scanners at checkouts instead of relying solely on self-service digital options. However, until then, any individual buying goods via web, phone app or store kiosk will need to keep vigilant - always checking if there's anything out of place before entering hisher CVV code or confirming that no one else appears to have tampered with the device being used. FireEye says that 940 million 'transaction identifiers' belonging to Visa, MasterCard and other payment gateways were compromised over 2018-2019 period, and as a result it may now see tens of billions of dollars worth of fraudulent charges in the course of 2019 alone. In response to media questions, WorldPay told Business Insider that it takes action whenever potential breaches come across its attention, and that it doesn't believe publicly available sources indicate there has ever been any evidence of direct money laundering associated with the hack. ""We recently identified a vulnerability impacting our PCI DSS compliant environment,"" said James Pitfield, managing director of WorldPay Europe. ""Our investigation determined that certain Cardholder Data Files containing Transaction Identifiers - commonly referred to as 'CVVs' - stored within the Worldpay file management technology had not been properly encrypted."" In order to protect consumers, companies must determine why their biometric standards might be broken In October 2018, the company disclosed that attackers managed to inject malicious software onto computers running its RosettaNet gateway service, allowing them to copy target user credentials and capture internet addresses where victims attempted to make purchases. While the attack remained limited to RosettaNet, the episode highlighted another issue common to most, if not all, modern banking infrastructure - weak cyber-security controls placed at crucial points along a complex supply chain of businesses whose job it is to carry out financial operations for others without actually having prior knowledge of exactly what they're storing and handling. Both Visa International and MasterCard Worldwide declined to comment specifically regarding the latest allegation about Russian malware linked to the 2016 presidential election campaign, saying that they don't discuss specific investigations. However, both groups did confirm that they continue to monitor relevant threats closely. As part of this process, both note that while global computer chipmakers often sell equipment to multiple countries around the world, they remain responsible for ensuring products sold abroad meet local regulations. ""As manufacturers we rely heavily upon partners to help us ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations governing critical technical components utilized in the design and production of electronic commerce solutions,"" wrote Patrick Brannan, head of anti-fraud policy at Visa. ""For instance, when designing hardware that connects to communication lines, governments worldwide specify encryption algorithms required for secure communications, irrespective of which country the manufacturer works in."" However, he added that due diligence carried out by suppliers does not include assessing risks posed by individuals working alongside them. Similarly, mastercard spokesman Albert Gidari said: ""MasterCard assesses product requirements from our industry contacts and evaluates vendor applications when they apply a score by either zero-degree players to conduct compared to try to duplicity) clients perform second track the surface, to test attempts to quality control guidelines",0,207

"A long, slow sigh sounded in the room. Then a consolatory hand on her shoulder. Shortly after, the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. Canon Enid Morgan remembers it well. ""I was so frightened I could hardly think straight,"" she recalled this week. ""My heart was racing and my palms were sweating as if I had been running all day - though that wasn't possible for me because of my arthritis, which made walking difficult. But then came the moment we actually saw him: tall, dark-haired, with eyes like deep wells, hidden behind thick glasses. We sat down to talk. He said he wanted to marry us both but couldn't afford my dowry price unless there were more bridesmaids than one. A wife would be needed at court; his father might not approve otherwise."" She nods sadly. It is clear from reading between the lines what happened next in their marriage. Her real first husband died before they married. After three decades she found herself alone again, widowed twice over. The last time, the man who purported to love her turned out to be cruel. Not only did he take advantage of her financially by taking advantage of her trust, but also by proposing marriage under false conditions. Now here she was being propositioned once again. Only weeks earlier Mr Harry Grunwell had bought her a home, presented her with an engagement ring, taken and paid for her holiday to Cornwall, promised to give her 500 towards any expenses incurred during the wedding preparations. And now this strange young man was asking if she'd consider marrying him. If he would love her forever and ever? From where she stood, apart from accepting a life of poverty (or worse) with no chance of family support, she didn't see much point in staying alive. So when she received another invitation a few days later, she thought about things carefully and decided yes. In November 1930 the two women met face to face for the first time since 1920 at Westminster Abbey. They walked up the aisle together arm in arm. But even as Mrs Cantornee Winifred Mary Louise Stoward smiled through red lipstick at her groom and kissed him goodbye, those same lips began to quiver uncontrollably. Even as they exchanged vows beneath chandeliers adorned with fake flowers, tears rolled onto her pillowcase. As their daughter Anne was born 18 months later, Canon Enid remained inconsolable. She refused to leave her mother's side. When her newborn child became dangerously ill just six hours old, Mrs Moore took care of them both while Canon Enid prayed fervently for divine intervention. At some level she must have known something terrible was coming. Just five years previously, the whole world had gone mad.

"Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal. His team-mates had also been involved but they were left to rue their profligacy as Bologna held on for a famous victory and sent them packing from UEFA Cup football at the quarter final stage. The match was billed as ""the battle of Anfield"" and Wallace did what Roy Evans once described him as doing: scoring goals even when we didn't need them. Like so many others before him over the years he took chances, in this case with his head rather than feet! He made one himself early on when taking a certain penalty kick within our own half that was saved by Gianluca Pagliari and we thought all was lost again until he collected it and fired home into the top corner. A few minutes later he turned provider with an excellent cross which found Peter Beardsley who passed back for John Aldridge to net. This time we'd hit paydirt and went looking for more quick fire strikes; however none came and after 70 odd minutes we were grateful for his contribution against an Italian side who were pressing hard, throwing men forward wherever there was space and trying to win every ball. We could look up towards the Kop end though where the fans' chants of 'Three Lions four Nations' seemed only partially appreciated by the Italians who continued to play aggressively. But the defending wasn't bad either with two fine saves keeping out Luigi Panico and then Giorgio Ruffilli late on. In contrast Chris Woods produced some superb stretching tackles throughout while his partner Steve Nicol looked calm in possession. Curiously enough the centre backs coped pretty well too although I do remember thinking how poor Nicky Weaver was in midfield! The game remained evenly poised throughout before Philippe Albert's 30th minute red card brought proceedings to a halt. After 13 wins in 199495, seven wins last season (seven!) any further unbeaten run in League matches would be met with scepticism amongst supporters. What if...? It seems inconceivable now? Not really because after such a brilliant start we can still reach Wembley so why worry about improbable events like a perfect streak beginning?

"The Austrian opened the scoring with a penalty after Ashley Westwood brought down Phil Bardsley. He set up his second with a looping header which he then chested in. Leandro Bacuna was denied by goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer as he went for goal and moments later Aaron Lennon, who had replaced him following an injury to captain Steven Gerrard, tried to find space but shot over from close range. Schwarzer missed from 12 yards shortly before half-time when Liverpool's defence failed to deal with another corner taken into their area. The striker felt hard contact on his right knee and limped off leaving manager Kenny Dalglish with no choice other than replacing him with Torres. Liverpool improved immediately and Stewart Downing put them ahead 10 minutes after the break thanks to good work involving Walcott, Suarez and Sturridge. Eight minutes later Gerrard took advantage of some slack marking at a free-kick to knock home and well clear from point blank range. All three players were imitating Ronaldo more or less - only they would get away with it. They weren't done there yet though as clever play ended with Suarez unleashing a low 20-yard strike that beat Australia keeper Mat Ryan. It proved to be a crucial moment because in stoppage time Keane got across unmarked to head the ball away from Suarez.

The first European contact was in 1492 when Ferdinand Magellan and his expedition arrived at Mactan Island off Cebu in what is now the Philippines; he claimed it for Spain.[15] In 1605 Manila galleon Miguel Lopez de Legazpi discovered the Philippine Islands (purely coincidental), naming them Las Islas Filipinas the Filipino [or Malay] islands.[16171819] During this period Spanish explorers established settlements along most coasts - particularly on Negros island which they named after their king Philip III - as well as trading posts throughout Southeast Asia and further as far south as India, where the Portuguese had long traded.[20] These early contacts were mostly peaceful although the Spaniards saw themselves as vassals or clients rather than full partners who might be expected to rule over indigenous peoples. Indigenous populations began moving into cities during that time also.[21] When Guerrero assumed office in 1765, only two years before independence, Spain controlled about 2 million square kilometers of land,[22] including large parts of Central America, South America, Africa, Oceania and Micronesia and scattered smaller colonies around the world.[23] Most significantly: In North America, an estimated 700,000 Native Americans lived within Spanish colonial boundaries in 1700s Mexico, New Spain and Peru.[24] Today, the number of Latin American natives living under Spanish political jurisdiction has decreased by 90, due mainly to economic development and poorer overall health care systems.[25] This includes hundreds of thousands who live outside official control today. Others left entirely, such as many Mexican Indians who fled the country's war against drug cartels. Many remain illegally within countries near those borders, while others have moved back home to places like Guatemala, Chile and Argentina. Some also live primarily among other ethnic groups, especially autochtones, for whom being part of one particular group is not always possible.[26] Some 50 million native inhabitants survived the holocaust caused by Genghis Khan and the hordes bred by him.[2728] From these few survivors came present day Mongolians and Japanese. One estimate put the total population of all existing worldwide racial homelands at 11 billion according to 2000 census data,[2930] with 1.7 billion people living in Europe alone,[31] meaning that nearly half of humanity lives either outside ""white"" civilization or else within non-European nations whose histories do not include European colonialism. As noted above, even the Americas did not become white until late 1800s. Generally speaking, those currently living in what would once have been considered the Third World do not wish to return to the conditions of earlier times, nor should they.[32] Those still residing in First World nations have shown little interest whatsoever in returning to past historical circumstances.[33] Yet some critics argue that indigenous societies suffer greater oppression because they have none of the benefits provided by western democracy or capitalism and thus lack the means to resist foreign domination.[34] Westerners tend to ignore or disown the fact of nationhood and national pride, calling instead for globalism so that everyone can enjoy equality without guilt.[35] Globalization tends to bring wealth and prosperity to elites of every stripe, but the poor benefit much less often than promised.[36] It must therefore be remembered that ""globalization,"" like globalization itself, does not work equally across geographic sectors.[37] A similar pattern exists in Africa. During colonization, key areas of former African empires fell under the dominion of imperialists based elsewhere. For example, British East Africa included Zanzibar, Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nyasaland, and Belgian Congo included Katanga, Kasai Orientale and Shaba (now Rwanda).[38] Other nationalist movements arose to challenge imperialism, notably the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya and the MPLA movement in Angola, though both defeated fascist regimes later allowed neoimperialist dictatorships to take power.[39] Even in regions where fascism or communism took hold, anti-colonial nationalism continued its struggle alongside these ideologies. National socialism grew out of racist Pan German ideology in Germany and National Socialism in Italy, but Nazi atrocities led to rejection of Nazism.[40] Thereafter, organizations known variously as resistance parties, communist parties, socialist parties, social democratic parties or populist parties formed in opposition to each other and governments, usually led by bourgeois democrats or fascists.[41] One result is multiparty Indo-China, allowing Vietnamese communists to win elections and establish Communist Party dictatorship in 1962-75.[42] Another outcome of nationalism is independent African states. After gaining independence, several African leaders chose to continue running centralized economies and state institutions modeled upon those of the old colonizers.[43] So while liberal democracies dealignge again in India, a certain amounting to leaveit sizeroppear construco staying strong setting up until testing the quantity test flaping away testing performin planning to stay",0,215
"The 28-year-old left Rovers after their National League promotion final defeat by Grimsby earlier this month.

The couple could only hear faint moaning coming from below deck so they went down there and found the man slumped over the hole next to where the anchor rope came out of the hull.

"Ties have sharply deteriorated in recent years, and the government in Warsaw has sharply criticised Russia's conduct in Ukraine. But Mr Andreyev's interpretation of history brought relations to a new low during his time as Poland's ambassador at Moscow's embassy before he was sacked over alleged visa violations for attending talks on the Ukrainian crisis about which he initially had denied knowledge. Mr Andreyev was accused by Polish prime minister Donald Tusk last week of hiding from parliament ""serious irregularities"" that occurred while he served as ambassador between 2009 and 2011. It is not known what these irregularities were but they are said to be linked to illegal procurement deals involving Russian officials. In December 2015, three of Mr Andreyev's aides who worked with him at the foreign ministry were detained after being charged with alleged corruption.

"The announcement of the coaching changes at Surrey on the day of the Australia-Sri Lanka Champions Trophy game at The Oval meant juggling meetings and phone calls with stints in the nets. But it was a welcome break from what was still, according to Steve Magoffin, ""one helluva match."" Curiously enough though, while most players were relieved that they wouldn't be facing Sri Lankan cricket for much longer, there couldn't have been many who would want to go back into their current set up and play against them again because once you've played one side you can never forget about its strengths or weaknesses. Unfortunately when you're not playing well against the other side then things don't get any easier as all sorts of uneasiness enters your mind - doubts creep in and subconsciously colour how you think which inevitably affects everything else. It's just human nature. And so we came out ready to embrace another new challenge, but also knowing exactly what this green jersey means. What does it mean to wear it? How do I approach these guys after everything I've learnt over my time here? That last question has already answered itself thankfully as the lads are terrific mates, some of whom I grew very close to during our time together. But going forward there will obviously still be times when the pressure is on and you feel like you need to deliver games and results, but now the team environment around me is different and everyone knows better than anyone what I'm capable of doing and why that would be dangerous if done poorly. Plus having experienced defeat before, rather than winning every single game, makes it seem even more special. Above all though, no matter where you end up coming next season, the fact that you know you haven't got a great opportunity left in you only adds more motivation to work harder until you achieve whatever goal might lie ahead. There'll always be challenges along the way, and perhaps none bigger than trying to live up to those expectations placed upon you by someone who holds such high hopes for you personally.""",0,224

"The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international began his European club career with Standard Liege in 2009. He then joined Anderlecht, for whom he scored seven goals in 47 league appearances, before moving to Serie A giants AC Milan last summer where he has yet to make an appearance this season. Meanwhile, El Ghazi's compatriot Didier Drogba is the first African footballer ever to score 100 times in Europe and considering his age, it seems certain that he will do so again. Drogba also came through Standard de Liege's youth system but it was at Chelsea that he broke into the side on loan from Marseille in October 2004 aged 17, making 19 Premier League starts over the next two seasons as a central midfielder; although injury restricted him to just six games during 200506 when he finished top of the PFA Young Player of The Year voting. As we saw earlier today, there are many more footballers who have represented their country whilst playing abroad than those who haven't played anywhere else after leaving home shores, however we thought you might like to know about some of them - perhaps they could inspire your own future moves?",0,226
"Georg Niedermeier's own goal gave Pep Guardiola's side a half-time lead, which David Alaba doubled. Daniel Didavi fired into the top corner for Stuttgart, but Douglas Costa's long-range shot sealed victory four minutes from time. Five things we learned... Timo Werner is in good form ahead of Bayern Munich clash Werner scored his second Bundesliga hat trick after weeks on end where he had struggled to score goals and bring others into play. The 22-year-old has now scored 10 times this season - including five against Hoffenheim last weekend - as he looks like one of Germany's brightest young talents. He was involved in all three Stuttgart goals with two assists and provided several other chances too, while also winning another penalty when the ball broke loose near by him towards the end of the game. It may not be easy but it seems that Timo Werne will start next week's Champions League tie at home to Juventus. Bayern run riot again The Bavarian giants looked every bit their imperious selves once more following an indifferent opening 15 minutes. When they finally settled down and began playing some proper football, they were unstoppable; such was the difference between these sides and Schalke in terms of style and personnel. There seemed little about Jupp Heynckes' team who are so often accused of being boring to suggest otherwise here: Athletic Bilbao would have been thrilled to see them dominate possession (69) for 120 consecutive minutes in just their third league match since the summer break. Their fluid attacking movement unnerved their opponents before they even came close to scoring as Manuel Neuer made fine saves to deny both Leon Goretzka and Mario Gomez. Franck Ribery could only sparkle at times though and Ramires needs to find greater consistency if Chelsea can continue to reach the heights they reached under Conte this term. David Alaba makes most ground forward This was yet another impressive performance for Austria defender Alaba who played 71 of Frankfurt's passes throughout the 90 minutes. His return pass led directly to Thomas Muller's first goal then served up Golazos to Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski alike. Having returned to full fitness following his knee injury, there might still be further room for him to improve, especially considering how much space he allowed Bastian Schweinsteiger to move inside. Alaba himself certainly didn't look out of place either, operating well alongside Mats Hummels in defence and providing excellent cover behind Keisuke Honda and Grunwalder. Once again, Bayern soundly beat their hosts, despite having enjoyed far superior possession over the course of the evening. In fact, it was 63. Didavi keeps it tight Stuttgart goalkeeper Roman Burki produced a string of clutch finishes during his spell on loan at West Ham earlier this year. Backing Benfica's Renato Sanches or Newcastle's Georginio Wijnaldum to replace him would prove rather difficult however, given the quality of the German international whose displays helped ensure Die Adler qualified for Europe thus far in 201516. No less than six shots were blocked off target in Frankfurt's box alone - the same number as Stuttgart managed themselves - while his composure often proved crucial. Shouldered through by Axel Witsel, Didavi somehow caught Rob Haemhorr's attempted crossbar and parried away Lukas Hradecky's follow-up effort. Moments later, he dived low at the feet of Didavi to prevent a certain opener. Incidentally, Didavi saved a penalty kick shortly before conceding the winner. Overall, the 25-year-old moved better than anyone else on a struggling Freiburg side and he comfortably handled Bayern's speedsters, particularly diving to save Gotze's header early in the second period. All in all, it wasn't perhaps his best display of the campaign but nevertheless, he remains undroppable until new signing Roger Federer comes stateside. Costa steps up big time Any doubts over whether Eden Hazard should indeed leave Stamford Bridge for Real Madrid appear quite unfounded after watching what he did against Gladbach. After returning late from suspension following his red card against Ajax on Matchday 4, the Belgian starlet found no rhythm whatsoever as Frank Lampard's men laboured defensively and lacked any kind of cutting edge going forwards. However, it took him just seven minutes to settle matters in Dortmund on Saturday night as he controlled Edson Alvarez' superb free kick volleyed past Bartlomiej Semin and onto the post. With his link-up play outstanding en route to netting twice in 14 matches, you wonder why the Blues don't make full use of the talent they possess within their ranks?

"No, President Xi Jinping of China isn't back for second helpings from the Buckingham Palace banquet, this time it is the Indian prime minister who is stopping by. India has lost its appetite for a formal visit to Washington after years of anger at perceived U.S. intrusions in Kashmir and Hizbullah's missile tests against Israel - not to mention being insulted with Donald Trump's ""America First"" outburst on North Korea during last year's G20 summit. Now Modi will be able to show Prime Minister Shinzo Abe he can take on Mr. Trump as well, including on trade conflicts that threaten global economic recovery. As the two leaders prepare to start their first official face-to-face meeting Tuesday evening (though I doubt they're looking forward to it), here are four things you need to know: 1) Prepare yourself for nuclear war India does have the largest stockpile of weapons grade plutonium among nonproliferation states, though most analysts agree there is no program to use these bombs or make more. But based on estimates by arms control experts such as Jeffrey Lewis or Hans Kristensen, India could build five small, dirty atom bomb per every one hundred tons of uranium ore extracted - and produce several million pounds per year. This would give them an effective arsenal within less than 20 years if all goes according to plan, which means they would still have enough material left over from their prior efforts. In 2015 alone, India produced nearly 84 tonnes of Pu-240, increasing its stock 60 since 2010; but even without material increase, India has already built up close to half the world's production capacity for weaponizing fissionable materials. The same holds true for Pakistan too, so both countries now have about 100 kg each of highly enriched uranium and spent fuel available for producing hydrogen bombs or miniaturized nukes using tritium instead of heavy water as moderator to boost efficiency. While neither country has yet decided whether to use it, either nation can put together a force capable of striking New Delhi or Islamabad -regardless of conventional forces on both sides-within weeks. And while a global nuclear crisis might seem unlikely today, we need only look back three decades ago to see how quickly a rogue state like Iran went from having far fewer warheads than India to possessing around 1300 with plans to double that number - in less than seven months. For both governments, nuclear deterrence remains a cornerstone policy, while both nations' military modernization projects include new missiles and submarines designed for preemptive strikes at enemy targets before any adversary knows where it intends to strike next. 2) Nuke anyone who messes with us While India doesn't appear ready to go nuclear right away just yet, weapons scientists believe it may be possible for it to do so even in response to new alliances between Russia and Turkey andor North Korea and South Korea. If all goes as planned, then the result could ultimately lead to a regional shooting war involving Japan, India, Australia, Indonesia and other neighboring powers along the disputed Maritime Southeast Asia arc. Since World War II ended in 1945, the region has seen near constant warfare, leading to many casualties, destruction of property, massive refugee migrations and untold environmental damage. A multi-polar Asia Pacific order appears increasingly likely given current geopolitical realities, raising concerns among some political thinkers that old Cold War thinking dominates foreign relations in this part of the globe. Both India and Pakistan seek to eliminate any chance of another East Asian conflict by fostering better ties with Beijing, maintaining free access to sea lanes through international waters and avoiding provocation. Despite open diplomatic channels, however, tensions remain high across the border because all parties fear Chinese intentions towards Kashmir, where Beijing claims sovereignty. So when China moves warships into territorial seas of Taiwan, Vietnam or Thailand, those nations naturally worry that China wants to extend a similar claim over Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma, respectively. Even Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi once said she couldn't rule out the idea of going nuclear herself, adding that ""we should never say it won't happen again as long as our borders continue what seems very unstable."" 3) Try to keep warm hearts amid cold logic With their parochialism and lack of vision, traditionalists in Tokyo find it hard to reconcile themselves with recent events unfolding outside their own self-interests, especially considering they have been pushing a strong anti-China agenda since ending WWII in August 1945. As the Japanese economy stagnates due to falling exports of cars, electronics and machinery after they were hit harder than expected during last year's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, Prime Minister Abe needs protectionist policies withstood by his allies in Europe and America in order to avoid losing support domestically. He also hopes to win favor with domestic voters ahead of national elections set for December 2019 by encouraging trade negotiations with the European Union and further relaxing constraints on capital flows from banks and businesses operating in Japan.

"Cyber-attacks, trolls, terrorist propaganda, sexism, racism, Twitter mobs.... stop the web now, Mr Berners-Lee, we want to get off. So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most read publications and websites on The Huffington Post UK - which is compiled by our data team from a range of sources including page views, social media mentions and comments left in articles - I was expecting some obvious choices... Not so much. At first glance this year's annual top 10 might seem somewhat predictable, with BBC News taking overall top spot for both the second consecutive time (numbers 1 2), followed closely behind by Mail Online at 3, Telegraph Online at 4, Independent Digital Media Group at 5, Guardian Unlimited at 6, Mirror Online at 7, HuffPost UK at 8 and FT Alphaville at 9. But then there are two surprises: one, as we will see below, that has come about because of new entrants; another, more surprising still, has been achieved despite what appears to be an ongoing decline in traffic. The biggest change however is not amongst those expected leaders but within the ranks of the other sites who made their debut in 2015 - four have gained places while two others have dropped. Here they are: 1) Daily Express: Up. 11 increase (73K). Defying its reputation as 'just Tory backbenchers', The Sun managed only 17th place last year, bringing all sorts of unwelcome attention upon itself after running headlines such as ""Ladette Who Wants To Shock Parents By Telling Them She's Gay Is Failing In Mummy Blogging Debut."" This year, thanks mainly to its MeToo coverage the title climbed up eight slots to take over the number one position... although, perhaps surprisingly given how viciously many newspapers attacked Jeremy Corbyn during his leadership campaign, he actually fell down 22 spots into third place. Things were even better than you'd expect on paper though: lead article writer Mike Stuchbery had already covered Pope Francis' criticism of Donald Trump (and received flak for it afterwards); editor Rebekah Wade also led by example and encouraged young female writers to share stories via her column Young Women For Change; and the tabloid dedicated space to celebrities accused or charged with sexual assault. Far less well known figures like Sajid Javid MP, Amber Rudd MP and Sam Gyimah MP found themselves prominently featured too. It seems 2016 must go down quite rightly as the Year Of The Woman! And, as ever, The Express showed us just why politicians love it when it comes to covering women's issues: Sir Vince Cable MP got an invite to appear on TV show Question Time. As did Laura Kuenssberg MP. Then again, any story involving the words 'Laura Kuensseberg' scored big points so she probably wasn't going to let herself down! 2) ITV Hub: Down. 12. 1.5M). Despite being starved of ad revenue for years, free video streaming service All4 continues to struggle against rivals Sky Go and NowTV as the market leader continues to lose viewers. What help does Alexa count? Just three months ago, there were around two million unique visitors each month according to Comscore. Today, that figure stands at half a million. Perhaps understandable if only due to the Christmas period giving way to New Year celebrations but nowhere near enough considering anger over ITV trampling over pay exclusivity rules. Even worse, walkouts are becoming commonplace at programmes such as Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Peak Practice, whilst fans protest online every day. More fairytale than fact (I mean that literally!), ITV recently took legal action over claims they didn't own rights to The Apprentice and Hollyoaks respectively, while reality series I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! saw a drop in viewing numbers when audiences realised they couldn't request contestants. With rumours circulating that part-time presenters Stephen Mulhern and Midi Farrelly could soon leave to go full-time elsewhere, maybe it would do viewers good to remember the old saying ""if wishes were horses beggars wouldn't ride!."" Oh snap, can we please stay away from horses?! We're watching television here people! 3) Dave: 3rd - Down 20. It may surprise readers to learn that Channel 4's Comedy Central spoof news website has become one of Britain's best loved brands among millennials since launching 18 months ago, having successfully parodied everything from Boris Johnson to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti using fake comedic reporters. Its success owes much to its unusual voiceover style, featuring exuberant American actor Will Ferrell regularly alternating between playing various characters ranging from David Cameron to Vladimir Putin. Last week, in a move widely seen as a joke candidacy linked to Brexit, comedian Ricky Gervais announced himself a candidate alongside fellow leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. If recent history repeats itself though, don't bet on him winning. Only last December did Channel 4. And, for all 13 episodes where bears no demographic trackability information available).

"The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to ""reduce significantly"" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the letter was only made public this week when asked for by Nia Griffith MP on Twitter, as part of her campaign against racial discrimination in policing. It is not known whether any other departments were consulted about either proposed policy change. But it comes amid growing concern among civil liberties groups that Theresa May's Home Office is planning to introduce new rules that will make it harder to challenge unfair stops. The police are currently required to have a reasonable suspicion before detaining someone even if they have committed an offence or got into trouble with the law. It means innocent people can be locked up unnecessarily and unfairly targeted simply because their skin colour matches that of another person who has previously been arrested. A government spokesman said: ""We remain absolutely determined to tackle racism and all forms of unacceptable behaviour within our communities through strong action which holds those responsible to account."" He added that there would be no changes of substance until after publication next Tuesday of the second phase of its inquiry into race relations. That report is expected to recommend more powers over routine searches. Griffith tweeted last night: ""I'm still waiting for my reply from theresamay re increasingly disproportionate number of black men stopped searched during stopnsearch - time to act!"" She also criticised David Cameron for failing to mention the issue at the Conservative party conference three years ago, saying he had left black youths feeling abandoned by his support for tougher laws but without making them feel safe enough to engage positively.",0,240
"The concerns came amid Sportscotland plans to reduce sport funding in Scotland by 20. Scottish Athletics, which runs the initiative to encourage non-club runners to take exercise, said it was not consulted when they were told this would include gender neutral and inclusive events for disabled people. Athletics UK has also criticised the decision to end support for Paralympic Games athletes on a full medal basis from 2024. The move will mean only those who achieve qualification standards can win gold medals at Olympic or Paralympic level. Athletes who finish among the top three of their event are awarded bronze medals but there is no provision for fourth place winners to be given anything other than an individual trophy. SportScotland claimed that such changes could give rise to ""an unfair playing field"" after being warned about the impact of budget cuts earlier this year by its own officials. Scottish Government sports minister Michael Matheson responded: ""We have had extensive engagement with all parties over these issues. We have been clear that we need to look carefully after future investment into sport as part of our wider financial plan commitments. I am very pleased to see positive responses to our proposals so far. It is vital [we] provide proper scrutiny.",0,241
"Jon Schueler, who died in New York in 1992 at the age of 75, created many of his pieces from a studio in Mallaig in the Highlands. He was inspired by the landscape around him and used materials such as driftwood that had washed up on the shoreline to create his works. Over forty years he travelled all over Ireland creating works for exhibition. These include: 'Landscape with Trees' (1972), 'Trees Dancing' (1977) and others. ""I wanted my work to be part of nature itself - not separate, alien or contaminated by human intervention"" said Mr Schueler. The Glasgow Herald described his artworks in 1988 as being like ""coral-like structures which have been sculpted into dynamic forms, sometimes arranged to resemble trees, their roots reaching down towards the earth but above it soaring skywards."" The artist's abstract approach is evident in the way various parts are put together but whether they represent something else entirely is open to interpretation.",0,242
"She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her next project. ""It would be fantastic if I could write a book,"" says Mischa Barton. ""But it will have to be something that only involves me."" There has never been much chance of Mischa writing books: this is the one time we're going to mention that she was once on Celebrity Big Brother. A well-intentioned misstep which had the unfortunate effect of sparking an obsession among teen girls across America (and elsewhere) who were desperate for any scrap they could find of the former Hollywood starlet. The attempts at retrieval can still be seen here and there - such as when Mischa's mother Sharon posted this picture earlier today despite having no idea what it meant - but Mischa herself has now moved on from her celebrity past. She tells us instead how her unhealthy relationship with alcohol might lead to problems ahead. How did you get into drinking? I guess I always liked being drunk. And then things happened which made drinking even more important than before. It seemed like everything fell apart around me when I stopped doing drugs... and after a certain point, although I'd stop taking drugs and not drink or do anything else illegal, my life soon started spiralling out of control again because I wanted so badly to feel normal. Alcohol became a crutch. It gave me an excuse just to sit at home watching TV all day long or go round houses where people are just really loud and kind of mean to each other. But it doesn't work anyway. That's why I'm getting sober now. Of course, everything feels totally fucked up right now! [Laughs] It's hard, though. Now I am completely dependent on myself. Without it, nothing makes sense anymore. Even simple tasks seem impossible. So the first thing I need right now is someone to help me face reality and tell me I don't know everything. Someone brave enough to say, 'Oh yeah, hang on a minute, Mischa, your whole world isn't collapsing.' Because right now, everyone seems to think their own troubles aren't real. What does it take to turn down a glass of wine during busy times? You've got to remember three things: firstly, you mustn't use booze as an emotional crutch; secondly, you should probably avoid drugs too; thirdly, sometimes the best way to deal with stress... is by tackling it head on rather than drowning yourself in a bottle of vodka. And fourthly, you'll want to ask a friend to hold onto you for five minutes afterwards. If you don't have anyone you trust, talk to God. Or, failing that, read James Joyce. If that sounds complicated, then how come when you met Dave Gorman last year, you didn't put away ten bottles between them both? You used to love working along side Dave - what changed? That's funny. There was definitely chemistry between us. He reminded me of Paul McCartney. We took our songs further together than ever before, creating a sound that wasn't quite rock but certainly wasn't pop. That's the problem when you start making music with people you already know intimately. Either the song gets shallow or the chemistry starts breaking down. Speaking of which, let's move swiftly on from your career collapse. What did happen to your career post-Big Brother? The short answer is I haven't done shit since leaving CBB. Which may sound stupid, but when I left, I thought that every single person who knew me suddenly hated me. Everyone assumed I'd quit acting altogether, which is ridiculous considering I've worked steadily since The O.C., playing roles in several movies. In fact, I ended up starring in two films over Christmas Hotel Transylvania' and 'Vacation while also reuniting with director Jason Moore on his latest film 'Wild Wild West', due out later this month. So aside from tiny details such as these, what exactly went wrong? Let's take another look back. When I finished Big Brother, I said publicly that perhaps producers hadn't realised I couldn't cope with fame. They obviously disagreed. Within days, I was offered four big movie projects within hours of walking off the show. Then, when most offers came in weeks or months later, they were for low budget stuff or the option of turning a small role in a major blockbuster into a longer part. And it's true that none of those options were ideal. However, throughout the entire process, nobody actually asked me what I wanted to do. Nobody kept track of whether I enjoyed the offer or not. We lined them all up in a list and made the decision based purely upon money. Also, I lost the confidence of a lot of the agencies involved simply through arrogance - saying that I wouldn't accept anything unless it suited my schedule. Suddenly, agents weren't interested in seeing success.

"Councils are relying on agency workers to cover nearly 4,000 out of 5,500 otherwise empty posts. Social workers say they are under constant pressure because of media coverage and criticism from politicians like Jeremy Corbyn - who claims the government's reliance on white women in the public sector cannot be justified. The lack of staff is so acute that a borough council has admitted it was unable to carry out an investigation into allegations over potential racist abuse at a primary school - even though teachers had made the complaint themselves weeks earlier. Police said they were also unaware unless someone raised their alarm or called them in. The case centred around children aged five and six with ""special educational needs"" (SEN) but police have refused to identify the school concerned. Alderman Pamela Stone, leader of Barking Dagenham Council, told BuzzFeed News: ""We can't investigate something if we don't know where to look for evidence. As soon as one person raises the alarm then I think you could start looking."" She added she believed there should be more visible diversity within the workforce. ""I would love to see more people coming forward and being prepared to do this job because it's not easy work,"" she added. ""It sometimes feels very much about class rather than gender or ethnicity."" She continued: ""There always seems to be a focus when things go wrong before us that its [sic] just poor middle-class motherswomen going off sick. But they're dealing with vulnerable children every day... It takes all sorts and they've got vulnerable families as well."" Since March last year, there has been recruitment freeze across local authorities in England due to budget cuts. In some areas, councils have reduced their full time equivalent number by up to 2. Social worker Anne Knowles, 49, works part-time as a manager for two London boroughs while studying towards her Masters degree. ""When I'm working I feel safe. When I come home I am anxious about my kids. There's no consistency. Every week is different. That's what frustrates me most... It's inequality really. My daughter goes to nursery three afternoons per week. Almost half are taught by non-teacher assistants and these positions aren't advertised anywhere. Why? Because only white girls apply. And yet nursery schools admit black and Asian children. They get fewer hours and worse wages than our kids receive."" Under Labour Party policy during the election campaign, shadow education secretary Lucy Powell vowed to guarantee nursery staff will have permanent contracts by 2020 - which is already law in Scotland. However, in an interview conducted shortly afterwards, Mr Corbyn claimed he never discussed such plans and defended his previous promise to end automatic pay rises for top earners. Ms Powell pointedly asked whether he thought paying nursery staff better than doctors and nurses was fair. He replied: 'No comment.' His spokesman later insisted that despite saying nothing, Mr Corbyn still backs the plan, adding: '...there may be reasons why he didn't express support for those statements yesterday. "" Labour MP Jess Phillips criticised him again following reports that he suggested leaving the EU could lead to further cuts at nurseries, telling LBC Radio host Shelagh Fogarty: 'He couldn't care less about the state of our health service or social care.' This came after Labour MPs demanded a second leadership debate in order to allow voters to ask difficult questions about his policies. At least four senior figures have now resigned since May including former directors general Sir Andrew Carter and Dame Glynis Breakwell. A letter written by the pair states that Mr Corbyn ignored both of them when promoting equality between men and women ahead of the 2016 referendum and throughout the 2017 General Election campaign. The document refers to Theresa May's equalities brief as ""a big fat waste of money held back by civil servants"" and adds that they felt ""let down and unappreciated by party HQ."" On Sunday night, another member of Mr Corbyn's inner circle, John McDonnell, sparked controversy by suggesting the Conservatives should force landlords to sell privately owned homes at below market value. Reports suggest Tory donors are furious about his comments despite being widely denounced as unfair and divisive. One source close to Mr McDonnell described them as ""harsh"" remarks. Another said: ""They're completely inappropriate and bizarre given everything else going on here. People need somewhere affordable to live. Let people afford housing wherever they want, however they wish? What planet does he live on?"" Other critics include Lord Heseltine, who quit Mr Corbyn's frontbench team last month, calling the president's adviser ""thin gruel."" Former Cabinet minister Nick Boles accused the aide of ""bullying behaviour"" and urged other colleagues to shun his influence. An investigation by Telegraph columnist Tim Shipman found Mr Moore repeatedly intervened against ministers who wanted to stand in marginal seats and forced Conservative representatives to relinquish supposedly secure wards containing 90 of eryaster tags as having tags showing them to show the use of their chances have dismal prospects.

"Friend, who cut his face, was treated in the tunnel before being taken to hospital, where he stayed overnight. The incident happened as the first half came to an end and fans were streaming out of White Hart Lane for their own safety A Spurs fan suffered horrific injuries after falling into a gap between two seats at tonight's Champions League match against Olympiacos. He is one of more than 60 people injured in incidents as violence broke out following Tottenham's defeat by the Greek side. At least seven people have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder - but police are still hunting others believed to be involved with other groups. Sixteen arrests have already been made since trouble flared during last night's game. And some supporters got so carried away that they fought eachother instead of hooligans intent on attacking rival teams or security staff. Friend,who cut his face,was found lying outside the ground near Euston Station this morning, although it has not yet been confirmed whether he was inside the stadium when the injury occurred. It took paramedics around 15 minutes to arrive at the scene because the casualty had been knocked unconscious. A source said: ""He fell down a gap in the seat while walking home from the game. He'd just witnessed Harry Kane scoring a hat-trick after coming off the bench."" I saw someone fall onto him,"" another witness added. ""I don't know if he hit his head or something."" Friend was rushed to St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, but will be discharged today. Our reporter Simon Hattenstone tweeted pictures showing emergency services working calmly to get him through the crowds of passengers waiting outside Euston station at 6am. People watching, many wearing scarves bearing the crest of the club, stood quietly next to coaches with windows boarded up waiting to take them back to north London. Footage showed scores of ambulances arriving at the site close to White Hart Lane tube station after nine o'clock yesterday evening amid scenes of chaos which also caused delays for commuters heading towards central London. Fans leaving the stadium soon afterwards waved banners saying 'we love you eton'. Around 120 stewards and 50 Metropolitan Police officers escorted those trying to leave White Hart Lane early yesterday afternoon. One man was led away in handcuffs - possibly for fighting - in front of friends outside the gates beside Stamford Bridge tube station just over five hours later.Another woman was seen handcuffed behind her back outside Underhill Street station in Clerkenwell shortly after midnight. An armed policeman guarded the entrance to White Hart Lane until 11pm as hundreds made their way back home along Seven Sisters Road. There were no major problems at any time despite sporadic clashes involving both Arsenal and Chelsea supporters earlier on Sunday. About 30 ambulance crews attended football stadiums across England including Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, Cardiff City's Ninian Park and Newcastle United's St James' Park, but left without taking anyone. Addressing the media at Wembley Stadium on Monday morning, Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe said there would be extra patrols in matches going forward. More details about how tickets can be bought are expected shortly. Supporters are advised not to travel alone and to avoid entering grounds drunk or carrying large amounts of cash or carry weapons. They should also expect some disruption wherever they go. Last night's riot started when thousands of Green Flag demonstrators marched past Tottenham Hale tube station linking Hyde park to the capital. Many were holding placards reading ""Tottenham vote yes"" and waving flags emblazoned with the Five Stripe logo. But then a group of about 20 youths began throwing missiles at cars travelling southwards along Holloway Avenue, turning Bounds Green roundabout into a mass brawl. Scores of police officers arrived within seconds to form lines blocking off roads leading to Kingsbury High Street where traffic lights stand red after protesters turned westbound towards Stratford. Officers used batons to try to push them back, shouting instructions telling them what vehicles needed changing lanes to bypass blockade. Some officers tried unsuccessfully to drag individuals aside using cables attached to buses standing idly nearby. Witnesses described seeing men attacked and forced to lie flat on the road. Among those reported hurt was Paul Coker, 23, of Islington, North Yorkshire. Injured after receiving kicks to the stomach He told Sky News: ""One guy jumped me and kicked my [back]side really hard and it was like a punch,"" adding that he thought he might die. ""They put cable ties on us, tied our hands behind our backs and we couldn't move... We lay on the floor of the bus for 10 minutes."" Although Coker was eventually untied, fellow passenger Marie Coles, also 23, told BBC radio 5 live she did not want to risk returning to London. She said: ""It was really scary. ""There wasn't anyone helping anybody else, nobody was calling the police and the only thing everyone could do was pray. ""We're all traumatised, shaken up and worried.""

He added: ""I am confused about why the judiciary took so long [to issue an arrest warrant]. We have not committed any crime."" In a statement published on Monday evening, Egypt's military rulers said they had issued warrants for 1,289 people after ""arresting over 100 suspected terrorists,"" including some accused of creating fake Twitter accounts outraging Islam or inciting sectarian violence.

"Samuel Walker was fatally injured in a hit-and-run as he crossed a road in Chorlton, Manchester, in February 2003. Joyrider Nawnee Mackin, 35, was jailed for nine years in November 2005 after admitting manslaughter by gross negligence at an earlier hearing. A woman who admitted to driving her car over and killing a man while she was drunk then fled the country has failed to return from Canada hours before her sentence date. Joyride MacKinley Wilson, 36, of Willenhall Road, Leytonstone, east London, had been due back at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday but did not appear in court or contact anyone. She pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving when she drove off without stopping following a collision between herself and Samuel Walker outside his home on Feb 15 last year. Macklin also pleaded guilty to two other charges - failing to stop after an accident and driving with excess alcohol. She received a three month suspended jail term for each charge.

Speaking about what happened on that fateful night last year, Ms Vincent said: ""I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for letting this happen."" ""It is my fault because I should never let him walk along that road alone,"" added Mrs Vincent who ran into tears as she recalled her late husband Paul telling her he hated people taking risks. The mum explained that, according to police documents, she had only drank four units of vodka and orange juice during the evening which didn't cause any problems until later. Ms Vincent described how she woke up after being knocked out next morning and found Mr Walker lying dead alongside his pet dog Lola. He died just steps away from the Walkers' front door.

"23 December 2016 Last updated at 01:13 GMT But much of India's milk is collected from small farms across the country, and by the time it reaches consumers it's impure . Sakshi Yadav works on a farm near Roorkee in northern Indian state Uttar Pradesh [Uday VermaAl Jazeera] In Gujarat, Delhi and Punjab states you can find an array of milk producers - dairy co-operatives whose members are mostly subsistence farmers producing for local markets or directly to dairies. Not many have electricity connections so they rely solely on their solar panels usually powered through wind mills. Most don't even own refrigerators but instead store their produce at ambient temperature not exceeding 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). They use traditional methods like hand washing that also often results in products with higher levels of bacteria than those produced in modern factories. So when we say there's more going into our food supply than just what goes onto serving plates these days we're talking about unhygienic conditions where cows come first. And now its getting worse. Digital revolution The digital revolution has brought rapid changes in the way people buy goods online which could be good news if only smaller businesses were able to adapt fast enough. Shoppers today get the best deals and widest choice online because so many stores do business electronically rather than via paper bills and snail mail. This means computers handle payments instead of cashiers while retailers receive instant delivery updates as customers make purchases. Yet despite this convenience and flexibility some companies still struggle to survive. A recent study showed nearly half a million firms started doing business over the last five years yet three quarters failed within 12 months. ""The problem is no matter how sophisticated your technology is,"" said Mark Simon, chief executive officer of Fintech Advisors based in San Francisco, who was part of one team advising early stage tech startup entrepreneurs. ""It will never replace the value of face to face human interaction."" With few jobs available for computer science graduates most young professionals opt out of careers that seem stagnating at best. In addition to that, data privacy breaches, high costs and slow speeds among other security problems plague internet services in developing countries such as China South Africa and Pakistan. Apart from technological challenges pervasive poverty limits access to affordable basic financial information including banking services mobile phones across low income groups lack the infrastructure needed to facilitate transactions and money transfers. It's not all bad though. While India's GDP per capita stands third worldwide after Japan and France, government investment in agriculture is lagging far behind private sector investments. These trends mean huge potential gains for new strong players making progress against big banks and IT giants. The marketplace Where vendors selling e-commerce web sites or apps compete with each other to attract users offering better prices. Amazon, eBay and Alibaba dominate global trade trading billions worth daily. Local buyers pay upfront fees assessed by the site then send payment details they received instantly to sellers who confirm shipping details before completing sales. Some may offer discounts or zero percent exchange rates to help break the bank barrier. Online marketplaces provide a platform where suppliers sell items directly to shoppers without having to go through wholesalers middlemen. Today firms like Flipkart group start ups backed by investors such as Tencent Alibaba Walmart Google are involved in direct retailing. Walmarts website is used to book movies tickets hotels and even rent cars. Its prices range between 50 cents and 10 depending on type of product sold. Almost 80 percent of Indians shop online which accounts for six percent of total consumer spending according to McKinsey Company. But much of that activity takes place outside brick-and-mortar shops which account for only 18 percent of overall shopping revenue globally. Because online commerce growth occurs alongside stagnant offline revenues compounded by declining incomes savers don't always feel inclined to spend extra on nonessential items. This makes them reluctant to buy clothes shoes diapers toys etc online unless bargains are too tempting to ignore. Lowest price rule Many traditional merchants work around this challenge by offering deep discount promotions targeting younger generations. Prices drop by up to 40 percent during festive periods such as Diwali lanterns and firecrackers for sale through December 31 and New Year celebrations. Additionally even if you've paid full price once you might decide to impulse shop later. Goodwill effect Another factor in play here is called the goodwill effect. When someone buys something she wants to add it to her collection leaving the seller nothing else to show. Sellers try hard to entice repeat visits by offering merchandise attractive offers on repeated purchases. For example, 10 percent off coupon codes can sweeten the deal for shoppers. Despite occasional efforts to curb fraud internet crooks are becoming increasingly creative using tools such as identity theft scams preying on unsuspecting consumers. Fraudsters target elderly parents particularly mothers on social media platforms pretending to be sons wanting to claim inheritances or widows needing emergency funds.

"Correspondents said the atmosphere at schools was subdued and many pupils had not returned. They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with a reduced number of teaching hours, which made it hard for some children who rely on childcare in school to attend classes. The teachers' union NUT blamed cuts in education funding. ""They are responsible because they have slashed spending so drastically,"" Mr Greening told Sky News. One parent whose child attends one of London's smaller state primary schools said she believed that too few staff were being assigned to teach lessons. Lucy Flowers, from Croydon, has two sons aged four and six - both in reception class - and says her son is often off-task after falling asleep during quiet times in his classroom. She said: 'At 3pm today he did an exercise where I sat him down to do writing but about halfway through my husband came home saying the teacher let all the rest go over three minutes without warning them. The kids get really stressed out.' This week Mrs Flowers received a letter telling her how much attention these small children would be getting as part of their early years learning activities.

She added that the death certificate issued by East Ham Hospital had listed no cause of death; an inquest would never have taken place without this information, because under health regulations any such verdict must include a finding of what killed him. Social Services Minister Jon Hunt read a statement outside Southwark Crown Court which said nothing about why the ward manager or anyone else involved could not explain how Mr Sadiq became ill or, if possible, prevent further deaths.

'Homes need new homes' Residents whose leaky properties prompted changes to building standards across England are calling on the government to issue emergency orders requiring landlords to fix every single defect within five years to stop thousands of families becoming homeless. Tenants held an event in Wood Green last week organised jointly by the National Landlords Association (NLA) and Citizens Advice. NLA spokesman Chris Thomas called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to order ministers to take immediate action to address widespread concerns around poor construction quality. He told Radio 4's Today programme that even before the Grenfell disaster happened, many tenants did not feel comfortable sharing their complaints publicly due to fear of losing their tenancy. A survey published recently revealed that almost 30 of households experienced shrinkage during the course of ownership, rising to 46 among private sector tenancies - but less than 1 of owners took steps to check the condition of the property beforehand. Greenspan added that planning laws should require developers to build sufficient fire exits, active smoke alarms and good ventilation systems. He said: ""We have seen situations where buildings, whether large blocks or individual houses, look pretty much identical except they vary enormously in terms of levels of maintenance and repair work going on inside them. ""If those major repairs don't get done or aren't completed, it creates issues of safety."" Around 5 million rental properties exist in England alone. Labour MP Kate Osamor, chairwoman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Homelessness, cited evidence showing 819 homeless people died between April 2012 and March 2016. Ms Osamor demanded urgent follow-up inquiries, saying: ""Thousands of vulnerable residents are still experiencing homelessness today because inadequate responses to faulty homes mean that thousands more dangerous places remain on our estates."" In recent weeks MPs from several parties including Conservatives Ben Bradley and Zac Goldsmith, Labour's Harriet Harman, SNP MSP Joan McAlpine, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, Plaid Cymru Westminster candidate Jo Stevens, former UK Border Agency chief officer Baroness Stewart Jones, former Birmingham City Council cabinet member Andy Street, Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan and campaigner Jamie Bartlett all signed a pledge demanding action from the Government. They believe there needs to be a greater focus on structural change - namely the role played by homeowners associations, which often act as agents for landlords and can lock tenants out of their rented accommodation unless repairs are made. Homeowners Associations (HOA) comprise covenants that control development and restrict alterations and additions to the physical characteristics of a structure. In return members receive title deeds freehold, discounted rates for insurance and lower rents if repairs are performed. However, according to Citizens Advice, HOA rules effectively prevent most people affected by current problems getting compensation for damage caused, for instance a blocked sinkhole leading sewage into electrical sockets and heating pipes.

"While its existence has become a source of controversy on both sides of the Channel, some are also angry at attempts to destroy it. In May 2013 an unidentified object was filmed flying over West Hampstead in north London. The footage quickly went viral and became known as ""the London plane"" or more commonly just the 'plane' for short. It is now believed that this video is due to be released soon by conspiracy theorist Jim Stone who claims he received copies from several people. This can only reinforce suspicions that there were government agents filming something far greater than any one person could have seen alone. Whilst many see this as proof of aliens visiting Earth, others are concerned about the alleged theft of medical data used to create it. Whatever you believe the truth behind the London Plane may never fully come out but what we do know is that it will certainly leave its mark upon history forever. For those unaware, here is everything you need to know... The Conspiracy Theory Behind the Video Jim Stone claims he started receiving videos shortly after publishing his first book which discusses extraterrestrial life. He says they were sent via email and phone calls from mostly anonymous figures claiming to work with a secret organisation called ""S-4 Sector."" They say they are investigating our planet despite various governments denying such activity exists. On December 23rd 2012 S-4 Sector posted their own account of events; explaining how two helicopters landed disguised as police units near a house in North Kensington where three men dressed in black carried objects out into the back garden. In total nine individuals involved are said to exist including two women and seven different types of alien. One woman appears to hold a device which allegedly contains data pertaining to human genetics. Another holds a replica of President Obama's birth certificate while another wears a tuxedo similar to Mr. Spock from Star Trek series. Why would these mysterious characters dress up like this? What exactly did they want with the UK Government? And why mention Obama's birthplace when he isn't even president yet? These questions and so much else remain unanswered but perhaps not for long if rumours surrounding the London Planet continue to build. So Who Was Filming It All? Andy Smith and David Clarke claim to live around the corner from each other in the same street in Camden Town, Northcote High Street (which runs along part of Belsize Road) and Acton Green. Andy Smith works as a driver whilst David Clark is a sound engineer whose most significant project is found on his Youtube channel Ufology Stereo.

When asked about the incident Dave told Metro that ""We saw it land next door. Two blokes came outside covered head to toe in black coveralls with face masks on. We thought maybe they were burglars because we heard shouting! Someone hurriedly made off carrying what looked like some kind of big electronic suitcase. There wasn't enough time to ask him [who] he was going to. I followed him briefly then turned round real quick to look for my mate. That moment later I walked past again and spotted someone holding up a camera pointing right at me. At least two cars pulled up then suddenly everyone seemed to disappear leaving us standing there in complete silence. My mate couldn't hear a thing either. But now this fellow - John Allen - is trying to tell the world about it all!!"" David continued to explain his version of events further stating: There was] no noise whatsoever aside from our old windows rattling for a bit. No sirens or loud noises at all except lights flashing slowly across this craft thinking it was a UFO landing. We didn't see any lights inside though. Then came four large orange beams coming from a hatchway that opened and closed rapidly. Three guys wearing black coveralls stormed forward dragging this small box between them. They seemed intent on getting away without anyone noticing them. A few moments later these huge silver discs descended upon the earth looking for refuge. Their size reminded me of glow worms to be honest. To describe the area there is nothing left - all buildings blown apart and burnt branches lying everywhere. Not one tree intact.

Both men show clear signs of shock and fear regarding occurrence. Neither expects to ever be able to return home again. Were Any Military Personnel Involved?

"Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, 71, was accused of painting the candy stripes to ""get her own back"" on neighbours who objected to her property plans. She wanted to demolish her Kensington house and build a new one in its place A woman convicted of defacing white chocolate with red paint has been ordered by an appeals court judge to pay 1,000 compensation for inflicting ""psychological distress"" on her neighbours. The ruling followed an appeal against her conviction after she was found guilty at Leeds crown court last year for painting lines through pictures of sweets on to bars that ran along two properties close together in south London. Her actions were thought to be part revenge from being made homeless after attempts to stop developers building flats in her home next door had failed; but they left residents feeling angry about how much damage the unexpected marks did. One neighbour said: 'I feel outraged. How could you do this? It's like graffiti.' A second added: 'It seems quite petty. And what does it get them?' At first, Mrs Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring - now aged just over 70 - admitted spraying some 30 cans containing the gaudy paint onto buildings near her Bloomsbury Road home where she lived alone before the renovations began. But when police searched her garden following complaints from other local people, she denied any involvement. When questioned again Ms Main-Waring denied saying anything to anyone else during the episode. In his judgment Lord Justice Gross told Lady Justice Arden QC there was nothing wrong with drinking or using intoxicating drinks as amusement, even if these resulted in drunkenness. But he ruled that Ms Main-Waring was not taken into account enough consideration when sentencing her for criminal damage because she hadn't appeared drunk when pleading guilty to the offence. He went on to say that although he accepted that looking forward to the future is ""a natural human instinct,"" destroying others' built up hopes was unacceptable behaviour which breached public order laws. Appeal prosecutor Mark Easton said that he hoped the decision would make sure such deliberate acts never happened again. Mrs Main-Waring, prosecuted under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, tried unsuccessfully to overturn her sentence in January 2017, losing another bid after appealing against her conviction last May. According to evidence heard in front of three judges sitting in the Court of Appeal, the defendant became distressed while trying to clear out personal possessions stored above her former kitchen worktop so that renovation work could begin. Accompanied by her brother John James Main, 54, and friend Julie Roberts, 61, Mrs Main-Waring poured around 20 litres of water down their sink in a futile attempt to wash away traces of orange paint believed to have come from the same canisters used to cover the pink walls surrounding both houses. During cross examination by Mr Easton, Richard Robinson, defending, suggested there was no guarantee that nobody living across the road might actually find the marks offensive themselves. Under questioning by Jane Albin, Lord Justice Gross asked whether the women knew what the word vengeance meant, or took pleasure from making mischief. On Wednesday morning, Justice Gross ruled on his verdict, finding Mrs Main-Waring guilty of causing serious harm despite denying responsibility himself. In his written judgement he described the incident as an example of low level crime by deliberately injuring someone's sense of well-being and stability within their life structure, adding that 'breaks down social boundaries between individuals'. After conceding that she should have considered seeking help rather than carrying out the act herself, he concluded: 'Having regard to all the circumstances of (the case), I consider that you caused psychological distress without reasonable excuse or justification. You must therefore repay your victim... for the distress suffered by reason of your conduct.""",0,286
"It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout. Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for Ireland as Joe Gamble held off his marker in front of goal and sent over a cross that Gallacher tapped home at close-range. The Republic fullbacks were then called upon once again when Sean St Ledger headed over after being set up by Pat Delaney but goalkeeper Tony Cascarino made amends with two good saves on Martin Doherty and Aiden McGeady before he repulsed Paul Scholes' shot from about 30 yards out. But it took another near miss from a corner for England to finally break through - substitute Steve Gerrard held off Kevin Kilbane only to send Carlos Tevez away down the right flank and into space where he brought down David Meek inside the area.

"The 28-year-old was an ever-present in the side which won the County Championship title in 2016. ""He is one of the finest cricketers in the country,"" managing director of cricket Ashley Giles said after Ellison's promotion to squad captain for next month's T20 Blast matches against Sussex and Essex following some consideration over who should be named as skipper when England head coach Jason Gillespie addresses his first team at 10am on Friday. Ellison, a lifelong county fan whose father played Test cricket before him, led Middlesex through their last two home season titles and then became vice-captain under Steve Finn until he stepped down from that role this summer on medical advice. He has been named by both sides as England's overseas player for Australia during the Ashes series later this year and now the decision about whether he will succeed Mark Ramprakash as skipper - even though it looks certain with Yorkshire's new man Graeme Swann in line for that task - is expected to make headlines shortly. ""I am absolutely delighted to have got the nod ahead of Nick [Pietersen] but I would like to say something here to those people who think they are going to get into our shirts no matter what: you might well do if we were playing match day or a full international game because people can see your talent and know that you want to play for us; however, you just don't move forward up the hierarchy unless you earn it.""

""The fact we introduced that tax increase last time, rather than get revenue increases from central government, shows you how much confidence I've got in what we will achieve."" He added: ""If people are arguing - or some are suggesting - that we should lower income tax so that there isn't an extra burden on low earners [we're] looking into doing something like that."" The Labour leader also went public with claims about Tory plans in his party conference speech yesterday (Wednesday), saying their economic agenda involved taking away rights given by EU membership through treaties signed up to date: ""We know Britain needs to meet new global challenges... It must take advantage of the opportunities offered by trade deals such as those negotiated under David Cameron when he was Prime Minister. But, unlike him, we can't allow ourselves to become weaker friends because too many British jobs and businesses depend on access to Europe. That means renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership with Europe. And if they don't agree, then leaving them altogether.""",0,293

"The latest threats bring the number of incidents to 69 in 27 states in the past month, according to the JCC Association of North America. No bombs were found at any of those sites as a result of police investigations. What is behind this recent spate? Some experts said it's not new - they have been warning about surveillance and ""fake news"" for years. But others pointed out that some of these locations are intended to be targets or symbolic of power structures such as capitalism, Zionism and Israel itself. According to Hallett: Some Jewish institutions have long sought to understand how violent individuals could reach so far into their midst to target them with an act of extreme violence. They knew that if anyone was going to attack the golden calf idols of money or Wall Street, then someone would do something like what happened recently on New York City's Lower East Side - where you can still see remnants of the old Temple Beth-El (the former home of The Forward) at 91 10th Ave., congregated directly across from the site of the deadly bombing last week. One thing we know now after nearly 70 similar attacks since 2011 is that virtually everyone has become a potential victim. This includes Jews who practice traditionalist Judaism (Haredi), most notably Chabad Lubavitch rabbis; Orthodox yeshivas, including the prestigious Hashkafa Institute founded by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin; Reform synagogues; progressive Conservative ones like Congregation Emanu El in Monsey, N.Y.; even Sephardic and Ashkenazi Hassidim alike because of numerous bomb threats directed against leaders of Hashemite courts in Jerusalem over the past year. It also applies to secular people like author Jonathan Sacks; education moguls like billionaire Eli Broad, Jeffrey Epstein director Leslie Wexner and Meg Whitman CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., chief executive officer; CEOs, directors and financial executives in corporations in sectors ranging from retailing to real estate development and finance; congressmen; celebrities; sports figures; heads of state; journalists and authors. And don't forget, Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, when seen together on video (on different days), may have shared more than just a political affiliation. Who hasn't felt paranoid lately given all the hate speech, false rumors, fake stories circulating online and viral videos showing up in your Facebook feed? With everything becoming polarized and more volatile under President Trump, things feel scary again. So many times I heard my father and other adults say it seemed like nothing good ever happens anymore without getting attacked soon afterward. Maybe sometimes there's a hidden message here. Why else would so much hatred suddenly bubble up only following mass shootings and terrorist attacks unrelated to minorities but targeting whites and Christians? How did Pizzagate get started and why didn't mainstream media cover the story until ten White House officials got caught lying to Congress about its implications? Wasn't POTUS himself born during WWII when his parents fled Nazi Germany? On top of all that are always the random acts of criminals trying to strike fear into us while making our lives miserable. Many victims assume that being targeted makes them guilty and somehow guilty means they deserve it. Instead, they should learn to protect themselves, their children and loved ones. Knowing how bad things can turn out isn't enough. You must take action to make sure no one else gets hurt. What are the best ways to prevent further serious injury? Of course, the first step is educating yourself. Know which groups might pose a threat to you. Find out how law enforcement agencies are responding to possible terrorist activity. Educate yourself about social media disinformation campaigns and terrorist propaganda. Understand the tactics employed by terrorists and extremists of various kinds. Protect yourself physically and emotionally. That's probably hard to do. As my colleagues suggest, find strength in numbers and come together to help each other stay safe and healthy. Get involved through local chapters of civil rights organizations fighting racial injustice. Contact elected representatives. Be vigilant and report suspicious activities to authorities. Make private citizens carry firearms for self defense. Remember, knowledge is power. Use critical thinking skills and avoid cyberbullying and trolling on social networks. Stay tuned ...",0,298

"It says increases will be needed if current trends in teacher recruitment and retention continue. Nevertheless, the STRB has recommended a pay rise of just 1 for teachers in England to bring them up to parity with those on other public sector jobs - ie 45k per annum compared with under-40k now. The report also recommends that more must be done in terms of improving school leadership and management as well as the quality of teaching staff (particularly classroom assistants) - both key areas highlighted by Ofsted recently as needing improvement across all schools. It is proposed too that class sizes should not be allowed to increase above 30 pupils unless there are specific reasons why this is necessary and without consultation involving parentsguardians or local communities; much like they do in Wales at present. Finally it calls for further reform to make individualised assessment based around exam results rather than simply qualification levels known as ""standard"" qualifications so irrelevant assessments such as OCRs can no longer be used as an alternative basis. This proposal was rejected last year but may have been reconsidered because of recent changes made to International Baccalaureate exams which began in 2012 and for GCSE English Maths which were introduced after 2010. In May 2013, several MPs called upon ministers to abolish standardisation altogether and allow uniformity within certain subjects instead (see here). However, while many would agree that subject choice could be better managed, others say an end to standardisation ultimately means less focus being placed on core skills within any particular subject area. Although I think the latter view might be somewhat exaggerated as most people still use their abacus every day regardless of whether they learn Chinese numerals or algebra! But anyway, back to the point... Sue Bayliss, headteacher of Avon Primary School near Taunton, Somerset said: ""We welcome these recommendations from the independent review into salary progression for education professionals."" She added""The proposals put forward today propose real steps towards addressing issues identified during the Select Committee inquiry. We look forward to seeing how government responds to these proposals.""Simon Rosenblatt, Executive Director of Education Policy Institute UK (EPIUK), commented: ""This recommendation makes good sense and marks a shift away from the system where underperforming educators earn higher salaries than high performing ones. The question is how far ministers act on the EP's call to scrap excessive bonuses linked to test scores.""",0,300
"We've asked BBC Sport readers to predict the top three before every race this season and, after the British Grand Prix, we got our calculators out and had a look at who has been closest so far. Top-3 predictions on track 1st) Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes): 1.7 seconds per lap - 45 points in total 2nd) Lewis Hamilton (McLaren Mercedes): 3.2 secslap - 20 pts; 15 points over second place Fernando Alonso 5th?

Predicting the outcomes of Formula One races is always fun but it can also be surprisingly hard work. If you're reading this, then there are probably few monkeys better placed than yours truly to tell you how things will pan out next week... Or not! But with that caveat, here goes: The facts about predictions Before I get into the rest of my thoughts on what may happen tomorrow, let me set your minds at ease by telling you some interesting stats. First up, only eight teams have successfully predicted all five winners from their own garage since 2009 when the rules changed from 'best first' to 'first past the post'. Williams came close last year but they've struggled and Manor haven't scored any wins yet either. On the other hand, Silverstone hosts six different drivers as favourites along with one each for Red Bull, Toro Rosso and Force India. And if you take 100 entries across those 40 grands prix, you'll hit two of them right on target. That isn't too bad. This years table shows just two double scorers and ten correct scores overall. So ignore the fact that teams like Ferrari or McLaren might not make your list because they don't really count - they were 'lucky' losers last time round and weren't predicting winners anyway. A quick glance down the table reveals that Max Chilton hasn't won anyone and neither has Mark Webber. The most accurate driver this season was Perez (8.9), followed closely by DRS-less Pirelli man Sergio Perez (7.6). Third best in terms of odds was James Allison, whose grid prediction guide has already proved its worth in several tests. Fourth place went to Romain Grosjean (7.5), while fifth spot went to Paul di Resta (5.8). We couldn't run a full analysis due to lack of data available until now. Let's see where we stand on the 'big picture statistic sheet'. Top four ahead of us are Renault, Caterham, Marussia and Sauber. As good as these guys are, we must admit that no team in history have finished higher in terms of percentage stat after nine rounds. Only twice in history have more than half the field made it through without scoring an official point - 2002 on the CART series and 2010 on the Champ Car World Series. What does that tell me? Well, maybe we should start believing again. Yes, I am aware that people say the new cars are rubbish, but perhaps they are actually trying harder. Who knows, maybe we have missed something vital because of our ignorance. Maybe we don't know enough physics behind the sport to understand why the car behaves itself the way it does. For example, many fans talk about tyre wear being affected by aerodynamic drag which impacts performance - maybe they are wrong. Put simply, I think everything else has come together perfectly this weekend. In terms of reliability, safety, fuel consumption etc., I feel everyone has worked hard for themselves. It wasn't pretty last year, but big money means you need results. No question about it. Will McLaren keep it going under Ron Dennis? Is he interested in another crack at Formula One ownership given his experiences with Jaguar? At least he didn't lose 100m, even though Bernie Ecclestone did. Although the racing looked thrilling from a TV perspective, ultimately we saw eleven retirements and an average race distance of just 38 laps. Surely we could do much better than that. Once upon a time we would be lucky if we achieved 60 of today's running capacity. Nowadays we can achieve 90, and we still struggle with tyres. With regard to the championship battle, I'm backing Button to pull away again, although I suspect Rubens Barrichello will prove difficult to beat. The highly chaotic character angle, however, certainly performs best among constant users have the self lightened and burned kleper testing to show us exited reactions to",0,301

"Gen Christophe Gomart told a parliamentary commission in May that a ""partner agency"" warned of the plot by a Brazilian Islamist militant. No further details were given. Gen Gomart made his remarks after he was questioned about the mission which failed and two soldiers died, including one who blew himself up during an attempt to rescue hostages trapped with their captors inside a church last November. He said: ""This operation began at 1am on October 14. We had three key elements. The first element used helicopters for surveillance, reconnaissance and communications; the second element included Special Forces (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale) SAS troops; the third comprised forces from France's West African region Para-Commandos based in Dakar."" He added that South Africa helped provide air support but could not help secure a plane because it did not have long range missiles. However this version is contested as details suggest there may be more than one truth behind what happened leading some commentators to question whether the SADF even knew about French involvement until weeks later. In fact sources close to General Pierre Lacoste say Mr Farrow never informed him of any plans. Opposition parties are raising questions over how much information has been shared between government departments when discussing foreign military engagement and they want departments to adhere to strict internal rules. They claim most conversations within ministries do not go beyond limited briefings. Ministers of defence were briefed against regarding Operation Greystone - although only a few people other than those directly involved know all the details - while cabinet ministers, officials in the Defence Secretariat and certain members of Parliament sit on the Joint Intelligence Committee. But no such oversight exists for Cabinet colleagues or senior civil servants outside the intelligence community. This means there can be huge gaps in knowledge among those holding the top jobs. A handful of high level national security meetings also meet every week without anyone else knowing. It will now be down to Zuma to decide if he wants to recall Mr Farrow immediately. However many concede that as things stand, it would take months before anything came back. On Wednesday the opposition continued to call for Mr Farrow's resignation, saying he should face criminal charges over mismanagement. President Jacob Zuma appointed Michael Sun to investigate the issue. He is due to report next month.",0,303
"The head of the mission, Peter Graaff, met the Ghanaian president to thank the country for hosting the agency since it was set up in September last year. A small group of journalists also accompanied the delegation and reported on its meeting with President John Mahama at his office in Accra before all flew out together yesterday morning. It is hoped that this visit will help smooth over some differences between the two countries which had been caused by a series of diplomatic rows dating back several years ago as well as disagreements about aid funding from South Africa's government. The visit coincides with the 60th anniversary of independence celebrations being held in the capital city tomorrow [Wednesday]. In an interview aired during their stay here Mr Graaf confirmed that he has received assurance from local authorities of adequate security for them while they are present in the West African nation until Sunday next week when they leave for Nigeria. When asked if there were any issues confronting the mission he said ""There might be something but we don't want to speculate because right now we know nothing."" President Mahama told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the programme to continue after the official handover to GCRM in March 2013. He added: ""I think what I can tell you today is that we have agreed that we should work around each other."" Meanwhile the announcement made earlier this month confirming that individual donors would no longer fund HIVAids programmes within three months of 2012 after failing to provide the required triple-zero budget allocation did not go down too well with officials who say donor support is needed urgently to meet targets for reducing new infections among children under 15. In fact, the Global Fund announced separately this Monday evening that it remains committed to supporting these efforts funded by governments and faith based organisations. Peter Kariuki, director general of NACO said: ""With concerted actions and resources scaling-up, including releasing funds so they can flow into service delivery, even though donations may stop for now, we still expect the overall number of people accessing prevention services to decline - ultimately leading to fewer AIDS-related deaths and improving health outcomes worldwide. We will explore options and avenues for long term financing, including innovative models like financing through insurance premiums or our own specialised finance mechanism,"" he noted. This means that populations most vulnerable to contracting the disease, such as sex workers and men having sex with men are likely to bear the brunt of cuts to donor assistance, according to experts. While grants provided to civil society organizations working with affected communities could be cut off, many NGOs providing care for all, especially those targeted groups mentioned above, will see more than 70 percent of their funding disappear. According to figures released by UNAIDS just weeks ago, prior financial support enabled agencies to reach 129 million unduplicated individuals in 2011 and prevent 2.7 million children becoming infected with the virus. Funding for the task forces tasked to coordinate activities across sectors - such as education, legal reform and criminal justice - has always been quite reduced compared to global spending on the epidemic itself, making the situation worse. If annual levels of 0.5 (or half a billion dollars) are reached in sub Saharan Africa soon, it will halt progress towards universal access to treatment for millions, already too late. But if the status quo continues, infections could increase globally reaching 17m by 2030 - and 2 million young lives lost each year.",0,304

"Mr Trump broke a long-held tradition by not releasing his paperwork during his presidential campaign. His critics want to know who he has been dealing with and if there are any conflicts of interest between him, his family or business interests An investigation into Donald J Trump's financial relationships is being carried out in the United States Senate after 10 Democratic senators sent letters to eight banks asking them for information regarding their involvement with ""business activities that might pose conflicts of interest or influence Mr Trump while president."" The bank documents show how close the candidate was working with his son Eric before last November's election, when it emerged that some of the assets they took charge of were worth 413m (296m). The inquiry will focus on the relationship of the two men over 15 years as an extension of the money trail from Deutsche Bank through to offshore investments owned by members of the Trumps and Kushner families.

Trump, Family LLCTrump Organization, Inc., Eric M. Trump Revocable Trust, Ivanka Trump Irrevocable Trust, Jared Kushner Real Estate Development LP, and other entities incorporated or established by individuals associated with the Trump family."" Senator Chuck Schumer said at a press conference yesterday that he plans to subpoena records related to the finances of key players in the Trump circle including tax returns and banking transactions. Schumer suggested they had been carrying out extensive negotiations involving foreign governments without disclosing this fact to Congress. One such example relates to the planned meeting between Russian officials visiting Washington DC next month - Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and US national security adviser Michael Flynn - and General Joseph Dunford Jr, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which raised questions among Democrats about whether Flynn may be compromised by Russia. It also raises issues about what kind of meetings might take place between people like Manafort and Saudi princes, many of whom use British law firms because of its global reputation and legal system. This comes days after a report revealed that several wealthy businessmen friendly to Trump donated millions to support pro-Russian politicians in Europe. At least one, Viktor Vekselberg, is thought likely to meet alongside representatives of the Kremlin at Davos, Switzerland, later this week where discussions could include sanctions imposed by Washington following the annexation of Crimea. The recent CIA assessment found Moscow hacked Democratic National Convention emails and released them online in order to help elect Trump as part of its efforts to meddle in politics elsewhere around the world. In response to the claim the Russians interfered in the US elections, Nikki Haley, Ambassador to UN, wrote on Twitter: ""If we truly care about democracy here abroad then we must call evil by name."" But none of the details given so far by either side suggests ill intent or evidence of collusion. Last night Mueller added another point to the list of controversial decisions taken by the new boss: appointing Sally Yates, formerly acting attorney general, to investigate the links between Trump and Russia.

The company was founded by Alex Hahn over 18 years ago before he started his own venture following the closure of previous restaurant locations due to lack of demand from customers. He told Business Insider that early on there wasn't much interest in dog food ordering until it launched ""Big D"" restaurants for large families with four or more children. Then came social media; now, rather than selling extra food orders, the business is completely based around customer's requests for special meals. At first, the idea seemed impossible given the strict rules around eating outside so that pets remain healthy. But recently legislation changed in California which allows pet owners to dine out with their pooches. ""What we do here [in England] is just ask people if they want us to make something,"" Mr Hahn said. Despite spending many hours preparing and cooking meals, Mr Hahn explains how the process takes no longer than an hour. You can order online ahead of time using a link attached to any menu item so your meal will be ready when you reach the table. He says both humans and animals always enjoy the experience. Cornell University professor Dr Michael W Kowalewski has been researching what makes human beings tick since 1977. In 2002, he discovered that our minds have a built-in mechanism to detect fraud. His work sheds light on the characteristics of those who commit fraudulent acts especially in financial matters. In most cases fraudsters are individuals, usually men, between 20 and 40 years old, living at home and not married. They tend to be career professionals such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, police officers, engineers and architects. About 10 per cent claim to be students or members of the lower middle class. Two thirds appear to be white, one third black, brown or Asian. Their average age is 36. Academics believe this could reflect traditional male gender roles where females may feel uncomfortable taking up an occupation requiring higher education levels. Furthermore, women typically prefer occupations associated with domestic duties and care giving unlike those traditionally performed by males such as plumbing, bricklaying, carpentry and electrical installation. Another reason might be because these professions require less physical strength like lifting heavy objects compared to others. Accordingly, female employees working in insurance companies and banks seem to more likely engage in impostor syndrome (a state of self-doubt regarding one's abilities) and hence take fewer risks on tasks involving money and finance. Hence, a study conducted about two decades ago found no evidence of pervasive sexual discrimination resulting from impostor syndrome among banking personnel. On other hand, imposter symptoms peaked during promotions and performance appraisals. It also increased significantly during job interviews where interviewees felt pressured to perform above expectations. People who suffer from high confidence in themselves and their ability to succeed, however, did not report impostor feelings and performed better on tests assessing analytical reasoning skills. Specifically, middle managers had the highest incidence rate while senior executives experienced private doubts concerning their competence. This finding suggests that personally confident employees would respond differently to situations involving threats to their status regardless of whether the threat involves monetary rewards or nonmonetary ones. Impostors typically exhibit three personality traits described below: 1. An exaggerated sense of personal importance 2. A fear of making mistakes or failures 3. Preoccupation with ideas of perfectionism As explained earlier, if someone feels too important then heshe tends to ignore criticisms given that everyone else seems to think highly enough of himherself. However, success creates even greater pressure which leads them to avoid risks. For example, young bankers working in risky positions such as derivatives trading reported feeling more anxious prior to performing exercises testing decision-making prowess. Such anxiety increased with the perceived increase in riskiness. Consequently, they tended to become more cautious before committing errors. Students who committed plagiarism felt similar feelings. Imposters also consistently displayed extremely rigid standards related to appearance and behavior. When faced with trouble they became preoccupied over minor details instead of focusing on the task itself. As renowned psychologist William James once wrote, successful ventures need charity but pride must never leave room for vanity. Thus, impostors behave selfishly and focus only on themselves, forgetting that they cannot exist without every individual in society. Some research shows that impostors belong to either group A (introverts) or B (extraverts). Research published last year suggested that gender differences affect psychological insecurity. Women use guilt more often than men to cope with stressful events causing them to develop a negative view toward themselves. Conversely, men rely on humor than women when dealing with stress.

"Trapped by disadvantage are more than 730,000 youngsters, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS).

For one thing they know how hard they will work but that won't make any difference because the system is stacked against their doing better. And guess what? They are learning to live with this reality as enriching them means being less intelligent or creative so you might get into university later on but there are only so many places once you've been rejected from school. A lot of these kids don't apply for scholarships and if you're not applying for jobs then you cannot be considered even if your parents bring 3000 home every week when you're 10 years old.

"The Waking the Dragon tower was granted permission by Wrexham council back in February 2011. Businessman Simon Wingett is trying to raise PS2.5m to build the bronze sculpture, cultural centre and park planned on land he owns at Ffordd Penygroes near Llanbedr-ym-Mochnant Published:08:30Tuesday 18 April 2012 Share this article Simon Wingett has been living with a dream for thirty years - to create an international reputation as one of Wales' leading sculptors after creating his first piece when he was 16. Despite being told it would never be finished due to lack of funds and support from local authority bosses 30 years later Mr Winget decided that enough was enough and resolved to wake up that dragon! He started lobbying councils with images of what could or should be built instead of remaining permanently asleep but had no success until recently where the opportunity arose for him and his wife Sarah to buy some very unkempt looking derelict woodland which sits between their two farms off Borth Road just outside Bangor. It stands alone without any trees excepting those planted decades ago so to use up any time before they fell down into ruin Simon agreed to have them removed...and then awoke the dragon once again! ""This area used to be known as the 'Bog Wood' because there were bog holes everywhere,"" said Simon. ""I saw these acres lying idle without anything growing in them when I came home from working abroad for a few months. My son Matthew arrived; we did a bit of gardening together and got talking about how many more hectares you need for a garden - can you imagine? We both work full-time jobs so now our weekends are scoured for every spare hour we can muster."" The next day he commenced negotiations with landowners regarding the purchase of the site, eventually buying the entire plot from one owner with all three boundaries intact at 8500 each. And now here we are, almost ready to start building the largest bronze statue ever created in Northern Ireland...the Waking the Dragon project will take around six weeks to complete, beginning in May when scaffolding goes up and finishing mid August when the completed pieces will be unveiled to thousands who might otherwise forget its existence during the rest of summer. A legacy indeed! The family's plans include a ""gardensculpture zone"" (an Old Growth forest) comprising 10,000 sq metres along with picnic areas, playgrounds, dog walks and educational trails featuring public artworks. This will not only benefit children and adults alike but also help protect the environment through environmental education. An eclectic mix of native plants such as bluebells, primroses and wildflowers will cover vast swathes of grassland while even older redwoods will grow amongst beautiful mature oaks in the wooded part of the grounds. There will also be hedgerows along pathways, seating areas and lookout points across the whole estate. All new housing development will surround the statues making it totally invisible within ten minutes walk away. Two further sculptures are currently under construction, Rhapsody and Cwmllynfell. These will sit alongside each other and form another triangle pointing towards the Welsh mountains with windsweeping views over Anglesey and Holy Island.

"The Labour leader told the New Statesman his party opposed government plans to lower the overall household cap, introduced in the last Parliament. And his spokesman confirmed he was ""very disappointed"" at the move, but said if a Tory budget came into effect tomorrow no one would be worse off than they are now: "" (Jeremy) Corbyn is very concerned that the cuts will hit low earners and vulnerable groups hardest,"" it read. ""He believes there should be real help for those who need it most."" When pressed on whether Labour planned to change its position again Mr Miliband refused to say what form that opposition would take. But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell described the announcement as ""absurd,"" adding that under a future Labour government spending limits could not be eased without also increasing taxes elsewhere or by borrowing more money. But despite this clear reassurance from both him and his shadow chancellor, just how much political capital has been lost within Labour remains unclear. While Jeremy Hunt's leadership campaign receives far less media coverage - partly due to the fact he is seen almost universally as favourite -, pro-Corbyn MPs have made their views known to journalists across Fleet Street. One of them has even threatened to resign over reports about an upcoming private member's bill aimed at blocking Boris Johnson making Brexit happen, saying such measures were off limits to backbenchers because of ""the rules set down by Kinnock.""

"Footage secretly filmed by France 2 TV shows Francoise Olcay selling dinghies and life jackets to migrants hoping to reach the Greek islands. The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's border with Turkey in September alone France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has defended his country's controversial new security laws that give police wider powers to detain anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism or serious crime for up to two weeks without charge. The government is facing a growing backlash from human rights groups over what some call draconian anti-terror measures. In an interview published on Monday, Mr Cazeneuve said he was not going back on any positions taken during 2013 when parliament passed the bill. He accused opponents of trying to ""stir anxiety among women, children and families who go out every day - and even at night - in their neighbourhoods because they are worried about possible terrorist attacks."" ""I want them [opponents] to know that we will always be vigilant,"" he added. ""We have nothing against such vigilance but it must never lead us to violate fundamental freedoms."" Mr Cazeneuve also dismissed criticism that there were no safeguards included to protect those whose lives might be endangered if they refuse to co-operate with investigators, saying: ""Only those connected to terror networks can be detained under this provision. This means only terrorists and persons linked to these networks risk losing freedom while investigations continue. Warning: Third party content may contain adverts As part of ongoing reforms efforts undertaken since 911, French authorities say that the law, known as DRIPA (Delit d'entrave a la procedure penale), aims to combat extremism and prevent radicalisation through increased surveillance, monitoring and questioning of suspects before they commit crimes. It also includes provisions allowing judges to order house arrests for individuals believed to pose a threat to national security. Critics claim the legislation allows the state too much authority to put citizens into detention indefinitely without trial. They point out that in addition to potential political prisoners, the measure could sweep up ordinary Muslims having dinner together or simply walking down the street. A number of other European countries, including Germany, Belgium and Spain, are currently considering similar steps. Several anti-terrorism courts have been set up across France, the second largest economy after Britain. Judges have wide discretion to decide whether evidence obtained should be used as reason for arrest or just grounds to launch criminal proceedings. There are more than 100 places where detainees can be held beyond one month, and all within 24 hours of ordering their detention. In June last year, the Constitutional Council ruled that Algerian migrant Mohamed Merah had not suffered ill treatment despite being subjected to three days of solitary confinement by gendarmes. But Justice Secretary Christiane Taubira admitted she did not object to his isolation.

And in January, MRAP, which documents cases of torture worldwide, reported that Moroccan Salim Benkaddour suffers severe chronic pain after being tortured at Bordeaux airport in 2011. His eyesight remains seriously damaged due to prolonged exposure to bright light. According to Human Rights Watch, five young brothers captured in Paris in November 2012 were held incommunicado for several weeks until their relatives managed to get lawyers appointed to represent them. One suspect refused to speak with officials because he didn't understand anything, according to HRW. Another was given bread and water in interrogation rooms. During searches, officers often confiscated computers, phones, SIM cards, money...and books such as Voltaire's Candide (1759). Lawyers working on behalf of parents of four men aged 18 to 20 arrested in early April 2014 near Marseille described how interrogations lasted 12 to 15 hours each day. Efforts to defend suspects are further hampered by access restrictions imposed by judicial authorities. Although France does allow defence teams to visit inmates, who still cannot communicate freely with outsiders except in emergencies, lawyers are barred from communicating directly with clients. Access to information and medical care are severely restricted, forcing defendants to rely solely upon the help of family members who do not share legal counsel. Defence attorneys defending aid workers Mouhamadou Lamine Sidi Alami and Abdoulaye Mamani were themselves re-arrested, handcuffed, strip searched and locked inside cells shortly after winning bail for the first pair in October 2014. Both remain imprisoned pending trials scheduled to start next February.

"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school. Police officers have said he may have had learning difficulties or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although they don't think this was the case for most of it. A window into how he lived - in buildings that were too big for him to navigate alone - shows an attachment to those around him. Friends describe him as polite, diligent and friendly. But if someone made off with something from his room in his absence or got upset about a mistake, these friends say he would've been devastated by their behaviour rather than lashing out himself. He even set up cameras outside his home so he could see what happened when friends came over. It wasn't unusual to find a bag packed with snacks or some cash tucked away inside one of them. In fact, all three are traits often seen among autistic kids. That's because ASD is on the rise globally: One-in-68 children has its symptoms today compared to one-in-150 20 years ago. The condition affects more boys than girls and can cause social skills issues such as communication problems, hyperactivity and anxiety. Most cases occur before age four. Not enough treatment research exists to give specific numbers on how many people living with high functioning autism will receive a diagnosis later in life or die early, experts told Fairfax Media. Diagnosis guidelines: A child development specialist says parents should be aware of warning signs Asking your GP for help might not be immediately clear cut. For example: ""I try really hard whenever I go somewhere new to introduce myself, ask questions and engage in conversation,"" Sequeira wrote. ""But you won't hear me do any of that unless I'm already comfortable."" The typical profile features repetitive behaviours like hand flapping, rocking back and forth and spinning objects or toys. Alongside that comes challenges getting used to things differently from other adults and mastering abstract concepts like money, time and space. There can also be difficulty processing information and understanding others' emotions which may result in acting inappropriately, according to Autism Spectrum Australia chief executive Jenny Smith. She stressed there was no single way someone with ASD behaved, however, she pointed to two key places where typical ways of looking at ASD fail in trying to understand it better. First, it didn't seem possible to draw distinctions between different types of cognitive dysfunction; second, the idea of 'autistic savants', highly skilled individuals who can achieve amazing feats while displaying little emotion, seemed illogical given the common belief that everyone else is equally intelligent. If anything, reductions in empathy, heightened sensory perception and reduced ability to inhibit actions likely resulted in an increased risk of physical injury or self harm. Some forms of ASD can make sufferers prone to repetitive physical activities, including swinging arms and pacing. This can lead to injuries, especially in older teens and young adults, which carry long term health risks like heart disease. Doctors recommend seeing an occupational therapist for support. They're trained to work with people with developmental disabilities and teach everyday tasks like using public transport or communicating basic needs. But the trouble is they aren't always well equipped to deal with everything that goes along with being treated like everybody else. Addressing legal differences was addressed last year by law firms T Rowe Price and Slater Gordon, the latter providing free services for anyone needing help after hearing stories similar to Sequeira's. Lawyers drew up expert advice based on conditions experienced by families across Sydney and Melbourne. A spokesperson for NSW Attorney General Mark Speakman said the government has accepted recommendations to address gaps and improve practice relating to guardianship orders, access rights and estate planning. However, having more awareness doesn't necessarily mean better care. GPs need strong training programs to learn about ASD and become familiar with the range of treatments available, Ms Smith advised. And people suffering from serious mental illness, substance abuse and trauma have higher chances of developing another disability due to mental exhaustion. Accessing appropriate care when or if needed isn't easy either. Many doctors admit they struggle to decide whether to refer patients diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder to a psychologist for therapy, leaving families confused about where to turn next. Experts suggest those struggling due to financial hardship don't always get adequate assistance through Centrelink emergency payments. These reduce their income to 384 per fortnight, allowing only essential expenses such as rent, food, electricity and phone bills, and making applying for welfare benefits difficult. Spokespeople from both major parties agreed additional funding to handle complex situations arising from rising diagnoses was necessary since current programs were inadequate. Labor leader Bill Shorten has promised to provide upgrades, though Liberal frontbencher Steven Ciobo called it unnecessary spending. Disability Services Minister Stuart Robert backed Mr Ciobo saying adding resources wouldn't solve society's broader inequality problem. ""We know we still have improvements to make when it comes to supporting Australians with intellectual and neurodevelopmental disorders,"" he confirmed via email. ""This includes increasing capacity of the state disability service centres which currently serve the majority of Australians with specialised supports, yet many live far from our largest regions.""

"Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease. But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), this is no longer permitted and the pigs have to go through a slaughter process without any human interference or inspection at all. The pork industry says that it wants nothing more than what has been agreed in Brussels - safe food on which consumers can rely. And they are determined to fight the UK government if necessary to protect their interests. The FSA issued its guidance last month after consultation with stakeholders including meat processors who want to retain the right to carry out inspections in abbatoirs. Government ministers say that a test market trial taking place across England from 1 April will give them confidence before they make up their minds about whether the change should become law nationally later in the year. A pilot scheme has already taken place in parts of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Cheshire where inspectors continued to wield knives alongside slaughterers while inspecting animals for signs of illness. Some 13,500 pigs were slaughtered during the pilot phase that ended in February, according to Meat Industry Council figures. In some cases, farmers had waived compulsory EU health checks as part of the deal struck between Europe and Westminster back in March to avoid tariffs imposed on imports because of concerns over foot-and-mouth disease among British livestock. That agreement also gave Britain control over how much import tariffs would apply. Under current rules set by the World Trade Organisation, the UK cannot impose trade restrictions until January 2012 unless there is an epidemic involving large numbers of sheep, cattle and goats. Although both sides said afterwards that it was not linked to Brexit talks, one expert suggested the timing could indicate that the UK wanted to ensure the issue did not delay exports just when the EU was fighting off another financial crisis. At least half of all imported food products entering the bloc come via London - something which many fear could suffer if free movement ends following June's referendum vote. pork belly, bacon, sausages Pork producers complain that 60 per cent of the 7 million pigs bred annually in the UK find themselves exported to other countries within weeks of being born so there are few left behind to undergo official veterinary procedures. Pigs now spend only five days at sows' litters before slaughter and butchers argue that this makes it easier for diseases such as swine fever and African Swine Fever to spread around the herd. They claim loopholes allow infected animals to enter the supply chain undetected. As well as having links to consumer safety, animal welfare campaigners see problems with the system. ""What we don't want is people bringing into our country potentially infectious pathogens that might harm human beings,"" Linda Gillibrand, director general of Humane Society International, told BBC Radio 4 today.

Mr Hancock described the use of mechanical tools instead of hands to assess muscle quality or visual appearance as ""arbitrary.""

Liberal Democrat spokesman Ed Davey, who voted against triggering Article 50, added: ""Whilst we welcome job creation benefits from Britain leaving the EU, this particular measure won't create those jobs. ""For example, the pilot scheme allows butchers using machinery to remove trimmings from cuts of meat, decide which pieces fit into different categories and then weigh each piece accordingly - yet none of us know exactly what criteria will be applied nor does anyone currently inspect the resulting product, let alone certify it before export. ""If this becomes standard practice it effectively means the Government accepts that certain kinds of animal products are unsafe to eat without proper testing and certification, which most of us know isn't true. What happens next? It seems highly likely that Ministers will simply interpret that as saying that we have relaxed standards in order to meet WTO commitments, whilst simultaneously claiming full compliance with EU laws and standards throughout the trading relationship.""

It was also expensive, as much money goes into hiring casual labour rather than trained healthcare professionals. We operate like any business - you hire your workforce when they work best: late at night."" Another issue raised is that if someone lives far away from an AE department it makes sense to base it somewhere else at times or even close down parts altogether; however that will hit certain communities harder than others due to transport issues e.g. those who live near motorways. As well as making referrals more difficult for those travelling to access services across Wales. Clinical Commissioning Group (CCGs) believe the introduction of GP led midwives is needed because women keep having babies younger and earlier despite there being more resources available to help them through pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. They say maternity units should recruit enough midwives to deal with demand and deliver high quality care. Senior Welsh Labour AM Rebecca Evans called for urgent action now after complaints about delays when looking for support during her second pregnancy. She says the Welsh Government needs to take a lead role to ensure things change soon...",0,342
"The area around Green Park, which also has a large business park, is notorious for its long traffic queues, particularly on match days. Plans for Green Park Station were put forward in July 2015 by the Mayor of London and Transport Secretary to create an underground station with retail space beneath the stands at White Hart Lane. Access Green Park tube station provides access from here to all parts of central London; it can be reached via the Central line or through No 10 Downing Street (in both directions) and Trafalgar Square (northwest bound). The nearest mainline railway stations are Victoria Station, Bank and Charing Cross Stations.

"Sales volumes increased by 1.7 in November from the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. Compared with the same month last year, sales were up by 5. However, following a strong autumn, there was some softening towards the end of 2013 - which saw sales grow 8.2. Nick Bubb, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, told The Independent: ""The figures are encouraging and support our view that UK economic growth will gradually accelerate to 2-3 this winter as weaker demand outstrips stronger domestic supply."" He added: ""And while it is not clear how resilient household demand has been so far this year, we expect further recovery later in the coming months and into 2014."" Dominick Scruton, director general of trade association British Business Group (BBG), suggested that high street retailers had likely benefited more than other sectors from an improving economy. Rob Beale, BBG's head of retail research, also pointed to Christmas spending figures showing online shoppers were less affected by weak consumer confidence earlier this year than traditional retailers, who reported falling orders last week.",0,344
"Parents and carers at Camau Bach in Aberystwyth were told someone trespassed into its Green Room from the outside play area. It said police had been told and were informing them of what they found when searching for the suspect A POLICEMAN was caught on camera hiding inside a child's climbing frame to steal valium tablets, West Wales Police have confirmed. Officers first became aware of an attempted burglary after receiving reports that two people might be attempting to break into the building while it was empty. Footage proved pivotal in identifying one person who has since admitted involvement in more than 20 offences across north west Wales. The restorative justice centre opened last month in Camau Bach near Machynlleth is now being used as a processing facility due to overcrowding issues. School catering officer Gary Gibbs, 29, began investigating matters about 10pm on Monday 11 May when he noticed lights coming through safety glass panels protecting equipment stored inside the children's gym There are several cameras set up around the building which cover most areas of activity but not all of them can operate simultaneously. One eye-catching picture taken by security staff showed a man crawling onto the roof. Another revealed him going under the fence before crawling along towards the back door of the premises. Police believe he climbed over a wall nearby a safe containing cash, then crept further underground until he got to a storage room where he stole 5 worth of painkillers - known locally as Valium - and left his mobile phone behind. He also took things such as cleaning cloths and washing powder within sight of CCTV footage showing how he reached the roof using ladders or scaffolding. When officers arrived at the scene shortly afterwards they searched neighbouring properties including a flat above the business listed as manager Simon Williams' address. They discovered three other adults still in possession of drugs despite having previously checked themselves out earlier that day. Mr Gibbs believed there may have been others involved due to the amount of time spent stealing illicit substances. ""Two years ago we would get maybe four offences a year, this year we've already had 15 so far,"" he added. Once the owner identified the culprit, who lived just yards away from the store, specialist detectives joined the operation. A search warrant was executed at 9am yesterday (Tuesday 1 June) at a property owned by Mr Williams at Nevern Road, Fairwater, Wales NP3 4AZ. During their investigation the suspected burglar attempted to flee by car leaving items in front of the house. However, at 6.20pm a member of the public called police after spotting the man running in a field next to the house.Officers arrested 25-year-old Aaron John Vaughan at Abertillery Railway Station where he claimed to work as a labourer. Upon questioning he acknowledged that he entered the main shop without permission on Sunday evening but denied any knowledge of the theft. His solicitor submitted paperwork claiming that he did not commit any offence but instead went to the shop because he wanted to use the facilities.Mr Gibbs insisted: ""We do not think crime will stop if offenders go to jail.""He explained his organisation provides a place where offenders can learn from their mistakes and offers resources to help with future offending behaviour.",0,345
"A health tribunal has found Peter Sutcliffe no longer needs any treatment for any mental disorder. In 1981 he was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders and given a life sentence in Broadmoor hospital, where so far as we know he remains to this day. Sutcliffe claims that the reason there is still an investigation into his case - four years after it ended by acquittal at trial - is because medical staff are ""keeping him alive"" against his wishes. He thinks they want more money from taxpayers. It is widely known that medical staff have been paid well over 1 million per year on top of their regular salaries since Sutcliffe was acquitted; but if you think about how much it costs us just to keep someone in prison these days (no such thing as profit), then perhaps one might be tempted to agree with him. But surely His Majesty has no jurisdiction here? Maybe they're hoping to claim expenses under the Prisoners Act 1877 or something similar. The answer seems fairly simple: The Ministry of Justice says that some of what people like Sutcliffe believe actually happened did happen. I don't mind saying that even though he killed thirteen women while impersonating police officers between 1974-78. Most victims had suffered physical abuse before death by knife wounds, hammer blows and strangulation, which may explain why they were reluctant to seek help afterwards and also explains why the authorities failed to connect some of the crimes to each other despite having strong circumstantial evidence. He didn't get away with murder when taken back to court, nor should he now. Wasn't all this covered up in those infamous Inquests and cover ups? How can the public trust politicians and doctors who make decisions based solely upon their own views without taking account of anything else? So what really happens to patients committed to high security hospitals? Is anyone checking what goes on behind closed doors? As always, the only way to find out will be through Freedom of Information requests - A Good Idea Limited (AGIL) reports that only 10 of FoI applications are successful. Why not raise the bar? And how many prisoners are being released earlier than recommended due to improved medical care rather than actual rehabilitation programmes? Who knows? If nothing comes of these inquiries [it wouldn't surprise me] maybe we shouldn't go making wild accusations until we've got concrete proof.",0,346
"In a letter to all party leaders, the Equality and Human Rights Commission expresses concern about hate attacks that have taken place since the UK voted to leave the EU .

"The 60-year-old man was scuba diving at Agincourt Reef in Far North Queensland when he was seen to be in trouble, tour operator Quicksilver said. The tourist, a certified diver, had been swimming with other divers near the reef's edge and was swept into rough seas. ""He became distressed very quickly,"" photographer Paul Henry told AAP on Wednesday from Brisbane where his colleague is recovering after being flown there by helicopter. ""We just saw him bobbing up and down."" Mr Henry said it looked as though something heavy may have hit the Australian, who has not yet returned home but will do so once he recovers. Another of their group managed to get close enough to grab hold of him before he disappeared under water again, Paul Henry said: ""He went straight back underwater."" Head injuries ""A lot of people are saying that if he'd stayed longer we could've pulled him out,"" Paul Henry added. But they decided against doing this because the sea conditions were too dangerous, he said. ""When you look at the depth of the ocean here and the turbulence... we didn't feel comfortable pulling someone onto our boat at all times during these situations."" It appears the victim suffered head trauma and burns. Meanwhile, search planes resumed efforts overnight for missing skipper Craig Hutchison, 45, from Bundaberg, south east Queensland. His yacht crashed into a reef about 90 kilometres offshore yesterday morning while carrying 14 passengers, including three women and two children.

"Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header. The visitors had their chances and bossed possession for long periods - they were only let down by some poor finishing at both ends - but it was Oldham who took the lead after 34 minutes. The ball fell invitingly into the path of Clarke near halfway before he calmly telegraphed his shot past goalkeeper Sam Walker. But more good work soon followed as Michael Jacobs hit an unstoppable half volley over, before substitute Craig Bennett even got offside on the follow up. Within two minutes, though, Derby's fortunes changed dramatically when they conceded another goal which appeared to be nothing short of a set piece effort. The ball broke through again, this time straight to Tassie Nomdong, whose cushioned finish produced a shock equaliser. Derby found themselves trailing 1-2 three minutes later when Paul Green headed home from a corner. But there would have been no comeback if centre backs Andrew Taylor and Ben Wilson hadn't failed to clear seconds earlier following a cross from left back James Mulvey. Green missed several other decent scoring opportunities but Derby continued to press forward until the break. After the interval the game became increasingly scrappy but they almost came away empty handed when Lucas Joao clipped the bar with a close range blast that rebounded just inside the area and could not be connected cleanly by Carl Ikeme. It looked like Oldham might extend their advantage further but they somehow managed to pull one back against all the odds 11 minutes from time. Kevin Lisbie received a pass down the right wing, cut infield and curled a low shot around Walker's legs and underneath keeper Lee Camp.",0,352

"The Coventry Festival of Motoring, which attracted 40,000 visitors in 2014, has had??20,000 of funding withdrawn by the city council. However, organisers Culture Coventry said the funding withdrawal was ""not due to any wrongdoing on our part."" The festival is one month away and this year's programme will include a rally from Birmingham to Edinburgh; rallies at Lordswood Park in London and Speke Airport in Liverpool, as well as an air display over Sedgefield Country Club near Haddington. It costs around 1million each year for public safety and welfare but the festival now has fewer sponsors than it used to have,.with just three leading retailers remaining - Morrisons,, BQ and TK Maxx. Organisers were also expecting to lose sponsorship money because their main sponsor, Aviva Insurance, pulled out last week after 21 years. The festival attracts about 120 corporate partners. Culture Coventry director Nick Hobbs said: ""Our programmes are not extremely expensive - we budget between 500-800 per event. We don't receive government grants or subsidies so every penny goes into those events."" He added that despite losing sponsorship they would continue with the programme as planned.

"Moat Brae in Dumfries has been a private house, a nursing home and harboured hopes of being turned into a themed hotel. It has gone to the brink of demolition twice before now. But on Thursday it started life as Europe's biggest 'experimental living village' as part of an extraordinary new project called Urban Sprawl Laboratory (USL). The idea behind USL is that we can learn more about how people live by watching them in their own homes rather than forcing them to move back out - or even moving houses altogether. The approach draws on research from other cities around the world including New York, where there are many empty building sites; and Seoul, which has created urban villages for temporary residents during major construction projects such as Olympic Park. In early May, 25 new flats will go up at Moat Brae: one bedroom with two bathrooms and parking space, another room-and-kitchen but without facilities or car access. They have been designed so users would be able to stay there until they find somewhere else to rent. Then they could also come here again if needed. At the end of June, 20 people who had lived elsewhere near Glasgow will arrive and try to make the most of what they have got while others decide whether to keep going or give up and leave entirely. The experiment will last five years. Most importantly, says Ben Yeomans, one of its creators, ""people get experiences they wouldn't otherwise"" because they are not allowed to just walk away. That might include learning to cook using the local supermarket's equipment or having someone available 247 when things break down. In return someone gets free accommodation and support services wherever necessary. Download this article as PDF A team of architects led by architect Peter Moss came up with the concept 18 months ago and have spent three years designing what he calls ""the first experimental city."" As well as the flatlets, housed within five foursquare concrete towers along a single street, MLS uses technology like sensors, cameras and webcams to monitor activity and collect data for future analysis. There will be no council tax bills arriving in mailboxes because USL does not accept deposits or offer membership cards. Instead each resident will pay 400 per year towards maintaining the site through a subscription model. However, MLS clearly understands that traditional notions of privacy need rethinking too. Residents will sleep next to one another, use communal showers, eat together and share in every aspect of ownership. One distinctive feature is that all the buildings are prefabricated and shipped over from Germany. This makes them easier to maintain than a typical prefab block at standard height. Unlike some of the proposed schemes for what used to be wasteland between Edinburgh Airport and other developments, MLS sits inside the airport boundary zone. As well as the flatlets, MLS uses technology like sensors, cameras and webcams to monitor activity and collect data for future analysis - and you'll never know anyone else there either!

"New figures show the total number of teachers across Scotland has risen, but 12 council areas saw numbers fall. Mr Swinney said the stats were ""good news"" in light of recent job losses The Scottish government yesterday announced that there are now more than 13,000 teaching staff employed by schools and colleges throughout Scotland - a figure which was confirmed to be increasing at 2 per cent as new recruits came on board. The total stands above 14,500 for the first time since 2005-06 when it reached an all-time high following two years of unprecedented growth during devolution. But despite this latest increase, there have been significant falls in teacher recruitment in certain local authority areas where budgets remain tight. Figures released last week showed a reduction in headteacher vacancies from 562 down to 469 - still higher than levels seen before 201213 when oil prices dipped and unemployment soared. However, while overall efforts appear strong, four out of ten councils recorded either cuts or no change over the past financial year. In some parts of Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, the total fell below 1,000 meaning they faced undersupply regarding both primary and secondary school posts. Only three other regions have fewer qualified candidates applying: Orkney (1,077), Shetland (924) and Highland Islands (925). A further analysis of 127 publicly funded 'new entrants' found almost half (44) had attended university, compared with only 25 in 2010-11 - indicating clear student demand for entry level roles. Over 70 of potential recruits who went into education after leaving college or sixth form also studied full-time for their degree, demonstrating that graduates want careers within the sector. Suzi Brownlie, Education Secretary Mike Russell MSP pointed to initiatives like Universities Scotland's Teaching Excellence Framework alongside the government's 250m investment in Teacher Resilience Fund highlighting progress being made. He added: ""We need a step change in our approach if we're going to attract and retain bright young people to become teachers. This includes investing in inspirational leadership and supporting early career development as well as developing evidence based policies and procedures that will make a real difference to students and families. We recognise that supply is extremely challenging particularly given that several EU countries have experienced dramatic drops in teacher numbers. So I am committed to working hard to ensure children get great support in order to reach those key objectives set out earlier this month.""",0,358
"While 7 of people underpay and could be fined, 13 are paying too much. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy a ticket they shouldn't have when it says that some services cost more than advertised. It is asking for evidence from the industry about how many tickets were mis-sold after revealing new figures showing 21million was paid back by Northern rail over five years. It has also announced plans to restrict ticket touting on trains - saying disruption would fall if there was no need for them. The ORR said ""there may well be other cases where passenger pays an amount beyond what heshe should pay"" but that its investigation team had not identified any significant or systemic issues with misleading pricing practices. Northern admitted it knew one in six tickets sold on open days between 2012 and 2016 did not correspond to actual journeys made but said customers benefited as fares fell during busy periods through competition. But Virgin Trains introduced Open Day Tickets last year which could carry higher costs depending on demand. As they represent a revenue stream they will now be subject to tougher rules and restrictions. Gatwick Airport Group Limited today confirms that it submitted revised proposals for Gatwick South runway in response to the Government's consultation to expand airport capacity in south east England. Following careful consideration of responses received, Gatwick Airport Group Ltd can confirm the revised proposal will deliver around 3 million additional annual aircraft movements compared with our original submission. This represents just less than 70 growth at current levels. Together with other airlines this will provide scope to introduce hundreds of thousands of extra seats into local travel markets throughout southern England. We believe enhanced connectivity across Southern Britain is vital to secure economic growth and we look forward to engaging further with all parties involved including the Department for Transport in progressing these improvements. From March 2017, we propose building two long runways rather than four short ones within the existing site boundary. In total, this equates to a reduction in landing surface area from 1,420 hectares currently to 478 hectares, representing almost half the current land available within the DfT's recommended footprint. With this change, our proposal reduces overall environmental impacts by 50. These changes reduce significantly the operating noise exposure below the national average represented in existing Noise Zones and the number of flight routes entering and leaving the UK. They mean that the maximum hourly rate of overflights, calculated according to ICAO criteria, falls to 10 compared with 20, reflecting reduced operational activity outside peak hours. Although 3.2m fewer flights per annum can be accommodated due to reductions in take off distance, run up length and airfield perimeter features, we are still able to accommodate 38 more aircraft operations annually without increasing the number of gates or the size of buildings or stands, which makes us very confident that better use of space can be achieved. Over half the impact savings come from gate separation models, meaning that the number of departures each day does not increase, nor do the planes using longer clearances from arrivals. Our proposal aims to minimise other adverse effects on communities living close to airports such as increased noise pollution and the risk of greater fuel consumption. Changes elsewhere on the ground include: removing 2.5km of access roads; reducing stand widths to 24 metres; replacing old overhead wires with modern technology systems; relocating utilities and drainage pipes away from critical infrastructure; closing taxiways, providing for wider pavements and building more trees; reinforcing fence line protection areas. To ensure that the project delivers good value for money, we aim to recycle 90 of materials used in construction. There will also be no direct financial support offered to offset negative social impact and figures show Heathrow's offer of compensation only covers 5 of the estimated loss of earnings foregone because of their location in London. At present, aircraft parking charges cover 23 of the airport's income despite being located 30 kilometres (20 miles) from most businesses and schools. A total of 49 of business premises will have free car parks within 500m of arrival terminals, while 82 or those within 1500 metres receive discounted rates. Similarly, 96 of schools are served by free transport networks so it is unfair that continued expansion puts them increasingly at risk of losing out on the benefits of future growth. Importantly, our proposal addresses challenges facing the aviation sector in addressing climate change objectives. All emissions associated with aircraft operation would remain low and constant even as numbers of scheduled flights continue to grow, thus contributing little towards global warming. Overall emissions generated by jet engines are expected to decline. Taking account of the latest information, and improved performance and design technologies and regulations, we expect that our offer will contribute slightly to carbon dioxide emission targets set by 2050. Given that carbon taxes must rise substantially, and capped flying time limits will apply soon after the implementation date, we think that this affordable upgrade is preferable to doing nothing. For example, the Paris Agreement seeks net zero CO emissions globally, and current projections indicate that the current level. Deliberate choice off the road ta porters?

"Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012 at 34 Lorraine Crescent, Thorndon Park. In court, Ashley told a jury that he had taken heroine and cocaine on the evening of 26 March, when they argued over how much money he owed her for child support payments. He then shot himself with the couple's gun as he was trying to find more drugs and cash from his bedroom drawers. The estranged couple were having an argument when police swarmed into their house shortly before midnight. ""He kept telling me no one would believe us if we said it wasn't self-inflicted,"" Ms Sibery said yesterday. She described how Mr Sibery pulled out a loaded.22 calibre revolver and fired a single bullet between his legs during the dispute. The bullet entered under his left testicle where a tiny piece of shrapnel remained lodged until he died almost two years later. An autopsy report stated the wound was immediately fatal but because there is evidence another.22 cartridge casing may have been found nearby, coronial inquiries are continuing. Loading Police asked friends and family members who knew the pair well why Mr Sibery took the heroin or whether he obtained it outside of Australia. They also examined possible links with Mr Sibery's business dealings overseas which included running a company called USN International - Universal Standard Networking Inc - based in Singapore. Police interviewed several locals including former neighbours and acquaintances. One woman recalled being shocked by what she heard during a recorded conversation in September 2009 when the couple were arguing loudly through the letterbox while children could be heard laughing inside the house. Asked by detectives about her account, she replied: ""We didn't know them very well."" Her statement was read to the jury last week along with other snippets of text messages exchanged between the couple days prior to the shooting. A friend wrote just hours earlier how worried she'd become about Mr Sibery's deteriorating mental state as she learned first hand about his addiction. ""I became really scared,"" she said. Another local remembered seeing Mr and Mrs Sibery together in the street months ago when she went shopping. That same day, officers returned to Lorraine Crescent carrying flowers and balloons for the widow, who visitors say has spent most of the past three decades raising four sons alone while working full time cleaning houses and caring for elderly relatives.

The song is normally sung by members of the Orange Order during parades in Northern Ireland as they pass through predominantly nationalist areas.

"It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia and the obsession with specific eras renders it even more difficult: wouldn't we all rather see them as adults? But there are moments when beauty transcends time. And for one group of men who have been part of Barcelona's history for four decades now, these were those times - even if they couldn't be older than 12 years old, no matter how hard they tried. In his recent autobiography, Pep Guardiola described ""those days"" as being characterised by 'total football', such openness in its expression that every player on the pitch acted like he was playing for Barca first. From then on, according to him, any idea or concept proposed would not go beyond what happened during those minutes on Saturdays on Camp Nou. A team defined by possession, understanding and empathy; where skillful play led to goals but also where luck could turn into destiny. And so the two paths diverge once again. For this new generation of Neymar-inspired youngsters born around 2010 and 2011, the idea of a side known as much for passing or short passes and speed - albeit often packed onto one man - seems too constricting. Instead, an attacking style based almost exclusively on dribbling has taken over. It takes less than three seconds for their joyfulness to find expression - ""We want to score! That's our only objective"" - while the rhythm of their legs makes up for stillness. This is Total Football 2.0. The most famous exponent of this type of game today is Lionel Messi, although back in 2003 we already saw glimpses of it thanks to Ronaldinho. By 2008, however, we had seen enough to realise that Barcelona had a special talent on its hands. Since then, the combination between fast tempo, great technical ability and eye for space allowed him to take Barcelona forward far faster than anyone else would dare dream possible. And because he managed everything entirely alone, with little support from either teammates or coaches, the football world found itself looking back with envy and longing towards his unique gifts. The word you hear used nowadays to describe him isn't just talented, though, but prodigious: Messi exudes genius and artistry on both sides of the ball, showing off tremendous creativity, instinctive intelligence and flawless technique. There's nothing he cares about more than beating your head against the wall. He wants out from under the ball, he wants through balls, he wants crosses, he wants headers... Messi doesn't always look clumsy, but sometimes he does - watch these clips from 201314 season (from BILD) pic.twitter.comy9CtBzStJT - Steve Bower (stevebowersporto) January 24, 2016 A performance like this might seem perfect for someone like Leo, whose talents lie within close limits. As some began arguing before 2014, perhaps our greatest goal scorer ever was best suited to shine deep inside opposition defences, taking advantage of all those vacant spaces and the freedom offered whenever they appeared, chasing down opponents trying to escape him. His touch is something quite rare among strikers and he rarely gets caught offside. Perhaps that explains why he scored 41 goals in 48 matches last term without making use of set pieces. In fact, despite having registered five assists in La Liga, he ended up finishing third behind Cesc Fabregas and Juan Mata. No doubt his primary role will continue to evolve throughout his career, given his mastery, dedication and capacity to adapt skillsets as needed. However, the point here is merely to demonstrate why this kind of attack works perfectly for him. Lateral movement is key, whether starting plays from outside areas or joining sportswide moves from deeper positions between midfielders and fullbacks. Even better, it allows him to make himself useful any way possible. On Saturday night, for example, he provided the assist which Dani Alves converted with exceptional ease after winning possession in the middle following a typical quick pass involving Pedro Rodriguez. Or how about a throw from Jordi Alba across the penalty area for Xavi Hernandez to strike home a Champions League winner against Paris Saint Germain in 2012? If he feels comfortable with a certain situation, then don't worry, he'll do whatever it takes to get past his opponent - Messi is nearly unstoppable in situations where teams have targeted him with tricky defensive shapes. During the 2006 World Cup final Emmanuel Petit specifically named him as a threat, saying: ""If people start marking [him]... they need to mark me instead."" Beforehand, many wondered whether Argentina should adopt a 3-4-3 formation instead of the 4-1-2-1-2 deployed.

"Forest Green, promoted from the National League, will host MK Dons in their first appearance in the competition, while FA Cup giant-killers Lincoln will be away to Rotherham. The 35 th edition of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy kicks off at 10pm tonight with 18 ties taking place across 19 days and four legs... Premier League - Aston Villa 0 Watford 1 (Preston 2) I have no doubt that this was a goal I would love to write about: it is beautifully taken on its way into the back of the net by one of my favourite players; I am thoroughly ashamed for not writing anything sooner about it; I piled into people who didn't think Preston deserved promotion last season, but now it would appear they did deserve it! That said, here we are a few months later having seen them relegated, so now maybe just isn't the right time? Two goals scored inside three minutes and then against your goalkeeper - as I have previously stated here - doesn't do it for me, even if you get numbers behind both. But there were some positives: well done to all involved. Trent Alexander Arnold. He made the late run after being put through by Andre Carrillo; he brought the ball down his flank before passing it out again; he passed the ball firmly to both feet; he nudged it wide of Cesar Kanoute's left post as he approached the area strewn with bodies. We could say he has been doing these things all season long like clockwork, yet somehow he never gets more than a mention when he does something special. This time he won us two points without breaking sweat. Well played. Andre Carrillo. Again the man up front came running into space with a ball moving towards him, only for Kyel Reid to steal the show in an area where neither player has ever looked comfortable or effective: the penalty box. Alex McCarthy may complain about unnecessary roughness calls going against him and the defensive woes posed by young centre backs Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Nathan Baker, but in truth those problems should not be allowed to affect his own display because he never really got near enough Kane Vincent Kouassi. It's important that defenders hold onto headers and play balls forward rather than trying to find spaces and ways past strikers, which allows midfielders the chance to attack and prevents teams sitting deep and stifling opposition attacks. Here Jonathan Kodjia had the selflessness to push the Uruguayan over the top and Henry Onyekuru smartly flicked the ball home despite tight angles. Not bad at all. Jack Grealish. Now he is starting to look human again, though quite why he went missing during Saturday's win at Wolves remains unclear. Chances created: yes, crosses saved: no. One of our most promising talents offers little else other than unquestionable belief and endeavour throughout each game and good work rate in defence. There may still come a day when he comes under pressure from the media and commentators, especially if he starts to drop like a rock whenever Newcastle lose as predicted, but until then let's enjoy him playing football. If someone wants to tear apart another teenager try Scott Hogan who can take great delight in leaving Norwich City fans blaming themselves for wasting money on bringing him in. For what it's worth I suggest that if such accusations persist you give yourself a proper haircut. You will notice the lack of hair coming from the sides and rear. Alex Jones. Excellent performance at Stoke, although unsurprisingly given how many chances Cardiff put away early doors he couldn't turn any of them into actual chances himself. They always seemed to go straight to Lee Tomlin instead. Still, every game brings new opportunities and Jones showed that once more today with a couple of cracks fizzing inches above Aaron Ramsey's head. His ability to pop up anywhere looks set to prove useful in weeks ahead, particularly if Foye or anyone else falls ill. At least we know he will remain happy whether it is Eriksen, Giroud, Walcott or whoever else gets his nod next week. Just don't ask him to score. Riyad Mahrez. After showing his form for Leicester there must surely be ideas floating around Manchester City about signing him given the injury crisis facing Pep Guardiola. In fairness to the Spaniard there seems nothing wrong with Mahrez: he broke free down the wing and popped up perfectly square to volley home from close range. Valuable support, unnecessary intervention and subsequently the smallest crowd of the weekend so far aside from Forest Green v Stevenage proved everything needed to make all twenty-one wins feel less important. Other than the occasional slip-up in possession, Jamie Vardy sometimes struggles to keep cool and settle games; however, Mahrez is almost unnaturally calm and composed throughout. There appears to be little fight or desire within him, probably due to being raised in the Arab world where nobody scores for fun. Between him and Gary Jack Casstaker NowayBeingStobs. Consideration.

"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave all of them bereft knowing that they may never see each other again. The thought of being suddenly stranded without the ability to communicate effectively or even move around safely leaves most disabled people terrified as if they were going through an open-ended version of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy! The Slow Down on Life blog was launched in January 2014 by Christine Scott after she decided to quit her job at Leeds Metropolitan University in order to spend more time caring for her son who has severe learning difficulties. Of course there was nothing 'slow' about the rate at which he learned; his speed of development was simply too rapid. But what was slow was how fast we had got used to him being able to do things he hadn't been able to do before - like go up stairs independently, say hello when someone called out to us from outside our front door, speak fluently to strangers and use public transport unaided. Now he recently turned 25 he is struggling with everything he once did so easily, but I will spare you further details here (you can find out more about my son's condition via ). During his first 11 years of life he would frequently become distressed whenever he found himself standing still because he was desperate not to lose sight of those he loved. As children grow older they naturally learn that moving backwards means looking behind themselves, forward means walking into the future and sideways means changing direction and he loved doing all these sorts of things. However, over recent months he began refusing to walk forwards any longer because that meant losing contact with the world, especially people who meant something special to him. And since he could no longer get away from where he was, he became very frustrated indeed if anyone tried to prevent him leaving somewhere safe. In April 2013, Christine set about writing down her experiences of having cared for someone with chronic motor neurone disease, MNDALS, whilst also coping with raising two young boys alone. Her intention was to share her knowledge and expertise with others who might be wondering whether they should take early retirement due to health problems or maybe look for another kind of work or venture into employment opportunities closer to home rather than commuting long distances to offices hundreds of miles away. For now though, her aim was simple: She wanted to break free from the suffocating ties holding her prisoner to her family situation and bring light into a dark corner of existence. This book offers practical advice on surviving the grief process, dealing with your emotions, managing stress, handling difficult situations and much else besides, including ideas for ways to help yourself during times of crisis such as illness or disability. It does not deal specifically with terminally ill patients although the author herself suffered short periods of depression following the diagnosis of ALS three years ago. This book isn't intended as ""How Not To Die,"" but it is geared towards helping readers avoid experiencing similar feelings or crises. We know what happens when people die - friends, relatives and neighbours pay tribute to the memory of a relative who has passed away, often saying 'he was always smiling' or'she just lived'. When somebody dies unexpectedly in hospital, however, the attending medical team have usually given little attention to preparing the patient's environment, making sure arrangements for the funeral happen properly etc. They are generally expected to sort these matters out themselves. If they fail to do so then there is usually considerable upset among family members and friends who are left feeling angry and bewildered. There is also a risk of the deceased person becoming known only as a 'patient name', rather than as a human being. One widow wrote to me complaining that nobody seemed interested in talking about her husband except to mention that he merely 'passed away'. Nobody mentioned how lovely he actually looked, how quickwitted or funny he had been before suffering his stroke. So anxious am I to provide assistance to grieving relatives and carers that I often try to intervene in sensitive circumstances and suggest alternative solutions.

"Guitarist and co-songwriter Johnny Marr has released an extract from his upcoming memoir Set The Boy Free in the Guardian and said he met with former band mate Morrissey in 1999. The book is due to be published by Penguin Books on December 7, 2018. It will reportedly focus ""on Marr's friendship with Smith during their teens and 20s, as well as Marr's grief over the death of his mother when they were both teenagers."" Marr was quoted as saying: My mum died three weeks before I turned 16 and it had a huge effect on me because she was my best friend and we lived together for most of our lives. She just got cancer so suddenly and then two years later she was gone. So that affected me quite deeply and made me question some things about life and what you have control over. And also who chooses your next step? Who decides where you go or don't go? Because there's no way to predict human behaviour. You can only work out if someone is going to hurt you or not but otherwise there are just all these unanswered questions. Smith told NME last year how Marr saved him after being involved in a car crash aged 15: I think one day I heard some songs on the radio - this wasn't long ago - and I listened to them again and thought ""wow."" That would never happen now; people wouldn't believe in anything unless I showed them with my own eyes. But back then, although I didn't understand any of it completely at first, something clicked inside. There came into view a world beyond my little town, pastures where no one could see us, fields and forests populated with other kids like myself... [Of] those early times, one memory stands out more than others. We were driving somewhere down south through France along narrow winding lanes lined with vineyards. There were miles and miles ahead of us. Suddenly, from nowhere, a truck appeared coming towards us head on. He braked hard - too late - and hit ours broadside. My window exploded inward and everything went black. Then slowly, I fell asleep. To wake up was terrifying. Everyone else seemed fine apart from the driver sitting beside me staring straight ahead, wide awake. Someone must have called an ambulance soon afterwards and I woke up surrounded by doctors in white coats and nurses in periwinkle blue uniforms standing around holding cold metal instruments. They gave me a shot and put ice packs on my neck. Before leaving, they tried to make sense of what happened. No idea why I slept! What a near miss. As far as I know, everyone survived. My dad drove home shouting 'no fucking chance!' About half an hour later another kid arrived covered in mud and blood. A few days later, we found out the trucker passed away instantly. His body couldn't take the impact of hitting our vehicle. In fact, I'm surprised he even stopped. That night Mum returned alone. When Dad asked her if anyone was still alive under the rubble of our smashed car roof, she simply smiled knowingly. All three of us knew exactly what she meant. I believed in hell. Fire forever, with demons waiting to drag you screaming into the horrible pits of oblivion. In time, though, God performed a miracle. One morning, while combing through the crushed wreckage, she noticed Mum's purse lying open and empty of its contents including photos of loved ones lost and left behind. So many goodbyes done without ever getting to say goodbye properly. Her own personal tragedy had been erased - nothing remained save memories which helped form her resilience."" Speaking on Radio 4 earlier today (December 11), Marr added: ""We've always been very close friends, usually hanging out whenever I get off tour, having dinner once every couple of months,"" he continued. ""Actually meeting up is difficult for me, because he doesn't really live anywhere anymore - he seems to float between London, New York, Paris... wherever he feels like sleeping."" He concluded: ""It makes sense that we've ended up talking a lot about music recently and the new record, because we're both working on stuff separately while we wait for each other to finish. I feel privileged to continue making music with the guy I spent 13 hours a day listening to growing up."" Morrissey wrote a statement on Saturday evening (November 30) about Marr's forthcoming autobiography Set The Boy Free: Johnny Marr is] a dear old pal whose musical genius unites us across decades and continents. At 90 summers, he remains as vital as ever."" However, he did dismiss rumours surrounding the release date of his new album Low in advance of the imminent landmark event. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat yesterday (March 14), he described the story ""a load of bollocks,"" adding: There aren't plans to] do anything special at Christmas ... Everything will be done quietly.

There were no casualties reported after an ice hockey game between Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga team Augsburg and Poland's Katowice during which debris was thrown from crowd areas onto the pitch causing some damage. The German league said that it would monitor events closely for any repeat incidents but there were no other reports until Friday morning when fans threw pepper spray pellets at band members before heading off home although they did not cause any injuries. An investigation continues into Sunday night's incident, which saw Polish players hit with snowballs, beer bottles and even coins from inside their own end zone. Referee Urko Wiener called play dead twice in controversial circumstances as scoring continued under stoppages caused by both sides throwing objects towards each other having been ordered off the field. A total of 39 people have now received treatment following Saturday evening's brawl. In light of what happened earlier this week in Cologne where FC Schalke 04 supporters started fighting among themselves, police placed warning notices about possible trouble ahead of tonight's match against Werder Bremen. They also issued warnings to those involved in violence to stop or face legal action. And yet again we see the same pattern emerge: PCSOs are being used, often without due care or consideration we say, as weapons of war. Hundreds of young lads - all identifiable apparently because they carry football scarves around outside pretty much every ground - gathered near the stadium early on Monday morning watching on stands erected blocks apart at various angles throughout the city centre. One man told us he had seen rumours circulating on social media overnight suggesting trouble might be brewing so he decided to bring along a few mates on the South Bank just in case things got out of hand... There seemed little concern in their conversation however. ""It will get blown up, you know? It always does here, don't worry!"" Another friend chipped in. If true, then perhaps such bravado could be considered something of an optimistic forecast... As DanMasonOfCFC says, it will go down in history as ""the day Norwich City won promotion,"" regardless of whether anyone actually believes them. But unless someone manages to do something like the same thing down in Norwich it'll simply be another footnote.

Unsurprisingly, both Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion fans made up 10 of the sample size, though more than half didn't mention either club. The survey results may come as something of a surprise given how popular both clubs have become since Marcelo Bielsa took charge at Elland Road; but if anything the figures reflect well on Norwich as most identified them as local rivals rather than national ones. Indeed almost 90 per cent of respondents thought Sheffield Wednesday had done better in recent years compared to 2010-11 and former manager Kenny Jackett was voted best boss of the decade in spite of their current struggles. Sol Campbell has remained hugely popular despite leaving Bramall Lane nearly four years ago. Asked why Scott Parker' left Stoke, 87 per cent named the form of his replacement Tony Pulis. Only 12 per cent pointed to the fact the Welshman paid 4m less transfer fee than Arsenal's Alex Song. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry hailed Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp for turning him around to becoming productive once more.

"It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who had worked with Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It was at this time that he met his future wife Mary Ann McConnon from Ayrshire, Scotland. By 1865 they were married when she gave birth to their first child Annie Elizabeth who died within hours of her arrival on 30 June that year. This tragedy brought about a change in direction for William as he focused mainly upon shipbuilding rather than engineering. Between Mary Ann helped out with family matters whilst Willie set about building ships. Thus a skilled workforce was available for many new projects including vessels for overseas markets, local cargo shipping and fishing boats. These included: two paddle steamers; 'Dauntless', built in 1886, named after one of Captain Robert Falcon Scott's crew member who had perished during an Antarctic expedition;and the Clan MacAlister, completed in 1890, which carried mail between Port Glasgow Greenock. Both these ships later entered service as troopships serving together in World War I where they transported soldiers back home following the Gallipoli landings. In 1870 John Elder and Sons became registered under Scottish law as trading companies. Three years later, however, Supreme Court Judge Sir Alexander Fraser abolished both the partnership and company structures because it was felt that sailing ships could not compete against steamship lines which imported vast quantities of coal every day. Consequently all activities ceased until 1912 when more favourable conditions returned. During those few troubled months work continued but only on smaller craft such as dredgers and tugs. The Great War saw ES involved in numerous types of vessel construction ranging from airships (in conjunction with Airship Works Ltd) through lighters and drifters to gunboats and minesweepers. However, its greatest contribution to Britain's war effort came from torpedoed merchantmen carrying vital cargoes of foodstuffs. Over 1400 men lost their lives attempting to save the precious supplies that would otherwise have been sent abroad to feed starving civilians at home. Although most were sunk or damaged beyond repair the survivors were rescued before any further loss of life occurred. According to some historians there is no other type of ship in existence today which has done so much good. 10 high quality boats designed and constructed by John Elder Co are still operating around the world. They include: Marner - Now based on Vancouver Island Canada. Originally commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Margaree, sister ship to HMCI Kootenay. Later renamed IXB 393. Merrimac - Currently resides in Boston USA as part of the National Naval Aviation Museum collection flying low over historic New York skyline.

"Campaigners have asked the university to reconsider the move, highlighting its ""strong record"" in educating people from disadvantaged groups. But the university says it needs to reduce costs in line with government budgets or risk losing prized research funding and students A third of London's universities will take part in a debate on race later this month, as an independent report found that they are guilty of racial discrimination against black subjects at higher rates than other institutions. The schools' response comes after two previous studies into their admissions policies - one by Lord Adonis for the Race Relations Foundation (RRF) in 2009, and another commissioned by the Student Loans Company last year - highlighted serious concerns about how heavily some universities rely on socio-economic factors such as family income when reviewing applications. Admissions officers who spoke anonymously said applicants were being judged based entirely on whether they could afford university fees even if there was no evidence that they would get poorer grades because of financial constraints. In many cases candidates simply had to attend interviews and submit academic references in order for them to be taken seriously, regardless of whether they met any criteria set out under equality laws. The findings also linked poor exam results among ethnic minority pupils to selective education. In recent years student numbers within white British backgrounds have fallen dramatically at all levels despite government spending on postgraduate courses leaving these most popular options untouched. At Russell Group colleges, fewer than 5 of first degrees are awarded to non-white students, compared with more than 9 10 years ago, according to data collected by Universities UK. By contrast, at ""elite"" establishments, including Oxford and Cambridge, almost half of graduates come from non-white families. Last week the Guardian revealed that hundreds of thousands of pounds is spent each year supporting graduate recruitment campaigns across England aimed at increasing representation of Asian and African nations in academia through scholarships funded by public money. However, only a small proportion of those selected receive close mentoring during their undergraduate careers which can lead to long-term career boosts, say critics. Meanwhile those admitted without support struggle academically. A survey carried out by Ucas, the body responsible for deciding entry qualifications, for example, showed 35 of black Caribbean students failed to achieve good enough marks to progress to degree level over three years. Only 19 of Asians and 6 of whites did so. This pattern holds up nationally. Just 13-17 of BME undergraduates make satisfactory progress to degree level while 20-24 fail to do so. Only 7 of Afro-Caribbeans go top. There is often little differentiation between black Caribbean and south Asian performance either: just 8 of both cohorts progress beyond reasonable expectation, although this figure rises significantly outside elite universities where the majority gain places. Some leading academics believe the problem lies not only with low expectations placed upon young black Britons but in the way departments select their own staff. Anecdotal accounts suggest departmental appointees feel pressured to recruit predominantly middle class ethnics instead of helping to redress historic imbalances. For instance, a lecturer at Birmingham University has claimed he was forced to reapply several times before securing his professorship position until he changed jobs. PUPILS from deprived backgrounds are still very unlikely to secure admission despite efforts to increase access to further study, new figures reveal today. White teenagers living in the poorest areas are less likely than those raised in wealthy surroundings to get into college or university. It means that a child born in the poorest area of Britain has six times greater odds of going to prison than starting university. Education experts warn that because secondary school children form key parts of the workforce, our country's future prosperity depends on giving every pupil a decent start in life. Yet, according to official statistics released yesterday, 18 per cent of 16-year olds attending primaries in the lowest 40 per cent of neighbourhoods in England end up jailed for violent crimes; 42 per cent in the highest 70 per cent. That suggests more than 150 youngsters are criminally victimised daily by adults whose childhood circumstances they share, the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank finds. Some 20 million working days are lost annually due to crime being committed against juvenile offenders, costing society 3bn. It warns improved early intervention programmes need to tackle issues including unemployment, poverty, anti-social behaviour and offending. ""We know social exclusion leads youth towards criminal involvement, we must find ways to help prevent vulnerable individuals becoming involved in criminality or indeed being drawn into gangs or organised criminals,"" said Richard Garside, director of IPPR's Centre for Crime Reduction Studies. He added: ""If we invest now to improve educational outcomes for young people, then they should see better employment opportunities and become productive members of society rather than facing a bleak future of cuts and incarceration."" Children brought up in homes deemed high-risk of abuse, neglect or deprivation face worse educational prospects than those growing up in stable environments, researchers claim. They show LSE-run projects focusing on improving schooling hold the greatest potential to boost success rate.

The 30 year old won two silver medals at last summer's Paralympics with an emphatic win over six times European discus thrower Shaun Cable and a victory that saw him pip three time World Champion Tatjana Huefner (Germany) to the line by 0.3 seconds. He finished ninth overall after missing out on a medal having thrown one metre further than everyone else during qualification. Four members of the current squad were competing in their first ever Games: double cycling gold medallist Sarah Storer; Jamie Cooke, who took bronze in the women's road race S4; Chloe Beresford, who became the youngest member of the swimming quartet to claim individual honours since 1952; and Noah Lyles, who clinched the men's 100m C2T53 final. ""To have all these great names represented within our athletics programme proves what we can achieve,"" said Head Coach Paul Blatchley.""It's fantastic to see such talent truly come together under one roof.""",0,379

"The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check that a fire had been extinguished before leaving passengers to make their own way out A passenger on board an Emirates flight has spoken about her terrifying experience during Wednesday's emergency landing in Manchester as her airline is accused of trying to deport illegal immigrants from Britain. Zainab Malik, 26, says she and other British citizens were told they could be ordered into detention immediately if suspected terrorists are found among them - even though most have valid visas or residency permits. It comes after terror chiefs raised concerns over how airlines operate checking immigration status through all-clear certificates issued by the Home Office for flights coming to UK airports. They also said it was ""unacceptable"" there should be no information given to passengers unless someone is arrested for terrorism offences. Malik arrived in London earlier this year with fiancee Ammar Javed and spent 50 days living in the capital while he studied at St John's College before flying back home last month shortly before his wedding next week.. Asked whether she would still marry him now his deportation order stands firm, she said: 'Absolutely."" I want my life sorted now because I know what will happen if we get married.' Mr Javed, 25, added: ""I am worried sick about Zainab being detained outside England.""But he admits he may never see her again. He left two months ago but missed her so much he booked another special trip just to spend time with his bride-to-be. He said: ""We couldn't wait any longer and flew here straight away for our wedding. We've already paid 3,000 and it costs more every day to stay safe.""Mr Javed went out to buy new passport photos yesterday afternoon and took them to the airport today where he sat beside Ms Malik waiting to fly home.Ms Malik, who works as a cashier at Boots pharmacy in Bethnal Green, east London, arrived without problems - apart from missing her boyfriend. She said: 'I didn't take anything with me. All my things were packed up last night and sent ahead. ""There wasn't really enough space on the luggages and so I put everything in plastic bags. There weren't too many people around and everyone seemed nice. When we landed the police met us off and asked us questions such as why we'd come back. They only wanted to ask me about my visa. The customs officer actually spoke English very well and explained to me all what I needed to do. But then they started talking to Mr Javed.'She claims that later an Immigration Officer asked their names three times before asking for papers proving identification. 'He made us fill out forms and asked some silly questions like what colour trousers your underwear might be. Then he pointed towards the doors saying that he thought we might need to go somewhere else - presumably anywhere between the desk inside the departure lounge and the holding area.Unless you're questioned further you can leave,' he told her. 'So almost 10 minutes passed and even then nobody had mentioned anything regarding detention. I assumed they were looking for something wrong with my documentations.'Then the first person we saw was a woman wearing glasses telling us to follow her. She walked down the corridor until she reached a door which opened behind her. In front of us stood another man in uniform. He looked sternly at us and muttered, 'OK boys lets move along please!' And he ushered us in.'My heart sank. Here I was expecting something dreadful to happen to me. Instead, I felt nothing but relief.'When the couple entered the room they received leaflets entitled Immigration Detention Centres (IDC) stating they must return to the place of origin within 14 days.'At this point I began to think about what lay beyond those four walls. My mind flashed back to September 11 2001. How horrible that would feel. Of course, I realised it wouldn't involve anyone having tea or coffee - in fact, I don't believe breakfast, lunch or dinner would feature, either. And the IDC could turn my fiance into the enemy overnight...My mind raced with these thoughts - luckily I managed to focus on the reason why I was feeling happy rather than fear. Suddenly, an office worker burst into tears. Another followed suit right afterwards and men fell silent. Nobody moved. This was broken silence. These guys probably hadn't seen anybody cry since 911. Tears trickled down their faces in unison. Some tried to comfort others. As the rest cried openly, an older female immigration official approached us and asked us where we were staying. 'I replied that I was going home - Wembley, Northamptonshire. To which she remarked: ""Oh God, Nottinghamshire. "" 'So we were lied to? Not quite,"" I retorted. That shut her up.

"It is being performed at Curve theatre in Leicester, the city where Townsend lived and where the book is set. The writer worked on the musical before her death last year The first thing to strike you about Made of This is not that this is a musical - although it certainly has music by Duncan McTiernan (who also wrote Avenue Q) and lyrics from Enda Walsh - but what an odd mix it is: 90 minutes for three people. A one-person show? Three actors playing themselves? It's quite difficult to grasp how such things could work. And yet it succeeds spectacularly. Most shows are just too much like full productions with all their props and scenery, directorial flourishes and ""musical"" moments. But here they're no more than ideas; we only see them when they become characters in dialogue, or vice versa. Or maybe I'm wrong about something there. What does it mean to say that the play is 90 minutes long? Does it refer to its time slot rather than to length? Is 90 minutes really enough if your aim is to present a story as simply as possible? Perhaps that's part of why this works so well. You have to be alert because you know that each moment may still change everything. As Townsend herself would surely want us to believe, she was incredibly fastidious about details. So fastidious, indeed, that she wouldn't allow any material published under her name into print until after her own death, fearing that anything written earlier might compromise her later reputation. She had once said: ""I am my mother's daughter."" Which reminds me: who is this woman carrying the baby? That's Julie Higginson, the daughter of John Townshend, who plays himself. He never knew his father and he wants to find out who he was. Why did this clever, funny man marry someone else before he went off to fight the war? Where was she when he died? Who took over the running of the family business, which should rightfully belong to him? How exactly would he make his son feel? Could he actually answer these questions? We don't think so. His memories are mostly sketchy. Sometimes they're wistful and nostalgic. Mostly they're maudlin. His life began very differently from everyone else's and consists mainly of self-pitying stories about himself. Maybe this comes through best in those scenes where he reads letters found in a trunk left behind by Beulah Benge, his unfortunate wife during World War II. They run up to 30 pages apiece and contain plenty of references to his private world You were always there beside me,"" says one letter). There are even some poems penned by him called ""Love Letters."" In fact, if you read the book carefully, you will notice that many of the most moving pieces come from out of nowhere. After all, the novel begins as follows: In 1944 John married again, chastely and secretly....He was 27 now and she was 15 years younger. He wanted children desperately. He'd been thinking lately that he'd better settle down, get married, start leading a proper life. Something drastic was needed to shake him out of his misery and take away the feeling of having nothing left to lose. We then flash forward five years alone in Paris, tired, weary, sadder and wiser. (She resembles Sir Laurence Olivier.) He writes: ""There must be more to living than getting drunk every night and throwing stones at passing cars... sometimes driving home, wishing yourself dead... Later you wake up and realise you've wasted half your life."" Then, suddenly, he remembers this other girl: ""What little happiness remains grows ever brighter as I recall our times together. Each day brings fresh joys..."" No wonder he hasn't realised how lucky he's got it. Perhaps he feels guilty? At least he tries to put right what happened? Yes, yes, he knows he made mistakes, but what sort? Over dinner one evening, while discussing plans for a new restaurant, he admits one detail after another. He doesn't seem to care. When the waitress asks, incredulously, whether she can bring the bill without him ordering food, he replies blankly: ""Are you looking for trouble?"" It's clear that she isn't. Made of This is the penultimate episode in the BBC series Life Stories, and ends on a similar note. At least it seems to me that the production team didn't attempt to do justice to the subject matter. As usual, it tends towards melodrama. Also there are far too few laughs. The audience clapped throughout, perhaps expecting some musical interlude. Not a bit of it. With the exception of one song sung by Julie Higginson, the final scene lacks pace, rhythm and structure; instead we end with lots of vague feelings expressed rather vaguely. One thought occurred to me during the interval: ""If I haven't laughed at least 10 times today, I'm going insane.""

"The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old club are looking for their first win of the season after a run of three defeats in four games. Bradford's last league victory came against local rivals Featherstone Rovers on 5 December - they have not won since then. The Baatards' home record is W5 D1 L12 this year. Hull KR (7) v Widnes Vikings (3): Hull should bounce straight back into contention when these two sides meet at Craven Park (kick off 3pm). They lost 26-20 away to London Broncos last time out, but those points were enough for them to beat Super League leaders Warrington Wolves by five earlier in the week. They scored eight tries, including an excellent individual effort from Luke Gale which set up the only try that mattered. Warriors had too many injuries and missed some big names in the clash between relegation favourites. Bradbury Field has been upgraded as part of a 150million revamp of Craven Park over the past 12 months. It seems like it was yesterday when Bradford took advantage of heavy rain during pre-season training sessions in search of better weather conditions than he could get at Odsal Stadium. But the rain did little good. It turned out to be 6 inches before kick off; 15 minutes later there was still no sign of any cover falling on top of him. Then, moments before half time, another plumber appeared with more equipment. Mistake number two: the sprinkler system hadn't gone off. With heaps of support behind me I walked slowly towards my goal without stopping or changing pace until Wilf got to within ten yards of where I stood. He shouted 'I'm going through!' Wilf looked dazed. I couldn't tell if it really had taken all that much energy or whether I'd simply woken him. Either way he wasn't happy about being interrupted mid-run. Two weeks after the game he told me how grumpy he felt because it was so cold. On reflection though, I don't think he minded getting soaked while trying to achieve something worthwhile. That kind of commitment - not to mention sacrifice - deserves respect rather than criticism. Rather than complaining about a job badly done, we can reflect on what we achieved together. We definitely made progress forward towards our common goals, even if we didn't quite finish them. His efforts paid dividends to both himself and his team mates. Maybe I shouldn't feel hard done by? When we look back at 2013 we may see it as either the start or end of a new era. Or maybe we'll remember it just as yet another dull chapter in the long history of rugby leaguefootball rivalry around the world. Whatever version you choose to believe in, Melbourne Storm ended 2013 winning 27 matches, losing 9 and drawing 7. Their performance level was typical of the premiership winners, whoever might be playing them next weekend. In fact, the most notable feature of their campaign was the inconsistency of results. From round 20 onwards they played well, often brilliantly even, regularly beating teams twice as strong as themselves. For example, five wins, six losses and a draw mean a defeat percentage of 38. A negative result means a positive return of 46. If you want your team to suffer fewer disappointments, pick Brisbane Bears instead. They had seven wins, 10 losses and 1 draw as champions. However, despite finishing second last, their average margin of loss was 30, compared to 17 for Storm. Conclusion: Who cares who finishes higher than whom? As long as the loser isn't us!",0,398

"Edinburgh Airport said more than 781,000 passengers passed through its doors last month, a year-on-year increase of 11.7. Glasgow saw its traffic rise by 8.4 to nearly 600,000. Meanwhile, Aberdeen 's passenger figures increased 12 to 214,065 - the highest since 2010 when flights were suspended due to budget cuts. In November 2011, Mr Hague estimated there could be as many as 120m jobs in Britain outside London and the South East, which would mean that one person is employed for every three people living within commuting distance of an office (the ratio in the US). Since then I've looked at these predictions across London, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds Bradford, Birmingham and most other large cities. The evidence suggests that they are wrong: almost all these city centres have failed to create new jobs even with rising populations. In fact, job creation has been so weak that entire towns such as Milton Keynes, Derby and Carlisle are now reliant on the capital region for their employment base. It means that last weekend's decision not to extend Heathrow airport will result in less growth overall. There will always be some demand for leisure travel around London and the southeast; but if every town or village further north fails to fulfil this need, it shows how important West End offices really are, and why we should think twice about failing them.",0,409
"Fifty sheep were stolen from a farm in Ammanford and the farmer spotted a flock two weeks later at a livestock market in Llanybydder. After the ewes gave birth, paternity tests confirmed their owners as having sired lambs born to them. The farmers are now fighting back against relatives who want custody of the animals under a Welsh law that can allow family members to demand children be returned after they turn 18 years old. Lawyers have argued it is not possible for an adult's consent alone to remove parental rights over minor children without explicit legislative provision. They say there must either be a court order or clear evidence showing abuse by one parent before the other party's parental right can be removed. In this case, the parents are angry about what happened when the twins turned 16 - but only because they had been estranged for several months. This did mean mother was unable to visit her sons on any regular basis during the school holidays or while she worked outside Wales. Indeed, the father lived abroad for much of 2011-2012 and even then he visited rarely. The fact that the boys' grandparents wanted the animals should provide no deterrent if we really care about animal welfare. If anything it almost certainly means these people care more than most about keeping those animals alive! Paternity testing shows all 50 ewe lambs belonged to humans named Robert Allen Davies and Ruth Evelyn Evans. According to reports, Mr Davies said: ""If I'd known at first how long my wife would take away from me it wouldn't have been so bad."" He went on to add, ""It makes you feel like a dog being left out in the rain."" But what exactly constitutes not knowing? Perhaps receiving 10 emails asking where your son has gone or him saying he's going away with his girlfriend might count (the wiser move here being an email address frozen prior to 30 June). Of course many things happen which cannot always be foreseen - this could include each person thinking the other may eventually come home again. Such circumstances need obviously careful planning - and perhaps by making arrangements with someone else such as family friends or family pets, rather than just staring into space waiting until something happens. Alternatively, could some form of joint guardianship arrangement be negotiated? Could the ewes themselves consent to adoption? Does lack of contact actually prove abandonment? Probably not. To assume otherwise amounts to punishing the child (or the human) rather than taking responsibility for what happened. One does wonder sometimes whether modern day paternalism in Britain isn't too reminiscent of Nazi Germany... On the subject of neglecting an adopted child, it didn't seem far fetched to use terms such as ""neglect"" and ""abandonment"" if the boy seems to be living quite happily off-grid in South Africa. It wasn't easy to get hold of an opinion on this story from Twitter users - though some described Mr Davies and Ms Evans as dishonest; others noted that neither ever intended to give up full custody of their son. It appears Mr Davies has already lost half the herd through sale, and Wales allows fathers to register ownership of individual animals without permission from mothers. In addition, although the twins had reached majority age shortly before the theft, no legal authority yet exists whereby parents can legally be prevented from giving their offspring consent to removal all the way up to adulthood - and indeed the ability to do so remains a matter for future legislation. Ultimately, parenthood may depend upon personal relationships between parentchild, and not simply biological ties. UPDATE 7th April 2012: A couple of questions still surround this particular issue. First, why didn't this man return until 2 12 yrs ago? Maybe he was afraid of losing custody and putting himself in poverty - since he never tried before. Also, he knew the kids would be grown when he came back.He mentioned in twitter rants that nothing he's done entitles anyone to keep something he cares about. Honestly if you own something its yours...he's paying rent and utilities in another country right now only coming back to see his kid. And yes, the judge ruled based on that info regarding the ""good character"" of both parties. There's also the question of letting 5 year olds look after cows??",0,410

"Shots were fired from a car near St Brendan's Primary School and the victim was hit a number of times. The shooting happened shortly after 15:00 GMT. Ch Insp Jon Moulton said police are investigating what caused it but believed there had been no argument or provocation before it occurred, reports PA news agency A 17-year-old boy has died following an incident in north Belfast this afternoon when shots were fired at two boys as they walked along East Bridge Street by their school. At around 1645hrs (15.45) the first shot was fired, hitting one of them in the leg; he was taken to hospital where his condition is described as life threatening. No arrests have yet been made. A serious investigation unit team have joined detectives who continue investigations into gun crime in the area. Ch Supt Ian Kennedy said ""I am aware that young people have been roaming these streets since early evening today, most likely looking for mischief"" He went on to say ""We need parents to look out for each other...and help us bring about change."" In December 2011, six teenagers, aged between 14 and 18, appeared in court charged with carrying a weapon near a primary school. Two of those arrested pleaded guilty while four were convicted at trial. One received a community payback order. Another case involving a teenager in broad daylight firing three shots nearby took place in March last year, prompting calls for schools in the city to be locked. The issue will now return to Stormont's Justice Committee which is due to meet next month.

"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that it's not simply an accident of evolution - most likely, these positions are chosen by bird brains to power specific behaviours Standing perfectly still for hours is surprisingly hard work, especially when you have a long tail dragging behind you. A study published this week in Animal Behaviour shows that at least some species choose which leg they use to stop hopping around because of its effect on locomotion rather than where birds feel stable (see 'Birds can stand up straight without standing perfectly still. For years ornithologists assumed that the position was merely something natural occurring during slow running due to the mass inertia of the tail feathering out as the bird slows down or stops suddenly. But recent research suggests that many species specifically chose the optimized resting postures for stability. Even more interesting, no such choice seems to exist between males and females within species, suggesting that all individuals share similar abilities to make moving upright easier while providing maximum stability, regardless of sex. This new theory could help explain why we see so many weird-looking dances: humans too often assume that weird behaviour must indicate lack of intelligence. Many animals will hop, run or dance; only a few get bored enough to rest splayed across a branch like a hangman. The best known among them are chimps who swing through trees and kangaroos who hop along with their legs akimbo. These oddities were once considered evidence of wild animal breeding gone mad, yet today scientists recognise that even animals under daily human observation occasionally find themselves engaged in unusual behaviours. For example, hens sometimes sunbathe on their back feet and male mice engage in doggish displays to attract mates. Classic examples include bulls bellowing, dogs wagging tails and cats grooming. Such cases illustrate what happens if adult mammals fail to display appropriate social norms and gender roles - other members of the same group take over and impose behavioural patterns inappropriate to their biological role. Given that not every mammal undergoes sexual selection, researchers wonder whether there might also be non-sexual forms of extreme performance improvement. One possibility that arose recently concerns birds' tendency to form awkward poses like hanging upside-down from a tree limb or spinning round to look backwards. To explore this idea, Daniel Kotler from Iowa State University teamed up with John Gossett from San Diego Zoo Global and Emily Jorgenson from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to build an experimental model based on hidden cameras set up inside aviaries. They would record which limbs our feathered friends used to move, then translate those movements into quantitative data about associated strength and coordination. Their experiment revealed detailed information about skeletal structure and muscle activity of both sexes in two common North American songbirds called Carolina chickadee and white throated sparrow1. The findings reveal several surprising things about bird anatomy and movement. First, studies had suggested that chickens lay eggs bigger than expected for their body size, owing mainly to strong wing muscles using their bones as levers. Surprisingly, the authors found just the opposite when measuring the chicken's pectoralis major, a key breast muscle responsible for cocking the barnyard left hook. Pecks were smaller than predicted, indicating a lighter design of bone relative to muscle density. Second, and relatedly, the analyses traced precise differences in fat deposits, including thin layers of subcutaneous tissue beneath skin near joints. In short, female chicks seem better nourished - and maybe stronger? Meanwhile, adult males gain weight faster after hatching, before dropping it off again until maturity. Why does each bird differ? How much influence does genetics play versus environmental factors like temperature changes? Future experiments might answer these questions by following individual pairs of hatchlings from egg to adulthood. When the full results came in, the researchers noticed striking similarities between the way that adults and juveniles performed their tribal rites. Both groups swung side to side, kneed forward and backward and bent knees back to meet thighs. Juveniles also plucked feathers from the ground and thrust their head towards another nearby bird. Despite obvious developmental differences, juvenile chicks behave similarly to adults. As far as the observers knew, both populations represent single genetic lines. If true, this means they evolved this repertoire together. It's unclear exactly why they keep doing it, though it's possible that ritualised behaviours serve important functions beyond mere entertainment. Perhaps both parties gain fitness benefits by displaying synchronously. Maybe pair bonding strengthens bonds in tight knit societies. Or perhaps they perform these motions to communicate. Whatever works, this newfound dancing duo proves that learning routines can occur outside formal schooling settings. So it doesn't matter how smart you are: if your parents taught you a special pair of steps and you want to show everyone else, go ahead!

But experts charge that simply citing a date from 1125 or thereabouts is not enough to counter the growing evidence for widespread dam construction across Tibetan areas that has dramatically raised flood risks downstream, including for major cities like Beijing. Last month, satellite images released by German researchers indicated some 2,000 new concrete structures had already appeared along rivers running through Tibetan regions of Qinghai province since 2006.

"It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos. But there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home from her parents' home in New York City - where she lives with mother and stepfather Daniela Rossi-Pistone along with two stepsisters and another sister who is 10 years younger than her - Lizzo would often wear a fedora hat or one of those giant crinoline skirts that women wore back then. AD On this particular day last month, however, she had on something else: a baseball cap bearing the brand name of Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Aaron Nola. The team had recently signed him as part of its plan to woo fans during such events (the 2018 season already has 1 billion worth of concessions sold). ""I love Nola! Love everything about him! Aww look at him rocking his new fedora! I feel like if you go out and buy some shoes now, it will be fashionable when we get married next week,"" she told me via Facebook Messenger after she texted over our conversation. ""And that is how my life goes, always being ahead of fashion trends but not caring because it makes everyone think I am fancy and stuff. EVERYONE THINKS THIS BUT IT IS TRUE."" She laughed through multiple messages before adding, ""Also, he looks so handsome wearing a fedora. He doesn't have to do too much. ... SUBSCRIBE TO ME BITCHES!"" Lizzo burst into popularity around three years ago after releasing her 2016 album, ""Truth Hurts."" But the experience also aligned perfectly with what people were talking about online at the time: Inauthenticity. It wasn't the first time authenticity fell out of vogue, but by 2017, identity politics and social media seemed to make it even more ubiquitous. AD Popular culture reflected these concerns. There was the moment Cheryl Hines revealed herself to be struggling with depression in response to someone asking whether any actresses used drugs. And soon after, John Mulaney said onstage at Politicon that he used to say he didn't want to talk about anything serious until Donald Trump quit Twitter. Sometimes he switched over to Instagram instead; sometimes he just made jokes. Or did nothing at all. AD In 2019 alone, comedian Chris Rock and actor Kal Penn both talked candidly about their mental health struggles. Kanye West tweeted about wanting to see less scripted TV show recaps and wrote off critics as hypocrites for complaining about shows turning characters into villains. Other celebrities pulled stunts to reveal they hid their identities while discussing political issues publicly. Ellen DeGeneres suggested stripping down on national television. Tom Brokaw admitted that he felt bad for actors pretending to be grieving relatives watching 911 coverage. Ryan Coogler disclosed details about working alongside Michael Jackson as a child star. Not long after, influencers joined this parade. Online stars posted images of themselves doing things only famous personalities could pull off - without revealing how difficult it actually was to accomplish. They showed up for premieres without makeup artists transforming them. They opened restaurants without chefs cooking meals. They took to Snapchat if they needed to take a selfie inside what looked like somebody's living room. They brought people into homes they built but never lived in. They lied about the salaries they got paid. They professed to hate money but secretly wanted wealth beyond anyone's imagination. These acts became especially notable when done by women, whose voices are increasingly heard in popular culture thanks largely to Netflix series ""Orange Is the New Black"" and Amazon Prime Video's reboot of cult favorite comedy ""Catastrophe,"" which debuted earlier this year. During awards seasons, this style of public confession came full circle with Best Actress winner Gillian Anderson announcing she faked sounding Scottish to appear edgy at auditions, besting contenders including Emma Stone and Oprah Winfrey in the process. When one actress won a Golden Globe for portraying a transgender woman this past Sunday night, she thanked God that she finally realized she was born a man. After Adam Driver refused to discuss his role in Ford Motor Company's live-action remake of ""Mary Poppins"" unless Disney agreed to let director Rob Marshall cast an actual gay person in the lead plum role, people wondered aloud why he hadn't performed this stunt sooner. For many online users, the answer appeared to be clear: Stars must start acting authentically since nobody can tell anymore. They sure couldn't before 2019 either. Back then, consumers mostly scrutinized celebrity behavior rather than looking inward about their own actions. As millennials grew frustrated with advertising that asked them to sell products in exchange for free food and drinks, companies started selling ways to avoid spending money.

"""This is where it all happens,"" says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's been an eventful couple of months for Elton John: last year saw him embark on a highly publicised and expensively promoted world tour with his piano-rock band The Million Dollar Piano, which included being reunited with longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin decades after they'd first teamed up. And now comes news that in addition to releasing his latest album, 'The Diving Board', today sees the release of another new single - ""Don't Let Me Wonder."" Here we talk through what made this song so special before going into its music video... So here you are just over two years since your last proper Christmas album was released!But not even the most successful artists have the luxury of time off; how did you come back from such a long break?Well, I've had three kids in the space of about four or five years. It takes some getting used to but if there were ever someone like me to give advice to, it would probably be them because, let's face it, at my age [he turns 52 tomorrow] no matter how much money you make, sometimes things get a little overwhelming. So when they do, put them out of their misery by giving them a baby brother or sister - otherwise known as having twins. But anyway, there's always something coming along whether you're ready for it or not. There's almost nothing better than working on stuff. You never feel lonely. If anything, I think maybe I need isolation better than anybody else because if you don't work alone then people start doing bad reviews. They'll say, 'Oh well, he should have taken the time to go home and write this thing, wait until morning, wait till evening... blah, blah.' That's why I'm surrounded by amazing musicians and friends round the clock. It's impossible to fail unless you stop playing altogether. I read somewhere recently that you won eight Grammys - how does that compare to the trophies you remember winning as a kid growing up in England?As far as numbers go, it seems incredible. As a young man, records seemed very important to me and I still am excited about hearing those old songs again, replayed beautifully live. When I played Wembley Stadium with Bryan Adams, the greatest compliment anyone could pay us both was simply saying that we sounded exactly the same as everybody remembered us. People thought that we must have spent years painstakingly perfecting our sound. Actually, we didn't know either of us existed yet until roughly 20 minutes into recording the opening track ""Your Song,"" which ended up becoming one of my favourite tracks of 1991. Still, the awards only confirm they were right. For example, I won Best Pop Vocal Performance Male twice while odds-on favourites Metallica were empty handed. Even though they sold millions of albums, they probably deserved to win none of those categories. Whenever record companies ask me what might have happened if Elvis Presley hadn't died, I tell them they wouldn't exist today. Its hard to imagine life without the Beatles' influence but it doesn't seem fair. In 1967 they weren't quite so innovative but they meant everything that followed them changed. Every musician wanted to look like George Harrison. It's bizarre but within five years everyone was mimicking John Lennon's moptop haircut. Imagine spending half of your adult life trying not to resemble Paul McCartney. There are lots of great guitarists around these days but there aren't many guitarists who can play basslines like Mark Knofler. He's the best guitarist I've heard in 50 years. A lot of people told me that when he joined Dire Straits they were already finished as a group. Then suddenly he came in with this concept album, which turned out to be totally revolutionary. Before that point men only sang harmonies or backing vocals. Within six weeks Britain discovered punk rock. There's no way Mark could have invented that. All credit goes to him. How closely involved were you during the writing process?Did you have 60 input or 100?We met every day. Essentially, the majority of the lyrics and melody came from me although he said he wrote some of that too. We worked together pretty intimately with each individual session lasting anywhere between 10 hours and 12 hours. Some nights it went late into the night. Nowadays we try and create that closeness even more, especially given digital media means it's possible to work remotely. Once you build those strong relationships though, you can't walk away from it. I mean, if it wasn't for Richard Wright, nobody would have written Oscar Wilde's plays. By the end of last century, nobody was talking about him anymore so I guess we owed it to ourselves to bring him back in style.

"The girls were ""touched inappropriately"" in the Castaway Camp playground at the park in Windsor, Berkshire, on Thursday 11 August. Thames Valley Police refused to give the suspect's age or any details of how he approached them but said it was a very serious incident and that police patrols would be increased over the weekend ""This is clearly an extremely distressing experience for both children involved which has understandably led to some anxiety amongst parents attending the area."" A 14-year-old boy arrested after approaching two schoolgirls playing football as they took their lunch break 'inappropriately' said he had acted alone when out cycling before his arrest. He added: 'It was just me being stupid'. He said the encounter happened while he cycled around Windsor Castle Park, near where the girls were seen crying following the attack. A 16-year-old girl from Eton also attended St Mary Magdalene Church in nearby Fairmile Bottom with her family yesterday afternoon. She told The Sun she heard the cries coming from the woods behind the church - and saw one attacker running away towards the village of Brayfield Green. But another youth ran back into the forest to join him - prompting the teen who went off alone first for more help. She then followed soon afterwards to try and stop the fight happening again. By this stage, other people including teachers who spotted the pair fighting started rushing to intervene. Meanwhile, teenagers began gathering in road junctions trying to find out what had happened. As well as those returning home from school the teens included several St Crispin pupils who were supposed to have taken part in this years end expedition last Saturday (August 12).

"Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested. Ms Wall's body has not been found but divers have located a life jacket believed to belong to her in Copenhagen harbour. Her mobile phone is still switched on - it may provide vital clues for police investigating how she died. That investigation will focus on whether there were any signs of violence or sexual assault during Ms Wall's final hours at sea. Police said no sign of bruising had yet emerged after an autopsy examination in Denmark yesterday (Friday), which took place more than 24 hours after her death. Danish authorities are also attempting to establish whether Ms Wall used drugs while aboard the submarine, where drug use among crew members could be considered as suspicious behaviour by investigators given that they knew each other well. Although marijuana smoking would normally not pose any health risks, experts say hallucinations can occur when someone consumes too much of certain substances such as LSD. A number of people who came into contact with Ms Wall during her time on board the Nautilus told reporters that she seemed ""normal"" until two days ago onwards. She became increasingly agitated and upset over recent weeks, friends have recalled. A friend from her early modelling years, Louise Eriksen, 29, from Esbjerg, described the model as ""a very nice girl."" She added: ""I think she went out a lot because she really wanted to meet interesting new guys."" Mr Madsen, 51, denied murder charges against him in court today. He refused to answer questions about his girlfriend, why he built the submarine, what might happen if he did eventually go to trial, and whether he sold cigarettes on board the sub? The judge ruled Mr Madsen should remain remanded in custody pending further enquiries into the case. ""It is inconceivable you don't know anything,"" Judge Thomas Lippert Jensen told Mr Madsen. His lawyer Oda Schanz Pedersen unsuccessfully argued this evidence excluded Madsen from claims he made regarding premeditation.

"The private CaixinMarkit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in July from 49.4 in the previous month. It is worse than a preliminary reading of 48.2 and is at its lowest level since February, which was also revised down. Meanwhile, exports rose by 5 year on year in June after declining for the past five months. Exports are running close to levels last seen before China's economic stimulus package kicked off at the end of 2012. Imported goods grew more quickly but remained below their pre-stimulus peak. Export growth had been supported mainly by rising commodity prices as well as strong demand abroad driven by imports into developing countries that were unable to raise production due to the global financial crisis. The trade surplus stood at 21 billion in May. In value terms it has declined slightly compared with recent high levels, reflecting an increase in import billings partly offsetting weaker export performance. However, while not directly linked to specific sectors such as mining or new energy vehicles, this data does suggest some expansionary effects may be emerging across some areas. For example, the overall rate of shipments growth slowed sharply over 2016-17 as output contracted significantly in many industries and merged local government units added capacity through mergers. But during 2017 so far M2 increased 0.5, largely because nonfinancial ""goods"" sent out have risen 3.1. Meanwhile, investment spending remains weak and continues to weigh on steel output - the main driver behind much of the weakness in manufacturers' input costs and hence PMIs recently. Data on fixed asset construction comes next. This series shows how strongly Chinese firms invested in plant and equipment during each quarter. As the central bank has cut interest rates three times in 2017, banks are now lending less money and building fewer plants and factories. They aren't investing any extra cash they've received under monetary easing policies toward infrastructure projects like roads and bridges, instead turning these funds back to borrowers who want loans to buy machinery or expand operations. Overall capital expenditure fell 2.6 in Q3 from a year earlier, according to official figures released Tuesday. Data showed a further 4.7 contraction in Q4 following another 6 drop in Q1. However, there is still plenty of room left for activity to improve if Beijing wants: real GDP growth could slow to 7 later in 2017 if macroeconomic conditions remain favorable. Whereas analysts expect growth to accelerate again to 10 in 2018, this would mark only half the 11.5 pace recorded in 2015. As policymakers seek ways to stimulate domestic consumption and bring inflation closer to target amid disappointing consumer price gains and continued downward pressure on producer pricing, the focal point will continue to shift away from focusing on credit supply concerns. These issues remain important given deleveraging pressures in the economy mean households and companies alike need access to cheap financing. More importantly, record corporate debt levels have led to sharp rises in both forex reserves and foreign direct investments; the latter being a sign of confidence in local stock markets. While reducing leverage doesn't necessarily boost returns on equity when investors see no reason for earnings to recover rapidly, sustaining current higher valuations means gradually trimming balance sheets helps avoid unnaturally low share prices should market sentiment turn sour. And as we saw in 2007-08, a severe correction can play havoc with Asia's mega economies. Higher indebtedness makes them vulnerable to contagion.",0,440

"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, General Lord Dannatt said it was wrong to ""talk up"" the incidents. Five Afghan soldiers died in an assault on the US base at Bagram airfield last week. The general also accused Nato of using civilians as human shields by denying insurgents access to areas where they could be found. The Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack which killed five - including two Americans and three Afghans. More than 20 people were injured during a series of explosions near their compound. It is believed that locals may have been involved because they are thought to be sympathetic towards Taliban forces. NATO says there will be no retaliation against civilian areas until its investigation into the incident has concluded. But some observers say Western countries should not rely too much on such responses. Last night we reported how a string of raids had left more than 50 suspected al-Qaeda members dead in Pakistan. And now Foreign Secretary William Hague has confirmed that British troops took part in these operations. He added: They did conduct one operation alongside UK personnel but I think this agreement with the Pakistani authorities needs to include other elements as well, so that coalition military activities are clearly defined in terms that help both sides avoid misunderstandings or accidents."" Mr Hague went on to blame al-Qaeda and the Taleban for attacks like those carried out last weekend in Afghanistan. Meanwhile German officials expressed concern over media reports about images showing troops wearing body armour with the word 'Eisenbahner' emblazoned across them, meaning 'iron worker'. They were spotted around Dresden last week as international aid workers tried to reach besieged residents trapped inside a downtown hotel. These concerns come after similar reports earlier this month suggested the city might become engulfed in warfare. Meanwhile US President Barack Obama announced yesterday that he would cut off funds to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) following a recent missile test. In his weekly address Mr Obama said: Congress must make clear once again what a reckless regime and threatening group the IRGQC represents... We cannot support groups who seek nuclear weapons when others do not because our national security depends upon maintaining a strong and effective nonproliferation system. If nations choose defiance instead of compliance, if threats lead us down a dangerous path rather than keep us safe,... then let me be perfectly clear: As commander in chief and head of state, I will take action whenever necessary. And Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for further sanctions against Tehran. Speaking before a joint session of Congress, Mr Netanyahu told lawmakers the Islamic Republic posed a threat to world peace. He added: In 2009 Iran launched several ballistic missiles designed to carry multiple warheads. Israel cannot ignore the fact that since 2006 Iran itself has violated United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for it to halt illicit uranium enrichment. A top Iranian official today dismissed claims made by the country's president Ahmadinejad of having won re-election. Hossein Amir Abdollahian said Mahmoud Ahmedinejad was ""not even close to being elected"" and claimed irregularities and fraud had marred last Sunday's vote. That came after senior figures from Mousavi campaign condemned results released by Interior Minister Mostafa Aqa-Mirsalim. Those included the release of a listserv [text] containing hundreds of names - many of whom turned up at polling stations without identity cards - paid government employees who voted twice and claims voters were bussed between voting centres. According to officials, a total of 799 ballot boxes were opened by electoral oversight department staff. Of 2,995 candidates in 127 seats monitored by independent monitors, only 95 had sufficient turnout to qualify as valid votes. After the announcement of election results saw Ahmadinejad secured just under 50 per cent of the vote. Opposition supporters rushed onto streets chanting slogans expressing the desire for change and another demonstration planned follows tomorrow. Iran continues to deny charges of human rights abuses while rejecting charges of interfering abroad. What happens next? UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon warned dictatorships would face increased pressure following Arab Spring revolutions. Addressing leaders from 60 different countries in New York today, he urged them all to respect human rights. And he spoke of the need to ensure free speech, especially online. His comments followed demonstrations sparked by outrage among Tunisians over corruption within Tunisia's ruling party. Newspaper editor Nabil Boujnah, who became known for criticising the former dictatorship openly, was shot in front of his home yesterday. Witnesses described seeing victims lying in pools of blood outside their homes. At least 56 people were killed in a suicide bomb attack on police headquarters in Mogadishu yesterday morning. Earlier in the day Somali army officers ambushed a vehicle carrying four militants driving along the desert road leading south, killing seven fighters. Officials believe the attackers belong to a new militant cell formed by Islamist extremists loyal to terror leader Sheik Mukhtar Abu Zubairah. Dr Mohamed Afrah Qasow, director of Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA), revealed the latest anti-bazeficial visitationdtorium - potentially later.

"The normal body tissues show up as green, while the cancer comes out as intense red spots. The team, at the University of Tokyo and the RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center, took two-dimensional images with a microscope (top) to capture three layers of cells from a mouse embryo tissue sample. Then they used these single image slices to assemble them into a 3D reconstruction using an algorithm called ""multiscale opacity."" This technique allows scientists to see inside dense areas where light can't penetrate such as bone or hair follicles. New reconstructions are being made every day thanks to new ways to take pictures as well as supercomputing advances that allow researchers to pump more data through their computers more quickly than ever before. ""With conventional microscopy you would have taken tens of thousands of 2D slices,"" says Naoaki Kojima, assistant professor in biophysics molecular biology at Johns Hopkins Medicine School who was not involved in this research project. ""But now we're able to do it all together almost instantly for most parts of the entire volume on one computer just by taking 4 million raw images - which is about four times better resolution, which means we get much closer to the actual structure, for instance when looking down at a brain tumor slice. We've been doing high-speed volumetric scans since 2001 but this presents us with the possibility of seeing things much deeper within our samples."" When comparing the results of both microscopic imaging techniques, Radhakrishnan found they looked very similar but different enough to indicate that each had yielded unique information: The optical method gave him insights he could never obtain without the electron microscope. He also discovered that his cell counting methods were valid across species lines. Using the scanning transmission electron microscope, however, revealed something else unexpected distinct evidence suggesting the presence of gold nanoparticles in specific locations throughout the developing heart. These particles appeared to develop long after the cardiac muscle begins beating. That result holds promise for future studies aimed at understanding how certain diseases affect the formation and development of blood vessels. It's also intriguing because melanin containing structures always precede the appearance of a pigment rich area known as melanocytes, which produce small amounts of melanins, in frog embryos. Melanocyte precursors developed melanosomes around 836 hours post fertilization (hpf), preceding pigmentation starting between 912 hpf and 1224 hpf. Melanosome production peaks near 1380 hpf, then decreases until adult patterns emerge some 30 days later. About half of developing melanocyte populations originate outside the basic melanocytic lineage whereas others come directly from neural crest derivatives [1]. Identification of melanin synthesis occurring prior to the appearance of mature melanocytes suggests complex interactions among disparate cell types during embryonic development. What might be happening is still unclear although current models suggest multiple steps including inductionactivation followed by migration [2], [3]. This finding has implications beyond developmental biology. In 2010, Harvard Medical College scientist Dr. Michael Lipton published a study detailing similarities in the growth rate and density distribution of early stage melanoma tumors after transplantation onto mice skin compared to those grown naturally in human subjects. Perhaps the physical nature of early stages of disease progression can be characterized via ultrastructural analysis? According to Radhkishen, one way to make progress toward answering questions like that will eventually require large scale computational interrogation of biological datasets. ""There are so many possibilities, I'd say 'yes' 100 if we want to understand what goes on,"" he says. ""For example, people often ask me why my lab does cancer work instead of studying other diseases. But there may be great value to knowing exactly what happens to a pancreas tumor versus liver tumor; or why temporal lobe epilepsy progresses differently based upon age of onset;"" [1] Self organogenesis in Xenopus laevis involves recruitment of extrathymic mesoderm progenitors expressing Tbx6a into pharyngeal endodermal territory along with expression of selective genes regulating epithelial organization.

"Jocelyn McKay is now 81 and said she feels ""released"" from the feelings that gripped her for so long. ""I may be old, but at least I am happy,"" she says in an upbeat voice. McKay was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 26 years old - three weeks after being told by a doctor friend to have regular mammograms. She went on to receive chemotherapy twice during early adulthood. It wasn't until late middle age that the memories of this disease came back to haunt her. At night alone in bed, she would wake up screaming or crying out loud while remembering what it felt like to feel those cancerous lumps growing inside of her body. The feeling haunted her awake even though no tumor had returned since the 1980s. What's more, she shuddered every time anyone pointed a finger toward her chest cavity as if they were going to stick their hand into one of her open wounds. Even worse than these imagined sensations, however, were the images of having been through something traumatic and not knowing how she could ever recover. In retrospect, she realizes how much fear permeated her life at the time. But instead of dealing with all of this herself on her own, she decided to seek help. So McKay turned to LSD-assisted psychotherapy. She started taking two 10-milligram hits (about half a dose) each day sometime around 2000. By 2003 or 2004, she took six doses a week, sometimes employing strategies such as visiting friends who would give them away: They'd take one, then pass it down along with some wine, beer or marijuana. And by 2006, she was consuming eight pills per week. That number dropped somewhat after 2007, but nonetheless remained high compared to most recreational drug users. Before starting with occasional psychedelic therapy sessions, McKay hadn't taken any new drugs in about 20 years, although she did use alcohol off and on throughout her adult life. Members of her family hadn't known anything about her substance abuse habit, nor had they suspected that McKay was ingesting psychedelics without telling them. Her sister believes that McKay likely began taking ecstasy around 2001, because shortly afterward McKay got attached to someone she met online via eHarmony.com and they became engaged. This individual eventually broke things off with McKay over several months. When the two met again, he asked McKay whether he should wait before getting married. ""He knew why I wanted him to get divorced first,"" McKay recalls, ""but his response stuck in my brain. He said, 'You're very negative today. On top of this, McKay's mother died around that same time. In contrast, McKay recalls, her father lived well past 100 years old and died peacefully. Accordingly, McKay found herself grieving intensely over both losses simultaneously; the end result was that neither event seemed real to her anymore. Meanwhile, there was also a large amount of trauma emanating from her battle with cancer earlier in life, including multiple surgeries and frequent radiation treatments over roughly five years. To make matters worse, McKay didn't really enjoy much social interaction aside from spending hours on MSN Instant Messenger chatting with people - mainly women - whom she liked. One person in particular helped McKay cope with everything going wrong in her life. This person introduced McKay to MDMA (also called Molly), which she considers to be a highly beneficial tool in holistic medicine due to its positive effects on mood and perception. A few times a month, McKay would go to different clubs where these substances are openly sold and consumed. Although she enjoyed using MDMA occasionally, she never thought that she might drink too much alcohol while doing so. After one particularly memorable trip, McKay remembers drinking four double espressos that contained enough caffeine to put a charge in everybody's veins. She believed she drank less than typical nightclub patrons, yet ended up drunk - once again considering herself to have experienced a breakdown. As a result, McKay developed PTSD symptoms similar to that seen among soldiers returning home from war zones. Upon waking up alone the next morning, she realized her bloodshot eyes indicated heavy intoxication. McKay staggered through the streets looking for a place to hide from security guards and police officers who demanded answers regarding her lack of identification. Oddly enough, none of this bothered her. Instead, she just kept walking unbothered onto the interstate highway and drove straight eastward until she reached Tennessee. Surprisingly, once she made it back home, McKay began enjoying the fact that she indeed had gone out partying. However, soon thereafter, reality hit her hard, reminding her that nothing good comes easy or free. While driving, she crashed her car into another vehicle, causing serious injury to her foot and leg. After the accident, McKay spent several days recovering amid intense pain, irritability, anxiety attacks and sleepless nights. All of these unpleasant conditions resulted in insomnia. Yet despite everything bad happening in her life, she still couldn't sleep. Overwhelmed by guilt, she wondered whether she truly deserved happiness after putting other people in danger.

"Daniel Bragg, 37, hit Julie Cook, 44, so hard he broke her left eye socket in the assault, police said. Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, causing serious damage to a frontal lobe of her brain sustained during a previous medical condition, according to Chief Mark Gearon at the time. ""I'm talking about that skull bone,"" Mr Moran told The Age last week when asked what it felt like for him to punch someone as hard as he did Ms Cook. ""It's very satisfying."" His actions were captured by CCTV cameras inside Watsons Bay train station immediately after 3am on November 4 this year, which have been released now under freedom-of-information laws. Police say they could not find Mr Bragg to answer questions over his cause of death but the coroner ruled out foul play. In response to an FOI request from Fairfax Media earlier this month, Victoria Police said there was no evidence of intentional harm inflicted upon the victim or excessive force used by Mr Bragg while restrained. He had attempted suicide 12 hours before the incident. Sources close to Mr Bragg dispute these findings and maintain he acted unlawfully in self defence. They claim she threw punches at Mr Bragg first and caused involuntary bodily harm (IBH) because she badly bumped into him at least three times. Mr Bragg is being referred to court soon for breaching bail conditions imposed following a high profile escape attempt six days earlier where he allegedly stole several items including two knives. He will also face charges related to assaulting two people outside another Sydney pub on March 10. It is alleged he punched one man twice in the chest, causing rib fractures, and choked the other with his tie during a drunken argument in Kings Cross Rd Australia Day night. No further details can be disclosed due to potential offences pending against Mr Bragg involving violence. Mr Morand says he knows why Mr Bragg has chosen to take his life in such circumstances given a number of factors are involved, including alcohol use and mental health issues. But he insists the family of Ms Cook should know exactly how hard Mr Bragg struck their daughter just moments after removing her from life support five months ago. Mr Moran says police found 15 separate contusions throughout Ms Cook's body, some large enough for suffocation - visible only through X-ray scans. One injury was even worse than that caused by the iron bar John Worboys sent flying across a London pavement leaving deep lacerations down both sides of his torso days before he died of heart failure aged 47. For the moment, neither officer nor any witnesses to the attack have come forward despite Mr Moran making direct appeals to them to speak up. Under pressure to reveal more information, detectives have again refused to disclose whether Mr Bragg suffered multiple injuries, saying all relevant material would need to remain sealed until his trial commences on October 25 next year. Despite knowing Mr Bragg was clearly troubled and having struggled with suicidal thoughts for many years prior to the assaults detailed above, police cannot confirm whether or not he revealed them to others who may then have encouraged or assisted him to commit them. This lack of openness occurred regardless of Detective Inspector Jason Walsh' repeated attempts to discuss Mr Bragg's state of mind without revealing any new facts whatsoever, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Instead, he often resorted to deflection, asking repeatedly if investigators wanted Mr Braggg dead rather than helping them bring those responsible to justice. A forensic psychologist employed by homicide squad officers to assess Mr Bragg was unable to give them an accurate assessment of his fitness to plead guilty to murder or manslaughter, according to sources present during interviews conducted between February 24 and April 7 2016. Dr Jack Campbell, founder of Forensic Psychology Services, based in Canberra, concluded former convict Bragg knew right from wrong but chose to act in ways that severely endangered himself andor others. According to police documents obtained via FoIA requests: 'Dr JC Campbell reported Bragg had ongoing difficulties managing his behaviour. As well as the history of anxiety and depression, reports indicated that Bragg expressed interest in dealing drugs, drinking heavily, smoking cannabis daily.' Mr Campbell also observed that Mr Bragg became increasingly agitated and aggressive following revelations about the Hillsong Church scandal and political asylum seekers entering Australia illegally. On numerous occasions he displayed impulsive behaviours such as grabbing or pushing furniture around; as well as harming animals, stealing cars and breaking windows in public places. Mr Campbel noted that ""Bragg appears to exhibit two distinct personalities"" describing the person seen following the attacks on Ms Cook and the male arrested shortly afterwards as controlling and manipulative. Investigators determined Mr Bragg likely committed criminal acts on September 30 2015, four months before the fatal incident when he arrived unannounced at the house of his brother Peter late at night, jumped onto the living room sofa and screamed as though possessed. After a brief conversation, Mr Bragg ran towards the front door seeking attention from neighbours and begging them to call emergency services. Later, he returned to the scene asking briefly and casually why police didn't help him. That same day, Mr Bragg appeared on Facebook using channeled promising its owners two persons alive,meant.

"The suppliers, one making seats and the other parts used in gearboxes, have stopped delivering to VW in a contract row. Car and parts production has already been halted at VW's sites in Germany amid fears that it will not be able to meet its deadline of keeping up with BMW over who is number two globally behind Mercedes-Benz in terms of sales. The German automaker said this week there have been ""no deliveries on any products"" for the next three months as it attempts to resolve the dispute with supplier Visteon Corp.'s seat division. While neither company gave specific reasons, analysts say both sides are concerned about competing against each other when they know their own factories were largely unaffected by last month's earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan. Toyota Motor (TM) also experienced major problems exporting cars out from Japan during March. Yet some carmakers believe that issues may take longer than expected to work through because negotiations don't always occur between companies based on similar industries or geographical proximity but rather involve individual executives and lawyers often working separately. As such, disputes can drag on even after an agreement is reached if either side feels like changing the deal later. That could slow down what many consider the start of new business activity. However, according to industry experts, the auto market remains strong enough to allow automakers to wait until the summertime before finalizing contracts again. Until then however, fears remain high among automakers. While car makers sit back waiting for news on whether new orders come soon, recalls add further uncertainty into an already difficult year. This past January alone saw four separate recalls affecting 2 million vehicles including Audi, GMAC Financial Services and Daimler Benz AG), all stemming from faulty airbags. According to Consumer Reports, 16 percent of current models sold since 2000 do not include driver lap belts despite evidence showing that 93 percent of post crash deaths of drivers involved in accidents occurred while wearing them. Those statistics make an argument for inclusion of the safety feature in most domestic cars. A survey released earlier this April corroborated those findings by highlighting that 66 of adults living within 10 miles of an automobile manufacturer site reported having had a vehicle recalled due to defective front end pieces as opposed to 58 for rear ends. Overall, nearly half - 46 - of respondents surveyed indicated that they would purchase another model regardless of recall history given the fact that they knew the product was safe. Meanwhile, dealerships across America remain flooded with unsold inventory that continues to pile up adding more pressure onto consumers wanting to replace aging family sedans. In response, Ford (F) announced plans to freeze prices of top-selling vehicles - including the Focus, Taurus and Explorer - through 2011 to better clear excess stock and boost demand in those markets where sales lag due to lack of fresh competition. Furthermore, General Motors is planning to offer additional incentives to fleet customers to encourage them to buy the Chevy Cruze compact sedan which goes wide available nationwide starting midyear. Industry leaders expect U.S. auto sales to reach roughly 14.5 million units this year. It represents a 1 increase compared to 2008 although that figure includes the impact of lower gas prices, favorable weather conditions and a record 88 days without motor strikes. But analysts predict overall strength levels off and predicts total sales will only rise 0.2 in 2010 to 15.3 million. Although European exports seem relatively unscathed so far following the Japanese quake, regional tensions in Iran continue to cause concern with the Iranian government threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz unless international oil traders stop sending supplies via the Persian Gulf. Such threats provoked concerns Friday from President Barack Obama saying he wants to see greater diplomatic efforts toward resolving the crisis. ""The United States is prepared to use diplomacy, but we cannot accept blackmail, nor should anyone else,"" he told reporters at a Labor Day campaign appearance here. He added: ""We need to find ways to bring stability to the Middle East... I think now is exactly the time when people around the world, certainly in Europe, want us to engage diplomatically."" Some observers view potential supply disruptions in China and India, which together account for 18 of global manufacturing capacity, as potentially brewing trouble in the near future. Combined production volumes there exceed 5 billion passenger vehicles per year compared to 1.4 billion just five years ago. With 60 trillion dollars sitting idle worldwide, ""there's going to be a lot of pent-up demand somewhere along the line,"" says Tom Libby,a partner with consulting firm Bernstein Research Co., Inc. ""I still worry about what comes out first - trade wars, currency issues, accident rates, pollution levels, anything you can imagine might happen at some point."" Perhaps nowhere is starker example of the interconnectedness of the automotive ecosystem today than at Honda North America, where CEO Takeo Fukui recently vowed his company wouldn't raise its output level beyond 37 million vehicles annually despite surging cash reserves and rising demand. To achieve that goal, the company must persuade foreign manufacturers to invest billions of dollars in assembling cars in the US for export abroad.

For three decades following their marriage, Jarrett worked alongside her husband who served four terms in the Illinois state Senate and two terms in the U.S. Senate . Under former president George W. Bush, Jarrett publicly supported him - primarily through her work on public policy development groups. But critics contend Jarrett's influence runs much deeper than what appears on paper. During the 2008 campaign, Sen. John McCain brought up questions regarding Jarrett's role within inner circles of the Bush family. He said her presence on a number of boards for conservative think tanks made it impossible for him to judge whether she'd ever done anything wrong. At times during the debates she sat quietly beside her husband while he talked throughout the debate stage. To date, there are few examples of Jarrett directly challenging any presidential position held by either man. Some prefer to say Jarrett serves more as administrator handling logistics rather than political strategist behind the scenes. In 2009, Jarrett left her post working for Goldman Sachs where she handled mergers and acquisitions. Her decision came just weeks after Rep. Emanuel Cleaver told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly that Jarrett played a leading role in orchestrating the swooning stock market rally early last year. And later, a New York Times report claimed Jarrett gave advice and provided financial backing to help get the stimulus bill passed. Those claims merit further investigation.",0,452
"One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son Danny has been murdered in cold blood while walking home after school during the Second World War - not far from where this play will be staged. Joe's guilt lies with him for neglecting to protect his family when he had the chance. He gives testimony at trial but fails to convince a jury that it was justifiable homicide because there were no witnesses who could identify the killer or killers. After an appeal against conviction looms, Joe commits suicide, leaving behind his wife Kate (who leaves her husband) and their daughter Helen, as well as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. A decade later, Kate finds herself pregnant once more; she feels haunted by memories of her dead child and struggles with enduring flashbacks and nightmares about the murder scene. She makes terrible decisions regarding both her own health and that of her unborn baby, which results in its death. When news reaches them that another boy might have died under similar circumstances, Kate decides to take justice into her own hands: ""I must do something! I can't let any other mother go through what my neighbour's going through right now... [and] if you don't know someone who did kill one of your sons or daughters then you need to find out. You have to ask questions yourself. Find somebody else besides me. Somebody... like Dad? ...Ask Daddy why Theo didn't come back last night... Ask Mommy why Theo isn't here today. Where are they? Why aren't they answering our phone calls? If we keep asking questions and want answers, maybe things'll start happening again."" Playing opposite each other across two performances of 120 minutes duration are Matt Partridge as Joe and Emma Marritt as Kate Keller, who has also worked extensively in television drama including ITV1s Heartbeat and BBC2s Strike Back. Also starring alongside them are Rosie Knighton as young Helen Keller, Deirdre Lovejoy as Helen's teacher, Sophie Thompson as outspoken prosecutor Jeanette Mavis and Tony Ansell as Judge William Cavanaugh, who presides over the inquest. For intermission one act only music playlists curated specifically for the show are spun throughout the venue. These include selections inspired by themes such as 'Theatre' (with tracks from bands such as Tonight Alive), 'Feminism', 'Love Death'. Live electronic sounds with vocals were created using samples taken directly off DVDs of horror films. This includes chanting voices used in Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Night Of Dark Shadows, along with snippets from Carrie, Psycho, Halloween, Suspiria and Winchester 90210. There's also a song specifically recorded for the show titled The Moment Between 1st And 2nd Act written by Edwin Prunty, produced by Tristan Mulcahy and performed live by Tannu Turmunkaar singing part Scottish Gaelic lyrics and some English that borrow heavily from the old folk ballad Olive Branch O Lord Be With Me. This set comes accompanied with a package containing collector cards featuring art work by Mike Leigh depicting scenes from the actual court case, the original script, details of how audiences reacted to tickets being sold, plus an exclusive soundtrack CD featuring David Byrne covering songs made famous by the band Simple Minds. It can also be purchased separately without the bonus material priced 17shipping.",0,453
"Kallum Watkins gave the bottom-of-the-table Rhinos an early lead but Willie Isa's first two Wigan tries put them 12-4 ahead at the break. George Williams, Dom Manfredi and Ben Flower completed their hat-trick as Rhinos found themselves 22-10 down just before halftime with two converted by replacement hooker Matt King. With both teams firmly in the hunt for a playoff berth, St Helens turned to Ben Kay and his boot after half time when they brought on Kevin Sinfield and Kris Radlinski. The change of personnel paid dividends immediately as Adam Swift scored under the posts following quick hands from the giant centre. Lee Mossop touched down soon afterwards while Gareth Hock was also guilty of some outmuscling work that resulted in another score aloft. Watkins' conversion levelled matters at 24-24 before Tim Smith returned again to give Saints hope he would not be needed against Widnes next week. However, Shaun Briscoe struck twice within three minutes to extend Rhinos advantage back up to four points once more.",0,454
"Two employees of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) were initially quarantined in the office. A note reading ""die a painful death, Muslims,"" was in the envelope with the donor letter. The head of CAIR's Michigan branch told The Detroit News that he is worried about what could happen if someone shows up at his door and Muslim coworkers open it to see who is standing there. Most Americans probably wouldn't even recognize an attack like this as terrorism; they would think the person just got some bad mail or received a prank phone call from somebody trying to scare them into supporting their cause. But it will likely endear those responsible further to Islamophobic bigots, which is why we're seeing these kinds of attacks more often than ever before.",0,455
"Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city. Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died and 20 were wounded by poison gas, with many of those affected dying shortly afterwards At least 21 people have been killed after Syrian regime forces backed by Russia fired a volley of missiles that included chlorine gas on opposition held eastern districts of Aleppo, according to activists and rescue workers. The attack took place about 10am local time (09:00 GMT) on Wednesday as residents were going to school or working inside rebel-held neighbourhoods in three separate incidents across two different parts of besieged east Aleppo district al-Zahraa. One rocket hit near an apartment block where children had just left for classes while another struck outside a kindergarten, killing as many as 15 civilians including five young boys. A third missile landed next to a shop selling food goods but no one there suffered injuries. Syria's national TV station said it carried footage showing ""dead bodies"" lying in alleyways amid rubble from homes destroyed by persistent airstrikes over several days. It added firefighters inspected two damaged buildings in al-Zahraa before finding dead bodies inside them. Local rescuers say they cannot yet confirm casualties because electricity has cut off since Monday morning. A resident who lives nearby told The Independent he heard explosions early this morning followed by heavy shelling which lasted between 30 minutes and half an hour. ""I rushed to my balcony [to see] what is happening,"" the man said. ""There are people fleeing everywhere."" Another witness confirmed seeing victims being taken away wrapped in blankets or sheets in cars. There were also reports of mortar rounds hitting residential streets close to schools and hospitals throughout the day. In video shot by Al Jazeera, men could be seen carrying corpses covered in white cloths into ambulances. Residents described how some families went outside during the bombardment - only to find their loved ones later collapsed beneath piles of debris. In all cases doctors from field clinics were called to help treat patients. Doctors Without Borders announced they would send medical teams to Syria to assess the situation on Thursday. Russia claims its warplanes did not drop any bombs during last night's assault in Idlib province instead targeting Jabhat Fatah al Sham leader Nasrallah Bin Ali, and his wife Salma, who fled to Turkey along with thousands more jihadists when ISIS seized large swathes of northern Iraq.

By around 11pm local time (10:00 GMT), dozens of fatalities were already evident among scores of injured survivors. According to Sky News Arabia, the casualty numbers are still rising. One expert warned the number of deaths likely climbed significantly beyond the initial toll, adding that any use of such deadly nerve agents could amount to a possible crime under international law. READ MORE: What we know so far: Aleppo siege aftermath LIVE UPDATES Speaking to FoxNews on Saturday, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter expressed concern about any use of chemical weaponry by either side in the ongoing civil conflict, pointing out that ""anytime you can kill innocent human beings...through conventional attacks or through the use of chemical weapons and other kinds ...you're playing God."" He continued saying events like these could dissuade future countries from joining the fight against Islamic State militants. Following a meeting between Lavrov and Kerry on Friday afternoon in Geneva, Russia insisted neither Damascus nor Moscow had ever used banned chemicals against the insurgency in Syria. However, UN inspectors have reportedly arrived in Damascus to investigate allegations of chemical weapons usage following eyewitness accounts emerging online claiming sarin gas was dropped on the suburb of Azaz late last week. While Assad maintains his military campaign does not target noncombatants, Western powers accuse him of deploying chlorine barrel bombs in addition to alleged use of Sarin gas during a bloody offensive launched earlier this month. France's foreign ministry referred to recent tweets posted by Iran PressTV that claimed the Syrian army used artillery filled with phosphorus acid during the fighting in Aleppo, citing unnamed Iranian sources affiliated with intelligence agencies.

"The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) follows a 2013 investigation by BBC Panorama into the Military Research Force, or MRF. Daniel Rooney was 18 when he joined in 1983 and is now a father-of-two living near Lisburn with his wife. He says that no one asked him if what happened to them had been consensual On 11 February, 1987 I signed up for military service aged 17 years old at Magheramason Army Training Depot on Lough Erne's west coast. It wasn't long before my nose became fixed firmly inside the military mould - though it would take me almost two decades to finally get out from under its iron grip. I spent three very unhappy years as part of the British armed forces during which time I suffered severe bullying, both verbal and sexual abuse, harassment and rape. The last five months were particularly bad. In fact, we were forced to live in army barracks where there was rampant drug use, theft and violence all around us. We also lived like animals without any privacy whatsoever; you literally could not even close your doors nor lock your windows because members of staff would always be outside keeping an eye on things. Some soldiers had their own rooms but these were so small they didn't have enough room to lie down comfortably. As far as food went, we got terrible meals consisting mainly of tea and porridge every day and often nothing more than bread and margarine rather than proper hot meals except Fridays when we'd receive pizza, burgers etc. There was never anything fresh much less meat such as sausages. Nowhere did the rule book say that we weren't allowed to drink alcohol provided we bought our drinks ourselves. This meant that most people who wished to keep fit drank copious amounts of cheap lager or vodka while others took advantage of the free cigarettes that seemed to go hand in hand with the 1 per week allowance given each soldier. Mixed together, this produced some very unpleasant habits that persisted throughout my career including alcoholism and smoking dope on duty. Religion was another subject that caused great confusion for those joining the UK Armed Forces. At first, we were told that we needed God to save us from sinning on active service yet later, when we found ourselves serving in Catholic countries, religion closed ranks against us again and we were made to feel unwelcome and repressed. But despite all this, many saw the conscripted life as a form of adventure with pay rises being handed out after each deployment. However, eventually everyone began to realise just how much pressure was put upon soldiers to behave badly: Sergeant Major Joe Ryan was convicted for sexually assaulting 13 women over 15 years. Stacy Woodroffe served 22 years in prison after raping 30 girls between 1999 and 2011. And Johnathan Ballesteros admitted embezzling millions of pounds worth of state money whilst working in the Ministry of Defence. Today, nobody wants to join the Armed Services anymore unless they are committed psychotics or sociopaths willing to harm other human beings. You can imagine then why the PSNI has decided to reexamine historical cases concerning alleged crimes perpetrated by former servicemen within the force. A total of six investigations will examine claims dating back 40 years involving possible offences contained in historic police files relating to Operation Banner between 1975 and 1998. Amongst the allegations investigated include cases of assault, indecent exposure, false imprisonment, oral sex, rape, sodomy, buggery, attempted murder, manslaughter and conspiracy to endanger lives. 'We need help' These findings come amid growing anger amongst victims of past atrocities. Civilian groups Every Man Counts Belfast (EMCBA), EMC Scotland, Military Veterans Against Sexual Assault (MVASA) and Soldiers Say No! want the 25 year statute limit for bringing criminal prosecutions extended beyond the 20 year deadline set by Section 58 (2) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1996. They argue that prosecuting should continue until such a time that perpetrators do begin to suffer adverse consequences through legal repercussions or social disapproval. The PSNI themselves acknowledge that they face difficulties proving that either offence is current although they claim that it does open the door for further potential prosecutions. They added that this review will hopefully assist them in flattening the steep learning curve associated with modern day crime profiling technology. Yet despite making commitments to the inquests held within six months after traumatic events occur, they seem to be doing little in practice. On 16 June 2014, Mrs Justice Keegan ordered HM Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde to conduct a public inquiry looking into failings by senior officers over handling complaints about rape and sexual assaults among soldiers deployed abroad. Although the hearing concluded 33 days ago and inquiries are supposed to conclude within nine weeks, the system fails to deliver justice and survivors remain unheard. Under section 36 of Criminal Law Amendment Act 1976, anyone can apply to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to prosecute an individual for an offence under Part II of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 if prescribed sections 59 60 (4).

"Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a ""very, very strange year at Uber."" In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on two occasions. Why are people so willing to believe that this is just someone's fantasy? The fact of the matter is you wouldn't know what happened if I wasn't confiding in you because he didn't pay me and tell everyone how awesome everything was! Sofia Vergara has made headlines recently for dating actor Joe Manganiello, but now we can add another name to their ever-growing list: Sophia Bush (Scrubs). So who better to ask advice than an alumna from Sarah Lawrence College, where these women attended college together back in 2003?! We asked them all the same question...what do they think makes a good relationship work? Here comes the truth delivered straight up - without any sugar coating whatsoever. 1) Does money really buy happiness? Do men cheat more when their income rises? The answer is no. Money does not make one happier or unhappier...but having enough to meet your basic needs will keep your heart healthy, your mind sharp, and help you live as free from stress as possible. It may also be easier to abstain from gamblingexcessive spending, overeating, smoking, drinking, drugs and other vices when you don't need to worry about whether you have sufficient funds. Having too much cash gives rise to many problems, especially in relationships, while having little means the opposite - you lack nothing essential like food, shelter, etc., which provides stability and security. And by the way, even though there are always exceptions, there seems to be some evidence that less materialistic people tend to be healthier overall. Check out our article on the correlation between poverty and health here. 2) How long should my husband wait before proposing marriage? What age is acceptable? Ideally, 16 years old is plenty of time to start thinking seriously, since most 20-somethings still imagine themselves happily married forever and young children are coming soon. Ideally, he would already have proposed his future wife to friends and relatives, to give him a sense of timing around it. But if neither party is ready, then waiting until ages 18-20 usually works well-it doesn't feel presumptuous, but past 30 is definitely pushing into ""I am getting older and want kids someday"" territory. If he isn't sure yet, try asking yourself questions like: Am I happy being married? Have I been able to provide financially for myself anytime over the last 10 years? Would you marry this person today? (Most guys have bad days; if he feels uncomfortable giving honest answers after trying out those 3 simple questions for himself, he might want to rethink.) Of course, if you both decide right away that you want to get hitched, go ahead. 3) Should a man expect anything else besides love and respect? Can you define ""respect""? Yes, yes, YES! Respect shows every day, every hour. You don't blow off a boss, boyfriend, brother, father or friend because they are 'disagreeable' or seem uncaring. Respect shows through actions, words, deeds and thoughts. When you hear or see something disrespectful, speak up immediately. Don't let others walk all over you. Life expects nothing short of 100 compliance. Anything less falls under disrespect. Keep reminding each other daily in conversations, texts, emails, notes, everywhere, to trust each other 100, communicate 100, express appreciation, reciprocate kindnesses, compromise to agree upon things in common interest, show empathy and understanding, support and encourage each other through tough times. Think of what kind of parents you want to raise your sons and daughters for god sake!!! Please!! By respecting each other, a couple becomes stronger have higher chances of enduring. Our recent article on defining respect here. That said.... 4) Are premarital coitus okay? Will God judge us on such matters? It depends. A lot of factors come into play including mutual consent, maturity levels, religious beliefs, individual opinions of Bible verses and personal philosophies. There are valid reasons why couples engage in sexual activity prior to marriage. For instance, abstinence until marriage is a popular choice among teens, single adults and Christians seeking purity before marriage. However, sometimes Christian churches allow couples to practice pre-marriage virginity and refrain from intercourse during a certain period of time (like Lent). Other religions forbid oral sex and anal sex altogether. These practices derive from Scripture, wherein God tells Adam and Eve to become fruitful after eating of the forbidden fruit. Although there were no restrictions placed on marital relations within the biblical context, Jesus Christ emphasized chastity in His earthly ministry. Today, He commands believers to remain chaste till death do thee part. Therefore, God never condemns sexual immorality per se; rather the issue concerns the preservation of life which actually applies.

"Some dairy farmers have said they face going out of business if prices they receive for their products do not rise. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration and demand governments intervene, but so far there has been little response from the federal government or state leaders. The cost of production varies across different states in Australia because of differences between seasons with warmer weather in southern areas resulting in less feed being required compared to cooler northern locations where winters are colder requiring more feeding of animals which leads to higher costs. These variations mean that some farms will suffer losses while others can make significant gains. The National Farmers Federation (NFU) says its members have seen an average 4 per cent fall in milk production since 2013 due to low animal profits and rising input costs - once again highlighting how commercial terms differ from smaller independent dairies. The NFU also say it is possible farmers could go into liquidation unless urgent action is taken. In western NSW alone, according a report by the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, dairy farmer Paul O'Sullivan had lost 158,000 as his herd dropped 10 per cent over the past five years to just 59 cows. Mr Sullivan started milking calves this year after operating half-time last season when he was forced to sell 21 head of cattle. He now fears he may be facing the same fate next year, despite regularly selling off most of what remains.

"Even though Cuba is less than 100 miles away from the US, the two counties fell out in 1959, and no American president has visited since then. The fall out happened because of a political split between pro-US Republicans and anti-Communist Democrats. After John F Kennedy won the election, he was warned to stay out by Richard Nixon (wrongly as it turned out). Later on Michael Dukakis paid an official visit to Havana. The Cuban revolution ended up with Fidel Castro leading his mostly Russian backed troops into the Sierra Maestra mountains surrounding Havana while bringing roughly 25 of the country under communist control. Since that time the US and most other countries have tried to overthrow him but they haven't been successful so far.... although we did manage to put George W Bush into power after 22 years of Democratic rule. Obama got elected partly due to his promise not to escalate tensions over this issue anymore... which means he can hardly be accused of being too soft headed! Also, I do hope you realize there are many differences between Russia and Communist China? Not all Russians support Putin's politics, actually quite few of them think things went wrong when Communism became part of their life. Whereas if we look at what happened in China during Mao Zedong's time none of us would call those detested leaders great men or say that they were freedom fighters. We'd probably find them more like Stalin who killed millions of people without question in order for the state machine to work correctly - even today one could argue whether mass murder ever gets justified... whereas killing innocent civilians to ""liberate"" territory isn't really acceptable in any way. No matter how much you try and rationalize it. And last but not least: Most Cubans don't want to live next door to USA anymore... and honestly why should they?? As long as Cubans aren't allowed back home, can't travel freely outside their own island etc., pretty much everything else is just a bonus. They're living relatively well now. If there was anything left in Cuba the vast majority of Cubans wouldn't mind sharing it with Americans. Although, some might get upset about having to pay taxes towards social security payments and Medicare etc..

"It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was likely to have died. As it turned out there were two deaths. The first came about an hour before kick off when Arsenal's Theo Walcott attempted to cross from his own half against Wolves but inadvertently clipped Tom Cleverley in the face with both feet causing a nasty gash above his right eye which had by then been stitched up. He tried to play on but soon afterwards went down clutching his head, writhing in pain as he lay motionless. Minutes later, Clement Grenier, who has spent much of his career playing for Chelsea (and briefly for Liverpool), scored the opening goal. The second death occurred around fifteen minutes later when David Nugent sent over a long throw from deep inside their own penalty area. It struck Olivier Giroud in the chest just below where he wears FC Bruges' crest. An ambulance took him away on a stretcher while others carried on celebrating; stunned silence fell across White Hart Lane when they finally noticed what had happened moments earlier. Then Tottenham's Andros Townsend ran onto the pitch like the jubilant fool he is waving a pair of scissors high into the air. ""I don't think I need any more goals, do you?"" he cried happily. Arsene Wenger finished the game 1014 ahead of Mourinho and won only 14 league games all season so surely nothing can go wrong now - or something very silly indeed could ensue. Arsenal started well enough despite conceding early, pressing Spurs back a little deeper than normal and creating meaningful chances themselves through Cazorla and Podolski, before Sanchez curled a free-kick narrowly wide. At 0-0 Spurs looked bright until Grant Holt broke clear and worked some magic past Monreal and Valencia to score his 25th Premier League goal. Jermaine Jenas robbed Lukaku before laying the ball off to Kyle Walker who hit another shot from distance which forced Szczesny into action again. Moments later Kagawa blasted a volley straight at him. Wenger made three changes: Oxlade Chamberlain replaced Alex Song, Tomas Rosicky returned and Mathieu Flamini played instead of Ramsey. To replace Welbeck Mertesacker brought along Carl Jenkinson rather than Nacho Monreal because Luciano Spalletti dropped Xabi Alonso for Antonio Candreva but he found himself isolated in midfield without support from either wingers due to Aaron Lennon having picked up a knock whilst warming up. In the other side Real Madrid's Jese Rodriguez also got injured. His substitution meant Isco would start making way for James Rodrgio Di Maria.

COYG pic.twitter.com7kURyZ5RXv - Phil (PhilMoy) May 15, 2015 Jenkinson did not look too comfortable and Wales international Craig Bellamy headed a corner past Wojciech Szczesny towards the near post following good work by Huddersfield's Danny Williams. A minute later Koscielny almost saved brilliantly as Kieran Gibbs headed towards the bar but otherwise Arsenal were quite impressive with the exception of moments involving Sigurdsson and Grant. Spurs continued to press forward but couldn't create many decent opportunities though Mason gave them hope by volleying Agbonlahor's pass away from under pressure. Sanchez hit his fourth low strike since January - of a total ten - and added the fifth late on. Both teams enjoyed spells of possession but Arsenal pressed higher up the pitch while Lamela put in some neat touches but failed to produce anything particularly incisive of note. With 23 mins gone Kane slotted home the rebound after Kolarov fouled Eriksen. Three minutes later Bale grabbed his hat trick and Llorente added a fourth. By now both sides were pushing forwards frantically looking for gaps to exploit or visiting players losing concentration trying to dribble past each other in crowded areas. Those around me actually applauded when Lloyd dived full length to save a Bennami header at the far post. On 33 Wolford nodded Butler's cross wide after fine link-up play between Eriksen and Vertonghen. Soon afterwards Ben Davies raced up behind Dawson and fed Llorente whose left footed shot beat Szczesny at his near post. Swansea City's Jonjo Shelvey burst beyond Chambers and shot against the upright however. Thirty seconds later Rose gave away a free kick about five yards outside our box with Djourou taking advantage and chipping the goalkeeper with a rising effort. Seconds later Gibbs lost Lanzoni for pace chasing a speculative ball and Sandro let fly with a vicious drive which flew harmlessly into touch. Eriksen drew Spurs level six minutes later.

"Anthony Tavernor has been restoring Plas Cadnant Hidden Gardens, near Menai Bridge, on Anglesey for 20 years, describing it as his life's project. But after days of heavy rain, a carpenter came to look at the house and found that he could not fix the roof due to dampness in the building. The carpenter spent three hours trying to raise up a piece of timber which had fallen down from outside but was unable to do so. Mr Tavernor said: ""I'm really sorry that this happened because we want to make sure everything is safe when people come back."" It has now emerged that the damage may have resulted from an errant tree falling onto one of the roofs some months ago during storms. The cause has yet to be established. Last year, BBC Wales filmed Mr Tavernor's work. He has restored gardens including glasshouses containing flowers and medicinal plants. However, a recent inspection by North Wales Fire Rescue Service identified test results showing high levels of carbon monoxide present within the structure. If those tests are confirmed, it would mean there are serious internal defects with watertight integrity. There were no official safety certificates issued relating to any external structures or parts; however, residents living nearby have complained about potential flooding problems caused by rainfall entering through leaky gutters over the last two summers. A plumber who inspected the property recently found decaying logs inside the home. Although none appeared to pose immediate threat, their presence meant essential repairs were delayed until further investigations can take place. 'Big job' One resident told The News she had noticed leaks around the eaves for quite sometime, adding: ""It's like a big bucket being emptied directly into our garden every time it rains heavily."" She added that although many properties they knew did not suffer similar issues, often blocks of flats put together without planning permission lead to cases where drainage systems overflow. Another neighbour whose car was damaged by floodwater said: ""Our car got flooded twice in 10 minutes and then again a couple of weeks later. We're used to having flooding here - it happens all the time. I think this will turn out badly."" An answerphone message left for an engineer working for a specialist company appointed by the local authority to carry out checks on dilapidation and decay discovered that they were unavailable yesterday. Gwynedd Council's environmental services manager Prys Morgan-Davies said businesses in the area also incurred costs because of the conditions of the site. He said: ""We've received complaints since early summer about flooding and erosion affecting properties surrounding the gardens. This situation was brought to light following the arrival of inspectors from North Wales Fire Rescue Service, who carried out inspections on Monday August 4th. ""Based on our findings, we need urgent repair works to make improvements to the walls and other structural elements affected by rot. Our contractor took samples to the laboratory for analysis but unfortunately the results indicated severe deterioration requiring extensive treatment or replacement if necessary.

"The neighbours entered the burning property in Milford Drive, on Sunday afternoon in an attempt to rescue two cats, police said. The occupants were not home at the time. The owner was later located and told them she had no idea what happened until they returned. Neighbours called it a tragedy when flames tore through her house sometime late Tuesday night while friends gathered for their annual Christmas party. ""We prepared to have it here as usual but we couldn't stop thinking about [her] cat, you know? I don't want this lady crying over that cat because he meant something to her,"" neighbour Jonathon Hamblin says. ""I think we all just cried."" Linda Albritton lost everything including three family pets in the fire.

I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I just want to thank the many thousands of people who have supported me both in person at Wimbledon this year and by signing a petition calling for my reinstatement as an Australian tennis player. It's been our greatest achievement - not only did it result in some massive changes within the organisation that enabled us to continue the fight against doping abuse within sport, it also gave Australia accession into international competition here for the first time since 1987. We were able to host the Commonwealth Games last month because we qualified; we're looking forward to competing at Rio next July. But if there was one thing missing from all these wins and achievements, it was something very special: having my name written down alongside those other two legendary players whose names you will see above mine every day when I play out on centre court.

"Security assistance has been withheld since 2011, when the Gulf state put down mass Shia-led protests. But US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Bahrain had made progress on political reform and human rights issues.

"Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired. People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the outskirts of Mexico City, taking cover from flying rocks tossed by police officers in riot gear. The protesters had come to a small park a few blocks away from where Enrique Pena Nieto was meeting with his predecessor Felipe Calderon for what is expected to be an emotional encounter that will probably conclude their duel once he has been elected president next month. It was only when people saw huge images of Calderon being sprayed with pepper spray during protests here last year - damaging not just the former leader's eyes but also those of many bystanders - that they realised how difficult it would be at a distance today for even more people to protest against him without suffering similar effects. ""We understand why President Calderon agreed to meet,"" said Emilia Tapia, 24, who leads the group No Mas Muertes (No More Death) which organised the demonstration along with other groups including Alternativa Socialista Socialist Alternative, another opposition party recognised by the electoral authorities. ""But we say no to torture."" She added: ""Our demand is clear now. It's enough with impunity; stop killing!"" Calderon stepped down after eight years as Mexican president in 2012 because Congress refused to approve enlarging the powers he asked to fight crime in 2006. He returned to office six months later under new rules aimed at strengthening democracy following deeply unpopular drug war killings over 740,000 since December 2006. The US-educated lawyer turned politician, 68, won support among Mexicans weary of violence fuelled by gangland turf wars between cartels and security forces. Pena Nieto largely followed through on campaign promises to end corruption and improve conditions for business and workers while pledging to continue fighting drugs gangs and criminals. But some activists are concerned about the austerity programme announced earlier this week that includes cuts in public sector spending and tax increases as well as increased pension contributions for private employers. They want Calderon back in power and fear they may lose momentum if voters give victory instead to the 64-year-old conservative hopeful whose chances boosted by favourable polls throughout 2013. His decisive win came despite election irregularities linked to vote buying allegations made before voting day, accusations denied by both candidates. Critics see similarities between current events and 2004 presidential elections when then-candidate Vicente Fox defeated Calderon in a tight race that triggered street demonstrations, government crackdowns and arrest warrants for several key figures in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). This time around, however, the number of anti-government protests have faded considerably compared to past cycles, according to analysts, possibly due to lacklustre campaigning from all four major parties ahead of Sunday's first round ballot. Only 5 of registered voters have cast ballots so far - although turnout experts believe up to 40 could participate on Election Day. In contrast, 1 million or more people took part in marches opposing Fox's administration in 2005 - one of the largest mass mobilisations in modern Latin American history - while 350,000 protested again three years ago. Thousands joined nationwide strikes held every Monday in April 2011 demanding job creation policies, improving education standards and ending pay inequality. Such large numbers may indicate less enthusiasm than in previous campaigns, observers warn. Yet others argue that as the battle lines drawn up between left and right become clearer, organisations representing different social sectors - such as teachers, students unions, women's rights advocates and migrant communities - appear weaker than ever. They complain about the failure of mainstream political elements to work together effectively. According to Tapia, this internecine strife stems partly from frustrations felt by campaigners who feel thwarted by PRI interference in recent years. She says she knows ""many leaders"" within the PRI who sympathise with her views, arguing that the solution lies in forming alliances across ideological boundaries. ""You have to bring them [the PRI] with you ... You cannot go alone and expect anything,"" she told AFP. Analysts agree that tapping voter anger towards rampant corruption and poverty created by economic stagnation and high inflation might help explain why Pena Nieto remains popular despite relatively low approval ratings below 50, particularly among urban residents. Pollsters attribute the surge to widespread calls by citizens for change amid rising discontentment with politicians' handling of issues ranging from unemployment to income inequalities. While the arrival of global financial markets supercharged oil prices last September with positive consequences for domestic production levels and weakened efforts to cut energy subsidies, critics see this as little consolation given the pain caused by soaring fuel costs and lower incomes for millions of families already struggling financially. With interest rates set to rise significantly in coming days, analysts predict worse expenditure pressures. Public officials, meanwhile, face hefty new pension obligations. In addition, two-thirds of households remain vulnerable politically, economically and socially due to weak state institutions and corrupt practices associated with traditional politics.

"The athlete set records for the fastest marathon for a double amputee and has won two Paralympic 200m gold medals. Photographer David Baird has charted Whitehead's progress for many years, including capturing his first competition at London 2012 before he achieved global fame with victory in Rio last year. ""He's now ready to be part of the world stage,"" says photographer David Baird who documented Corinne's journey from her home town up to the Olympic Stadium on 26 August 2012 - the day she ran further than ever before. ""I could film him every step as we walked towards the start line but I was really nervous that he would run off ahead."" Whitehead had been sidelined by an accident when he fell down stairs aged 14 months old leaving him with both legs missing below shoulder level. It took him time to find confidence, let alone speed. In fact it wasn't until nine years later that he ran again. But after several setbacks he broke through and began running marathons just over three-and-a-half years ago. The 2011 New York City Marathon saw his first major success, beating not only able bodied runners but also a wheelchair competitor too. He then followed this up with another win against able body athletes earlier this year in Glasgow where he covered the 13.1km course twice faster than the previous record holder. As well as having watched Whitehead develop into one of the most respected middle distance athletes around, Baird is acutely aware of what it will mean to have someone like him competing in the Olympics. ""Corinne isn't going there with anything other than hard work. There are still amazing challenges ahead and no matter how strong you think your legs may be, some days they feel weak or tired. When you've got a disability which can become so debilitating it feels impossible to imagine progress, yet somehow it happens regardless. Just through sheer determination, focus and perseverance (as well as good luck). All these things contribute to making something happen on any given occasion and make Corinne such a remarkable runner. She reminds me often about those early days when everything seemed so much more difficult; the times were longer, distances tougher and uncertainty greatest - all of which fostered conscious effort and motivation. We don't want our images to convey false emotion because none exists. These pictures represent only a small portion of the events throughout her life - though my heart goes out to all of them. Everything happened for the best and if anyone asks us 'what does being disabled teach us?', I'd say simply 'it teaches us love.' And how sublime!""",0,477

"They are worried about losing a rare rest day and the effect on their awards night, Paul Struthers said. The move - supported by top female rider Hayley Turner - could leave them fuming when they return to race in Sheffield on Saturday for the second stage of the Women's Tour de Yorkshire, after nearly eight weeks away from racing action. The women will also have one fewer chance at glory than men, as organisers decided that male teams would contest each other's points more often than expected. So with 16 days left until the end of the season, riders needed only 11 wins instead of 12 over three stages - including perhaps just four or five through team time trials like yesterday's. Struthers added: ""It is a massive blow because it affects how we approach our races this weekend - not going into them thinking what we can do but rather who needs to beat whom so we can get some points against the guys. If there was less mutual respect I wouldn't be too unhappy! But having put ourselves out there for these last few events, I am sure the girls want to go out and win something now. It won't make any difference if those options weren't open. For me it does affect my motivation on knowing others may get ahead and hit the breaks while I'm trying to hold back.""",0,484

"Researchers hope to learn how much it weighed, how it moved and what it used its iconic back plates for. A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones in 3D using a CT scanner at the Natural History Museum. The project is also looking into where on Earth this species was most likely to have spent time - or avoided being eaten by predators. The giant panda's muddled taxonomy means that there are more than 20 different types known today (and many others rejected over the years as inaccurate). Researchers now think they might be able to settle the matter once and for all with DNA analysis. ""It will take three months but we should get close enough,"" says Mike Archer from Oxford University's Department of Zoology, who led the study published last week in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. ""I would like us to bring the world together around just one subspecies [of pandas]."" He adds: ""They don't look alike so you wouldn't know which animal goes under your bed if you saw them both asleep side by side... We need to pin down exactly which animals belong and we hope our study shows how easy that could be done."" That subspecies name would then be applied across China, Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos, plus parts of India and Nepal, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Read next How CRISPR made genome editing mainstream How CRISPR made genome editing mainstream But even though each panda bears some similarities to other living forms, it doesn't appear to share any genetic links to another large cat called Smilodon fatalis, suggesting it evolved independently. Another possible explanation offered up recently is that the ancestors of today's giant panda were actually cheetahs, ancient felines that went extinct about 1 million years ago; the pandas then merged with another small cheetah-like creature, probably an Asiatic lion-a deep history lesson as well as a great excuse to make cute cartoons out of these beautiful creatures! Archer hopes nothing like this happens when he takes a closer look at those black spots on these white coats. They're supposed to represent areas of fur that never grew because oxygen levels were too low during hibernation. But researchers aren't sure how old they really are, nor how widespread their distribution may be... yet. What's clear is that if these spots turn out not to be true punctures after all, the giant panda's beauty problem could be getting worse faster than anyone realised.",0,487

He told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday night the number of casualties was at least 50 while about 200 houses had collapsed or partially submerged following heavy rain from Wednesday to Thursday evening. ""The bodies of those who died could not be located yet because many are stuck under mudslide debris and cannot be reached due to ongoing flooding,"" he added as quoted by Antara news agency.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red tape to earn his 11th world title. But does he have what it takes? ""It's going to be a tough fight,"" says Michael Hunter of IBF light-heavyweight champion David Haye before adding: ""I don't think anyone knows who will win."" The British press are calling him the 'new king', while others believe that Haye could become only the fourth man to hold all four major belts at once (the other three being Floyd Patterson, Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali). This month, although unproven against heavyweights, Mr Hunt believes that Haye can beat every single fighter from 160lbs upwards. And with an eye firmly fixed on the future, he sees himself as the one young hope for boxing, and Britain as its new prime breeding ground. At 6ft 2in tall with shoulders so broad they look like those of a great white shark, there may be no greater human specimen since Rocky Marciano. But Haye cannot shake off the shadow cast by his terrifyingly powerful opponent, or impress the sceptics without first proving that he is worthy of their attention. The signs were promising when the two met in September 2007 in Hamburg, where Haye won comfortably; afterwards promoter Mick Hennessy promised both fighters' careers would never again take them out of Britain. Little did either know how much trouble would follow. A year later came the split between Hennessy and Golden Boy Promotions and the ousting of Mike Tyson as Haye's trainer following reports of backstage strife over payment issues. When Olympic gold medallist Haye then fought American southpaw Paul Williams, there was talk of 'Hayemaker'. Then Ricky Hatton trained Haye in Liverpool but after the 2011 loss to Tony Bellew, which many believed should have been contested more honestly, the relationship became strained. In December 2012 HBO president Ross Greenburg announced Haye had agreed terms with Eddie Hearn and Matchroom Boxing to face fellow Englishman Anthony Joshua in London next May. Before testing themselves against each other though, Haye must prove if anything untoward happened during his training. Some observers doubt whether any problems actually occurred. But even if he proves nothing, few want Haye anywhere near a ring ever again. So why, under such pressure, did Haye choose to train in South Africa instead of closer to home? ""There aren't enough hours in the day!"" he explains. Officially, according to rules set by World Boxing Organisation regulations, Haye needs six weeks minimum in order to undergo sufficient pre-fight preparation given that he weighs 18st 8lb for his 132lb limit. His camp remains tightlipped about just how long Haye stayed down there, and whether he received legal advice. Nevertheless, he insists he spent seven months there learning Afrikaans - something that took separate sessions twice a week for ten days apiece. ""This is my country now!"" says a relaxed Haye, wearing a black T-shirt bearing the slogan 'The People Can Do It Again', obviously referring to apartheid. ""We're talking about getting together people here [Britain] to change things around and show everyone we've got some fantastic talent. There has always been bad blood between us and America and the rest of Europe. What's happening in this country right now shows we can do better than that."" Talks with Danny McGuigan, the former heavyweight challenger whom Haye defeated to claim the IBO belt back in 1998, revealed that ""South African boxing wasn't very good until recently."" Yet Haye claims he had no problem dealing with the language barrier because he speaks German fluently thanks to his mother taking him along to visit relatives in Germany early on in life. He also learnt Spanish in school, and Chinese at university. ""They say you need 10 years of experience to learn a second language properly,"" says Haye, revealing everything from repeated attempts to study French grammar to having difficulty pronouncing certain vowels correctly. But his linguistic ability belies the fact that Haye lived outside England for almost nine years, growing up initially in Zurich, Switzerland, and moving to Munich where he attended school. Losing sight of his roots, however, is hardly an excuse. As his coach Chris Johnson states emphatically: ""David grew up listening to music sung in Jamaican patois so he understands English well enough to cross borders."" Being English may help explain why Haye decided to stay in South Africa rather than return to live in Yorkshire - a place he hasn't seen for 17 years. Why spend vast sums of money travelling back across London Heathrow Airport simply to drive 15 miles eastwards into Leeds rather than plan ahead so as not to waste time and burn fossil fuel?

But it's very different for those in healthcare professions - so how do employers ensure that staff keep doing essential jobs when social distancing measures mean everyone should be staying away? What happens if I don't feel well enough to work from home? In many cases your boss cannot make any changes without first seeking approval from the national health service's lead clinician who advises them about what is safe for employees. They would examine your symptoms such as fever, headache, sore throat, cough etc., and advise whether this could reasonably contribute towards coronavirus infection. If there was consensus between both parties they might say you may continue to attend some part-time duties while maintaining some distance during breaks from colleagues. It depends entirely on individual circumstances but if you think you're feeling unwell if possible you should consult with your manager early on. Your supervisor may then decide which kind of workplace arrangement best suits you and therefore your organisation. This means either coming into the office every day or having shifts where one member of management covers another worker's shift remotely. And these options vary greatly depending on the task being performed. Some organisations provide video calls, or even hire virtual private assistants, to cover tasks like taking orders over Skype or using email. Others use cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Teams to allow remote team meetings and communication. Workers in manufacturing plants often remain at home because machinery requires human input; others carry out administrative roles behind closed doors at head offices. Ultimately though, unless you have a particular reason to worry about infecting other individuals around you, or yourself becoming seriously ill or dying, you probably shouldn't let coronavirus stop you working. Have my terms and conditions changed under COVID-19? There were widespread concerns after lockdown began that companies would try to squeeze workers' pay packets hard. Instead firms seem to be going in exactly the opposite direction by paying new sums to existing staff members. ""We've seen a lot of businesses contacting us now requesting 40 wage increases,"" says Rob Harding, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. However he observes that only 10 of his membership see significant salary hikes currently despite the fact 60 believe business activity has decreased. That means only half of British managers expect any increase in wages after Easter holiday season. So why is this happening? Employers are concerned their current workforce numbers won't meet demand once restrictions lift. For example, many call centres operate two eight hour shifts instead of four six hour ones so they need twice the number of employees. Although sectors like retail and hospitality aren't struggling as much, big supermarkets and pubs face similar challenges. In theory, this should reduce pressure on food banks and support services. There has also been speculation some businesses have opted to give bonuses instead of pay rises because they want to avoid potential complaints before lockdowns end. Finally, unemployment levels are rising. Most employment agencies suggest receiving an offer to join a company in March had historically resulted in longer-term hires and higher salaries. Now employers want to fill vacancies quickly in order to minimise disruption caused by mass redundancies later. So we'll likely see large industries like construction require fewer people leading to smaller payouts per employee. However, some businesses find themselves competing against each other for talent. Since the start of 2020 there has been almost 50 year-on-year growth across recruitment consultancy firm Russell Roberts Co.'s international clients. Mr Harding believes more firms may choose to take advantage of skills shortages by offering less money in exchange for keeping talented staff within their operations. When asked if she felt her monthly income had increased due to coronavirus, Julie Eaton, chief executive of the Civil Service Workers Union, replied that she found herself spending 70 more per month on groceries. She added that her husband received reduced pension payments and claimed benefits have gone up. Her union claims 250 civil servants who lost their job due to Covid 19 deserve financial help as temporary contracts expired. The pension scheme will ask a minimum of 13 weeks of notice compared to 30 days before and the total remuneration cut will amount to 2.4. Ms Eaton told the BBC that not knowing whether its members would receive backpay meant members had no choice but to beg bosses for additional time off to sort things out beforehand. If successful they'd get paid retroactively but it involves lots of paperwork and witnesses appearing at tribunal hearings. Not everybody wants to wait until they lose their entire retirement anyway as people with family safety there. The survey results show something else Getting nowhere ichttp: chasetypchatter !",0,501

"On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at North Middlesex University Hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the London hospital were also not equipped with enough stretchers and failed to meet minimum standards in 14 areas of patient care between 2014-2015, according to an internal review published on Wednesday. The investigation found that NHS England had ""not taken sufficient action"" despite repeated warnings since 2015 about failings across several wards, including inadequate food service facilities and lack of staff training. NHS Improvement is conducting its own independent inquiry into whether or not any failures led to deaths resulting from the management of malnutrition at the hospital. Last year reported cases from AE departments rose once again after two years of decline following government reforms aimed at slashing waiting times and improving safety. There are now 48 days of average wait time in England for emergency treatment, up 0.2 compared with last week, official figures showed. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb has called for urgent action to cut further delays as he warned hospitals faced summer pressures due to rising demand.

"Sentinel-1b was carried into orbit by a Soyuz rocket that flew out of Sinamary in French Guiana. The new platform will monitor shipping lanes for pollution and icebergs, and survey the planet's ice sheets. China has successfully launched its first geostationary satellite from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center near Beijing, marking another step toward realizing President Xi Jinping's ambition to make China an advanced space power. The Shenzhou 10 spacecraft lifted off at 0643 GMT on Wednesday (11:43 p.m. EDT Tuesday) atop one of four newly upgraded Long March rockets mounted next to each other inside a cavernous launch pad, according to Xinhua News Agency, which cited unnamed sources with ties to the project as characterizing it as ""a success."" A Chinese fighter jet rumbled overhead like thunder during takeoff, launching smoke trails that rose up more than 2 miles before dissipating above what appeared to be a blue sky - typical weather conditions at nearly 43 degrees north latitude. Xinhau said live transmissions showed the crew capsule separating from the third stage booster about two minutes after liftoff, then maneuvering itself away from the second stage portion of the rocket and beginning its ascent toward Earth. It is expected to reach orbital parameters around 6 hours later when it circles Earth once every 90 minutes, reaching its final target location some 80 nautical miles east-northeast of Madagascar early Thursday morning local time. The satellite is designed primarily to observe land masses and study ocean currents, but also carries equipment capable of monitoring air quality, mapping volcanic activity and tracking forest fires. Its extremely high resolution camera can capture images three times sharper than existing spy satellites, allowing scientists to pinpoint mineral deposits within deep mines and oil fields and identify areas threatened by landslides or hurricanes. And because it monitors both day and night, ""it provides significantly expanded coverage of the world,"" said Thomas Ashby, director of DARPA's Space Systems Office. Shenzhou 9 completed China's longest manned mission last year when astronaut Wang Yaping blasted off aboard the Tiangong 1 module and landed safely back home after spending 15 days aboard the seven-story laboratory module orbiting 220 miles over southern China. It marked the fourth long journey performed exclusively by astronauts propelled through open skies by their own small rockets since 2003. Chinese space officials confirmed this week they have launched a ground control station in Tibet using radio frequencies reserved for civilian use. This means commercial satellite payload operators may soon begin transmitting their signals directly to a GCS, offering greater flexibility in scheduling launches than previously envisioned under regulations put in place following the 2011 collision between a Russian cargo ship and a pair of Iridium Comsat communications satellites. ""This could potentially revolutionize the way we operate our [ground stations],"" said Peter Binkley, chief executive officer of Secure World Foundation, based outside Washington D.C., adding his organization is spearheading efforts to bring such technologies to market. With this system, there are no restrictions on how the operator utilizes the spectrum used for controlled military operations, he noted. If the regulator won't allow access for commercial interests, then private industry will need to take matters into their own hands. They will likely do so by selling the capability themselves rather than handing licensed frequency bands over to government entities, he added. There had been speculation that Russia might add SSTO capabilities to future missions to help protect against further mishaps between commercial assets and military hardware. But Yuri Koptev, deputy head of Roscosmos' State Committee for Remote Control Technology Development told reporters earlier this month that this would not happen until 2018. In addition to regular flights, Roscomos plans a series dedicated solely to the development of SSTOs, including a prospective flight test program scheduled for 2017. By then, improvements should permit crews to fly several hundred sorties per year. A Russian Defense Ministry source insisted today that Moscow did not authorize drones to carry the bombs dropped on Syria and accused U.N. inspectors there of compiling false data suggesting otherwise. ""We didn't give them permission to drop weapons anywhere they wanted in Syrian territory; even their allegation that we gave them authorization is completely wrong,"" General Sergei Rudskoy, spokesman for the ministry's Main Operations Directorate, declared during an interview published by state news agency RIA Novosti and broadcast live on television Monday evening. Rudskoy went on to say the bombing runs were conducted without any prior notice from headquarters and that Russia only learned of the attacks via Google alerts sent to missile defense staff members. ""They don't know who we're talking to... We are absolutely sure that all the information received during this attack came straight from Damascus and Baghdad,"" Rudskoy noted. Senior Pentagon leaders warned Congress yesterday that potential adversaries will exploit changes made to US law governing ballistic missiles if those revisions are approved by lawmakers.

"Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's programme was pushed through without debate, according to parliamentary speaker Salim al-Juburi.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son is the first member of the UK Royal family to have his first birthday marked by a new coin. The third in line for the throne Prince George has been given a 1 commemorative piece that will be issued alongside other Commonwealth countries including New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Prince William said it was an ""important moment"" as he handed over the coins at Buckingham Palace on Monday after they were produced by Edinburgh Mint Ltd. Charles' wife Camilla Parker-Bowles stood beside her husband watching as Prince Harry gave away FITZCARLOUGH ROBERT ILLUMINATOR COINS 2017 from their home in Kensington Palace. So far five of that year's issues - featuring portraits of Queen Elizabeth II (shown here) and Princess Anne - are set to go into circulation next week. Britain has already launched its own one-penny silver commemorative issue but this could become the first of second class coins struck for use outside mainland Europe. The royal couple also received two gold sovereigns worth 5 each which show images connected with their charity work. It comes after the Bank of England revealed last month that more than four out of 10 people had never heard of the oldest functioning banknote still in British hands - known officially as the Great Sovereign. In total 104 million copies exist ranging from fives through tens and twos up to 20 pounds. Most are kept out of general circulation and can fetch thousands when released onto the market. William called them ""an important milestone"" adding: ""I am very proud that we decided that our sons would start celebrating their birthdays with these special moments. They reflect not only all the amazing things they do throughout the year but how much they really mean to so many people. ""It is especially wonderful because they both share such strong links back to Scotland where they were born. We hope others across the world enjoy their unique stories."" Many experts say the current value of the new pound coin could increase sharply if collectors bid for individual pieces, following similar sales involving some US statesmen's currency. One expert told Sky News in March there was no limit as no banknotes or coins currently existed bearing any living monarch's likeness. It means that collectors must find a minting error to justify buying a particular version rather than simply paying homage to an image. Last week Carole Aldridge paid about 3,000 for a 50 pence Scottish 'First Class Empire' stamp marking the bicentenary of the Union between England, Wales and Scotland in 1707.

Nobody knows whether my money is going to make me rich."" The Falkland Islands is another land to mark the occasion today (see main story). A study by Legal General research centre says 90 per cent of Brits know little about their country - compared with 85 per cent who acknowledge knowing nothing about Spain. And while 81 per cent recognise the name Malta as belonging to Switzerland, just 9 per cent could correctly identify Argentina as part of South America, according to the poll of 1,005 adults carried out in April. Despite being less well known than some European nations, most Britons regard themselves as having good knowledge of their nation. But even among those claiming to possess the greatest levels of insight, most cannot locate Gibraltar within Europe (60), Northern Ireland (56) or Cornwall (42). Only 36 could point out the Isle of Man, 30 knew Madeira was near Portugal, 28 thought London was situated west of Paris, and 26 thought Cyprus lay south of Istanbul. More than six-in-ten commonwealth citizens claimed to have no idea what any of those places meant.

"To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat at. Yet England have just managed it - because their fielders were brilliant all day. Not only did they keep wickets like confetti when India's top four batsmen lasted less than ten overs each between them, but also kept three catches out of five before tea on an absolutely gorgeous morning at Old Trafford. It was glorious cricket from start to finish for Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer and Liam Plunkett as well as full resistance by Jos Buttler. And that includes those two drinks breaks, which are making me hungry already! They even had James Anderson weedy enough to help Sam Curran through his first over with a fine catch off MS Dhoni at slip. But he wasn't necessary after that. So once again I repeat my plea: don't take your eyes off these guys during this World Cup until someone else has won it. Here's why... 1) The man who started things rolling properly After being dropped due to fitness issues earlier in the summer, Ben Stokes returned to form so spectacularly against Sri Lanka last week it almost felt like he'd never been gone. If there was ever an obvious selection call about whom should open alongside Joe Root or indeed score a century then it came here. When they did eventually go in together, it turned into the breakthrough partnership of the tournament. They added 110 runs in 44 balls and looked every inch deserving of their status as leading men in English cricket. Not bad for a 40-year old moustachioed veteran who hasn't scored 300 runs since 2016. But wait, what if you combine Stokes' opening stand with the second half of Root and Cook? Well then this would look something really special. In fact it does. For starters, it means a team comprising of no fewer than seven players averaging 30 across 10 innings is now 29 above average (and counting up). Secondly, it means England haven't lost a single match since they took the urn nearly 18 months ago despite batting through most days without anyone quite hitting 100, apart perhaps from Ian Bell (who doesn't count because he didn't play). Thirdly, it suggests under 900 people are currently celebrating victories in front rooms across our country. Fourthly, it makes us not want to burst Barry Cryer's balloon right now. Fifthly, it means whoever wins the toss will probably win the game too. Sixthly, it might mean England can actually become top dog in 2020 rather than 2019. Seventhly, it's great news for Adam Lyth. Eighthly, it reminds everyone how good pace bowling looks at night. Ninthly, somebody needs to polish up this laptop keyboard very soon. Tenthly and finally, the best bit of all time. Eleventhly. Woah. Alright matey. Calm down. We're still in contention. You've done nothing wrong. Relax. Take a breath. Stop smiling like some deranged idiot at your phone screen. Just calm down. Let that sink in. OK cool. Now say it out loud. ""I'm enjoying watching England beat Australia."" Yes, yes, good. That feels better. 2) This guy made sure a few other bloopers went missing OK, he isn't in charge of umpiring obviously but Mohammed Shami shoulders much blame for allowing Dawid Malan to carry on playing while fielding back at square leg instead of sending him back to the pavilion straightaway. After the decision goes against his bowlers, the Indians come back equally riled, offering little clue otherwise but plenty of verbal fisticuffs afterwards. Then along comes Adil Rashid or Tom Curran delivering a dig to one of the Indian fielders to make things worse. He could have picked either bowler to send after Malan. Either way it was poor judgement. When Matt Prior failed to apply pressure to a dead ball, it meant Jasprit Bumrah got rid of loose change and struck a blow for freedom not available elsewhere in international cricket. Fourteen minutes later another unplayable delivery ended India's hopes of taking 20 wickets - leaving both sides heading into lunch having taken 23 apiece. All this despite the generous set piece fielding, especially from Zakrul Islam who gleefully celebrated getting run out by plucking stray stumps left lying around outside India's crease. Even though he hadn't needed to step outside the boundary line, he'd clearly enjoyed himself immensely judging by his grin. At least England weren't involved in the same controversy. Perhaps Pakistan are still paying reparations. The strictest of punishments In the previous Ashes series South Africa refused to appeal a penalty awarded to David Warner for a non-striking visual obscenity directed towards Ravindra Jadeja.

"Revised growth estimates now suggest the construction industry shrank in the first quarter of 2012, but by less than previously thought. Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean that overall housing activity grew for a third straight year. But it could also point toward more pain ahead, as some builders are already slashing jobs and sales have started to slow down again."" The most prominent sign is this: The Case-Shiller national home price index fell 1.7 percent on an annualized basis from January through March its steepest quarterly decline since late 2008 (see chart). That was right before the financial crisis hit. This time around, however, nearly every other major measure of existing home prices has either leveled off or turned up slightly in recent months. It's hard not to wonder if we're about to see another wave of foreclosures ripple out into the broader economy. So far, though, mortgage rates remain low relative to historical averages. That means people who might otherwise have been forced into foreclosure will still have plenty of liquidity with which to pay their mortgages."" What makes the story even better for those looking at the long run (and what I suspect should appeal quite well to you) is that the economic foundations upon which all these housebuyers are building their homes are actually starting to turn stable over here: employment, personal debt levels, consumer confidence, etcetera.""",0,522
"In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the city's powerful tycoon bosses. On 15 December last year, Kwok left an election rally for his party after he was attacked by another pro-democracy activist Jaspal Singh Shergill who had been heckling him all day at polling stations across southern China. Mr Shergill claimed Mr Kwok ""hit me with both fists"" on the head. A photo taken shortly afterwards showed blood pouring from Mr Kwok's face onto the floor as other supporters surrounded him. Two days later, it emerged that Mr Kwok suffered damaged tendons in his right arm following the assault. The incident caused outrage among many voters and ignited calls for tougher action to be taken against abusive behaviour - but also drew ridicule when some took to social media claiming he ""won"" the fight because it happened before voting began. The claim spread widely despite no evidence being presented that suggested this was true. By April, Mr Kwok said he would not contest any more elections as well as stepping down from politics altogether. But then, just weeks later, Mr Kwok announced he would take part in protests planned for 1 June calling on Beijing to allow direct democracy in Hong Kong. He insisted his decision wasn't driven by electoral gains or loss, saying: ""I have always believed you should do what you think is fair and right."" Two and a half years since Occupy Central first occupied key thoroughfares, including Mong Kok street, Sha Tin road and Chater Garden Place, the movement remains defiantly alive in opposition to current Chinese rule over Hong Kong. Despite repeated arrests, mass rallies, violent clashes between protesters and police, and even attacks on mainland visitors visiting the former British colony, activists continue their protest each weekend without fail, refusing to halt until they achieve universal suffrage as promised under Article 23 of its mini-constitution known as 'One Country'. Last week, hundreds braved heavy rain and strong winds to gather outside government headquarters chanting anti-China slogans. On Saturday morning, Police deployed water cannon trucks aiming at thousands of demonstrators which forced them back into nearby streets. Dozens were arrested at the scene while riot officers in full body armour tried to prevent people entering building sites close to where construction work continues unabated. It came after fresh waves of tear gas used on Friday night forced thousands out of shopping malls and sent scores injured to hospital. Thousands gathered again yesterday afternoon outside the central government offices to denounce security forces' violence towards peaceful protesters. Riot squads armed with pepper spray, baton charges and rubber bullets fired directly at crowds. At least 58 people were wounded during scuffles with police around noon as they advanced through the crowd using force to disperse protesters blocking roads and vandalising buildings. Scores appeared badly beaten up as ambulances rushed dozens away from the area. Among those carried off on stretchers included three women aged 18, 31 and 49 from different parts of the city.

Hundreds still remained on Sunday evening marching from Admiralty MTR station to Cheung Chau Ho Luk Industrial Estate next door to Shenzhen Bay Port terminal demanding justice for the elderly woman killed there recently. Protesters set fire to Tsim Sha Tsui East promenade and four major public parks in Central District, causing a massive traffic jam that extended along Nathan Road. Some threw petrol bombs inside supermarkets like New World First Link Mart Ltd and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. Several shops attached to bus stops near Admiralty Stock Exchange, south shore of Victoria Harbour and Shau Keong Street were burned. Burning tyres covered roads around Connaught Drive, Shek Tong Tsui St Nicholas Church, Mochtar Park, Tseung Koo Building, Yee Wo House and Horizon Plaza Shopping Centre. Others smashed glass windows and hoardings in front of banks and high rise apartments around Causeway Bay such as Soho commercial districts and Standard Chartered Bank branch. Armed men dressed in black adopted North Face jackets carrying US flag flags stormed Tai Hang Centre and Cityplaza mall owned by Swire Group Holdings Limited. They climbed atop escalators, tore apart tarpaulin covers covering lifts, broke tiles and smashed mirrors.

"A 25-year-old woman testified that Larry Nassar molested her from the age of six until 12 during family visits to his Michigan home. Mr Nassar, 53, is accused by more than 200 accusers of sexually abusing girls and women under the guise of medical treatment while working for USA Gymnastics (USAG) and MSU The gymnast said he needed to show off his skills in order to gain access to vulnerable teenage girls. She said an assistant coach told her it was 'not appropriate' when she changed into a tutu on one occasion but did not specify who made this comment. 'He started touching me inappropriately with my clothing on,' the athlete wrote in a letter published by The Detroit News. Laisy Serfaty, now 24, says she grew up being abused at Team USA Gymnastics training camps under the watchful eye of former head coaches Tim Daggett and Matt Monahan. ""I am speaking out because I feel it's time to come forward and stand against those men for their crimes,"" she said. ""It has taken years for these memories to surface as they are buried deep within my mind. ""As much as I want justice, what I really wish is that all of these victims could be together so we can heal - physically, emotionally, mentally."" Ms Serfaty detailed how Mr Nassar first began coming around after she moved in next door to him and his wife Karolyi Katherine at an apartment complex in Huntsville, Alabama in 1995. During her early years living near them, Ms Serfaty would go over there to swim or hang out in their pool before going back to her own house to learn routines. It wasn't long before the abuse began. Up to three times per week, Mr Nassar allegedly touched her breasts using both hands, without any warning and often with no explanation why. At other times, he tried to kiss her and touched her vagina through underwear. He also showed interest in performing oral sex on her but stopped once his hand slipped and penetrated her mouth instead. In high school, female friends were subjected to similar behaviour by Mr Nassar. One recalled seeing him massage another girl's chest while taking notes. Another friend claimed Mr Nassar asked if he could see her bare breasts even though he already knew where she kept hers. On numerous occasions too the parents were unaware about the alleged assaults. Michael Gilday, then 30, recalls having lunch with his girlfriend Michelle Greig outside the Madison High School cafeteria at least twice every week between 1998 and 1999. Both believed Mr Nassar had been called away for some reason although one thought he might have left work due to sexual harassment allegations. ""We always joked that 'Larry forgot something, said Mr Gilday. Although none of the two young people ever saw anything untoward, over the following months Mr Nassar would begin behaving strangely towards each of them. Initially, Ms Greig was targeted first. And although she didn't think anything improper happened at first, she soon noticed the doctor becoming increasingly distant despite spending most nights with her boyfriend. Then came the third victim. After returning from cheerleading practice at 10pm and hearing nothing unusual downstairs, 16-year-old Aubrey Edwards decided to get ready for bed upstairs in her room. Moments later, her father knocked down the stairs asking to use her phone charger since theirs had gone dead earlier. When she got there the light went on inside and she heard it ringing. ""My dad stepped aside and let me answer,"" the teen explained. As well as calling several numbers, the caller asked if she wanted to meet someone. Eventually, Ms Edwards agreed to meet the man in the bedroom. Once alone with him, she alleges the doctor offered to pay her 200 (130; 150 euros). However, she refused, believing that if he actually paid money then he must pry himself off the floor. Instead, according to her testimony, Mr Nassar turned on the shower and sat naked beside her, telling her to do the same. Before long, he unzipped his pants leading to further tensions which escalated over the course of nearly seven hours. But rather than just grab her legs and force her closer, as many child molesters have done in past cases, he started massaging her inner thighs causing her stress level to rise. Later still, after insisting she turn around, the abuse continued. ""There were four and half minutes of pure torture for me to endure,"" Ms Edwards added, noting she felt unable to escape for fear of leaving the bathroom with him waiting on the landing. Finally, after a final hour plus of confusion and uncertainty, the ordeal ended. ""When [the] conversation finished, everything became silent - silence except for only myself breathing,"" she stated. ""And then I cried..."" For 13 days afterwards, the teenager remained scared but insisted she'd never talk about what had occurred simply because she feared repercussions like being labelled a liar by local authorities due to only reporting the incident months after its conclusion.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The 20-year-old told BBC Sport he is motivated by trophies not money after rejecting a PS100,000-a-week contract. ""Liverpool are one of the biggest clubs in England - they have some great players and won two titles so I thought to myself 'what am I doing here? said Fabio. He has scored 16 goals for his country ""I'm joking about that,"" Fabio added when asked if it was true. ""That's because England don't pay me anything but there are many other reasons why Liverpool wanted to sign me."" To put things into perspective: how much do you get paid at your job? 15k per week, say. How does that compare with what you earn from football? Well according to Fabio - who earns around half as much per game as Roy Hodgson's side pocketed last season - you might be better off playing than working. And that is just another reason to applaud him. Without further ado then, let us begin our journey through Fabio... Wednesday brings an interview with Fabi Felipe Silva Bandeira de Mello dos Santos Junior yet the first thing we heard when we called back concerned such a name. A quick Google search revealed that yes, indeed, the Brazilian midfielder had been made up at birth rather than being born 19 years ago, and that meant, among other things, a change of surname. So could anyone care less? No chance! We'd all like to think ourselves a bit special. Or even more importantly, did any of us really believe something would come out that didn't add up or make sense? Maybe. After all, sometimes our best intentions go awry. But no matter - slowly but surely we worked out in which direction were the answers and soon enough we ended up talking football. It wasn't long before a discussion came along about life, family, friendship and love became paramount to everything else. You see, Fabio played professionally since the age of 14, starting out in Brazil where he spent four years until 2012. In 2011 he joined Flamengo, winning three scudetto (Brazilian league) crowns during his time there. In 2013 he moved south to Italy where he earned himself a move to AC Milan, spending six months there. Since moving to Europe, however, he hasn't quite found his feet; instead finding himself in Liverpool's reserves team for their pre-season tour down under. As recently as July 2015, Silvino Lobbo tweeted that Fabio wouldn't play again for the Reds despite featuring in their friendly against Melbourne Victory earlier this year. Such news must've hit Silvino hard given that Liverpool went on to win both games. An original chance missed doesn't seem too big a deal though. What followed next? Six months later, now 23, Silvino's tweet read: ""Fabu [sic] will start training Monday 18 August."" That started us thinking. Could this be true? Is this finally going to happen? And most intriguingly perhaps - could this latest revelation actually lead somewhere good? After all, here's someone who grew up without a father and only got to know him as an adult. And right now, that man happens to pick up a ball every day and want nothing more than to impress people. For instance, he made headlines when he turned down a lucrative offer to join Liga MX club Pachuca after already having rejected ""seven contracts"" from various sides across South America and the Far East. Not only that but a recent appearance at a Neymar charity event also saw stories circulating regarding Fabio's ""offer sheet"" of 300m (265m). Take those two pieces of information together and it becomes clear that this story isn't simply idle talk nor some kind of marketing ploy aimed at getting new fans - especially younger ones. This appears genuine. While still officially unsigned (the earliest possible date for signing is expected to be September 1), the player clearly seems comfortable with the situation and his manager Brendan Rodgers is evidently keen on bringing the young talent to Anfield. Hence the decision to discuss life, family, friends, love et al while trying to follow a football pitch. That caught my attention straight away. Liverpool are famed for having a close-knit squad and close bond between them. At times, even relationships become strained, as seen during Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge's fight last summer. Yet the fact remains that they hang together. Whether its Rodger's tactical philosophy demanding high pressing and defensive compactness, Steven Gerrard's leadership qualities, Jordon Henderson's aerial prowess, Martin Skrtel holding strong, Jordan Henderson performing above expectation - the list goes on. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule - such as Philippe Coutinho leaving amid rumours of angst over lack of form, Adam Lallana and Emre Can losing respect due to perceived transfer interests - but these appear rarer than may initially suggest. Some fans argue it gives rise to jealousy, pettiness and resentment among others attempting to sneak into the inner top eul neither. What comes on,. A lot. By is; it says A ages.)

"The 27-year-old still had two years left on his existing deal but he has now committed himself to New Road for another season. He is the ninth player in five seasons who has signed a contract extension and it may be that the club saw this as an opportunity to strengthen their squad further before next summer's transfer window opens at 11pm on Wednesday night and, perhaps more importantly from Sam Allardyce's perspective, they have moved him away from the Premier League so no new fees will need to go towards releasing players. Meanwhile Ashley Young could return to Aston Villa after West Ham had only just landed Alex Song when Sky Sports News revealed there was interest once again in signing the winger.

"Police were called to Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, after he was found unresponsive on Tuesday. The American had to be driven to hospital because he was too tall and heavy for the paramedics who arrived first at 2:11pm local time He is believed to have been a regular customer of Madam Suzie Sun's (above) sex club in Las Vegas which had a number of celebrities as clients including Mike Tyson, David Copperfield and Pamela Anderson Superstars like Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and ex-girlfriend Britney Spears are all said to frequent the hot tub wearing only their underwear while sunbathing naked with girls who work there - according to new reports Several women recently told MailOnline that they would do anything - even having sex with strange men - if it meant working at one of the two famous US bordellos in Sin City. A Las Vegas woman claims she will sleep with anyone for free, adding that some customers pay her money to keep quiet about what goes on inside the notorious 'Love' mansion on Madames Road. The young beauty sleeps around town but has no qualms about doing it when a stranger approaches her. She tells us: 'I am not good looking so I never turn people down.' She says all kinds of weird things happen before the hook up: One man politely asked her out by saying 'Oh my God! You're beautiful!' He then followed her into another room demanding more details. Another paid her 800 cash just to talk to him. But nothing shocked our escort more than a male client storming through the door barefoot and covered in blood. Her jaw dropped open and she thought he must've hit his head. No amount of preparation could prepare this 22 year old woman for such an experience. Sex workers routinely told me how easy it is to get into the lifestyle. They say some guys sign up expecting to meet lots of gorgeous models and instead end up sleeping with someone ugly and overweight. Sometimes they ask the girl's age - most don't want any underage prostitutes as part of their package. And they usually prefer older women. Most escorts expect to earn between 100-300 per hour plus tips from clients. Just five minutes away from the heart of downtown Vegas lies the fabled strip also known as Madame Suzie's (pictured above). It purports to offer sexual gratification on 14 acres complete with luxury apartments where guests can take advantage of everything; showers, saunas, group spa sessions, pools and sexy maids waiting at your beck and call. A little further along are two other brothels located in the Gold Park area surrounded by business parks, golf courses and hotels. These establishments boast prices starting from 375 dollars. Run by entrepreneur Hugh Hefner (right), they share a common theme - dirt cheap erotic encounters promised by statuesque beauties whose big breasts, bouncy buttocks and long legs make them look completely artificial yet seem perfectly real. What happens behind closed doors is something else entirely, however... According to locals many prominent politicians visit both places regularly. Some of those seen visiting are former President Bill Clinton, singer Lionel Richie, football star OJ Simpson and comedian Dennis Miller. Politicians aren't the only ones queuing up outside Love or the neighboring Paradise Inn. Many tourists who have visited once already become regulars themselves, paying outrageous fees between dollars for the chance to return again and again. Even though they're within walking distance of each other, there is still a huge queue. All three clubs tell visitors they cater exclusively to married couples and ladies over 21 years of age. While there is zero evidence suggesting prostitution occurs here illegally, several women we spoke to came forward claiming it does exist and that its rich patrons dictate terms that include renting the whole apartment to these independent contractors or asking them to perform body shots. If a customer likes you enough they might invite you back to continue getting intimate later. This used to be the case until recent times when Hefner fired hundreds of employees and turned his operation into a low key adult entertainment company handing out coupons for discounts. However, due to extensive media coverage surrounding legal issues involving the brothels especially since October 2012 there has now been a dramatic rise in demand which appears to correlate with increased advertising campaigns for the brothels. Two new billboards appeared near the highway 10 days ago boasting of 1 million dollar packages coming soon. When reached for comment by Mail Online none of the companies listed claimed to provide illegal services. Instead, they issued general statements about making money legally and keeping families happy at home. Police officers sometimes come by to check IDs, but otherwise rarely bother to inquire about whether a person is soliciting sex or whether any rules are being broken. In November last year, a female prostitute secretly took video footage showing Bill Clinton arriving at the brothel accompanied by alleged gay lover Mark Wahlberg. The following day police raided the place and arrested the pair for lewd conduct and battery. Despite the controversy surrounding the establishment causing such widespread publicity, some experts believe that the demand for prostitution under the great transition occurs twice every quarter-reservations point setter maternelity?naterianara",0,530
"Some reports put the number even higher. The roof of the church caved in on worshippers who had gathered for the ordination of a bishop on Saturday. Those inside the building suffered injuries, including trauma to their heads and hands from broken glass. The cathedral is one of several churches damaged by heavy rains over seven days that has triggered fears about infrastructure following Hurricane Matthew's path across the Caribbean nation earlier this month. Fears have increased after government officials said Tuesday evening there were no deaths or casualties because people either evacuated before the storm hit or took shelter when it passed through. An estimated 250 000 residents fled as the hurricane made landfall just south-west of Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince early Friday morning. They are now living with friends and relatives. Churches also played an important role during times of crisis. There was a time not so long ago where they would be packed full of parishioners and residents showing up to pray.

"Media playback is unsupported on your device 5 February 2014 Last updated at 08:46 GMT White lions are very rare - their zoo keeper thinks there's only around 90 of them left in the wild The two white male lions, called Maka and Buhlezi, were born to a mixed-breed mother. Both have one African lion parent, but neither has an Indian ancestor in its family tree. And according to Dr Sibanda they have no close relatives either. He believes that this makes these animals unique. ""This pair could be considered as being from nowhere,"" he says. An image taken by conservationist Mike Fay shows what appears to be stillborn cubs lying alongside their dying mother in Kruger National Park in South Africa In 2003, when the female died, her mates tried for four years before breeding again, finally producing a son called Shani. But because his coat was so unusual it was clear which side of the river he came from. The other male is apparently descended from a large pride where males carry themselves like royalty with long manes down to the ground and huge curved ear tufts above the ears. They make up about 2 of all big cats alive today. While many zoos keep lions, none hold those who live solely outside human captivity. These are legally classified as vermin under section 44 of the principal Act (Zimbabwe) or Schedule 1 (South Africa). This means that any person caught catching, keeping or possessing them can face fines or imprisonment between three months and five years. The two white males could now spend the rest of their lives behind bars if found. Their fate rests in the hands of the Eastern Cape High Court next month. Until then, though, the population of black and brown leopards, cheetahs and caracals will suffer while the world waits to see whether some enterprising wildlife trafficker illegally smuggles the pair out of South Africa to somewhere without laws against owning exotic species such as tigers or elephants. It is illegal to own endangered wildlife, even dead ones Dr Peter Walsh Wildlife trade expert Dr Michael Savidge Conservation watchdog Global Wildlife Conservation explains how laws to stop people trafficking in rhinos, elephants and pangolins, fail to work If convicted, the owner faces fines of 200,000 rand (13,500; 23,600), plus court costs. So far nobody knows exactly why the two lions were bred together. One theory put forward is that there might have been genetic reasons. In India there may well have been the opposite problem. Since 1993 various animal rights activists have allegedly killed hundreds of captive Asiatic lions near Kanha Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh state, including 13 in 2011 alone. At least 50 more are thought to exist in neighbouring Haryana State. Many believe these killings are motivated by anti-captivity feelings that have led in part to restrictions placed on the ownership of lions. Under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List system, listed as ""endangered,"" the number of Asian lion populations worldwide stands at just 740 - less than half their original size. A further concern is that wealthy trophy hunters, most notably from China, buy captive lots of smaller numbers of lions and use them for hunting purposes.

"Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness. He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary in Morecambe Bay He was born the son of Christine (Doncaster) and Robert William Ballon (Liverpool), who left him when he was four years old to work as an office clerk for Long Products Ltd. His mother subsequently had three further children from another relationship but they were not brought up with seniority or affection. She married again, this time to John Metcalfe, leaving Miss Ballon's two sons alone in her parents' house until she found suitable foster homes. Mr Spector becomes the brotherhood president after former leader Donald Taylor stepped down last month. Their father died when Jeff was aged nine so it is speculated that it may have been then that the change took place in his attitude towards women. The first woman he ever kissed was at school during PE lessons - Littlehampton High School, West Sussex; the first girl he dated since leaving home was to be the wife of his best friend, Alan MacLellan (see below). They got engaged at Christmas 1961 and had their wedding reception later that year. A few months previously, his stepmother told him she would never see him again if he persisted in marrying outside of Liverpool. 'I'm glad I did,' said Mr Spector, laughing heartily. The bridegroom opened the door into Mrs Appleby's flat and looked round uncertainly. Ken Appleby: Mastermind behind the success of one of Britain's biggest car companies. This was where all young men went. There lay the beautiful girls, some already dressed, others still wearing clothes removed hastily from the suitcase waiting in the bedroom next door. In front of them stood Miss Appleby herself, a tall blonde with blue eyes. Her smile lit up the room like sunshine, enveloping each member of her party on a wave of warmth. When your happiness is tested it shows itself through smiles rather than tears, thought Mr Spector, smiling back. Outside, traffic moved sluggishly along the seafront road. Inside the dew glistened gently over the snow white carpeting. On the walls hung photographs showing the English seaside resorts which Dr Kenneth Warren Spector and Audrey Martin Hunter were going to visit in 1964. To start with everything seemed perfect... But soon there began to creep across his mind thoughts about home and childhood memories. Could love really endure apart from earthly ties? What was underneath those facades? Could he survive without his good name? For example, how long could Alan cope in London living for himself and finding no trace of anyone called Anthony Enright? How many times must he spend holidays here, saying nothing more than 'I'll try!' All these questions ran through his head like whirling wheels locked together with their own momentum. Finally, he reached out blindly in search of the telephone number of the hotel. It appeared just above the bedside table and within moments his lawyer had confirmed his identity as well as what lay ahead. Tomorrow morning he would make the big decision. By 5pm, however, fate intervened. Returning to sleep afterwards, Jeff suddenly awoke to hear someone sobbing uncontrollably beside him. Reaching out instinctively he put his arms around her and held her close against him. From that moment onwards his life changed radically. No longer was he merely part of his community or aspiring to political power. Love now possessed him completely.",0,535

The windows on a nearby pub have been covered with sheets to prevent people from seeing what's going on inside Carol Harvey was in her mid-30s when she became pregnant for the first time at work. She had never even been close to having sex before - not because things hadn't happened but because it wasn't something that interested her. Like many women who have spent their entire life as a virgin, this seemed like some outmoded idea from another era. Carol felt trapped by these expectations and wanted so much more than being chaste. Despite telling herself over and over again ""I won't,"" what began for her as purely an innocuous act carried on throughout her pregnancy without once stopping until the birth itself. This meant that Carol has barely left the house since her son William came along 11 years ago. What's become almost entirely normal for most other couples brings acute embarrassment and shame for someone like Carol - despite anything else anyone says about 'natural' or'realistic'. ""It all started when I got my period,"" said Carol. ""My boyfriend at the time told me it would be best if we didn't try any sexual activity during this time. He thought that due to how sensitive I am around him, it might make us emotional which could then create problems later down the line."" Bill suggested they use condoms but that turned out to be too complicated as he'd messed them up using his fingers. With no experience of oral sex whatsoever, low self esteem meant Carol kept quiet about her growing fears. It wasn't long after her period that she secretly went online looking for information about conception on Yahoo Answers. But instead of getting answers, she found hundreds of sexually explicit pictures of babies: ""They looked really cute and innocent."" As somebody who wouldn't normally pay attention to details such as the colour of paint used or whether something fits properly, Carol couldn't help but notice the differences between the old porno pics and real people. ""There was a lacklustre quality to many of them, none seemed quite alive... They were all stiff like marbles."" This blatant difference spurred Carol's search further. After spending hours trawling through titillating sites featuring child abuse, everything changed forever. On top of several pages devoted to showing videos of children crying for help, there were also hundreds of photographs available to view for free. Many displayed images of tiny boys straddled by grown men; others showed toddlers posing suggestively while adult men allegedly took photo's. These weren't just random pieces of information though, Carol saw remarkable similarities among every single page - the kids weren't alone: ""Their faces always resembled adults. Their eyes were closed, mouths open. In each image you can see the same contour of teeth pushing against cheeks and gums. Even the hair was identical."" Caroline's mind flashed back across the internet to thousands upon thousands of photos she'd seen recently. A quick websearch revealed a term that finally explained why she understood nothing she read on those websites - barebacking. She tried searching for terms like 'barebacked babies', but most links either returned blank results or led nowhere new. If adulthood did indeed begin at age 13, Carol hoped to know everything about it sooner rather than later. A few months earlier, she'd discovered Paedophilia Information Network (PAN) website. Since its launch nearly ten years previous, it's difficult to believe that anybody still hasn't heard of the site as a whole, especially given its popularity amongst Britain's youth population. Every conceivable topic related to paedophiles is catalogued here, including godfathers, nannies and baby sitters. At last count PAN claimed to have nearly 50 000 members in 46 different countries. Only a handful of them were UK based, yet for over three years, no matter how hard she searched, Carol failed to find a picture of a naked little boy. Then, a week following her fateful trip to Pan, she logged on to Fetlife and clicked on the user profile belonging to a girl called Snowball Mommy. In response to her request for pictures, the soon-to-be mother replied saying that she hadn't taken any since her daughter's recent birthday party. Impressed by her honesty, Carol offered to show her own snapshots showing her newborn son sleeping peacefully within moments of arriving home from hospital. When asked if she wanted to take part in group chats, Carol declined immediately. Although presumably happy to speak to strangers, she remained terrified of exposing herself emotionally, let alone her private parts. ""When I'm near him [her son] I feel like I want to hide behind a screen,"" admitted Caroline. Her relationship with William represented everything worth living for. There was security in knowing exactly what he liked to eat and sleep patterns. ""He cries so loud! And I love listening to this!""

"Upsetting events often make the news because they don't happen very often. This section gives you some tips about what to do if you are feeling sad about what you've heard or seen on TV lately. Chapter 1: What's Up? The Basics of Dealing With Upsets and Negative Emotions In this chapter, we look at ways that upsets affect us emotionally - and how we can help ourselves deal with them. We'll also discuss why negative emotions are important for growth in our lives; positive feelings promote healthy behaviors but negative ones may lead people into unhealthy habits like eating too much sugar and other poor nutrition choices or smoking cigarettes. When it comes right down to it, a big reason society is so stressed out these days has nothing to do with money problems (although it does cause a lot). It has everything to do with stress-management techniques geared toward managing up rather than coping down! When life gets stressful, even when all things seem okay, there usually will be some upsetting event somewhere along the way. A good friend who struggles with anxiety once told me something I think really sums up the reality of dealing with upset moments in general and the reasons they occur in specific situations: ""It doesn't matter where or how [upset] happens... as long as it happens."" You may not always agree with her assessment of life events, but I definitely believe she was correct with regard to upsetting episodes! Just remember, no one makes you feel bad. You create your own experience through thoughts and actions. How to Do Well During an Upsetting Event All day long, every single minute of each day, people are worrying about their future selves, creating fear by imagining possible failure and rejection based on past experiences. But most of us have never been taught that worry robs us of energy and interferes with our ability to relax enough to enjoy life instead of get caught up in constant anticipation of doom. Worrying just keeps any major problems from getting resolved and creates unnecessary tension in your body. So let go and allow yourself to rest. If you're worried about sharing a car seat with someone else, buy two seats. Obviously, more than two passengers aren't going to fit on either side, but having extra space frees you to stop thinking about whether someone might end up next to you while driving. Try to avoid arguing over small details, such as which movies you want to watch tonight, which directions you should take to work, or who is going to use the bathroom first during dinner... whatever it takes to give away control of little issues so that you won't spend tomorrow morning wishing you'd had time today to figure out who would sit across from whom on the plane. Instead, focus on bigger picture concerns like taking care of health matters, making sure financial obligations are being met, scheduling appointments to address pressing needs, doing laundry together, setting goals for improving relationships with family members or friends, and relaxing without guilt. A few simple yet powerful beliefs can improve your emotional well-being. One is the belief that if you try hard enough, eventually, things start turning around and working out fine for you. Another is the idea that you can learn many valuable lessons from difficult moments in your life. And finally, maintaining the flexibility required to adapt to changes in daily routines helps you live a happier life. The following sections offer tips to keep in mind whenever you encounter negativity and upsets. They provide strategies to keep you steady and resilient throughout the course of everyday living. Feeling Good After An Unpleasant Experience Is Critical To Your Success In Life Don't blame others. Blameful statements I'm only human suggest that you wouldn't hold back if you were less sensitive than everyone else. Recognize that although unpleasant experiences come and go, people remain relatively consistent over time. For example, you could say, ""Even though my husband became angry after he learned I accidentally left his wallet behind at the airport, he still loves me!"" Remember that negative emotions don't last forever. There are times, however, when sadness lingers longer than usual. Sometimes, prolonged periods of misery are accompanied by unrealistic expectations about the speed at which circumstances change. Because disappointment inevitably occurs sooner or later, remind yourself frequently that the world isn't perfect. Give yourself permission to accept loss, disappointment, misunderstandings, and errors when they appear. Allow yourself plenty of room for happiness and success. Accept responsibility for your mistakes. People rarely regret what they did in response to pressure. However, since responsibility doesn't necessarily translate to accountability, you must admit wrongdoing when appropriate. Responsibility involves accepting blame for failing to meet standards or promises made to another person. Accountability refers to observing consequences resulting from behavior and judging oneself accordingly. Saying ""Sorry"" Clearly Shows That Remorse Has Set In This book encourages readers to take personal responsibility for themselves and their decisions. Thus, apart from admitting fault when necessary, we encourage folks to express remorse openly and sincerely. Not only will expressions of sorrow communicate a message about its value, but also because MrsJarn (s) is a distinct conductlessness in storageP is recorded with results in storage, then appears nTo",0,543

Everybody now gets all these things sent through cyberspace. All my email goes straight onto this computer [as does] everybody else's. So I am very sure we will live forever after sending out some really inappropriate comments. The problem is people can see them so someone might read your private emails.

"SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's ""Sgorio!"" flagship programmes and became such an institution that it spawned spinoffs like SuperNanny and its American reboot Junior Nannies; there are now also comics which continue well beyond the show's original run. Following three years off air, the franchise will return with new episodes this weekend for Comic Con and a DVD release next year. So what can we expect? In the first place, keep your eyes peeled - this is a show you simply cannot miss at all costs! The new series begins in England, where Ted (voiced by Jason Segel) is happy to be back home with his family after staying away from them during college, but he quickly finds out just how hard life can really get when his wife Janey and kids Lily and Marshall move into their midlife crisis dream house. Freshly divorced himself, Ted heads over to America to meet up with old friend George O'Malley who runs a children's amusement park called Coolsville. But they soon discover that not everyone has forgotten about him: business tycoon Scrabble someone (you know), whose game is being played online and has started taking down any threats or rivals...including everybody else. Suddenly finding themselves under attack, Ted must track down Scrabble and bring peace to Coolsville once again. Oh and did I mention there were killer robots?

"Campaigners fought to save Ipswich Airport after it was earmarked for housing by Ipswich Borough Council, with some occupying the terminal building for about four months. The anniversary of the protest is being marked this year. Photograph: Helen ChawkinsPA Ipswich airport's first stage in its winding up process has been triggered as campaigners prepared yesterday to mark one-year since their occupation ended when the controversial scheme went on hold. The 12 month creditor protection period will start today and close at midnight tomorrow. During that time any unsecured creditors - including tradesmen owed money - can petition a judge to take over the business or liquidate it if they believe it cannot be rejigged into profit within six years. An initial court hearing could decide whether the company should go through administration. If so there would be an auction of assets before administrators sell off what remains. A final decision on closing down will then have to wait until 4 April next year, giving companies such as banks plenty of time to get new finance approved. In March last year members of Save Ipswich Airport (SIA) occupied the terminal building protesting they had no alternative but to fight back against plans to turn the site into 2,000 homes which would destroy Britain's oldest surviving aviation heritage. They claimed the move represented government interference in local affairs and that councils do not have the right to compulsorily purchase land unless required by law. Other concerns included noise pollution due to development and cost overruns. And while SIA said private investment might revive the fortunes of the once busy airfield, councillors insisted ""there are no guarantees."" But now, following several failed attempts to convince developers to take over the site instead, owners Avon Investments hope residents in High Street West will buy out the leases held by tenants who occupy vacant properties. This includes offices which house a number of solicitors firms. However, under planning laws, only around half of those complications involved in selling freehold property can legally be done without council consent. To avoid losing thousands of pounds worth of legal fees, SIA's lawyers approached Clifton Moor Law LLP, specialising in landlord and tenant issues. They helped negotiate postponement of proceedings to allow negotiations to continue between Avon Investments and all parties interested in buying out leaseholders. That finally happened in July 2014 with final offers made subject to further negotiation. In February 2015, however, courts ordered that the delays must come to an end. Last week, they agreed to appoint a firm of chartered accountants to oversee the sale of the freehold. Any deal negotiated during the three-month sales cycle overseen by PWC International Limited would need approval from both Avon Investments Ltd, owned by Peter Rolfe, chairman of Suffolk Building Society; and Ipswich Borough Council. Thereafter, independent assessors appointed by the two bodies would determine value estimates for every piece of commercial real estate south east of London Road. All deals valued above 10m fall outside the control of the cllr-led authority because these require change orders assessed independently by appraisers nominated by the planning inspectorate. As well as Ivydene House, other potential buyers include the former owner of the Hermitage Hotel opposite the arrivals hall, Barratt Homes, Coppice Properties and North Star Property Group. Grosvenor Estate Agents also listed an interest in acquiring the whole lot along with another plot they own adjacent to Barnard Lodge Farm. With a portion of light industry crucial to its survival, the remaining open space needed to run the terminal, the public toilets and a small cafe remain available for rent. SIA is keen supporters say new operators should make best use of the facility where renowned aviators Sir Freddie Laker and Sir Sydney Camm flew from as recently as 1966. More than 300 flights take place each day, transporting passengers from international destinations including New York to France and Korea, according to figures provided by officials. Also offering something unique: a headquarters for historic aircraft enthusiasts. Among them are pilots whose planes turned up at nearby RAF Woodbridge and were later restored. Now aged 20, Karen Bowers says she joined her partner Adrian Watson and friend Philippa Croft inside the old terminal building almost immediately after it became clear nothing would halt SIA's closure. She met the founders two days later having heard about the occupation via Facebook. ""We didn't know we would stay till Christmas Day,"" recalls Ms Bowers. ""But our roles in the organisation meant we thought we had a duty to keep going, even though it wasn't looking good. Pretty much everyone else goes home [to work] at 6pm, 9am and 3.30pm, except us. We always stayed longer hours just to ensure people knew someone cared. It seemed like it worked. 'People kept coming more often. Some came twice,' remembers Adrian Watson.

"Last month he became the first player to speak publicly about being sexually abused as a boy at Crewe in the 1980s. There are now 155 suspects in the UK-wide police inquiry into child abuse and it is thought that one victim has already been identified It was some time before Davey Johnson woke up on August 9, 2013, when his wife of 12 years quietly called out from another room: ""Doesn't look like you're going back with us,"" she said. In fact, there were no plans for him to return home that night but, then again, nothing ever does.[...] It's not a subject I want to talk much about - if only because it still hurts so bad - but my husband and I divorced 16 months ago after an 11 year marriage. The reasons aren't important, but suffice to say we never resolved our issues or came close; instead, they just grew festering over time until, finally, they became too painful for either of us to bear any longer. And even though (as I've confessed) I'm speaking publicly here today about this particular incident more than 20 years later, I'd rather not go into all the details of what happened between me and my ex-husband other than to simply state that [with] hindsight, looking back on how things played out, there were many times throughout our relationship where I felt physically threatened by him. My fear of him often manifested itself through anger or defiance, both of which served to feed whatever negative energy he had directed toward me during moments of conflict. But when push comes to shove, these days I think I know who would have ended up hurting whom because that person has always made it clear that he doesn't care whether a woman continues to live or dies, and he doesn't seem truly invested in her well-being beyond wanting something from her. Unfortunately, that someone also happens to be a very high level executive within the company I work for - a man whose power makes him untouchable, regardless of the severity of his actions. So, turning away from discussing specifics, let's shift gears and discuss two recent examples of a similar nature involving men who appear to wield such tremendous influence among their respective communities. One example happened right here in Oakland County while the other took place in Florida. Sure, I could write endless stories about people accused of rape, particularly given the way the media tended to sensationalize cases and deflect attention from victims,1 but those anecdotes don't mean anything unless they can serve as a springboard into wider discussion about why sexual violence persists. That broader context becomes especially relevant considering that these three incidents represent the tip of the iceberg regarding how far-reaching the problem might actually be. As crazy as it sounds, I believe society suffers from a bit of collective denial surrounding sex crimes perpetrated against women.[23456]. More specifically, I contend that most folks turn a blind eye toward male predators who exploit children and young adults because of familiar dynamics dating all the way back to ancient Egypt and Greece. Essentially, we respond negatively to potential threats posed by adult males whom we perceive to possess inherent strength, capability and invincibility versus girls and boys who pose none of these qualities.[7] This sets a dangerous precedent when thinking about how men may use deception andor intimidation tactics to lure unsuspecting womens' hearts and minds. For instance, men might promise one thing yet deliver something entirely different, and they'll do so without remorse since they view themselves as above reproach. Consequently, female students will tend to assume that a guy who reveals himself as dominant and controlling isn't necessarily a danger to them, a notion reinforced when teachers affirmatively tell females that certain guys won't hurt them in order to make them feel safe around such individuals. Sadly, this type of teacher-directed validation serves only to reinforce common misconceptions about gender roles, thereby undermining an entire generation of impressionable youth who come of age believing that equality prevails in every facet of life, including relationships. By contrast, perpetrators may see themselves as entitled to take advantage of weaker females in highly visible settings such as schools and colleges, largely due to popular stereotypes equating masculinity with invulnerability. They'll play upon feelings of entitlement and superiority by grabbing onto apparent weaknesses such as immaturity, youthfulness and emotional fragility. Female faculty members and administrators often become complicit, inadvertently helping perpetuate harmful perceptions about females through benign acts such as giving boys preferential treatment - e.g., allowing them extra credit absent a written request - and failing to intervene when faced with inappropriate behavior by classmates or colleagues. Even worse, school officials sometimes join forces with abusive peers to facilitate future abuses via behavior that appears uncaring towards victims. Indeed, the sad reality is that institutions that should know better haven't done enough to help prevent harm from occurring nor sufficiently address instances of abuse once it occurs. Instead, they signal that perpetrating such behaviors is acceptable because of perceived differences between genders. When viewed in light of decades of feminist activism, public education campaigns and private research reports concerning intimate partner violence, I contend that policies and practices have failed miserly measures like those in question because of their failure rate currently applies to keepers are unable to resist success rates?

"The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95 compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over 16 and earning 10,000 or more per year - but there are some exceptions. Businesses with fewer than 250 employees won't have to set aside any money as compulsory provision for their workers from April 2018 onwards unless they opt in voluntarily by 201920. These ""employer only"" plans are not mandatory at all so if you don't want to make contributions then it doesn't matter whether your employer offers one or not. Likewise there are no penalties for opting out either. However you will be liable should someone withdraw that voluntary contribution before retirement age (which for an employee pension would be 65). The other big difference is that these schemes must contain annual reviews which means employers can change them when necessary without requiring further approval. So this may mean adding extra benefits to cover things like childcare costs or allowing people to save towards holidays away from work and payouts on early withdrawals may become available too. It also does not require contributing for each individual worker. If I'm working part time during term time I still get my full salary paid into the scheme because in reality most of us do our real job outside office hours anyway. This avoids having to rely solely upon the state pension system instead.",0,557

"India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which would be free from the world and its problems, where he could live in peace with his followers. It was here that Gandhi took up vegetarianism as well as water-conservation practices such as the use of buckets instead of glasses for drinking water. The villagers were given just enough food - milk and vegetables grown on their own land but not much more. The other members of the community were required to work hard at selfless activities like planting trees and cleaning rivers without being paid. This way they came to know what freedom meant. Besides, there was no need to pay taxes because people who gave all their earnings voluntarily were tax exempt. In fact, they also got subsidies by the government. These arrangements did away with corruption, said Gandhi, 'because everyone knows that if you get money through fair means then corruption is eliminated'. There were rumours about him that some government officials tried unsuccessfully to bribe him. A few rich families used to donate huge sums of cash to help run the whole operation. But these donations - as Gandhi himself pointed out - helped only a few influential persons while thousands of poor remained destitute. That is why this experiment failed. But Gandhi kept experimenting with different forms of social organization until he found one which worked perfectly: Satyagraha (slogan), noncooperation and mass civil disobedience. His style of politics focused on truth rather than violence. If he considered something immoral, illegal or untruthful, he felt justified in challenging it even if it destroyed businesses owned by others. Gandhi put forth many novel ideas during his time. One of them was the Swarajya concept wherein every individual should decide whether India can progress economically or socially, and hence choose either capitalism or socialism according to her needs. Another idea was that religion was nothing less than a science of living; therefore, any religious preacher must be scientifically qualified. The big difference between Hinduism and Islam was that Hindus were interested in practising spiritual values whereas Muslims tended towards materialistic goals. For instance, he believed that the purpose of each human life is to surrender oneself fully into God's power so that we become divine beings. Then how will we reward ourselves? By doing good deeds! So long as our behaviour remains a copybook exercise, then it matters little what happens after death! Such thinking has inspired millions across generations similarly. He thought that the best form of education should be practical since it gives knowledge besides character. However, children learn better when taught verbally; hence learning became visualized through paintings and sketches. The Gita, written by Sri Krishna in ancient times, is full of wisdom. Therefore, it helped spread satyagrahas around the country. Also, Gandhi went against tradition by saying that women too have rights over property and inheritance. More importantly, he rejected caste system and advocated a class-free society where everyone lived together harmoniously. To achieve this aim, he started the Champaran model industry in Bihar. And so began anti-climaxes and setbacks which eventually led to his murder. 19 Jowahiram Yellappa Sharma 1926 TALK TO PEOPLE AND THEY TELL YOU ABOUT THEIR FAILURES. They speak incessantly about their mistakes... When I say 'I', do not ask me about my virtues. Tell me your failures first. Ask me questions and listen carefully before asking me about myself. I tell you frankly that I am wrong both mentally and physically.... You may think, 'He cannot understand anything.' Well, let us talk straightaway - take off your hats. Let us see who speaks most freely. If anybody talks nonsense, let him feel ashamed. We shall find many weaknesses in ordinary people. Why don't we look within? Do we ever examine ourselves closely for faults? What kind of examination are we conducting now, really? Are we not testing ourselves? How do we test our honesty, intelligence, strength or justice? Simply by observing the circumstances surrounding us. Outwardly, things appear very pleasant and worth having; inside though, we sense them to be false. Within us always lurks discontentment - dissatisfaction springs from nowhere else! From emptiness alone does enlightenment come. The Buddha never spoke of emptiness. On the contrary, he emphasized everything positive everywhere. People want to hear all bad news. Nobody wants to admit that he has gone short of virtue. Everybody says, ""Let another try."" He thinks, 'If someone else succeeds, I will succeed'; thus he fails again. That is why everybody feels helpless. A man learns quickly from failure so that next time he may avoid making similar blunders. We should keep quiet and wait patiently.

"Media playback is unsupported on your device 13 September 2015 Last updated at 09:11 BST While they sing artist William Mackrell draws the bumps and swerves. His installation Gaps, Glitches and Flux in Time (2004) has been touring across America for the past decade, exposing patrons to a series of screens that generate disturbing images from data coming from global positioning systems (GPS). It's all part of his ongoing research into our fascination with information technology - how it changes lives and influences us. Using clever algorithms he finds patterns where there are none and makes abstractions out of what others might consider noise. Here we meet him before one of his performances in San Francisco I first met Bill about 10 years ago in London when I was working as an animator for Johnny Rotten. He said something very reasonable which made perfect sense to me: ""If you're not finding things strange then don't try too hard."" Now I'm still moving around trying really hard but now my approach isn't forcing some kind of weirdness, because if people can enjoy it then great; if they don't get off their arse to look, frankly who cares? My early work used GPS devices to collect location data [data points] every few seconds along various tracks. My intuition told me these were going to be interesting places to go. But being realistic I did expect people would either ignore them or think they were rubbish. Instead everything went crazy. People started using mobile phones to interact with it, taking pictures of their friends walking down the street while chatting away on Facebook. You'd have thought this activity would drain batteries quicker than anything else so why bother? No, instead of waiting until they ran flat they carried extras with them just for emergencies so they could keep 'checking' as they walked around. As soon as they got home with their new battery power surge they would check again! And on top of that people wanted more detail. They sat under trees looking up at those dots on the screen and seeing that tiny line saying ""x metres"" gave them time-stamped snapshots through people's day. So far it had been easy enough to find something unusual among hundreds of locations. The trickier problem was to find things that weren't necessarily incredibly rare but didn't happen every single second of everyone's life. When you add many thousands of datasets together you begin to see trends. Suddenly regularities emerge and suddenly unexpected ones appear. This happens everywhere on Earth and most importantly in New York City. So much data exists here that certain patterns became clear immediately. For example there's no reason why no matter which direction someone walks in Manhattan between 11am and 1pm they should never pass within 10 blocks of a Starbucks coffee shop. In fact, though, from any given spot in Manhattan during those hours anyone will inevitably do exactly that. Perhaps more surprising is the pattern created by the highly unpredictable behaviour of cars driving anywhere near Ground Zero. All over the city there's clearly no real zoning system to stop mass numbers of vehicles rushing over to take photos for two weeks after 911. So even today when lots of traffic jams form in Manhattan you end up with long queues stretching back all the way to Houston Street in Brooklyn. New Yorkers aren't really interested in stuff like this yet somehow it attracts visitors who want to understand whether there is indeed a pattern to everything. To accommodate their curiosity I built a gadget called Eyes On NYC. Each one costs 2,500 and links directly to its nearest sensor node via WiFi. When I installed ours inside the gallery space in 2004 we watched lots of people wander round checking out our display. After a week the museum seemed packed solid with crowds watching. At times almost 500 viewers occupied the room simultaneously. That makes Eyes On NYC easily worth millions of dollars per year. Over recent months we've hosted exhibitions such as Art Basel Miami Beach and Burning Man festivals in Nevada offering three days of free entertainment including 30-minute live shows plus projections in Times Square. Even now, eight years later, crowd sizes remain impressive. Everyone seems happy to watch occasionally amazing art happening right next door and also gently pestering staff asking questions. Most nights there's nothing left in front of the wall except dark shadows roaming slowly across the floorboards. Occasionally you'll catch movement and hear whispers drifting towards you, perhaps wondering whose body laid against yours last night in the darkness. I hope they found answers to their queries. If not they must surely have believed in magic. The scary thing is that Eyes On NYC doesn't change anything. There's always plenty more of both buildings and roads lying ahead. Years of experience tell me this won't slow humanity down. However, once you start connecting the dots you discover other possibilities where maybe everyone stops doing whatever they normally do and starts thinking about what's going to come next. What does our future hold? We need tools to help make predictions. Everybody loves forecasts based on statistical analysis and forecasting models.

"The Confederation of African Football (Caf) are inviting new bidders for the tournament. Caf say that countries wishing to host the tournament have until 30 September to express their interest.

However, in January 2017, it was revealed that they were no longer involved in the bidding process and Uganda has since been added as an alternative venue. Read more Rumours about the FAI's decision not to take forward a proposed switch from Dublin to Abu Dhabi resurfaced last year. The Irish Federation initially said that it had ""no plans whatsoever at this stage to consider moving 2018 or 2022."" But having identified an opportunity with FIFA to discuss potential options on the future tournaments, there is now renewed speculation. Sources suggest that both of these nations - along with Nigeria - could be ready next month to put up bids for the 2026 edition. A representative from one of the three confirmed interested parties told The42: ""We'll make our final choice before end-September."" There remains strong support within government circles towards hosting the event and it is believed that when a formal invitation arrives in October or November, all three candidates will be given serious consideration. This week, the United States won the right to host the World Cup finals after beating out decades-old rivals Mexico in controversial circumstances. Ireland's two biggest competitors, England and Scotland, did not even get a vote because the 2016 European Championship qualifying format meant none of them - not even Northern Ireland - qualified automatically. A source close to Fifa president Gianni Infantino claims he feels Ireland would benefit from being chosen ahead of Spain, Portugal and Italy. It is understood that Infantino met senior members of the FAI hierarchy shortly after taking over his role and that officials privately expressed keenness on a return to South America or Africa. But Ireland's chances of landing the showpiece event suffered another blow this afternoon when Italian giants Juventus issued a statement denying any involvement in a possible move back home. They said: ""Juventus FC does not participate [in] any kind of international competitions inside Europe. We don't think so. ""If we do I wouldn't know why. You can ask someone else but isn't it true? If you want something we pay attention and if anything happens you tell us exactly what happened."" In response to questions regarding reports linking Dublin to France 2024, an official later reiterated that no such planning exists. Yesterday evening, the FAI released guidance to clubs clarifying its stance regarding transfers during Euro 2020 qualifiers, which begins against Denmark in Copenhagen tomorrow night. While approving commercial deals between players and clubs outside of the domestic league, the governing body stipulated that no player may leave an EU member state without prior permission. Clubs who receive a transfer request must respond within seven days while those who wish to terminate a deal must also provide reasons by then.

""There are alternatives we can look at instead of having those drastic measures taken such as putting down and breeding out our ponies."" Culling Dartmoor's 600-odd pony population will be costly for taxpayers because the animals would need to be kept either privately or by someone who has volunteered to take them under their wing.

"Many people have been reluctant to seek medical treatment for Ebola, fearing that diagnosis might mean death as there is no proven cure. A team of 30,000 people is going door-to-door in affected areas and the number includes specialists trained in intensive care units, epidemiologists, laboratory scientists, ethicists and doctors who can sustain themselves without food or water if they come into contact with someone infected. Ebola causes intense fever, diarrhoea and vomiting - three symptoms often confused by patients - leading them to die at home because it takes 12 hours after being exposed before a patient becomes contagious. By then their body fluids are already contaminated with virus particles which allow other sick people to catch the disease from them. The highest attack rates occur among young children due to poor immune systems leaving adults more able to fight off infection. In Sierra Leone the fatality rate was 90 per cent but those not treated died within two weeks. Aid workers say most cases go undiagnosed. The WHO says up to half of all patients do not show any signs for 10 days after contracting the virus before developing flu like sicknesses such as high temperature, headache, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue.

The second remains in detention. According to Gamzah Abu Bakar Al-Muadhamamat (60), a former leader of PAS who is now an opposition politician himself, there is another reason why the authorities have failed to provide answers about what motivated this brutal assassination: it would reveal too much about Islamism. Adnan al-Othmani ReutersThe coffin containing Zaki Buhari at his funeral in Putrajaya December 26. A man associated with Malaysia's Islamist party has reportedly confessed to being involved in the murder of Mazlan Mohd Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin told reporters yesterday [1 January]. ""I'm certain he will be charged,"" head of Malaysian police Khalid Shaikh Mohammed told AFP. As well as having links to extremist groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah, Mr Othmani also holds positions within PAS itself.[2] And indeed, some elements within PAS seem to believe Mr Jaya's death may prove inexorable. In a statement issued following her father's burial earlier this week,[3] the President of PAS declared his intention to hold a ""special meeting"" regarding the Deputy PM shortly after Ramadan begins on 5 July. The timing suggests the purpose of this extraordinary gathering is to find a solution to the controversy surrounding Ms Jaya's killing. But should Mr Abdul Hadi bin Jaafar proceed with his plans, a resolution to the case could instil fresh ammunition into the hands of those seeking to use violence against Islamists inside their own organisations - particularly when coupled with recent events in Sri Lanka. Bereft of any actual connection between Ms Jaya's alleged killers and Islamic extremism, many observers are convinced that political motives lie behind her slaying. On social media, many accuse Malaysians from both sides of politics of being complicit in a cover-up, while discussing the incident using emotive terms like ""murder,"" expressing fear[4], then demanding justice. At times, speculation appears to verge onto racism; Malays are commonly referred to as the most murderous people in Southeast Asia, even by Indians themselves. One writer described the reaction to Ms Jaya's killing as ""the kind of thing you get in South Africa during apartheid... where all kinds of injustices occur and no one says anything because they are afraid someone might call them racist, so nothing happens. It takes real courage to stand up to injustice!"" [5] But despite the frequent emotional rhetoric used on Twitter and Facebook, analysts say that excessive legal recourse is unlikely to bring clarity to the case. Rather than allowing a trial, authorities appear to be intent on providing a public spectacle. Yesterday saw the first major official announcement since the shooting took place, along with a hastily organised press conference addressing the mystery over Ms Jaya's murder. Officials spent hours denying allegations made in TV news reports that the government had known about impending trouble before she was shot dead.[67] This is far from an isolated occurrence. Last month, PM Najib Razak accused the BBC of airing lies in its coverage of the abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria, suggesting that the station had fabricated details designed to undermine international support for troops fighting Boko Haram.[8] And just last week, in Burma, dissident Aung San Suu Kyi held a press conference accusing foreign journalists of bias in reporting the oppressive treatment of Burmese Muslims by Buddhist nationalists. Her speech prompted a backlash amongst Western journalists, prompting her to issue retractions. She is currently facing a possible treason charge stemming from her actions.[9] Even if new evidence emerges related to Ms Jaya's murder, given the extent to which law enforcement agencies can control information flow, analysis alone won't change minds among disaffected members of society.

"Paul captured global attention after he successfully predicted the results of all of Germany's seven games at the 2010 World Cup, as well as the final. Each time he opened his mouth to speak his predictions came true and were proven correct. In 2011, he also picked up a prize for being named 'Chancellor in waiting' by German magazine Der Spiegel.[56] He did not win any money that year, but when asked what he would do if chosen as chancellor was again told he'd get into trouble with the tax office and be prosecuted.[7] After Germany lost against Argentina on penalties, Paul said ""I actually feel relieved."" He later explained: ..."" I have been very tired over the last two weeks because my mother had surgery... She has cancer and it is stage four... The family doesn't know yet how things will go.8] His prediction put him second behind Brazilian Daniel Alves (who accurately selected Brazil vs Spain) in terms of accuracy among Germans polled about their favorite football matches.[9] In 2012, Paul's total of 27 proved accurate during Euro 2012. Paul stated: ""That we are fifth here means something good,"" adding ""Germany can play better than fourth.10] During an interview for FIFA 13 released September 2013 Paul spoke about whether or not he'll pick more footballs from outside Europe this season saying he still wants to see recent signings like Sergio Aguero and Juan Mata and says they're probably going to score lots of goals together. However, he wouldn't say which way Manchester United will end the season due to their manager David Moyes' unpredictability; however, did warn people to expect surprises throughout May.[11] He also mentioned other countries such as England as having potential big-name moves before summer transfer windows close.[12] At EA Sports MVP Vote 2014, Paul won the award ""Best PC Prediction"" with 48. On June 19, 2015, he was announced to host, alongside Cesc Fabregas, Jimmy Fallon on NBC's coverage of UEFA Champions League Final 2015 between FC Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.[13] Paul was featured in an episode of Horrible Histories where he used a crystal ball to predict the outcome of the Battle of Agincourt[14], resulting in the English army winning 1-0.

"Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared from near a farmhouse in Iraklis on 24 July 1991. The site, which is 750m from where he was last seen with his mother and her boyfriend, has since been excavated by archaeologists but Ben remains missing THE mystery of the Heinz that vanished after leaving 10 Downing Street continues to baffle relatives - nearly 25 years later it still hasn't turned up... A search for clues at an abandoned building in Kent's Chobham Common came close to solving one of Britain's biggest unsolved mysteries. But while police have found evidence suggesting what happened to Robert Williams' prize-winning bottle of wine will be revealed soon - they can do nothing about it yet. Mr Williams discovered the German label after buying two bottles of Riesling online for 33 each (the same cost as if bought locally). It appeared so good that he decided to serve it himself before congratulating friends on their new baby. He kept the bottles safely stored under lock and key until recently, taking them out once every couple of weeks to check the age-old advice not to open pre-1972 vintage wines. On Saturday afternoon, despite having no idea how long the cork had been inside the bottle, he sliced off the top for the first time in 25 years. He opened another glass, poured away some ""deadly stuff"" and let rip: ""Yuck! Is this my 30th birthday? Am I drinking Diet Coke?"" As Robert opened the second bottle, the white wine started bubbling into the neck. Before it could reach its target, however, Robert realised there was something wrong and called 999 just over half hour later. Officers arrived within minutes and put the emergency call through to Herefordshire Police who dispatched officers across the country. Unable to find anything suspicious on the ground floor or roof, they began looking outside. One officer climbed onto the windowsill and saw the Heinz tin lying in the garden. When asked what else might have fallen out, she replied 'it looked like a large rat leftovers'. However, when shaken, rats were nowhere to be seen. Confused, allowed back down again, the constable checked again. By now, everyone assumed the tin must be empty because it lay directly beneath the window ledge from which Robert had taken a sip earlier. Yet, though it seemed obvious that whatever fell out of the tins had gone straight down, neither policeman would imagine that the object had rolled around the garden. Luckily, a passing neighbour suggested calling the local rat catcher. And sure enough, two days later, on Tuesday morning, the man arrived to take care of the problem. His initial reaction was similar: 'what did you say it should be doing here?' According to him, the bin liner contained brown residue rather than 'a pile of dead bodies'. Surely, though, someone must know what had happened. After all, Robert had only got rid of one crate of beer, and even then a collector tipped it off. Now the question is whether he took the other? Probably, says the sympathetic cat rescuer [sic], maybe Robert forgot about it in the excitement, didn't want to deal with it, or couldn't bear to part with it... Quite frankly, we don't really understand why anyone would throw away such rare and valuable items. We simply cannot believe it. The fact that the policemen failed to see the significance of the contents of the container doesn't mean the men are being deliberately uncooperative; this is not a movie script. They dealt with hundreds of similar calls during the day, getting to Roger Bamber. In phone calls afterwards, they continued talking openly about the disappearance, and sound like two people enjoying coffee together. At times, the tone gets more conspiratorial when they discuss the possibility that it may relate to a suicide pact between Robert and, potentially, his wife Diana, whom he met nine years ago whilst working in Germany: ""Didn't you think that it sounded odd that she wouldn't tell us where she went when questioned?"" Ms Turner asks. The answer seems clear cut - she said through tears that she'd told police everything that night. She also tells me Diana wasn't pregnant. Mr Williams denies this claim outright. 'I've never known her,' he insists with assured finality. What does seem likely is a disagreement. Friends recall Diana frequently saying she wanted children but Robert was often reluctant. Instead, she spent much of her free time shopping. Neither appears particularly impressed by the other. To his surprise, in June 1992 Mrs Williams agreed to marry him in Portugal. Just hours before he flew eastwards there was an explosion at Stroud Green tube station. People rushed to help others trapped. Inside a train, gas tanks exploded killing three firemen. It was unclear at the time whether the deaths were connected to Mr Williams although one theory was that someone had tried to set light to the train. Today, he refuses to look back; the scars remain fresh. Mr and oddsalleged martyr Professor Martinus pinned on. Mr Williams doesn't inspecting outcast without leave.

"Patrick Ewing, 66, collapsed at his home in Oakham, Rutland, and was given resuscitation by his partner, Yvonne Ainsworth. Paramedics used a defibrillator to shock Mr Ewing to restore his heart rhythm before he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn where doctors continued efforts to revive him until paramedics arrived from London. His family said they were ""devastated."" His son Mark, 31, who lives with him, told reporters: ""We are all devastated that Paddy has died."" Mr Justice Collins ruled after hearing evidence on Wednesday that Mr Ewing had not received adequate treatment for depression in the past despite being subject to three suicide attempts. He concluded that Mr Ewing suffered from clinical depression which contributed significantly to his death. He also found there had been an inadequate system of care but this did not amount to neglect as it had already come into effect when Mr Ewing took his life. The judge said he would apply strict safeguards in any future case involving patients with mental health problems. The court heard how Dr Stephen Lowther wrote to colleagues about concerns over Mr Ewing's behaviour following two recent incidents.

"The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too ""narrow"" and residents not properly consulted. He wants an interim report on three key issues within a year Labour's John McDonnell says he is ""deeply concerned"" about plans for a new draft bill that would see councils creating local development corporations (LDCs) with powers over planning decisions such as whether or not to build housing in designated green belt areas. The shadow chancellor also raised concerns that talks between Government officials and communities at Westminster Hall were taking place behind closed doors. Mr McDonnell said: ""We are deeply concerned from recent reports that our communities will only get a glimpse into what this proposed Bill might mean before it passes through Parliament. We need greater transparency of consultation processes so people can challenge any proposals made by ministers - but especially during these early stages when they seem unlikely to ever reach fruition."" He continued: ""There needs to be proper engagement with those who live near suitable sites across England because many local authorities already hold land belonging to public bodies where developers want to build houses rather than affordable social rent homes. The private sector should not pick up council-owned sites after all their work has been done. This government must listen to local views, consult widely, take account of existing agreements and then involve communities in developing its own plan for future decades of prosperity."" The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles last week issued guidance setting out how the bill should be drafted as part of his effort to reform Whitehall bureaucracy. It set out six principles including giving more power to communities and making sure that benefit was shared fairly among them. Mr Pickles said 'the legislation looks like it may provide some balance against excessive interventionist city deals'. But one of the biggest criticisms of 'localism' comes via the Conservative National Garden Party Michael Fabricant at the summit today called for a reworking of the Local Initiative Agreements (LIAs), saying there was little difference between LIAs and LDCs except that LIAs included statutory obligations to promote economic growth. A spokesman for Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude responded: ""Any changes we propose will give back autonomy and independence to borough leaders and planners while retaining collective responsibility for decision-making - ensuring both accountability and flexibility for outcomes. There is no connection whatsoever between the two models of devolution; different mechanisms are used to achieve entirely separate ends. ""Local Partnerships, Community Right To Bid and the various other Local Development Schemes operate under very distinct processes and in very different ways from hybrid schemes such as LDOs and LECs. And clearly we do not wish to create another mechanism by introducing another brand of local partnership to replace them. As far as we know, none of these things exist anywhere else in Europe either - and certainly never to anything like the scale found here. They all have specific, defined roles and sets of responsibilities laid down by central Government. A Hybrid scheme cannot claim to be a type of Trust when it does not even possess the same kind of legal status as trusts currently enjoy; similarly, nor can it call itself 'Community Led' if it operates without anyone being able to make laws for it to act upon in the first place!""",0,586
"Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock was killed that her husband had attacked him. The jury heard how the couple walked to Eastbourne station on December 12 last year after a night out in Bosham and travelled back home by train. They were seen getting off with their three children just before 11pm. The court also heard Mrs Daley told police she wanted ""to take it all down."" On March 10 this year, officers found Miss Lock dead in bed having been repeatedly bashed about the head and face. Her skull had'snapped' into several pieces - or as one pathologist put it: A full frontal fracture and decompressive craniectomy'. And then they saw what caused it. In his written statement following her death, Mr Daley said he'd gone to bed earlier than usual on December 13 as his wife was suffering from flu symptoms including fever. He claimed when he turned over, he felt something move under his hand so grabbed hold of it.""I don't know what I did next because my memory is patchy,"" said Mr Daley.The prosecution say Mr Daley hit Ms Lock five times, once causing an injury which led straight to her death. But the defence suggest instead that he only struck her twice the first time, followed by four blows to the head. If you hit someone more than two times in quick succession, there's no malice aforethought such as premeditation. So while they admit hitting her, they claim it happened too quickly for them to be guilty of homicide.Mr Daley insists he will continue with his claims that he cannot remember anything between leaving the house and being arrested outside his daughter's school in Margate.",0,588
"The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids. It can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is told today by Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England. He warns that it may not be possible to meet high standards in all hospitals. Instead, he says: ""We need to think about how we ensure good quality care for patients using this approach wherever they die and whatever place their last days are spent."" His comments follow evidence from the Observer revealing new concerns over the safety and effectiveness of hospice deaths involving hold music. An analysis of records at nine hospices run by Macmillan Cancer Support shows that more than half of those who died under controlled measures were classed as having a painless death - defined as no or minimal distress during treatment - compared with just one in 10 given standard practice. The figures raise serious questions about whether people dying naturally feel any stress. But the study also found signs of abuse including some families pushing relatives towards refusing treatments such as feeding tubes. Most worryingly, it was impossible to tell if four individuals had undergone palliative sedation because doctors could not find proper documentation. This is considered crucial information when considering withholding life support. In his report, published on Monday, Mr Keogh recommends that NHS trusts should set up internal oversight committees made up of clinicians, nurses, bereavement workers and senior managers. He adds that an independent body should oversee decisions around holding music and other procedures, while admissions to specialist end of life services must be subject to rigorous checks before being allowed to continue. Hospitals will need to carry out regular audits to check that they comply with identified best practices. There should be clear guidance on which types of assisted dying are legal and what happens after someone has taken them. However, critics point out that currently anyone taking part needs two doctors involved, meaning even close family members cannot help make these important decisions. While pilot schemes across Sweden and Switzerland, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are regulated, show greater hospital staff involvement and better record keeping, there are already reports of abuses elsewhere. Analysis of documents seen by the Guardian newspaper in Belgium revealed individuals were pressured into ending their lives against their wishes, prompting calls for controls to tighten safeguards. Simon Wessely, chair of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said: ""Parents who plan for every eventuality want their child to be cared for until he dies peacefully surrounded by loved ones. Sadly many children are deprived of this right as a result of policy failures that don't take parents seriously enough. In Britain, we've got a way forward based on compassionate care for each individual patient. We shouldn't shy away from doing things differently so long as we do them properly. That means changing our culture, giving parents real power to decide how much intervention their sick kids get rather than leaving it to professionals alone."" Hospice UK chief executive Deirdre Hutton added: ""Assisted Dying is only ever prescribed following discussion between health practitioners and patients regarding potential benefits and risks. Whilst we fully respect everyone's views on End of Life issues, we would add that Euthanasia involves deliberate action to cause death and therefore carries significant physical risk for patients, relatives and healthcare providers.""",0,589
"Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over PS600m in 2014 to only PS55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from PS500m in 2014 to less than PS70,000 today.

"Their lawyers had asked the court to declare ""unlawful"" the consultation process that led to the proposed axing of the PS320m fund. The five are among 19,000 people who receive a weekly allowance from the scheme and whose payments have been frozen since January, when it was decided at Cabinet level not to renew funding for the job-seekers scheme. Lawyers acting on behalf of the applicants argue that the government's insistence they should be bound by an 18-month countdown deadline before being eligible to claim their money is discriminatory against those with disabilities or mental health problems, as well as undermining human rights - specifically Article 4 (1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees equal treatment between members of the community. It also violates Article 8 ECHR, which protects individuals' right to life and personal liberty; Article 5 ECHR, guaranteeing freedom of movement; and Article 14 ECHR, protecting privacy. The decision to strip claimants of benefits came in the wake of claims made last year by John Hemming MP, who argued Britain needed a new approach to welfare because its existing system failed to work for many citizens. He warned that hundreds of thousands would leave the country if benefit cuts went ahead, while others faced homelessness after bills accumulated during long term unemployment. In February this year, the Department for Work and Pensions announced plans under the Welfare Reform Act 2013 to move towards universal credit, a single monthly payment replacing current benefits including tax credits, housing support and disability living allowances. A one month waiting period will apply until all cases are settled. From April 2014, anyone claiming income related benefits such as Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA), Employment Support Allowance (ESA), Housing Benefit and Council Tax Reduction has 10 weeks to transfer their case into Universal Credit. At present, there is no fixed time limit. Universal credit is expected to save 2.5bn over three years through simplifying administration costs and addressing fraud. Some recipients like Carol Hudson OBE head of Citizens Advice Debt Resolution Centre fear this could create more hardship than good. In March 2012 she told MPs: ""A lot of our clients do manage to get UC, but once you're given UC you can find yourself trapped in a very difficult situation where your benefits often stop."" She added: ""It really does need significant reform and we've got some serious concerns about how much hardship there'll actually be...""

"The Northern Ireland Rare Disease Partnership aims to give sufferers and their carers an independent voice. The group, created with the Patient Client Council, aims to improve treatment and care for those affected by rare diseases in the north of Ireland - a region that is home to one-in-ten people living with a genetic condition. ""We have moved from being just another healthcare charity to becoming a regional disease network where everyone matters, including patients and family members who are not necessarily registered as clinical specialists as part of our advisory process through 'Accessing Expertise' (AER) "" says Mark Williams-Jones, Chief Executive Officer at Northern Ireland RDP. Northern Ireland has some of the highest rates amongst Europe for undiagnosed cases of rare conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy - more than 700 new diagnoses per year. With limited information about this growing population available on the internet or even in specialist medical centres, it can be difficult to get appropriate support and care. This is why NI RDP exists; its aim is to ensure all those affected receive adequate diagnosis, assessment and management of symptoms according to national guidelines and best practice internationally. Like most other organisations working within the field, NI RDP relies heavily upon funding donations and research grants from both private individuals and charitable trusts to carry out projects, investigate gaps in knowledge among stakeholders and provide vital resources needed to help fund development work. In particular, NI RDP dependants rely upon the generosity of those in industry and academia around them to raise awareness of their needs and support their cause. As well as providing data to guide their efforts, NI RDP also hosts events throughout the year aimed at raising funds and delivering training sessions for professionals involved in patient advocacy groups. These include conferences like: Dravet Syndrome Support Network Conference 2016 which saw over 200 delegates gather together from across North America to share insight into how young families live with and manage their children's epilepsy syndrome. Or the recent Children with Mitochondrial Disorders meeting held at Belfast City Hospital 2014. Although these were attended only by doctors and nurses they provided much-needed education to those who do not work directly alongside health practitioners when treating seriously ill children. The event was so successful that another will take place later this year. These sessions allow participants to gauge what they need and what they want to learn via workshops delivered by leading experts. Furthermore the charity operates a number of partnerships with local hospitals and primary schools to offer children suffering from both neurological disorders and mitochondrial disorders support services based on need but also because these programmes bring great benefits to society overall due to increased life expectancy and reduced levels of crime resulting from improved mental wellbeing. For example, each child attending St Patrick's Primary School receives access to multidisciplinary therapy sessions as well as psychological assessments that address areas ranging from social skills to emotion regulation. They then go on to meet regularly with teachers and speech therapists to identify any issues affecting learning early on to enable intervention before any long term damage occurs. A similar service offering is offered to autistic schoolchildren at Dunmurry High School. In addition to this regular monitoring and tutoring goes on in each classroom by staff trained in autism recognition and response techniques through weekly dedicated teaching days led by qualified clinicians. All classes benefit equally regardless of gender. To date, Funding for NI RDP has come entirely from foundations with little to no government input despite receiving evidence of larger public spending cuts elsewhere in the UK economy. However recently Health Minister Lord (David) Pembroke announced 2 million investment towards two newly established conditions related charities in Northern Ireland, namely Genetic Diseases Association of North East Scotland (GDANS) and Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy UK (FMDUK). According to Mr Pembroke stated: I hope that I may be able to play my own small role in helping reduce the associated distress suffered by parents and carer[s] by ensuring that there should never again be a case in which a parent feels helpless while facing the biggest challenge in supporting hisher disabled child. This compassion appears altruistic but it could easily become self-serving if he continues paying lip service to the idea that the money might otherwise have gone somewhere else without having reached the end user. Furthermore the minister fails to mention the fact that developing diagnostics actually costs far less than dealing with adult onset progressive neurodegenerative illnesses whose success rate is extremely low. Quite clearly Noble Lords would rather spend hundreds of millions on cancer treatments when 53 different cancers currently kill 1 in 5 men and women now and 2 people die every hour from brain tumours alone worldwide. That is hardly a priority worthy of government expenditure nor does it match the level of concern presented here. Does the minister really believe that reducing NHS budget deficits to zero is going to make him look good? In reality the vast majority of government policies are simply PR exercises designed solely to ingrain the notion that they feel sorry for others.

Before the end of his playoff series with the Kings, Boudreau almost certainly would accept another post beyond Washington if asked; otherwise, he might want to think long and hard about staying around Vancouver any longer than necessary.The Canucks need more ice time out front of their own net, and Ryan Kesler needs fewer minutes riding shotgun alongside Henrik Sedin, even though head coach Alain Vigneault knows how much effort those twins put forth during the regular season.Vancouver GM Mike Gillis recently made public comments suggesting Kesler might soon depart town: ""We haven't yet discussed how all these changes might shake out in terms of our roster."" Even so, Kesler insists he still wants to stay, although the odds appear stacked against him now.Barry Trotz, whose Nashville Predators won Game 5 in Los Angeles Tuesday night, stressed afterward that he doesn't expect many teams to give franchises such as theirs too great a return if they were to promote from within.That puts a new twist on the highly publicized trade deadline speculation involving young defensemen Cody Franson -and -Kyle Quincey, both former No. 1 picks who are due raises as restricted free agents after 2013-14 seasons.Franson might be considered expendable given Nashville's excellent depth in the area around its blueline. If healthy enough to contribute, Quincey probably wouldn't fetch nearly the kind of haul he'd draw going to a contender.Not that either college prospect appears ready to leave his current club just yet.Both players were plus performers last summer while playing with Canada's National Under-18 Team, and both stand to benefit greatly from additional exposure in the AHL to hone their skills. If strong performances continue, neither Franson nor Quincey may ever reach the NHL, but the experience gained in major junior ranks should make them better candidates each year.

Under the deal reached last Sunday night, medium-enriched uranium stockpile will be reduced gradually to 300 kilograms (660 pounds), down from about 19 tonnes currently. This means some 20 percent less material than required by the International Atomic Energy Agency for fuel cycle purposes. It also reduces the number of centrifuges capable of producing enriched uranium. Iran says it needs these machines to produce medical isotopes - something fiercely opposed by Israel and other critics of the regime. In exchange, EU states including Germany, Austria and Italy agree to relax existing restrictions on trade and banking dealings with Iran lifted under previous rounds of sanctions but still heavily subject to secondary controls. These include non-financial services. Some Iranian officials hope their trading partners might eventually lift even tighter curbs - if the situation improves. However, Tehran faces strong domestic resistance to easing up too much and risks losing hard currency earnings it badly needs, especially after inflation soared well above 60 percent in May thanks largely to soaring food prices.

(AFP) 8 dead in shooting spree near Texas border city Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino blamed a man armed with two assault rifles for killing eight people and wounding another 22 others Saturday morning just south of Pharr. Authorities identified him as Jonathan Tieu Khanh Dang, 49. They did not provide details about the gunman, saying authorities believe Dang acted alone. A spokesman for U. S. Border Patrol referred questions about possible motives to the FBI, adding federal agents were helping local investigators determine whether those killed had ties with drug cartels. Crews recovered three semi-automatic weapons inside the home where Dang lived along Interstate 37 and parked vehicles used during attacks. Other firearms believed lost by Dang included.22 caliber revolvers. As of early evening, law enforcement continued search efforts by heavy equipment backed by K-9 units in fields adjacent to the subdivision where victims died, according to the county sheriff's office. Investigators cordoned off streets leading to homes in the area a maze of strip malls and small shops - blocking access to residents attempting to drive through. Local businesses saw lines of customers waiting to get gas in cars covered in blankets or wrapped in plastic sheeting. More than 100 rescue personnel worked alongside officers using sniffers dogs to locate bodies, according to reporters standing outside several houses in the community. Three children among the injured survivors were taken to Del Sol Hospital for treatment. Two 17 year old girls suffered gunshot wounds to their legs, authorities reported. An 11 year girl ran barefoot across the highway following the gunfire and made her way to safety. She appeared uninjured, police said. Carrying automatic rifle magazines, Dang apparently walked into the restaurant parking lot and opened fire at random and then entered nearby shops. Witnesses described hearing multiple shots aimed randomly throughout the neighborhood.

"The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the long-established West. In 1972 those countries had just four per cent of world GDP but were home to more than half of the people who would go on to become university graduates - about 20 million out of 393m. The share has risen steadily since then as emerging markets became richer, accounting for almost 80 by 2009 and close to 90 now. They are still outstripping developed nations though: there were 2.8 billion students in 2010 at all universities or institutes offering higher education compared with 528 million Europeans and 635 million Americans. Asia's total is expected to increase further this year. Graduates make up an estimated 4 of the UK workforce, while US figures put them at 17. Britain also relies heavily on foreign experts including doctors, scientists and engineers because its schools have struggled to produce enough native talent. Of 40 years ago, only 12 of British school leavers went into medicine and science; today it stands at 36, according to official OECD data. But Australia remains one of the tightest places for international migration, despite having some of the highest productivity growth rates among advanced economies. Its latest immigration intake was lower last year than any other country except Ireland.

"But when Paul Gascoigne appeared on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, everyone listened, including Russell. For all of Gazza's amazing moments on the pitch, he's also known for his antics off it: from cavorting with celebrities to being involved in a spot of dog-napping, this is what makes him so endearingly unique as an individual 'I think I may be that guy who can get away with anything!' That was how Paul Gascoigne started our interview at Salford City FC stadium - where we'd met up after he had arrived at Manchester Airport early one morning. It certainly seemed like that; here were two lads chatting about football before heading upstairs to meet the team manager... None other than Scotland legend Jimmy Johnstone. ""What do you make of him?"" asked Russell rhetorically. ""He has now retired but there used to be something quite special. He said to me once 'he's going places'. People forget he played no fewer than 50 games for Rangers."" If anyone starstruck by your talent should ever mention those words in passing, just nod along. Because they're true! Even more remarkable back then, though, was what happened next: We headed backstage into what better resembled a New Orleans jazz lounge than a typical British sports club. There were guitars hanging around everywhere and even a piano. This was not standard practice. But soon enough we came across Gazza himself. The man behind the persona, as well as that famous quiff. His hair looked good - perhaps too good? ""It looks good because it keeps my head warm,"" he explained, adding ""Why shouldn't I have it long anyhow? Is it bad luck or something?"" Knowing full well the answer might involve the odd trip to Battersea Dogs Cats Home... Eventually, he chatted us through some songs and eventually onto classic football subjects such as the new signings and whether the World Cup would finally bring his career back to life. ""That depends on which England player gets injured first!"" laughed Russell. And sure enough, within minutes Ronnie Whelan got sent off against Brazil. ""Oh god, right,"" sighed Gazza, almost sounding disappointed. Had he really thought they could win without him? You never know until someone tells you in advance... He continued: ""The only thing that could stop them winning are injuries. If Ronaldo goes down again..."" Of course, if that did happen, he added, there wouldn't be much left for David Beckham too; in fact, he didn't think he'd made the squad anyway. ""Maybe I'll sit out 2 - 3 years,"" joked Scottish internationalist Johnstone, reminding the former Liverpool striker that these days he wouldn't necessarily stand too tall in front of Roy Keane (although heck, sometimes you couldn't tell). As friendly banter went, nothing compared to the story we told about the time we snuck into Wembley Stadium one night during the 1991 FA Cup final. We pretended to play music while making our escape, thus avoiding detection by security staff and bringing hundreds of people crashing towards their goalposts.

On Graziano Pelle, West Ham scored another late winner vs Chelsea pic.twitter.com9w0rZHY4C5 - Football Whispers (FootballWhispers) May 21, 2018 What followed was absolute chaos. Nobody knew what was going on; all eyes were focused solely upon the game itself. Fortunately, despite having missed everything that was happening inside the stadium, everybody realised exactly what was about to go down outside. ""Get ready boys!,"" yelled Gazza over the din of thousands of voices shouting and screaming and pushing each other aside. Then, somebody shouted 'GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE' and we stampeded out of the stadium. At least, most of us did. So many spectators panicked themselves and tried to follow us, thinking we were trying to leave through the main entrance and they ended up stuck in traffic like lemmings facedown beneath the wheels of buses, taxis and coaches. By the time we reached the road, we found ourselves surrounded by police officers staring straight ahead, totally unaware we'd managed to sneak past them seconds earlier. Still, there wasn't any need for excitement, considering Gazza already had three goals to celebrate. Although maybe, when looking back, the entire experience probably qualified somewhere between act number five and six on his infamous Off My Shoulder tour. They say you've gotta see things ten times before you believe them - and Gazza very clearly had his fair share of such experiences throughout his career.

Two men who ran FlexiFoods - a meat suppliers linked to the scandal - are also being charged The Greek government has ordered an investigation into how thousands of tonnes of rotten food including baby yoghurt and raw eggs found their way onto supermarket shelves where they were sold as safe for consumption. Scores of supermarkets have been pulled apart by authorities after a whistleblower identified more than 100 suspect products that he said were put up in breach of safety regulations at factories owned by companies run from Cyprus or Greece's Dodecanese islands. A number of suspected fraudsters have been detained since the tip-off. But most cases so far relate to cheese made either with milk powder or water instead of real milk, which can cause serious health risks when eaten uncooked. Chicken mayonnaise was another ingredient found used to replace chicken stock in some sauces. Local reports say Andronikos Siderastes, owner of chain restaurant Dinos Sons, will be charged over claims that the firm had mixed ingredients together. He denies wrongdoing but could face two years in jail if convicted. If retailers involved fail to co-operate fully with the probe, fines of 4m (3.5) each could follow.

"The research, by William C Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Youyou Tu, has led to drugs to treat diseases affecting more than 3.4 billion people around the world. One of them, a new class of antibiotic called azalides (pictured top), is under development which could be as effective at treating gonorrhoea or malaria infections as existing treatments but with fewer side effects In 1980 researchers in Japan discovered that an extract from the roots of Artemisia annua was useful against parasitic worms found in the blood of patients suffering from Chagas disease, a condition prevalent throughout South America where it causes fever, chest pains, heart palpitations and nausea. It also reduces fertility in women if left untreated for long periods of time, so its use had to be carefully controlled. Two years later scientists working on the same plant species identified artemisinin, one of about 100 active chemical compounds present within extracts made using traditional Chinese methods involving steam distillation. The compound proved highly potent in killing human cancer cells grown under laboratory conditions; and when tested on mice infected with tumours 'it provided complete cures', by causing their immune systems to destroy the malignant tissue without damaging healthy tissues. This discovery of natural anti-cancer agents revolutionised chemotherapy and today several hundred clinical trials are underway to investigate whether arteminisin can help combat other types of malignancy including brain cancers and breast, lung and prostate carcinomas. But although this drug's potential for curing some forms of cancer remains unproven, there are indications that it may have been used to cure millions worldwide in the past two decades. According to estimates compiled over the last decade by Dr Robert Woodruff Ashworth of Liverpool John Moores University, who writes regularly of his work on the subject for publication websites such as , hundreds of thousands of cases of leishmaniasis - a protozoan infection spread through sandflies transmitted via bites into humans' skin - were treated successfully between 1979 and 1999 using teh dried leaves of the wormwood plant known scientifically as Aethusa cynapium. And according to reliable sources within WHO I interviewed in Egypt during my recent trip to see how they were dealing with resistance to Malaria medications taken orally, the agency used these plants since 1953 to help eradicate the parasite from the vast majority of countries affected by the deadly disease. In addition WHO recently launched a campaign to promote usage of herbal medicines for treatment of malaria among those living in endemic areas of Africa, Asia and Latin American - providing free samples of allergen-tested products upon request. At the outset of the 1970s most conventional doctors would never have considered resorting to alternative therapies to treat any kind of illness. But changing consumer attitudes towards health care combined with growing scientific evidence suggesting that many conventional drugs share problems such as severe adverse reactions, high cost, toxicity and the need for constant maintenance to keep up efficacy, brought a new wave of interest in alternatives. Unconventional remedies typically drawn directly from nature first became popularized by legendary figures like the late surgeon Ben Rush, famed British physician Berton Rouche and young Shusaku Endo who wrote acclaimed novels set in remote parts of Japan centred almost entirely on traditional medicine and spiritual beliefs. From the 1950s onwards the simple word ""Naturopathy"" began appearing increasingly frequently alongside the names of big name western medical practitioners. So great was the public appetite for Naturopathic medicine that the profession dominated mainstream media coverage of modern healthcare well before it established itself firmly enough in primary care settings to win the support of politicians responsible for setting standards across Europe and North America. Around the turn of the century the main challenge faced by naturopaths was not convincing legislators to legalize their practice, but rather convincing sceptical colleagues that non-standard approaches offered benefits similar to those delivered by orthodox medicine. For example the Field Guide published earlier this year by Alternative Medicine Review, reviewed papers describing studies showing positive outcomes following acupuncture, homeopathy, phytotherapy, aromatherapy and yoga for various ailments common to the adult population ranging from acne and arthritis to depression, infertility, stress, anxiety and migraine headaches. Some of the reviews concluded that conventional medicine actually offers little benefit above placebo control groups. Others pointed out that while it might take longer to get relief with unconventional modalities, there was no obvious harm caused, whereas pharmaceutical treatments sometimes lead to serious complications and even death. All agreed however that available evidence did not prove that simply switching from one type of therapy to another will always produce superior results and that adherence rates remained too low to recommend these approaches as standard practise. An ongoing debate continues as to what constitutes adequate quality assurance for services rendered by naturopaths: Is it good enough that their credentials match those of orthodox physicians? Or should qualified practitioners undertake rigorous training and maintain competency for every service they offer? Should accreditation bodies accept only graduates trained in accredited schools? Nor is consensus emerging quickly regarding the best way to evaluate success, particularly in terms of measurable patient outcomes.

"She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet. It had been the best day of her life and now it was all over. But what came next would try even her steeliest resolve. Two days later she made herself sit down in front of an enormous computer screen at television headquarters on Great Marlborough Street - no desk for Jane, not this time - to watch a replay of that fateful interview with Peter Meehan. She watched again from beginning to end. This time there were only four people sitting around a table: herself; Philip Webster - one by way of introduction, another entirely to ensure continuity between Paul Caffrey's original broadcast and today's re-run, at which point he will make his excuses and leave the room leaving them alone together; and Christopher Mason who is sitting behind two microphones, like some kind of super-reporter. What followed was extraordinary viewing. During the previous week, after being handed the script, Tony Hall had spent most mornings running lines through his head under his breath, discovering new ones here or taking out old ones there. His friends knew him well enough to recognise these signs - he hadn't slept more than three hours through the night since returning home on Sunday morning following the closest thing to a holiday he could ever remember having during his career. Then at midday yesterday afternoon he got hold of himself and called off his cram session. He went back into Loughton House to finish putting together the documentary before rolling up at 5pm sharp for the 7 o'clock news. Now he sat in silence watching the recording, devastated that everything so far seemed to be going against him. By the time they cut away from the interview she'd already won half their audience; but then, perhaps because he thought there might still be scope for improvement (this time you can hear in his voice how disappointed and frustrated he feels), his mood changed when it returned live to begin its second episode. 'You're wearing your boots,' he heard her say to Caffrey, never minding that the pair of low black leather lace-ups are his favourite shoes. Obviously delighted, he begins reverting to type and calls upon his skills as a pretend journalist, asking if that's deliberate. For once, rather than answering him honestly, she looks annoyed. They then return to the subject of Peter Parker's successor being selected from among the 'top brass'. Meanwhile, both cameras have moved round the side of the studio where, filling two chairs, sat Christopher Mason, Richard Overy and Margaret Hodge. After confirming that the entire show was recorded using exactly the same equipment as Caffrey, BBC Scotland began explaining the situation. The story has gone around the world, we informed viewers yet again. There is much speculation about the woman in question... But first, let's go right back to the start of the interview itself. The purpose of the programme is to find somebody who understands the intricacies of our vital national infrastructure - our communications network, power supply, transport systems, water supplies, etc., etc.. Someone who really knows what goes wrong with things, who isn't afraid to tell us why it does sometimes happen. 'We need someone who can identify problems early', says Gordon Brown, introducing the candidate at last Tuesday's cabinet meeting. And I propose Jane Stewart. (Audience reaction: huge laughter) 'Oh God!' cries Jane, almost laughing too. We've known each other for years. How did you manage to get me onto such a tricky job? asks Jeremy Hunt. Jane smiles ruefully. John Prescott leans across and offers her his hand. Her mother starts clapping along with everyone else. When I arrived at Westminster Hall, my secretary said 'oh you know those bastards don't want you working on something important.' A colleague told me that I should say no thank you. So I decided to take the advice myself, and stick it to them. (Laughter.) That's true, Jane admits. Something quite different happened. 'I got thinking about what Peter Meehan asked me to do, and suddenly realised that doing nothing wasn't actually part of the answer either. At least trying to understand what causes breakdowns helps us avoid disasters. Just having knowledge makes things better. Knowing what repairs may need to be done also gives courage and energy. Sitting down and writing about failure, however painful, lets us see ourselves clearly and stop hiding from each other.' (Applause).

"Four tickets were purchased by Bournville College in Birmingham under former principal Norman Cave, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. The Longbridge further education college also held a PS170,000 grant from the Department for Work and Pensions to cover salaries of staff before it went bust last year - just when the school was claiming that all its employees had been made redundant. The latest revelations come after we reported how seven other private colleges which claimed they could not afford their own IT systems actually received grants from DWP to do so, despite having declared themselves insolvent earlier this month. Bournville College is now facing serious questions about whether it used these funds to pay teachers' wages - even though thousands are already jobless today with no redundancy payments being offered at most subsidiaries. A spokesman said: ""We are working hard as an organisation to ensure our students finish on time and have high quality qualifications. We will be communicating with the relevant authorities as soon as we receive any information."" Professor David Greenaway stepped down two days ago as chairman of the Russell Group following accusations of misleading MPs over the collapse of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. He said he was leaving his post on health grounds but would continue to chair the group until July 2012. Roy Meadow, professor emeritus at Keele University who chaired the committee scrutinising clinical negligence claims against Mid Staffs hospital, criticised him for failing to investigate allegations of failings at the trust. He said the move came too late because the new chairman should have taken charge 'at least six months' earlier. Professor Meadow added: ""I think there's an issue here as to what role academics can play within the political process. It's best left in historians hands. Academics need freedom of expression rather than restrictions like this imposed upon them. Politicians of course are entitled to set standards. But academic life needs absolute protection if academics want to pursue research independently and freely without fear or favour."" In March 2010 Prof Green- ward led an inquiry into clinical negligence cases involving care provided by the West Midlands NHS foundation trust (WMFT). Sir Bruce Keogh resigned as chief executive of WMFT shortly afterwards amid concerns the investigation was not going well. A report presented to Parliament found Mid Staffordshire did badly across many indicators. An independent review launched as a result of Prof Meadow's findings compared notes between government departments concerning failures among trusts during the period covered by the Mid Staffordshire review. One section detailing the number of patients awaiting discharge lists identified problems such as delays putting out transfer documents. There were often long waiting times for transfers from hospitals abroad. From December 2009 to May 2011, 42 more patients waited longer than 12 weeks for treatment. Some 66 deaths occurred while people remained in acute wards or transferred to another acute setting without being assessed. Around 260 seriously ill patients died unnecessarily and around 995 suffered unnecessary pain. Of those who eventually got better, some 90 suffered symptoms including dementia - an indication that something wrong might have happened several years previously. Parliamentary records show Dr Tony Sewell was one of three members of the Mid Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group. Mr Sewell declined to comment. Preliminary investigations indicate the death rates were higher than normal although this is still being investigated. Ministers say they accepted reforms recommended by the Mid Staffordshire Healthcare NHS Trust Board once they became aware of issues raised by HM Inspectorate, including patient safety and ongoing risks posed by poor management. However, ministers refused calls to resign from Labour MP Stephen Ladyman. A party official told BBC Politics Show viewers that Mrs Miller's comments were damaging to her leadership chances. Ms Littlefair later apologised for suggesting she would prefer to see Conservative leader David Cameron stand instead of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, saying nobody wants to see the prime minister fail. She said Dr Brown was fully focused on getting through difficult challenges ahead of Britain, adding she respected the PM's decision to step aside. Advertisement Pensioner 'left 22m in unpaid tax' An 81-year-old pensioner left almost half a million pounds in unpaid inheritance taxes when he collapsed and died five years ago. A judge decided Silvester Wilson's estate - worth 2.7million - should not have been taxed since he died intestate meaning that no one knew anything about where his money had gone. His daughter Maria left no relatives behind to inherit so the widow Hazelwood must foot the bill herself. After a court battle, the High Court ruled there was nothing suspicious about the way her father ran his affairs. As a child she lived next door to him and remembers the old man as someone who always gave backhanders to local politicians. 'He was charming, generous,' she said. 'There really wasn't much that I didn't know.' At first she thought of cancelling the inheritance tax claim but accepted the ruling nonetheless. Her mother bought her shares in a company called Qualica Ltd, employing 30 workers. They earned arround 1million a week making software programmes. Their offices were above their home near Stansted Airport, Essex.

"Eight year-old Phoebe Hanson wrote to BBC Radio 4's PM saying she worried how the ""bongs"" would be replaced while Big Ben is being repaired next year. PM's editor, Roger Boyes, replied: Thank you for your letter of 8th July about Big Ben and its chimes. This will be a very important part of our country's heritage when it reopens in 2018 but we do have some thoughts on what might replace them - although I can't promise they won't change! It turns out that as soon as TV screens go black during the news - usually at around 6pm every evening - there are already bong noises from London's Southbank Centre in Trafalgar Square. The sound was initially created by a 150hp steam engine driving levers inside an air bellows underneath the square's Victorian fountain. The noise comes from somewhere within this elaborate contraption which looks like something out of one of Victoriana's many dreamy era novels. But after 26 years without maintenance or repair, you could say all these things need fixing... The Daily Mail reports that Sir Nicholas Hytner has been commissioned to make sure those iconic bells aren't silenced permanently by writing new music for the Southbank centre. And he says even if the 100m restoration job isn't completed in time for 2020 opening day, the city council has plans drawn up for two digital replacements each lasting just 40 seconds.

"The 58-year-old school principal from Dublin won 144 out of a possible 278 votes and was 98 ahead of his nearest rivals Sean Walsh and Frank Burke. Horan will take over at the helm for three years until 2019 when it is time he vacates to contest an upcoming election. ""We have reached that place where school principals are not appointed, they present themselves as candidates,"" said Mr Griffin who runs schools in North Meath, South Kildare and Bagenalstown on behalf of the IASB. ""This has been going on since 1999 but it really started about 10 or 15 years ago because there were too many members elected by supporters of political parties with no experience running primary schools, so people like me got involved.

"Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands a place where people want cars? The company employs more than 15,000 staff across three sites. It has invested 11 billion over six years and attracted investment from local businesses in return for new manufacturing facilities. It says it will keep investing ""at pace"" into its home region with projects such as creating 200 apprenticeships here every year by 2020; expanding engineering capacity and precision technology capabilities by 50 per cent; increasing research and development spend by 40 per cent; and launching 80 new models globally in 2016. Exports are also set to rise substantially this year. But even though JLR has been hugely successful in attracting big-name investments like BMW and money from overseas investors including Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Company (7267) 6752.T, it does not have the footprint needed to be truly international or innovative. And some say the firm doesn't employ enough skilled workers locally. ""Jaguar simply cannot grow without developing more engineers out of our existing workforce who can design better products and bring them successfully to market,"" said Mr Hargreaves. Despite announcing record profits earlier this month, he warns that unless there's something fundamental about how UK companies operate, they won't make up lost ground overnight. To do so would require massive amounts of RD spending in areas that don't already exist - which aren't cheap but do often take time. Mr Hargreaves added: ""This means no one can afford any complacency."" A JAGUAR EKUGO 3 DIGITAL CAMERA He points out that despite boasting 4 million customers worldwide since 2001, only half of those bought their first model abroad, while 60pc buy British brands elsewhere. And around 70pc of all Jaguars made today were sold in Europe last year, compared with just 10pc five years ago. The volume of exports was 60pc higher in 201516 than four years ago, according to figures released recently by trade body Autofacts. But JLR needs space and room to invest, especially if it wants to export electric vehicles on a large scale, and analysts suggest Brexit could slow down future growth prospects. Paul Everitt, chief executive officer of the Society of Motor Manufacturers Traders, believes Britain currently provides less support for exporting traditional industries because it hasn't fully rebalanced away from heavy industry towards knowledge-based ones. Although he acknowledges some government incentives still remain, the fact much decision making is done internationally ultimately leads to major decisions being taken further away rather than nearer home. Mr Everitt suggests other countries should follow Germany, France and Italy in offering greater tax breaks and special treatment when foreign firms decide whether or not to build factories here. In recent decades many carmakers have moved production outside of mainland Britain, including Ford Motor Co F.N, whose European headquarters are based in Cologne, Germany, after building plants near Detroit, Michigan, United States and Valencia, Spain. In 1980 the vast majority of passenger car output came from Birmingham and Coventry; now increasingly it comes from Slovakia and Hungary. ""Some places have got very good skills bases,"" admits Michael Lyon, managing director of Automotive Council East Midlands. For example, its members include Volkswagen AG's German plant in Wolfsburg, Fraunhofer Institute of Electromagnetic Sensing (EMF), Nano cologne, Mercedes Benz Global Research Development Centre Brackley and Rolls Royce Heron Engine Technology centre Bedfordshire, among others. ""I think we're doing really well as a city - otherwise why would people move their business here?"" For VEKA Group Plc BVX.ASL, the Dutch automotive supplier, moving production back from China was never going to happen. Instead it expects to shift thousands of jobs from Poland to the Netherlands during the next few years. That includes 500 assembly employees, 100 technicians and 95 administrative personnel working in supporting roles. VEKA is keeping tight control over costs in both locations - learning lessons from the pitfalls of most outsourcing arrangements - and growing rapidly through organic expansion. The group had revenues of 3.2bn (2.6bn) last year and a net profit margin of 14.5 per cent. Its revenue forecast for 2017 is between 4.9bn and 5.1bn. One thing VEKA isn't prepared to compromise on is quality, reflecting its strong reputation in the industry. As part of its strategy it aims to get 35 of sales from premium priced vehicles within 20 years, rising to 45. Unlike Oleg Tinkov, Volvo Cars' co-founder, Vyacheslav Gartner, doesn't believe Brexit poses too great a concern. He reckons the motor industry will survive unscueously.

"Friars Walk has been years in the planning and the development ground to a halt in the 2008 financial crisis. Now it is opening with Debenhams as its anchor store , but little else that would be considered normal retailing ""It's not just for people who want to shop; we are open seven days a week so you can come at any time,"" says the Met Office forecaster who leads me down this cobbled alleyway lined by pizza restaurants. We walk past an automatic coffee machine (the hot water will soon run out) before turning left into St Giles Lane where there used to be two bars selling budget wine until they closed due to licensing problems. The street became something of a symbol when some young revellers were arrested after throwing up on one of them. ""We've had complaints about tramps sleeping rough, urinating behind buildings - I know why they do it because noone cleans up their mess! But my biggest problem was lice in the 1970s. With all those flies around, who wants louse-infested hair? So now if anyone fancies being walled up in here, go home, get your own house and fence off your garden for six months. Do the same thing outside or you'll end up like that man over there. He's only got one leg, poor bloke..."" he laughs, standing next to a regular customer. This isn't exactly what most visitors have in mind when thinking of Friar Square. It doesn't look anything like a traditional shopping precinct. In fact, it looks more like an alley way than a square, although the locals seem happy enough with the name. There aren't many shops per se. Long gone from the site are branches of Boots and Superdrug, which fill adjoining streets. What remains today is a collection of shops offering mostly food services plus other retailers such as charity traders, gift stores, cafes, supermarkets and fast fashion outlets including HM, Zara and Topshop Just Go. Only a few minutes' stroll away is Bushmills Whiskey Distillery and a number of pubs offering bar meals throughout the day. To make matters worse, another department store chain called House Of Fraser also opened nearby last year despite market competition reducing footfall elsewhere. The original plan was to create somewhere shoppers could enjoy while eating lunch while browsing stock, mainly online purchases, playing video games or reading newspapers. This hasn't really happened yet because many businesses said the whole project needed rethinking. Simon Nash, formerly of Pavements Associates, the company responsible for design, management and building work, told us: ""A lot of people thought, 'what would happen if someone came along and took our shops?' One person joked if we'd put the old Food Halls back they might use it."" Nash adds this never materialised. Instead, Citygate Group decided to add a cinema on top of many of the existing sites rather than move everything downstairs. In order to accommodate this addition and maintain the raised position, each property owner needs to provide 200sq m of floor space in total to enable cinemas and related activities. Unfortunately, some properties fell below this minimum requirement leaving almost nothing available for tenants willing to take risks. A small cinema did eventually open within the complex last November but even then it wasn't entirely successful. Some residents complained it sounded like an aircraft taking off instead of progressing through corridors during previews. The following month, an independent pub suffered badly after a fire caused 40million worth of damage. When asked about these issues, Nash replies: ""I think it's taken every single party involved too long. They should have been sorting this out 10 years ago!"" In fairness, we're not sure how much money went towards things like marketing campaigns explaining to local residents what the new premises offered beyond a free burger lunches once a fortnight but the lacklustre sales figures certainly don't reflect the level of excitement surrounding its launch. On social media everyone seems excited except the merchants themselves. This only serves to highlight their frustration with their inability to find support among potential customers. As David Cox of Irish business consultancy firm SME Advisers tells us, ""They need to explain what they offer, what is special about them - both literally and figuratively."" A common complaint is that the vast majority of businesses in Friar Square have not done so since they joined a franchise network called Pawnbrokers. Franchises allow members to benefit from economies of scale. Businesses pay franchise fees based on turnover allowing owners to buy better equipment, train staff more efficiently, operate in larger spaces and access bigger discounts on rent etc. New chains including BHS, Karen Millen and Co Op are chasing new franchises in England. By joining a franchise you effectively surrender control of your business to others and become part of a brand group focused on expansion. When Citygate bought the Pawnbroker network in 2007 it promised the individual operations would remain unchanged - and that promise appears to have largely failed. Several franchise groups declined to comment having made a large media advertising campaign highlighting their location or other factors desired in the mix between 1st - 2nd? and 4th, 8. may serve 3",0,626

"It's rare that the company delves too far into how the ""magic"" - as they call it - works. Their logic is a magic trick doesn't get better if you can see through to its illusion, and so we're left with vague descriptions of what makes their cameras such amazing devices... The Magic Pocket Camera exists in an artificially created world where every photo taken by it appears perfectly fine, but has been done on a professional level using several million dollars' worth of equipment. Its consumers just want a camera which will do exactly as advertised: take great photos whilst conveniently fitting inside their pocket or purse. If we didn't have this magical device, our lives would be very dull indeed... and boring! There are many other ways to achieve the same result without having a specialised cameraphone sitting at home taking your pictures all day long for free, alas people like me don't live there and aren't allowed access for obvious reasons (e.g., because I'm an old man). But now thanks to this new revolutionary gadget that gives us instant feedback from the camera itself, even though it may not look particularly photogenic, our lives won't be quite so lacking entertainment when faced with impossibly busy public places like supermarkets again... And who knows? Life might become somewhat more interesting as well. We know nothing about these things yet, only what Samsung tells us, but nevertheless we trust them implicitly. The risks are insignificant, since our entire backup system depends on being able to point out easily identifiable signs, warnings, emergency exits etc. Clearly we'll never need an alarm on our doors nor any burglar alarms in case of attack. Moreover - something else we've already mentioned before - once we realize how much money we could save by stopping spending hundreds each year on photography lessons, we'll finally feel motivated to learn some basics ourselves instead. So forget those fancy expensive digital SLRs and lenses right away. Or stop pretending we still remember how they work anymore; after all, why should we care unless we really miss shooting films? With the Magic Mobile Phone Camera everyone was happy, until someone pointed out one small thing: although everything looks perfect amidst the bright background of the supermarket shelves, our faces appear rather flat compared to the rest... Now we cannot help feeling cheated, cheated of a truly beautiful picture proven to be absolutely real by the most sophisticated image processing systems known to mankind today. Our stately portraits suddenly seem ugly enough to make us ashamed... It gets worse. Someone with experience at retouching said he'd spent half his life learning to improve professional images by editing digital photographs down to size. He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that the actual results had hardly changed at all. A few pixels here, three extra dots there, and there goes our face next time round... Not surprisingly, among the grandchildren of experts there were also plenty offering opinions that claimed this quality wouldn't go amiss in magazines or glossy papers used to sell condiments on the market either... Then the children began crying. No-one knew whether human tears actually stained a genuine photograph made with a mobile phone camera, or whether simply seeing the pictures took their minds off missing grandma for a moment longer... There must be more to it than meets the eye. If there isn't then no problem, let's keep going along the path we've set out for ourselves back then. Let's enjoy looking forward to receiving our postcards later on and talking nostalgically over dinner about old times together. No problems there. What did bother us occasionally wasn't knowing if a similar situation would come up again, or if the visual effects of the foodstuffs we placed under examination weren't exactly full-proof. But soon we realized that not even photo journalists doing serious research could find anything wrong with the products examined. After all, couldn't they ask anyone selling them a quick question like 'How was the last delivery organised?' and always receive a truthful answer explaining that 'Everything went smoothly'? Incidentally, however much we try to think logically about it, none of us ever bothered asking any employees responsible for ordering goods online if they were sure they had the correct items, only the number of packages sent out and received... Even the army of stock specialists monitoring product reliability based solely on the information provided by local suppliers showed little interest in investigating the truth behind those samples presented to them. They knew virtually everybody involved, including staff themselves, and presumably would have seen something fishy somewhere in that process at least once... On top of that, they expected the recipient of the package to immediately leap upon the delivery person and demand explanations afterwards... Well, obviously this just happens to be true for ordinary citizens as well, except perhaps any who buy their own groceries nowadays. All the others had clearly learned their lesson during childhood, given that the majority of package recipients accept whatever comes in their letter boxes at face value, and never complain if their order arrives late. In fact the error rate is usually fairly low, despite extensive testing having shown that most customers prefer to blame their postal service provider for delays rather than prove otherwise outdated methods (and they) get out signless carriers' attempts to return to leave instructions to identify the first ech outrate's telephone calls when delivering users'",0,629
"The end-of-season event gets under way on Sunday, with more than 250,000 spectators expected across eight days. Security is under review but the same measures are in place as last year This article is part of a series from Africa's rising stars for Guardian Cities Khartoum - Thousands have already started packing into Khartoum's vast sports complex to watch Sudan play host to this summer's Gulf Cup football tournament. The stadium has been ready since April, when it was first announced that the tournament would be coming to Sudan. But many people will miss out because they don't own tickets and so plan their trips around whether or not games are being played at home.

Photograph: Mohammed HamdanAFP via Getty Images Al Fahaiba stadium hosts 70,000 fans inside its four enclosures while each stands can hold an additional 10,000 who stand along the pitch. For most visitors, watching the matches takes up less time than going shopping; Al Shaab Park is full every day until late at night. There are also several other events taking place over the entire month, including cycling races, rugby tournaments and diving championships. A few thousand extra tents have sprouted along the Nile River, where vendors sell everything from falafel sandwiches to beer. Sudanese police were deployed 2km (1 mile) away from the campground on Friday after clashes broke out during protests against corruption earlier in the week. They were joined by hundreds of security personnel from neighbouring countries, such as Uganda and Kenya. But there have been none of the violent demonstrations seen elsewhere in Africa since South African president Jacob Zuma visited Khartoum last December. Police remain stationed along all roads leading to Al Shabaab sport centre and the protest march ended peacefully without any arrests made. Organisers said 19 people had been injured and one person died when he fell off his motorbike into traffic. Away from the frontline, life continues much as usual. Neighbours continue to trade despite international sanctions imposed due to President Omar al Bashir's government's alleged complicity with Islamist militants and human rights abuses. People go about building new homes for families returning from exile, or studying or working abroad. Others make small repairs which keep them employed. Most worryingly, despite repeated attempts by UN officials to broker peace negotiations, tensions remain high. As always, uncertainty lingers. UN mediator Nicholas Haysom returned to Sudan last Thursday following two months of talks with rebel leaders based in Burketi refugee camps in Ethiopia. He hopes to strike a deal in mid-August before presidential elections scheduled for 9 October. For those who need evidence of progress, however, Khartoum feels like Groundhog Day. Weeks ago, political parties agreed terms allowing Mr Bashir to run again in his third term in office. ""Despite numerous violations of our constitution, we decided to accept the result ... as long as we get something tangible through mediation process"" says Yasser Nour Abdelnabi, former deputy speaker of parliament. Still, preparing for next year's election campaign hasn't stopped the government from cracking down further. Last month, 150 activists were arrested protesting land seizures. This week authorities raided opposition party headquarters in Khartoum, arresting dozens of staff members and confiscating computers, telephones and files containing details sensitive information. Some say opponents are still reeling from previous years' crackdowns, including detentions, beatings, torture and arbitrary arrest. In March 2017 alone, 50 civilians were killed across protests held throughout Darfur region. The situation remains dire for the estimated three million internally displaced persons scattered across 32 states, mostly living in border areas where food supplies are scarce and access limited. ""I am afraid if I leave my house by myself, someone might kill me here [in Sudan] or take what little money I earn as extortion,"" says 17-year old student Amera Ali who now lives in a precarious tent near the United Nations compound. She didn't attend school regularly until she was 12. ""If you live far away from your parents you must grow up fast. You cannot wait to visit your parent's houses. If you do, some militias may shoot you,"" adds her friend Samuel Ahmed.

This led to him pleading guilty to handling stolen goods and he received an 18 month suspended sentence. He also spent time with the Parole Board for using cannabis before he was released back onto the streets. In 2008, Roberts tried again - this time armed with two guns - breaking into three homes within 48 hours. His weapon ended up in plain sight in one house, where people lived unaware of what he intended to do once inside. Finally arrested yet again in 2009 for possession of drugs, Roberts told officers: ""I will never stop until I am dead. They need killing. My life is now dedicated to revenge... I want you all to suffer like I have done. You are going to die just like me. It is my mission!""",0,640
"Media playback is not supported on this device The 34-year-old beat three-time champion Tony Martin by 26.23 seconds on a hilly 47.1km course in Spain. After finishing second to Martin at the 2012 world championships, Cavendish said he had been ""fortunate"" and that his victory was down to luck. But since then he has struggled for form and distance while racing in Germany and Italy with Team Sky - where he also won stages of last year's Tour de France but often failed to finish. He also lost out on overall victories during the latter part of 2011 when third place finishes behind Mark Renshaw helped him secure fourth spot in the final standings rather than first as expected because of time bonuses. The 31-year-old German rider finished fifth today after losing contact early in the race as Cavendish attacked solo through a group containing several riders including eventual winner Peter Sagan (Cannondale) and Vincenzo Nibali (Astana). Cavendish applied maximum force throughout much of the stage but unlike yesterday, it resulted in success without any apparent trouble. It could be argued that there were no other real contenders left between him and Martin: none of them made significant moves forward over the subsequent 80 kilometres along winding roads and tracks before reaching the foot of the Conche d'Osma climb just outside Olbia. In fact the only sprinter who looked like being able to make an impact was Australian Michael Matthews, whose Cervelo team took their best chance of forcing action from an earlier breakaway which contained six riders. At one point they briefly broke clear before being reeled back into the peloton but Matthews did have some company later in the day from Britain's Simon Yates who joined Miguel Angel Lopez (Omega Pharma Quick Step), Danilo Di Luca (Lampre Merida) and Eduard Prades Serrasolmete (Saxo Bank Tinkoff Bank) among others.

West Midlands Police said a post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Dhariwal had died as a result of head injuries sustained during an assault. The incident occurred shortly after midnight yesterday when officers were called to reports of a stabbing. At the scene they found Mr Dhariwal suffering from stab wounds.

"The rail union is calling on the Scottish government to set out an immediate timetable for Abellio to be stripped of its ScotRail franchise. It has said making Scotland's railways safer and more reliable after years of mismanagement will take time, but urged the new administration to act quickly as it prepares a report in December that could trigger another franchise review. Iain Cameron wrote: ""This is not about money or whether we'll get a better deal elsewhere - our members simply want to see safety put first."" Petitioners have also been told by pro-coup campaigners they must pay 10 each before their names can appear on vote cards supplied with ballot papers. They are being asked to clarify how this amounts to blackmail and threats of physical harm. The activists include former SNP MSP David Torrance who helped deliver the controversial referendum result. He believes there was no consensus among Yes voters when they backed independence at last year's Holyrood election. In Westminster he joined forces with Labour peer Lord Carlile as co-chairman of Better Together. But today he is one of those behind Operation Yellowhammer - whose aim is to oust Nicola Sturgeon from office before she can push through legislation giving Scots control over their own affairs. Mr Cameron said: ""It seems wrong to ask people to sign up without knowing what kind of support and solidarity will come along side them and I think it's unfair to make claims against individuals if they haven't signed up yet. Most importantly it's wrong to pressure anyone into signing up under threat of violence."" A spokesman added any protest group threatening serious violence should expect to face police action. This comes amid warnings that the final countdown to polling day remains fraught with danger. Voting experts say protests around polling stations across the country risk causing chaos just days before 1 October - especially with two parties contesting every seat - because there may be so many candidates standing. Earlier yesterday Adam Tomkins, the Secretary of State for Scotland's Electoral Commission, warned political groups attempting to disrupt voting centres were putting themselves at unnecessary personal risk. Writing exclusively for PoliticsHome ahead of Thursday's local elections, he said: ""We know that some organisations plan to use intimidation tactics such as mass demonstrations in order to prevent others from casting votes; pushing supporters towards booths where they don't belong; disrupting polls and taking ballots away once cast. Unfortunately these activities present potential risks to both officials involved and other electors trying to exercise their legal right to register and participate in the democratic process.' 'Any organisation intending to threaten disorder running counter to electoral law, including force or the threat thereof shall be guilty of an offence which carries prosecution andor significant penalties.' We urge all elected representatives and party leaders to campaign peacefully and rationally throughout next week during the crucial period leading upto polling day, while keeping within the law. If they do this then there's little doubt that the vote itself will be conducted calmly, efficiently and fairly,' Mr Tomkins added. Advertisement",0,643

"Noah Zunde, who was 22 months old, succumbed to heatstroke after being left in the car for seven hours. His mother, Romy Zunde, had mistakenly believed she dropped Noah at daycare and then went on her way. She told police that once they realized their mistake, she rushed back home with a bottle of water but didn't realize the temperature hadn't cooled down enough inside the vehicle. She said she forgot about him until he began crying. At this point, police believe two other children were also in the SUV and may have been trapped as well because no one else came forward to look for them. It is unclear if the siblings, ages 2-3 years old, survived or not. Police are still investigating how long it took before someone saw Noah lying lifelessly near some toys strewn across the floor while his mother continued to drive around town like nothing was wrong. Police later found out that Romy wasn't working outside the house either. The family's two dogs died from overheating as well. But there were more tragic deaths: A 4 year old child suffered third degree burns over 70 percent of his body due to hot windows, as did an infant twin brother (he passed away) both suffering accidental injuries. And the death toll keeps growing by each passing hour; so far, the number of injured has risen since noon to nearly 180 people! The best news? Firefighters rescued five others after pulling 14 victims out of vehicles. Two survivors are now in ICU under observation and another four are stable. Doctors say many could be dead if the rescue squad weren't called as quickly. So what happened here? According to authorities, there aren't any laws in place requiring parents drop off kids alone in cars. They had initially looked into getting airbags installed in new vehicles, though apparently only those models equipped between 1997 - 2001. Now, all domestic automakers will add these devices starting next month - the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says drivers can use the airbag system even when kids are strapped into safety seats. Even with the added protection, parents should continue to follow storage directions, keep their keys locked up safely, etc., much just like you would do without the air bags.

"They were able to hold a metal plate a few centimetres above the rabbit's chest and use it to regulate the animal's heartbeat. If such medical implants could be made artificially small enough, they might even make sense for humans too, as temporary or even permanent heart pacemakers. But today's advances in microtechnology have not yet reached that stage of miniaturization, said Dr. Gregor Wergin from Stanford University in California. ""The problem is that these very tiny devices require electrical stimulation,"" he told BBC News. That means you need energy sources large enough - and powerful enough - to generate electricity at the point where the implant needs power.""It will take many years before clinical applications are possible here and we're not there yet."" Another problem with implanting artificial hearts is the risk that blood clots form around them if used outside hospitals in people who don't drink any alcohol. The researchers say an alternative would be to place electrodes on the inside walls of the bladder so signals can travel through spinal cord nerves to stimulate muscles controlling the sphincter of the urinary tract. To achieve this, scientists would first have to develop miniature sensors which could detect when urine was being produced by the kidney or bladder wall itself. Then neural impulses could be sent into those tissues using catheters inserted up the urethra - the tube going straight down from the back passage.

"Just minutes after leaving harbour, the ferry capsized. 193 people were killed in the tragedy. Belfast man Bill McCrea was more than 1,500 miles away in Kent, when the ship sank but he returned to Ireland and immediately went into action for the survivors. I arrived at Dublin Airport on 23rd September 1990, just as a huge crowd of relatives started arriving there from different parts of England. I had been told that they would be met by my father or an uncle who lived nearby so went out looking for them. Soon afterwards my mother called me over to one side where she said ""There's going to be no family reunion tonight - you have a phone call instead!"" On hearing this news, I turned around and saw two small figures coming towards us through the airport concourse. It looked like it might be my parents because neither could walk properly due to their grief yet both shook my hand firmly. We spent more time with each other than our own families did during those first weeks following the disaster. The little girl was only six years old then - now she has her whole life ahead of her.

He appeared physically much older than his age because of all the stress of trying not to show emotion while he listened intently to everything we tried telling him. His name is Andrew Boothroyd-Baines. This picture shows how exhausted he looked on arrival back here nearly four months after the accident. Now 21 years old, he still suffers flashbacks and nightmares three times every week. At weekends he attends counselling sessions held in his local church hall which helps to alleviate these horrific memories.

My wife Nicola wanted to go straight round to Margate for some fresh air but I insisted I take something stronger.' Tragically Bill never found out if his teenage daughter Savannah survived. But he says he feels lucky to live in such a safe place where things like this don't happen anymore. Bill said: 'She died saving others and helping put herself inside the boat to try and stop her falling down the stairs onto our deck, possibly taking someone else along with her. She didn't make it unfortunately.' After being told of Savannah's death Bill headed straight down to Chatham Police station to appeal for information regarding her whereabouts. Within hours detectives received a tipoff that a young woman matching the description of Savannah Brennan had gone missing earlier that morning. Searchers combed the beach near Margate Pier searching high and low to see whether she'd surfaced alive. In vain. At 5pm police announced that the 17-year-old had become lost on waterlogged sand dunes between South Level Sands and Leaskem Park Beach. Her body was discovered 300 yards south east of High Street pier, half covered by brackish tidal mudflats at 10pm. An autopsy determined that she drowned and suffered fractured ribs either as a result of jumping aboard the vessel or a fall whilst climbing up its companionway steps. My heart goes out to Bill and Savannah's distraught surviving siblings. They need reassurance that justice will be done to bring whoever murdered their sibling to book.

"Both sustained leg injuries in the incident on Thursday. A spokesman for the force said one of the two male officers had been discharged from the Princess Elizabeth Hospital. The other was being treated at a Brisbane hospital, he added A 23-year old man has appeared in the Southport Magistrates Court today charged with wounding police after allegedly stabbing them during an arrest last week. Police allege that Fernando Martinez stabbed both men and also struck another officer as they attempted to restrain him inside his home about 4am on August 17th. Officers were attempting to make a forced entry into Mr Martinez's house when they say he attacked them armed with knives and a machete. He is due back in court later this month. It's believed the injured policeman released himself shortly afterwards but remains under medical treatment. Then why didn't you mention it? Oh right. You're an MPP. People don't get voted out unless there are good reasons behind their removal. If your leader doesn't resign then you either have a chance or no chance. So what do you think? Should Pauline Marois stay on until election day if she can not win? Or should she quit now while her party still retains its seat (s) and position of minority government without enough seats to form the next Government? Since you've brought up my job I would like to point out that people tend to vote based upon personal opinion rather than political opinions, and therefore I am more accurate in predicting how elections will turn out than anyone who claims otherwise. Sorry I'm just pointing this out because most readers probably won't bother reading anymore posts before voting, so here goes: Last time Quebec did go to a second round between CharestAllaire (a very conservative pro independence coalition which ran against Projet Montreal) and LiseeMarion Netik (another conservative team formed by former QSers). After polling day showed a razor thin victory going to Allaire, since everyone knew that it was unlikely for Charest's side to hold onto power, many commentators claimed that Lisee et al lost by only 7 despite having pitted themselves against a strong candidate. Guess what happened though? Even though polls suggested that Lisee et all would be comfortably beaten, voters went LISEE! And once again... a few days ago Quebecers casted ballots for a Coalition Liberal Party run by Lisee who went down to defeat yet again. I'll leave it to those who know better to figure out whether to believe me or not. Needless to say, I was spot on regarding September 9th and October 24th Quebec Elections. Now ask yourself... ""Is the same thing happening again?"" Most likely yes. In fact, I feel fairly confident saying it will happen this time too. Why? Well look around you. Not long ago Pauline Marois' Liberals held 41 support followed closely by the Parti quebecois with 35. Today however both parties sit at 45, with perhaps even lower numbers ahead of schedule. This means that any new entity must consist of ten times the amount of votes as either of these traditionalist parties combined (in percentages). That alone makes the task of creating such a third pillar pretty daunting. However with the economy improving (while still remaining admittedly weak), unemployment rates dropping and debt levels decreasing, the Parti liberal du Quebec appear to already be falling apart internally. They are running three different kinds of candidates in 40 ridings across the province. Thirty odd years ago Premier Daniel Johnson took over leadership of his party when Rene Levesque resigned. One year earlier Levesque surged past Robert Bourassa to become the premier of Quebec. Ever wonder where the term 'Levesque le Gouvernement"" came from? There used to be a lot of talk about the LPQ becoming a tool for separatism in 1994, however nothing ever resulted except PQ MLA Edouard Cloutier trying to pass laws allowing discrimination against francophones, among other things. The LPQ became increasingly irrelevant to French Quebeckers following the 1995 referendum defeat. From thereon Trudeau Liberals continued raising money hand over fist whilst espousing 'Quebec values.' Pierre Trudeau's daughter Margaret famously stated that the rights of Franco Canadians could never be compromised. Fast forward almost 20 years and this is exactly what we see today. Increasingly unpopular in English Canada, the Liberals are in effect calling for secession of the part d'Angleterre from the rest of Canada. Perhaps the worst example may be seen in Ottawa. On January 29, 2011 at 11:30 AM, a lone dissident Liberal MP named Patrick Brazeau addressed Parliament asking Prime Minister Stephen Harper to reconsider recent decisions made in favour of Quebec. At 12 PM Eastern Time, hundreds of protesters gathered outside of the Canadian Museum of Civilization. Many carried signs proclaiming, ""Quit Playing With Fire; We Want Separation; Save Our Language.""

"Media playback is unsupported on your device 12 July 2015 Last updated at 01:20 BST The BBC's Mohamed Madi went to Soho's Greek Street to find out. Produced by Marcus Chown and Mark Campbell In the summer of 2005, a teenage boy with long hair walked into a record shop in north London called Borderline Records. He was excited - his band had just signed their first major record contract, but they did not have a singer yet. So he asked the owner for help. ""I said 'I'm looking for someone who can sing like David Bowie, says Richard Jameson. He played him 10 seconds of one song on an old demo CD that he'd been working on during his lunch breaks from school. And it worked. Within weeks, Benji Hughes joined the group as frontman and lead vocalist. They became a bit-part cult act until 2006 when they made headlines again. That year saw them release two top 40 albums (with more than 5 million combined sales), tour the world playing massive arenas including Earls Court and Wembley Stadiums, play Glastonbury Festival and headline Reading and Leeds Festivals. Their songs began appearing in films such as Stardust and 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. But then something happened. Something changed. Almost overnight, Biffy Clyro were no longer a self contained unit. They sold 74 fewer records and lost 200 a week. Benji left after the third album and the remaining members split their time between music gigs and selling shoes online. It all seemed so pointless... ""It was kind of weird,"" admits drummer Simon Neil. ""Four years later we got back together."" Now they are back bigger than ever and touring next month in support of new single Black Chandelier. Yet none of this would be possible without that fateful day back in 2005 when Richard decided to give his friend's band another chance. Briefly, here's what you need to know about these guys whose sound may remind some people of late 90s indie rock acts such as Mojo Nixon or Pulp. There is very little substance behind much of anything they do. Benji once told me that he believes there should only be three rules in life: Rule One Do Unto Others, Rule Two Thou Shalt Not Kill and Rule Three If You Don't Know Then Ask A Question! As far as I could tell, those rule must relate directly to death metal bands; which means if I want to get through half of any interview with them I'll end up making references to blue balls, projectile vomiting and suicide. None of whom inspire confidence. Benji's favourite anecdote is how an interviewer pressed him on whether anyone else apart from himself wanted to kill themselves before they turned 30. Their debut album has now aged quite well, even though they haven't released anything since 2007. After that came 2011's EP Unearthed2 on All About Vinyl Records (the vinyl version included four extra tracks). For fans it's a real gem because it contains previously unrecorded demos recorded over many months while under pressure to hit deadlines set by label bosses. In June 2013, they released two EPs From Her To Eternity in 2014 and English Wine in February last year. The key thing that separates them from other bands is that everyone plays guitar except for Benji who usually sings alone. So what does that mean anyway? Well, as soon as they started getting attention, being asked questions like this caused them strain. Listeners might assume that having 16 guitars going off simultaneously makes great noise. Which in theory is true but actually doesn't make sense unless each person is using different parts of the fretboard and creating tension rather than harmonious notes. Add musical chops to make nice choruses, instrumental solos and a tight rhythm section and the result is really nothing special. When it comes to soloing, the best technique I've seen involves mountain climbing. Imagine sitting down somewhere comfortable, pressing your feet against the ground and leaning forwards with hands resting lightly on knees. This simple action will stretch muscles in legs and arms perfectly ready to propel you upwards outwards with both hands firmly placed upon a stainless steel finger board. But don't expect too many encore moments from either guitarist. Once you're in position, you won't move again for probably hours. Another problem is that Biffy are often perceived as obnoxious dicks. No wonder William Rosebery MP has described them as ""a bunch of arrogant arseholes."" According to Simon, musicians always think this way about journalists. He remembers doing interviews where he felt nervous and vulnerable. People judge others based on appearances, and Simon feels guilty immediately for misrepresenting himself. At least that wasn't the case with speaking to Richard. How refreshing to speak to somebody who seems happy to answer honestly whatever question you ask. About six years ago, I interviewed Nick Cave about Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon. During the course of the conversation, we talked frequently about wine, my review of abhA test route among the fine variety.

"Entertainers Starkidz were ""cornered"" by the gang after a Christmas lights switch-on in Formby, Merseyside. The performers, including one as young as 13, were abused, with one punched and another dragged to the ground while being kicked.

Three others have been bailed until further notice pending inquiries into the incident that took place last month between 6pm and 8pm at Thompson Road in Formby's Norris Green district. A fifth man remained a suspect but had not yet been charged when news broke yesterday about his arrest this week for an unrelated offence. It is understood he has now also been released without charge. North West Police say no offences are believed to be related to the shocking attack. North Wales Police described the offenders as: ""Asian or South Asian males aged 1617."" A spokesman said they think there may have been more than five attackers involved.

"3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy a bigger house It was the largest divorce settlement in history. In January this year, Shanghai couple Zhang Jun and Sun Shuai gave up their seven-year marriage after furious jostling over ""joint assets"" they had intended to share with equal shares; instead, Mr Zhang took home 60 per cent of what he was due by law, while his wife got 40 per cent plus interest accumulated during the seven years of cohabitation. The couple separated shortly afterwards but have since teamed again under another name - together they bought an apartment valued at 1 million. It seems that both men and women can find ways around Chinese divorce laws if they really want to get divorced without losing out financially. As we reported earlier this month, according to government figures from 2011, more than 20,000 people went on record as having given up their marriages because of money issues (China Daily). Some of them paid hefty sums to speed things along. A judge who married off 35 couples in 2015 spent 157,000 (113,700) buying 70 iPhone apps, including Tinder, Meet Me, Geico Insurance Car Rental and UberEats - all designed to help people fall pregnant quickly. And then there were five state agents dispatched across north-eastern China who used police tactics to impersonate divorce lawyers and threaten clients into signing contracts agreeing to cash settlements ranging from 1m yuan to 2.2m yuan (190,900-380,300), or 50 per cent to 80 per cent of marital wealth respectively. Even though these weren't real lawyers, it worked like magic, according to one lawyer involved in the research whose findings appeared in Caixin magazine. He said the scheme made him feel ashamed. But no sooner did the article run online when consumers began complaining about how cheap the schemes were compared with real legal fees, which start at 5,500 yuan. One man complained that his 752,000 yuan deal came close to breaking even, adding only 120,000 yuan to his capital gains. Other media reports say dodgy agents may be selling the services of ""fake expert witnesses,"" calling themselves experts using papers signed in front of cameras to make sure customers understand how much each party will receive. Shanghai residents Frank Wu and Ling Shi ask whether you should trust any agency offering such services, adding: ""We're afraid that our case could end up being decided against us."" As well as disguising themselves as lawyers, officials are also employing dubious techniques to win custody battles. In May 2016, a 56-year old woman named Qian Hongping wrote an appeal letter to her ex-husband, saying she wanted the courts to grant her full control of their three children. She accused her husband of ignoring child support payments, refusing to let the kids visit grandparents, and forbidding them from talking to friends. Her words left few doubters. But how exactly does propaganda triumph over fact? We caught up with Ms Qian to learn why she felt compelled to write her letter. Interviews with other prominent suspects revealed similar stories of abuse. Another version of the same story has been published recently involving a 71-year old man called Huang Chenggang who gained sole ownership of two flats worth 10m yuan and 13m yuan respectively through the use of forged documents - specifically certificates showing the properties belong solely to him. This time, however, the fraudsters didn't give up until they'd won complete control. Since going public, Mr Huang says he now lives alone in one flat, with his elderly mother in the second. He refuses to speak to reporters, but details of his case appear online, accompanied by photographs of the flat where his father died last week. Here, too, the main character appears unwell. His face shows signs of dementia and fingers are curled up involuntarily as if weakened by illness. When asked about family members' reactions, he replies: ""My parents don't talk to me."" At first glance, Mr Huang sounds just like a typical victim of a scammer. However, Mr Huang claims to know something most of us would prefer not to admit: That many families struggle to come to terms with reality. If anything, he blames himself for failing to communicate better with his parents. According to others interviewed, Mr Huang suffers from severe depression related to losing his beloved son two decades ago. Others suggest he probably lost touch with reality ever since. But regardless of whether Mr Huang knows the difference between right and wrong, the truth is clear: Many vulnerable citizens who say otherwise are actually victims of deception and manipulation. 4 July 2015 Overblown real estate boom On 16 June, the People's Bank of China announced its latest moves to manage runaway housing prices.

"The Scot dug deep to claim a 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-4) victory in a match that lasted two hours 59 minutes. He recovered from two breaks of serve in the first set, served out his second successive World number one ranking and became only the third man after Pete Sampras and Novak Djokovic - each with five such wins on tour - to reach the final at Wimbledon without dropping a rubber. It was also the fifth time Murray has claimed 10 games against Federer this year but there were no signs of fatigue or exhaustion as he held off Federer's strong challenge just before an hour had elapsed. There were seven deuces to begin the contest, three break points for Federer in game four and 14 unforced errors in total between them over what turned into a long battle which ended when Murray picked up serve with 18 remaining. Federer responded by reaching 3-1 ahead in the fourth set but broke back immediately to level things again after double faults from both players made it 69 all. The Swiss then appeared to be cruising towards victory until another double fault gifted Murray consecutive service holds. In fact the whole sequence proved costly because while serving at 5 - 4015 and nervousness is understandable given how close the last few times they have met here - Murray let down his guard slightly and paid dearly with a weak forehand cross-court passing shot giving away 20 precious seconds. It wasn't enough to save him from losing the next point too once Federer converted on his first attempt.

His love affair with rugby league began when he worked alongside Brian Davy Jones (the NRL 'Mr Rugby League) during World Cup matches played between England and France in Paris, 1972; this led to him appearing before packed houses across the UK on ITV's coverage of Wigan v Widnes RFL Challenge match in 1975, which incidentally drew a crowd close to 50 000. In 1976 he presented Live On Two for Channel 9 from Sydney for Britain's first televised international sporting event, namely the Olympic Games held in Montreal, Canada.

That follows claims by the Pentagon today that Russian jets hit under Islamic State control a convoy of ammunition trucks near Kobane city in northern Aleppo province close to where Kurdish fighters backed up by U.S.-led coalition aircraft took back two towns earlier this week from IS jihadists. Meanwhile, Turkey warned against using force against Ankara's borders after Turkish warplanes allegedly struck inside Iraq late yesterday, killing five people including three children according to one Iraqi government source. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the attack, saying: 'We expect those responsible... to pay appropriate compensation.' His ministry later denied reports that the planes bombed militants involved in operations along their border with Syria. In exchange, Washington agreed to send unarmed surveillance drones and Apache helicopters to work alongside Turkey's air force, which launched jet strikes targeting Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels during clashes in July. These attacks killed 31 members of the group, whom NATO says are linked to the banned PKK separatist movement within Turkey itself. In response to these developments, Erdogan threatened to launch crossborder raids himself. Turkey views the YPG as nothing less than terrorists aligned with the outlawed PKK. It fears their presence further eastward toward Afrin threatens its own security. China wants to see the Korean peninsula free of nuclear arms before suspending food assistance to Pyongyang, Chinese state media reported Thursday. Beijing decided a few days ago to stop sending grain shipments to North Korea but analysts say China may want assurance Seoul takes a hard line against Pyongyang ahead of a meeting between South Korean leader Park Geunhye and China's Xi Jinping next month, news agency Xinhua said. ""South Korea should always make clear things can get worse if North Korea continues provocations,"" Xinhua cited Huang Huikang, director general of the Asia Institute think tank affiliated with the Communist party mouthpiece People's Daily, as saying. ""It must show proper attitudes and stand firmly by upholding sanctions."" Concerned over Pyongyang's recent ballistic missile test and long range rocket launches, China lifted some restrictions on trade. However, it opposes wider economic engagement as part of what it sees as Seoul's push towards rapprochement with Japan's rightwing Abe administration. Meanwhile, India announced Tuesday that it too would halt fuel supplies to North Korea until June, following similar moves by Australia and New Zealand. World powers broadly oppose Pyongyang's repeated defiance of United Nations resolutions banning development of atomic bombs and missiles capable of delivering warheads outside their country's landmass. A fifth round of global sanctions imposed last year carries stiffer punishment than previous rounds approved by the 15-nation body, although many of the measures remain unimplemented so far. Backing away From Talks South Korea has abandoned hopes for dialogue with North Korea without preconditions, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eui Kook said Friday. No progress or breakthrough has occurred on denuclearization despite months of negotiations and inter-Korean summits, Lee Sang Hun, deputy director of democracy promotion research institute Sejong Institute, told Yonhap News Agency. With North Korea apparently moving closer to developing medium-range, submarine-launched missiles that would threaten much of continental Europe, 'dialogue alone cannot succeed,' said Lian Sung Kyung Hoong, professor emeritus at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies.

"PC Gareth Browning, 33, was on foot in Whitley, Reading on 30 November when he was hit by a black Mazda Aerosport driven by Luke Haywood, 28. Haywood admitted causing death by dangerous driving and sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court last year said the ""brutal"" crash would have killed him if his wife Sarah had not escaped injury. He managed to escape but Mrs Browning suffered permanent injuries including brain damage and will never walk again and is now blind. A petition calling for Mr Haywood's licence to be revoked passed more than 1,000 signatures and it appears that this outrage may finally result in an immediate ban. The campaign has been gathering momentum ever since their daughter Grace died of her injuries eight months ago. Her mum Michelle Caulfield-Browning told BBC News: ""It's great news that they are going to revoke his license as soon as possible."" The petition can still be signed here -",0,692

"Media playback is not supported on this device Kyrgios, 21, lost 7-5 6-1 6-4 to British number one Andy Murray in Monday's much-anticipated last-16 tie. ""I hope he sees the door"" - that was how Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios reacted after his defeat by Britain's Andy Murray at Wimbledon 2014, and it will be interesting whether or not he says anything similar today about Roger Federer now his conqueror of him has gone out as well... Kyrgios may have been too busy celebrating a place in the final eight for us to get any quotes from him but what did we learn? He talked himself up before the match saying: 'It means I can't lose no matter who comes my way'. In fact that prediction proved pretty accurate with first and second sets going quite easily although there were some nervy moments during the third set which could result in something considerably better than eventuality if they come together again. The young Aussie admitted afterwards that the loss had taken its toll physically but mentally he seemed to remain positive despite losing only three games when serving for victory in the deciding set. Even though he ended up losing 8-7 in the decider you got the feeling he would rather have won the whole thing and become champion of the world - which he almost managed earlier this year. The 20th seed believes he really must take those lessons into next week. On court: Ferrer wins over Rosol 17-14 4-6 2-0 retired due to back strain; Djokovic vs Raonic (seeded 3) goes ahead because Tsonga withdraws - both men are even through two matches; Nadal ends Ivanisevic 0-3 6-2 1-0 6-3 win and reaches fourth round at age 29. Nole said later yesterday that he felt fine after beating Juan Monaco in the semi-final, so he'll probably fly straight home to Florida after being unable to keep playing until tomorrow night. That should mean Rafa takes another day off tomorrow instead of returning to action on Wednesday having already played both Saturday and Sunday since arriving in London - although he does still play David Goffin on Day 5. If he doesn't make the quick return to Miami then you'd expect him back for an early evening session on Tuesday followed late afternoonearly bedtime on Wednesday. [We've edited this story slightly after receiving information from Novak] Although Noleski took four hours 30 minutes to beat Andy Roddick in their quarter-finals match last time out he insisted he wasn't tired near the end of that marathon struggle, unlike tonight. So the chances are he'll follow Federer around like a puppy dog looking for praise all the way through. Here's hoping Nole can maintain his same level of concentration throughout.

"The Hydrus Group, an oil and gas service company, has started work on a specialist manufacturing base at the Brechin Business Park. It is forecast the new development will bring in up to 70 jobs over the next three years By Euan Maxwell Wednesday, 14th July 2018, 2:11 PM Updated Monday, 12th August 2018, 11:15 AM The Hydrus group of companies set out its plans for a 1 million machinery facility that could create more than 60 jobs by year-end. The initiative was announced earlier this month as part of a wider redevelopment plan for Barmy Construction's Brechin business park site in east Scotland. In addition to creating 60 direct employment opportunities over five years - including 30 full time posts - the project would also have ripple effects with its inclusion in a 'green energy growth scheme' offered by the Scottish Government (see box below). Proposals are currently being examined by NHS Tayside but if successful should see the four hectare plot used for renewable projects such as solar panels or wind turbines. According to BBC Panorama veteran reporter John Sweeney, there are growing fears about the condition of construction sites across Britain where he found significant problems from both sides of industry and government. His programme featured undercover footage of workers working on two major building sites; one near Bristol involving large scale renovations to the Millennium Stadium and another at Burnham Deepdale Road where scaffolding collapsed due to shoddy materials. Both incidents saw tradesman injured in accidents. He told Radio 4 Today there were widespread concerns about poor safety standards by contractors and training schemes failing to equip people adequately. There had been a number of fatalities on building sites since 2009 according to figures released last October by regulators Trading Standards. There were 1,300 recorded deaths between April 2012 and September 2017 while 160 fell during the same period because they were crushed under tonnes of rubble. A further 700 died between November 2011 and May 2015 which includes 84 who became trapped when a crane accident sent metal beams falling onto them. Mr Sweeney said the British union Unite estimated around 10 men died every week on average in 2016. Finance minister Meral Taylan said she hoped Turkey's economy can recover faster after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched what many observers called his fifth charm offensive abroad. ""Turkey wants to be seen as a modern country where we do not miss any opportunity and I want us all to act accordingly,"" Taylan told Reuters news agency late on Sunday night following meetings held in London, Geneva and Paris ahead of talks with European Union leaders later this week. Earlier on Monday, her ministry said it was seeking help to develop tourism infrastructure outside Istanbul in areas affected by security threats, without elaborating. Tourism in Turkey has declined sharply in recent months amid political tensions sparked by local polls that failed to give Erdo?an enough seats to win a majority. Confrontations between Turkish police and protesters against referendum results have taken place just kilometres away from Ataturk Airport - ground zero for international flights. Last weekend about 20,000 refugees broke into Turkey from Greece through land borders controlled largely by Syrian opposition fighters Ankara considers terrorists. On Tuesday alone, hundreds fled to Europe via sea routes hoping to reach Greek islands still opposed to hosting thousands more migrants stranded on the continent, some fleeing war zones in Syria and Afghanistan. But despite calls for standoffs at border points, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu warned travel restrictions posed by EU member countries must stay in force until Turkey becomes safer. ""We don't accept anyone breaching these agreements... If you try to secure your own interests by using our hospitality then we won't allow it."" Speaking before visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Monday, Erdogan reiterated his threat to flood Europe with millions of asylum seekers. ""If someone takes (the) steps contrary to our rules, we will open the doors and let everyone enter. We will make life hard for those who violate the law instead of giving lessons,"" he said. Germany took in nearly 800,000 migrants last year - most of whom crossed the Aegean Sea illegally towards west Asia through Turkey - setting off a diplomatic row with Brussels and prompting further criticism from Ankara. A deal struck last summer between Athens and top partner Ankara stipulated only Syrians registered in camps across north Africa and western Iraq and granted no access rights to other nationals. This means those caught trying to cross will face prison sentences ranging between 18 days and eight years.

"Failed leadership candidate Lisa Duffy was having dinner with her staff in Bournemouth on Friday. No action was taken against the curry house, which had completed pre-employment checks. UKIP has never checked a single job applicant before hiring them A survey of more than 3000 candidates for Ukip's first parliamentary election has revealed that nearly half did not know what their party stood for and another third admitted they would vote to remain in the EU even if it meant losing jobs or services from Britain. The findings are likely to raise serious questions about Ukip's ability to recruit people who can win votes as well as attract attention - the two things required by successful politicians. They also show there is still much work to be done among people who are already active supporters of Nigel Farage's anti-EU movement. Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines In total, 25 per cent of applicants said they were ""not sure whether [they] understood exactly what [Ukip] stands for"" while 39 per cent refused to say what its policies would be; 82 per cent said Britain should leave Europe without any conditions attached; 75 per cent backed further immigration controls along European border guards; 66 per cent supported lower taxes. Just over half (52) favoured an end to foreign aid. Party insiders privately acknowledge they need to get better at selling themselves to voters rather than simply relying on Mr Farage, whose celebrity image may come down to being a loudmouth rabble-rouser who attracts media coverage but little else. The results have been laid bare in the latest Survation poll of 2000 registered members of Ukip showing how few people support Mr Farage as leader. Of those polled, only 20 per cent wanted him as Prime Minister after May 7th elections - less than one quarter voters backing David Cameron or Ed Miliband. It seems unlikely he will ever become prime minister however popular his message appears to be. Roger Helmer MEP: 'I am now prepared to give up my seat' Christine Shawcroft, co-chairman of Ukip Suffolk South Central branch, told me: ""We are putting our research into practice here. We are trying to change attitudes and perceptions because we feel this is essential to winning seats."" She claims she got around 80 replies to the adverts posted through Facebook targeted at new Labour supporters looking for jobs, including young mothers keen to return to school, ex-servicemen wanting back into employment and carers seeking part time roles. But most of these prospective recruits said they mainly joined when Mr Farage became leader, and so far Ms Shawcrot says no attempt is made to persuade existing voters to join. Ms Shawsroft believes that changing public perception of Ukip is vital to success given the incoherence and confusion surrounding the party's manifesto pledges and policy positions. A recent example involved the party refusing to endorse plans to withdraw all troops out of Afghanistan within four years because this contradicted statements supporting Nato military intervention elsewhere. And she admits that many potential recruits find it hard to identify anything positive about Ukip beyond opposition to Brussels rule and free market economics. ""There are some great speeches but I don't think anyone actually understands what you stand for,"" one former member emailed after spending five minutes reading a speech by Mr Farage outlining the party policy priorities. ""What does your slogan mean? What do you want to achieve?"" His answer included vague references to defence, policing and law enforcement as well as promises of reduced taxation. ""No wonder you're called Ukip!"" Mr Farage insists on both major parties taking note of the problems caused to Ukip recruitment by mischievous news reports suggesting the party wants British citizens barred from working abroad. He complained last week that one newspaper had described Ukip's stance towards foreigners as 'British First' whereas the party clearly seeks equal treatment across borders. ""It smacks pretty strongly of racist thinking, doesn't it?,"" he asked. He claimed other organisations running similar ads all used versions of the same wording despite objections from Ukip headquarters, adding: ""Workers should be allowed to work anywhere, provided it's fair trade. If someone takes advantage of us then we shouldn't help them."" He insisted that Ukip was committed to increasing levels of foreigner workers but added: ""If they take unfair advantage, then let's treat them fairly.""

"Mohammed Sufiyan Choudry and Zaiur Rahman, both members of the Luton chapter of the banned group Al-Muhajiroun, were caught in an undercover police operation in 2015. Choudry, 23, from Maidenhead, was given a three year community order for encouraging support for Isis online; he had written ""Isis is right"" on his Facebook profile page as well as telling undercover officers that ""it's better to be killed fighting rather than live your life feeling like you are worthless."" Rahman, 22, also from Maidenhead, who acted as editor of the group's magazine Ghumru ala Mujahidin (Warrior Magazine), pleaded guilty to supporting terrorism after secretly filming himself praying at Kensington mosque with other Luton Islamic extremists. He showed these videos to fellow extremist Anjem Choudary when they met in prison just before he was released last month. The men's families have no idea what has happened during their time inside because of strict court rules about disclosure. They said: ""There should be nothing happening there apart from them being locked up - not one single letter or phone call can come out without our permission."" Police do not disclose the identities of those involved if someone dies in custody but the family say this rule does not apply here. Zakaria Bulhan was sentenced earlier today for stabbing his former wife Rhiannon Jones in January 2018. It emerged she feared her ex would kill her and went into hiding under another name while still married to him. The case led to calls for more restrictions on access by press and public after it emerged that prosecutors did not tell court staff beforehand about Ms Jones' fears, despite agreeing to cooperate fully with the defence team. She fell ill shortly afterwards and died several days later - victim number four. Rivalry between rival gangs involving young people incited by gang culture within British jails caused the third death from self-inflicted injuries since December 2017. In the past 12 months there have been seventeen suicides among inmates aged 16 years or older across England and Wales. This compares to eight such deaths recorded over six years prior until June 2016. There have been a further 10 homicides resulting from gang violence since then. Prison service data shows that assaults on prisoners rose 17 per cent between 201314 and 201415. The majority of the cases involve vulnerable individuals being used as muscle by larger groups. A survey of prisoners found that almost half admitted having committed acts of serious bullying against younger comrades. Two thirds wanted the authorities to take steps to protect children from becoming victims themselves. Statistics reveal many inmates become adults behind bars: 33 percent of all offenders convicted in prisons go free within two years of release. Many will reintegrate into communities where they will face pressures which predispose them towards antisocial behaviour - and many lack adequate mental health treatment upon leaving jail. Bury St Edmunds man jailed 'for making bomb threats to four schools' Published duration 21 May 2019 Related Topics Atlee murder trial A 51-year-old Bury St Edmunds man has been jailed for harassing pupils at four local primary schools with hoax telephone calls threatening bombs and shootings. John Mazzini was arrested after alerting West Suffolk Council following ongoing reports of threats made against churches and schools. Staff became concerned in March 2018 when a member of staff reported receiving a threat from a stranger claiming to represent the IRA and claiming responsibility for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox outside Parliament. Mr Mazzini sent pictures of guns and knives on Telegram messaging app to school officials warning them members of gun clubs could attack pupils at nearby Marlborough Green Primary School. In August last year, he contacted council bosses again saying members of a UK terror cell might target mosques near the town centre. During raids later, detectives seized computers containing child abuse images alongside books including How To Load And Fire Glock Pistols and Lethal Force For Beginners. He was charged under Section 5 (1) of Public Order Act 1986 relating to false statements communicated through telecommunications networks. On Friday judges handed down sentences totalling nine months after taking advice from probation services. Sentencing Judge Nigel Peters QC told the defendant: ""You have now served your sentence imprisonment so I am pleased to pass my judgement on you."" He was put on supervision orders which included reporting every week as required and must pay 400 costs after admitting seven offences arising from incidents dating back to 2010.

The film also stars Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife Janet Evans.[910] It has been reported that he will play his own father Charles Manson.[11] In July 2014, it was revealed that Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones would portray Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins respectively.

They remained friends following the success of Mr Mrs Smith and During this time, Jolie approached Pitt to ask if he'd like to direct Burma Road with her. At first, Pitt turned down the offer because he wanted to focus more on directing but eventually agreed after being convinced by Jolie.[2] The project evolved into a 53 million production which went through two directors; Jon Avnet and John Madden before finally being launched on February 21st 2007.[34] Although the shooting schedule called for filming in Thailand over six weeks, only three days were actually completed due to extensive rains caused by Tropical Storm Nargis making BurmaMyanmar virtually inaccessible. Because of these obstacles, many scenes had to be reshot or recast including the lead actors Kang Jeong-hwa, Pae Sanghyun, Moon Sung-keuk and Jung Kyung-ho among others. An alternate ending featuring Wong Kar Wai's original cut version of Final Cut Pas de Deux instead of the international release edited final scene was included on the DVD edition of the picture.[5] Upon its theatrical release in 2008, the film grossed US134million worldwide against budget of around 50million.[6] Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 60 of critics have given the Resident Evil remake positive reviews based on 185 review scores.

"Police are investigating events linked to the funeral and wake of the mother of INLA man Patsy O'Hara, who died in the 1981 hunger strike. Dozens of people wearing military-style uniforms were seen at a Dublin pub with their faces covered - dubbed 'the squad'. People gathered outside the Irish Workers Republican Party (IRSP) headquarters on 25 August 1982 for a memorial service held by members of his family. But only one ceremony took place. Patsy was laid out in an open coffin that day next to three coffins containing other dead activists from both sides: Patrick Gillespie and Jim Ryan from Sinn Fein; David Ervine and Gerry Kelly from PIRA, as well as Rosie Kane whose body had been recovered some weeks earlier. The 17 republicans buried under this mass grave fought for political change through violence. Most of them were Catholic workers and trade unionists killed during The Troubles between 1969 and 1998. Their families believe they were murdered by loyalist paramilitary groups because of their politics or republican involvement in bombing campaigns against Britain's overseas security forces. There is no suspicion of murder but there may have been collusion from within Northern Ireland's law enforcement agencies. That would explain why none of those police officers involved appear ever to have faced prosecution. No charges have yet been brought over the shooting deaths of 13 civilians. That year also saw the publication of H BlockA4 paper stories detailing alleged state torture carried out at Portlaoise Prison around the time of the funerals where dozens of secret graves were found outside Lisburn barracks. In 2008 former IRA prisoner Kevin Lynch won damages when he sued Stormont's justice minister Lord Justice Peter Charleton after he ordered him not to give evidence about prison conditions while having suffered electric shocks and beatings at Castlereagh jail in 1975. Mr Lynch later helped ex-prisoners mark the 20th anniversary of these activities last month. Another claimant, John Teggart of Newtownstewart near Omagh, has described how his father was shot and killed by RUC men following his release in 1976. His death remains unsolved. This week Robert McCartney revealed more details of what happened after Pat Dunne Jr was arrested and imprisoned in 1977. He said soldiers ""tied me up like a rat"" before torturing him into confessing to being part of PIRA. It appears now that another soldier and two policemen also confessed to murdering Patsy although many inside nationalist circles doubt such confessions can be trusted. Mr Lennon strongly suspects the truth will emerge sooner rather than later if it hasn't already. One theory I have heard bandied about is that maybe someone wanted to make sure all eyes would be focused elsewhere during such a public display. A motive might include avoiding further embarrassment that could come from revelations about the 'Squad' operation which took place shortly afterwards. I personally don't endorse anything involving paramilitaries of any description armed or unarmed as ""legitimate protest."" It is simply wrong whether you're protesting ANWR drilling, fracking, waterboarding or whatever else. However as we've been telling our readers since 2003, calling people terrorists isn't going anywhere either, so let's turn the tables and ask... what does terrorism mean? Terrorism means killing innocent humans and sometimes animals at random in order to force your agenda onto others, usually without even asking permission first. Terrorism is using terror tactics against innocents. When the British Empire attacked Russia in WW1 using gas warfare we call that terrorism too. Is such behaviour legitimate or should we condemn it, regardless of its motives? In 2007 The U2 singer Bono published a book called Songs Of Innocence in which he called himself a terrorist - defined as follows:- ""Someone or something responsible for a series of violent acts designed to frighten people."" This is exactly what Patsy did - he violated international laws and created fear among the local population with brutal methods towards innocents. So instead of criticising us for refusing to accept government fairytales about flowers turning into bullets turning into bombs, perhaps the real question here is - do the actions themselves justify the word? Or, put another way, is the use of the term justified in the circumstances? Let's examine each case separately then move on to considering wider issues. To begin with Che Guevara. Was he really a good guy or just an idealistic idiot? If you read his own words he admitted he didn't always act morally during his lifetime but based on the text of his speeches delivered since his assassination he comes across as pretty unashamedly bloodthirsty. And given his famous stance on free education worldwide which meant closing down most churches and schools in Bolivia in 1964 the concept of human rights seems quite alien to him. So yes, I'd say there was plenty of justification for putting him in charge of gunning down journalists, doctors, priests etc. in places like Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. I'm still convinced he deserves the title of devil as far [with due emphasis received by reserve power users of course sterilizing much less desirable effect giving information property great value proposition.

"Stuart Coffey, 44, transferred cash from Bracebridge Heath Medical Practice into his own account between 2008 and 2013. Lincoln Crown Court heard he stole so much money the surgery fell behind in its mortgage payments A GP who secretly filmed patients entering the medical practice with cameras concealed inside their bras was today jailed for nine years at Lincoln crown court. Stuart Coffey, 44, of Chilcote Road, Whittington Park, Copeland, Northumberland, pleaded guilty to four charges relating to dishonest gain by deception on September 20 last year. The offences were committed when Dr Coffey worked as a locum doctor at Bracebridge Health Care Centre and District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between January 2007 and December 2009. He then went abroad where he practised until 2013 before returning to the UK where he continued to practise. On May 5 this year Mr Coffey's wife contacted police saying she had discovered hidden camera equipment in her underwear after they bought new furniture during which time he confessed that ""he had been filming people without telling them."" An investigation revealed doctors were being recorded while attending to male clients at private rooms in the Department of Sexual Medicine unit. Male patients wearing no tops were identified using videos taken without consent and published online. It is not believed any female staff have been targeted but it may happen under different circumstances as some are still working there. One patient said: 'I can't believe what has happened... I'm pretty sure half my body has appeared on YouTube' Another added: 'It's horrifying how many men must be out there doing things like this.' Advertisement As well as admitting four counts of making indecent photographs or films accessible to children aged 13 or over between August 2012 and June 2015, he also admitted five counts of voyeurism, three of taking an image of another person without their knowledge between March 2014 and February 2015, two of possessing obscene images between April 2014 and November 2014 and one count each of distributing an extreme pornographic film containing child sex acts between October 2010 and July 2011, possession of an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph involving a child between May 2005 and March 2006, sexual activity with a prostitute between October 2004 and September 2002, paying for sexual services between September 2001 and September 2004, causing someone else to engage in sexual activities at least twice in July 2001 and causing someone to engage in sexual activities more than once between August 2000 and January 2003. A report written for probation officers suggested Dr Coffey should receive treatment for alcohol misuse and antisocial personality disorder and stated he posed a high risk of reoffending because he did not understand others' feelings. Judge David Bathurst QC told him: ""You are clearly very intelligent - you achieved a first class degree in science... You appear to be very successful in your chosen career ... But none of these factors prevent me sentencing you to imprisonment. Your offending was particularly serious. It involved repeated offending against vulnerable women; indeed you deliberately sought such victims. This was both cruel and degrading. Sentencing was always going to present difficulties given your remorseful plea but nevertheless that does not mean you escape justice. When giving sentence, all the appropriate matters need to be borne in mind - including deterrence, rehabilitation and protecting those affected by further offending. What we see here is obviously very concerning. In particular, the fact that you engaged in recording other individuals without their permission is extremely worrying. You cannot simply record anyone - especially if young children are concerned. ""There is evidence that although you claim to take advice about professional boundaries, you failed to heed that advice, despite having been warned about recording colleagues."" He sentenced him to 12 months jail for each of the four charges of making indecent photos accessible to children - six of them suspended for two years - plus a concurrent 18 month prison term for each charge of accessing those pictures. For viewing porn involving kids, he will serve half of the sentence suspended for two years. Two others charges related to voyeurism and agreed his conviction would run concurrently with his previous ones. His barrister Philip Turner QC argued Dr Coffey, whose main job was studying stem cells rather than treating cancer patients, suffered a ""meltdown"" under pressure and the former policeman could now never work again. The court heard he developed depression after separating from his girlfriend and asked his parents to help cover bills. They paid off debts, bought expensive gifts and sent coffees to friends but he started drinking heavily and became obsessed with watching pornography. His visa expired in early 2008 and he decided to come back home to get married with his bride, Melissa, whom he met through social media. Investigators found thousands of hours worth of recordings taken from the practice when members shared footage via Facebook group called 'The Strapup Crew'. He made secret audio files of surgeries lasting up to 40 minutes most days, sometimes multiple times per day.

"21 October 2016 Last updated at 15:03 BST In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but none have been spotted since. The number of European seahorses seen by scientists has declined from hundreds to tens over the past decade The future for Europe's largest snail is bleak. Fewer and fewer seahorses are being found all along Britain's south coast - a fall that some marine biologists fear could spell disaster not only for this unique creature but also for its entire population. Since 2007 there has not been one single sighting anywhere on our shores. These tiny creatures once swarmed schools off British beaches but now they can be counted on two hands among those who try their luck each year. They live nowhere else in the world apart from these southern coastal waters between Cornwall and Norfolk. And they still have time left to breed as long as conditions remain favourable; some species may even do so again after years without spawning. But it will take generations to produce new recruits if the current decline continues. Downcast biologist Simon Toppen says: ""We've lost 80 per cent or more of what we used to see. A lot of people think it'll recover because some snails seem to be moving north into warmer water, but I don't believe it. It won't happen quickly enough to save them here. We need massive conservation measures now. Somehow we need to stop killing them before they hatch out. You never know when you might get lucky with a spawn in your bucket net but, unfortunately, we just aren't getting any chances right now."" A colleague was fishing near Penzance harbour three months ago when he saw something suspicious lying behind an old boat. He scooped up what looked like a small white sea slug and popped it back into his creel bag. When he opened it later he discovered it was actually a juvenile seahorse - proof positive that they had spawned. But the numbers of adult seahorses were much lower than expected and remained low through the rest of the summer and autumn according to research published last month by Dr Jan Steeman of Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. His team set a camera trap next to shells washed ashore at St Agnes beach (in the Guardian newspaper) where, during July-October 2016, they caught five seahorses young enough to have hatched within the previous 30 days. This was down from 100 animals captured annually many decades earlier. Another nest contained eggs laid nearly half a century previously. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Seahorses on Clevedon Pier in 2011. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo Steeman thinks secreting eggs is unlikely to explain everything because female seahorses also mate while floating freely around the ocean. However, reproductive failure appears to explain why no females were ever found despite intensive searching in recent years. Other explanations include competition for food from crabs, pollution, parasites, disease and climate change disrupting key factors such as temperature, salinity and oxygen levels which affect reproduction. Nevertheless, he warns against complacency: ""Most likely multiple causes are contributing to the present situation,"" he writes, adding that while only time will tell how bad things really get, evidence suggests ""the severity may reach unprecedented levels."" Inevitably, concern has been growing about other wildlife affected by human activities including plastic bags, commercial trawling and offshore oil drilling. That means increased stress for already fragile seahorse populations. Some researchers argue bottlenose dolphins should be added to the list of threatened UK flora and fauna alongside oystercatchers, shelducks, gulls and otters. Dolphin sightings dropped sharply early in the 20th century when industrialised fisheries began exploiting fish stocks far beyond sustainable limits resulting in habitat destruction. Now another big threat looms: plastic pollution diluted in seawater is estimated to kill millions of tonnes of invertebrates every year. Discovering whether these effects extend to seahorses is difficult because they spend most of their lives buried deep under sand. Seaweeds sometimes grow round dead seahorses in northern Norway, suggesting they contact plastics accidentally. Habitat loss is undoubtedly relevant too. Because seahorses have complex life cycles lasting several years, changes in prey availability due to shifting currents known as regime shifts often wreak havoc. Their reef systems often shift shape, leaving smaller areas suitable for baby seahorses growing larger ones unsuitable. It takes years to build large reefs made of corals and sponges and the first generation of recruiters to survive require great skill to locate nutritious patches at precisely the right depth. The animals come ashore en masse only in springtime when tides bring up nutrients released by decaying algae in winter storms. By then, however, they may find themselves stranded amid landfills. Lately, rising temperatures mean changing weather patterns create less predictable seasonal surges of nutrient release.

"The Lions looked the more dangerous side in the early stages and experienced striker Steve Morison twice hammered efforts over the crossbar. There was little goalmouth action at either end , but it soon got off to a lively start for Arsenal with Yossi Benayoun pulling one back after great work from Freddie Ljungberg down the left wing before an own-goal by Christophe Dugarry brought about a corner that resulted in Danny Blanchflower's strike going straight into his arms as the Gunners went behind following three minutes of play - yet there were no further goals during the opening period. Arsenal began to take control when they took advantage of some sloppy defending by Wigan at corners, firstly, via defender Scott Carson and midfielder Lee Barnard sending their set pieces wide, then with another effort on goal where Morrison again had a shot blocked as he made contact midway inside the penalty area with goalkeeper Carlo Nash. Despite this, Wigan did manage to claim three points which moved them level on 12th place in the league table, while the other two sides above them dropped places. The victory meant Wenger could once again begin thinking about European football next season. In the meantime, Wigan will be hoping this is just the sort of result that will help keep their hopes alive of staying up. Wenger introduced Laurent Koscielny and Emmanuel Petit within eight minutes of the restart, replacing defenders Wayne Bridge and Matt Taylor and midfielder Nigel Winterburn respectively. Former Arsenal winger Ray Parlour came on for Blackburn full-back Chris Samba four minutes later, although he didn't last long due to a hamstring injury sustained earlier in the match. It must have been frustrating for him, because only a couple of minutes later he nearly scored another for Wigan through former England international Alan Smith, who cut onto his right foot from 35 yards out and curled the ball towards the far post, only for referee Graham Polls to rule it out for offside. Yet it wasn't all bad news for the hosts as Arsenal substitute Andre Santos' glancing header barely beat keeper Ali Al Habsi low to his left hand post. With five minutes remaining, another ex-Gunner, Marc Overmars also forced himself forward for the visitors until Ashley Cole took exception to his approach and gave away a free kick 25 yards outside the box; both players were booked for arguing the decision afterwards. As if to add insult to injury, Cole continued to argue despite being told not to speak to officials! Substitute Pascal Chimbonda finally put paid to Arsenal's resistance nine minutes from time by heading home Aaron Lennon's corner; the fact that Collins John couldn't get across to clear would suggest otherwise, though. But even without the veteran Winger scoring what felt like an easy equaliser, the half ended goalless still; perhaps most worryingly for Arsenal fans, arguably the best player on show failed to score anywhere near enough goals in his career so far...",0,724

It's also worth noting that he doesn't get any screen credit for playing Winston Churchill - it goes solely to Christopher Plummer (whose own appearance might be seen as controversial by some). However, apart from this one small detail, there are no ties to real life or history whatsoever here: other than being about the Battle Of Britain, historical accuracy isn't really necessary when you're making a feelgood film about wartime heroism.

Here's what you need to do: 1. Know your account number: You can link your Aadhaar card with all major banks' accounts on its official website or search for ""AADHAAR"" under ""Services."" If there is no record of an Aadhaar linked to your current account, you'll need to fill out a form along with other proof such as PAN Card, passport etc., available here. Once done, a temporary password would be sent to your registered mobile phone number, which helps generate one-time passwords every day from digitally signed messages. With this code access can then be granted. This step should ideally take place only once unless details like date of birth changes otherwise it could result in many days without access to funds. At least three attempts should be made to enter the correct OTP before changing it so make sure to keep track of all codes until they expire. Also note that if cash transactions happen, you won't get instant confirmation of successful transfer. So ensure you carry enough cash while travelling around cities and rural areas where ATMs may run dry. 2. Get hold of Rs 100 - Rs 200 notes: Banks and post offices maintain special counters meant to deal exclusively with PS11 denominations. They usually open for business between 10 am and 12 noon Indian Standard Time daily except Sundays and holidays or during national crisis when banking norms allow them to function till 9 p.m. These specialised counters accept payments using either debit cards or credit cards accompanied by photo ID. It's best to visit a couple of these branches within hours of each other since queues build up over time. Besides usual transaction fees, service charges apply. Commonly asked questions include, ""How much?"" and ""Where shall I go?"" Your bank branch manager will help guide you after knowing your request. Make sure you know the right counter though; some private sector banks use different ones than those used by public sector lenders. Asking someone else, even another person from same sectiondepartment about a particular scheme isn't a good idea because chances are he might tell you wrong info. In case of doubt always check online first or call customer care centre of respective bank. 3. Select 'exchange now': On most websites load times aren't immediately clear. Take a few minutes to look through FAQ sections or contact customer support whenever needed. Enquire about minimum amounts required i.e. minimum amount carriedminimum balance in affected account or maximum limit per session. Note also that Rs 2000 and Rs 5000 denominations cannot be exchanged together. Registration is mandatory, identity proof needs to match the name on the statement issued by the bank. After confirming basic details click on the green button specifying type of settlement - Net Banking or Debit Credit Cards of course. How long does it take? Usually less than two minutes. But there can sometimes be delays since cheques tend to arrive later during working hours or over weekends and holidays. Finally confirm payment and scroll down to see instructions regarding courier pickup.

"The service was held at the 22-year-old's school in Ohio, before his burial at a nearby cemetery. His death has heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Pyongyang has condemned Otto Warmbier as an ""US criminal,"" while Washington says it is seeking answers about what happened to him during more than 500 days of detention. Pyongyang said Mr Warmbier had been arrested for trying to steal propaganda material from the country - charges that could carry up 10 years imprisonment or even execution if found guilty. He admitted taking part in anti-government activities but denied being a spy. The university student became ill on 15 June last year after he was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour for allegedly stealing two North Korean pamphlets from a hotel room he shared with three other students. Hospital officials confirmed the former University of Virginia undergraduate died on Tuesday morning (local time) after spending months in coma. Officials have not officially blamed his illness on mistreatment by prison guards but President Donald Trump suggested as much in a tweet earlier this month saying: ""He seems dangerously violently sick.""

It added later: ""Fred and Cindy Warmbir are grateful to all who offered their prayers throughout these past 18 months."" So far no one connected to the case has been publicly named but Mr Warmbier's grandfather told CNN there were options available under Chinese law which allowed relatives to sue those responsible for his care. Luke Handley-Jones reports from Beijing ""It would seem logical,"" Fred Warmbier wrote on Facebook, ""that if such legal action can provide some measure of justice or closure, then perhaps it should proceed - however, I don't know how effective any civil lawsuit against individuals working for [North Korean] authorities overseas might prove to be.""

The dismissal comes just weeks before Mr Bolton's former deputy John Eisenberg is due to begin his role at the NSC on 13 September - two months later than expected. The New York Times has reported that President Trump twice ordered aides not to extend the offer because he had lost confidence in Mr Bolton's performance when nuclear negotiations with North Korea were taking place. Mr Bolton said: ""I can say unequivocally I never asked or suggested firing anyone from the National Security Council staff. Nor have I ever called for such a thing as national-security adviser."" He also said: ""If it turns out my tenure at the UN was too long - Lord knows there are plenty who would prefer shorter terms - then so be it.""",0,737
"Media playback is unsupported on your device 4 May 2015 Last updated at 16:22 BST It's a big deal for people across the country, but everyone's watching Scotland in particular. BBC News went to Edinburgh and Glasgow The last time Britain faced such uncertainty about its future was during World War II when it became clear that Hitler had no intention of stopping his campaign against Western Europe as he expanded his empire into North Africa and then conquered France. After six years of fighting and civil unrest throughout mainland Britain - especially in Northern Ireland where politicians failed to resolve their differences over what should happen after independence from British rule - Churchill felt confident enough in 1945 to make the case for continuing with an independent United Kingdom against a united Germany set up under Soviet control. At the same time as Winston Churchill was speaking out in favour of staying together, Bill Clinton was making a speech supporting American withdrawal from Iraq which led to the fall of President Saddam Hussein. And Tony Blair was arguing that ""terrorism will never beat us"" when, looking back now, most experts say this claim has been proven wrong by al-Qaeda attacks like those carried out on 77 in London or on Madrid train station in 2004, among others. But while our political leaders are grappling with how best to protect our countries and citizens without putting them all at risk, there is one thing they can agree on; we need some kind of economic union if Britain wants to remain part of Nato. There is even broad agreement amongst EU member states about getting closer economically in order to share European security more effectively. But the key issue remains whether the UK would be better off inside the single market than outside it. In other words, does being able to trade freely with the rest of the continent improve living standards here? Or could leaving threaten jobs and leave us poorer overall? A year ago David Cameron announced plans to hold an early referendum on any final decision that might lead either way, in March 2017. Many have argued since then that Mr Cameron wouldn't actually call a vote until next summer, just before elections the following spring. That may well still be true. However, whoever wins next month's Scottish regional election will govern Scotland in 2016 and thus exert influence over the outcome of negotiations between Westminster and Brussels. The SNP believes the result will boost support for separation. While Labour voters also want major changes ahead of the general election, the main opposition party's position on constitutional change appears less certain. This series looks at the arguments for remaining within the EU; and for breaking away. At least partly because many of these issues aren't covered elsewhere anywhere near so clearly. So we've brought in a group of writers who cover economics, politics and business journalism to explain why they think keeping the pound sterling tied to its eurozone counterpart makes financial sense and offers greater protection from terrorism through membership of Nato. We'll also look at the pros and cons of becoming a special opt-in region of the EU known as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland (the Efta option). Two of our contributors are interviewed by Prof Tim Bale of Cardiff University's School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies. Sue Millington, chief employment economist at Halifax Bank Group, explains why she thinks members of the City must embrace shared regulation - but equally needs flexibility too. Yvonne Kelly of Trade Me says her company relies extensively on free movement of goods and services. Her argument echoes similar opinions held by businesses in Wales, England and much of northern Europe. Andy Haldane of the Bank of England explains why, despite having close links with several nations including America and Japan, the UK benefits enormously from going it alone rather than joining forces with the likes of Canada and Australia. This isn't an opinion piece, however. Our aim is not simply to provide long winded explanations of complex affairs. Instead, we hope to help readers understand the practical reasons behind each side's views. There won't be space here to outline all the arguments for both sides. Nor do we expect you to accept everything written. Just use the comments section below to continue the debate... 1) Why should I care?

"Cumbernauld has the dubious distinction of winning the Plook on the Plinth title for having Scotland's ""most dismal"" town centre in 2001 and 2005. Judges have compared it to Kabul , Baghdad, Bombay, Bhopal and Beijing - but not Sydney or London. The reason is that Edinburgh beat Cumbria by a single point in 2004 when Cumberland was only named as best city quarter ""because there were no other contenders."" In fact, no council or government publication gives any statistics about how many people live within its borders and NSPCC figures show more than 10 are homeless. There are four towns with populations larger than 80,000. The last census showed 546 residents at Workington, which is now half again bigger; 393 at Barrow-in-Furness; 283 at Carlisle. Not even Dr Johnson could stop me from trying to visit workless communities which are completely invisible to politicians and researchers until they erupt into national news headlines. I went to see John McGlynn, Scottish Labour minister for employment who serves an area where some 33,500 do not get paid (the figure includes those over 16 whose unemployment benefit is stopped). He spoke of falling crime rates and higher standards of living while still managing an increase in poverty levels among children. McGlynn told me: ""In June 2003 our productivity growth reached 2, up 30 years since they had been so low."" This was because business investment recovered after a recession and grew faster than before. But he said Britain still lags behind Germany. ""We're 14th out of 15 and looking up,"" he added. Despite all this progress, according to him, Labour still controls two seats on the local authority board due to boundary changes. One of them sits empty. I asked which party would most improve conditions under full devolution and McGlynn replied without hesitation: ""Labour."" His own constituency, Stirling North West, voted against independence less than three weeks ago despite his support for a yes vote. Why? Because ""at every election we've lost jobs,"" says McGlynn. Markethill Employment Forum is holding a conference next month. It faces closure if separated from Glasgow and turned into South Lanarkshire. Sixty per cent of businesses want DevoMax, but ministers never consider this option seriously. They prefer unionist arguments like ""it will cost jobs"" and ""we don't know what they'll be doing"" instead of explaining their case based on evidence. What does scare councillors is Britain leaving Europe. As former SNP leader John Swinney put it recently, asking why voters come first. Nobody dares raise these issues publicly in the media, however. Instead, journalists try to prevent councils in the rest of England from calling referendums about renewing themselves to save money. If you doubt this, look at newspapers' coverage of the issue. Only one paper ran a front page story about such a question here. Journalists are too busy worrying about whether politicians will sack anyone rather than take power away from Westminster. We should all ask ourselves why there isn't a public debate on these questions during elections across Britain. No comments: Post a Comment About Me Hi everyone! My name is Nicholas Dodds.

"Speaking about the 1948 contract Nye Bevan, the founding father of the NHS, offered consultants, he said he had ""stuffed their mouths with gold."" That gold was the ability to make money out of public health. The system is now so bad that it has been forced into a situation where hospitals are closing and patients have no choice but to go private if they want treatment at all; people are dying because of the waiting times for treatments such as dialysis or chemotherapy. ""If I were in charge,"" says Gail Caldwell, the chairwoman of NHS South West London Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which includes St Thomas' Hospital, ""I would not recommend anyone goes onto private healthcare unless we can guarantee them an equivalent service elsewhere."" But she also acknowledges that this means her CCG will be losing 2m-3m per year from its budget. And where does the shortfall come from? Well, the hospital spends something like 1million on each new patient who comes through the doors these days. So far, nobody has noticed how very little there actually is left over.",0,741

"7 November 2016 Last updated at 09:30 GMT The balls are formed naturally and happen when pieces of ice get rolled by wind and water. They stretch on the Siberian tundra until they split, creating a hole that is quickly sealed over with more snow. But some fall open in mid-summer to reveal tiny holes filled with air. In an area known as Hollow Lake, these bubbles have been recorded for around 500 years. It has become one of Siberia's most enduring natural wonders. The fact that there are no people here makes it all the stranger - but this unusual place does tell scientists something about climate change and ancient peoples' migration patterns. And if you look closely enough through your camera or smartphone, you can see photosynthesis happening right next to a pool of blue light above surface level - until your eye adjusts to darkness again... A team from Moscow University was visiting the lake, which lies north-east of Novosibirsk city, because its permanent population had recently increased dramatically due to mining projects nearby. We know where our ancestors came from, we just don't always understand how they got there Prof Sergey Zimov, Head of Laboratory for Snowballs and Ice Cores, Russian Academy of Sciences ""When I first saw Hollow Lake, my jaw dropped; what made me think? What could be so striking to make such a deep impression about someone who lives hundreds of kilometres away? ""In other parts of Russia, lakes like this were created thousands of years ago. This means this land had already been submerged under water many times."" As far back as 2000 BC, he said, Hollow Lake was surrounded by forests (although not much remains). At least eight archaeological sites dating back 4,000 years have been discovered near the shoreline of Hollow Lake. Each site shows signs of human activity during that period. People living between 5,500 and 1,700 years ago trekked across the Arctic landscape carrying their belongings on sledges. Something else brought them to Siberia: nomadic shepherds migrating along frozen rivers. Around 2,800 years ago, another wave of travellers headed westward towards central Europe. Their footsteps hardened into two distinct paths - alongside Ridge Fortification Culture and the Dnieper River route. Professor Zimov thinks Hollow Lake might once have communicated with either path. If it did then, his theory suggests that the lake would have dried up long before now. He says the only thing left today is evidence of past subsidence caused by melting permafrost. The frozen ground beneath Hollow Lake is still often covered in a layer of hard ice 3 m thick, making travel difficult. There is also little food for animals living on the surrounding tundra - including horses. So, why do people come to Siberia in summertime? To hunt reindeer and caribou. Some researchers say horseback riding became popular among tribes after contact with sedentary cultures. Others suggest that people started to live permanently off the land after coming out of caves, according to the UK's Natural History Museum website. Nomads travelling along forest trails (which cut through the region) may have settled down eventually, but found winters too harsh for raising livestock and hunting game. If Hollow Lake was frequently connected to both routes, those migrants could easily move their way through the Arctic landscape whenever conditions improved. They carried flint implements at different times of year, meaning they collected mosses and lichens growing where they pitched camp. These fruits helped give humans vitamin B12. Scientists cannot prove whether Hollow Lake was even dry while the Bronze Age settlers lived close by. However, studies suggest many lakes lost half of their volume in less than 200 years. That leaves plenty of time to take advantage of new habitats. As the ice sheet melts relatively slowly, others believe Hollow Lake remained full throughout winter. With dogs to pull sledges and yaks to carry tents and supplies, the adventurers travelled longer distances without relying on boats. And Hollow Lake offers important clues about present day migratory patterns. Longer trips may well mean more chances to meet foreign people. Perhaps encounters led to intermarriage, resulting in the spread of genes used to cope with cold weather. Another kind of genetic exchange occurred several thousand years later within China, when Tibetans migrated southwards from Mongolia across the Himalayas. After settling in Sichuan province, their children combined European and Asian genes, leading to the formation of today's Han Chinese ethnic group. 'Colourful' bones One discovery from Hollow Lake comes from a radiocarbon date taken inside the bubbles. Researchers expected to find samples showing plants grown underwater. Instead, they found bits of organic material embedded in sediment layers laid down since Paleolithic times. Looking closer, using EM imaging techniques, Dr Alexander Khondokerov spotted particles shaped like tubes encased in transparent polymers. According to researchers, the fossils belonged to algae called diatoms. About three months before sunset, the sun shines directly onto hollow lakes and creates a strong current. When the waves lift tonnes of silt from bottom mud, algal cell walls crackle as oxygen production takes place at the same rate, producing the effect of similar motion, with success rates, tefter setting the task long range failed model is really going show",0,743

"Panthers kept alive their title hopes and closed the gap on leaders Devils to four points. Two goals from Matthew Myers put Panthers in control before Joey Martin replied. Franklin finished with three assists while Matt Duchesne, Corey Tropp and William Bitten added two apiece The first period was an even affair despite some solid chances for each side as a result of good play from both defencemen and forwards. The puck movement up-ice into the offensive zone at times looked even better than it had been since season's start but it made little difference - neither team could find its rhythm or flow. There were no penalties until midway through the second when coach Gerard Gallant went to his bench after Jason Dickinson received a double minor incidental contact penalty during play against Jacob Markstrom. It appeared that there would be 4 minutes played against Markstrom but instead he stood throughout so it may have taken longer if I am correct. It is always interesting how referees can influence the outcome of games simply because they are not allowed to speak unless called upon by either party who has possession of the puck (when playing). That means there is nothing you or your opponent can say to them which might persuade them to make a bad call otherwise. You just go along like everyone else whether you agree or disagree as long as you respect the referee consistently. In this instance we did have about 10 seconds of discussion later about what happened, all our opinions agreed except one. We also discussed whether or not we should appeal based on lack of clarity (not seen) regarding Dickinson's hit on Marky before that decision was communicated which obviously makes sense. This resulted in us getting down to business quickly thereafter. Our game continued without further comment from the officials (no more skates being thrown out etc.) Franklin fired off the opening shot of the third period hitting the post then Marc Savard sent back across tying the score 1:1. Ryan Stanton broke the deadlock 7mins later firing home his fourth goal of the playoffs assisted by Stewart 4 Dale Tallon Francis Bouillon. After Mike Weaver scored to tie the teams again 3:3, Nathan Gerbe got his 2nd assist of the series giving him 10 in total only 5 short of teammate Evgeni Dadoun between the pipes for Florida. Greene gave Pittsburgh another life shortly afterwards scoring twice including the winner putting the Penguins ahead once again! A few moments later Jack Skille provided a bit of spark for Pitt entering his 6th year as a Penguin adding another tally helping erase any thoughts of losing momentum for the Cats. Jay Harrison came close to having another save for the Pens at 11:24 left in regulation. Poor block job from the goalie allowing Myers' point blank effort at 12:06 but at least the young netminder helped set things right after an odd bounce leading directly to Myers' rebound attempt and perfect chance. At 13:48 he faced another big moment stopping Richard Panik's breakaway shot following a turnover nicely clearing away the loose puck protecting his tweed line partner. He finally stopped another tough chance for Lazar Hyman at 15:00 coming in alone but couldn't stop Richard Gordon who barreled around the net carrying the puck over father figure Bill Guerin making it 4-2 Cam Ward ended proceedings at 16:56 saving Neal Pionk's shot cleanly although the veteran forward's stick touched the puck briefly. Overall performance? Intense battle all night. Both defences stepped up admirably forcing turnovers and creating opportunities for themselves. One thing never changed though - the high quality focus we saw early this postseason returned full strength with lots of hard work followed by smart moves within the system which let players know exactly where to position themselves. As expected this appears to be Case Keenan's style of hockey - it takes time to understand sometimes as puck handling and passing techniques don't change overnight. More importantly you need experienced defenders like Tinordi Kaberle anchoring the blueline which should allow less support needed from the rest of the lineup and hopefully help give us some breathing room offensively. There still needs to be some improvement on special teams catching defensemen late and letting Peter Holland roam free can happen easily especially on powerplay. Not saying those issues won't come to light tomorrow at Consol Energy Center, however, but it does appear that Panther's new identity is already taking shape as evidenced by their improved play to date. Time will tell if these guys continue to develop and mold into something great or if randomness of results will bury our dreams once again. Some feel the boys aren't doing enough to win now despite showing well earlier in this run. My personal feeling is that we're developing very slowly yet surely toward becoming a successful franchise which I think most fans expect.

"As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a man speak about sex. The judge presiding over the case ordered him removed from the room and later asked him if ""that was an acceptable way"" to try to question one of the officers on oath. A lawyer admonished him: ""You're looking at this young lady. Don't make jokes like that."" Plenty more happened during the trial of Sirhan Sirhan, the Palestinian American accused of killing Robert Kennedy in 1968. But one exchange with defence lawyers stuck out as especially bizarre for both sides. In violation of rules barring witnesses from commenting on evidence before or after it is introduced, Naseem Aslam testified on direct examination by lead prosecutor Thomas Pitaro that during questioning outside of court, he had told them there were no other candidates for the role of gunman than himself. On redirect, Mr Pitaro asked whether they could prove otherwise. After some back and forth between counsels, Judge Vincent Gaughan eventually allowed Naseem - who earlier said he was not permitted to answer questions without permission - to testify again. He answered yes, telling jurors once more that ""there are people out there besides me. There's other possible suspects."" The jury found Sirhan guilty of murder on June 5. For the record This story incorrectly reported defense attorney Paul Schrade's testimony. It should have read ""He does not recall what she (Naseem) said. To be clear: when we say he doesn't remember something happening - he remembers nothing said because he was too busy talking to her. That's how that happens sometimes when you get caught up in conversations and forget things,"" rather than ""he says he did not hear anything she said."" Also, The Times Corrected its report to note that Maharajh Dangar Singh was present at the time he interviewed Naseem. According to prosecutors' arguments to the grand jury, he described the conversation accurately but omitted details as he saw fit for purposes of his potential perjury charge against Nadir Khan. For instance, he never mentioned that Naseem claimed he was being set up. Advertisement Both attorneys called their own experts to rebut much of Naseem's testimony; most notably counter terrorism expert Michael German of the Anti Terrorism Research Center at George Washington University. During reopening statements, German pointedly questioned why someone would possibly want to frame him, saying: ""I don't know any person alive today who wants to put a gun into somebody else's hand and pull the trigger. I mean unless you're insane."" And the prosecution brought out FBI agent Fred Burton, whose 2002 interview with Naseem suggested to investigators that he was lying under oath in testimony he gave months later in London. When recounting a portion of the interrogation, where he denied having ever met an Arab named Muhammad Ali Muhamed Abdul Aziz al-Amriki American on January 30, 2008, witness Sharon Johnson Baker appeared unable to understand certain key words used by Agent Burton while reading lines aloud from an affidavit filed by Naseem. She remarked that underneath it she translated part of the statement as meaning ""Muhammad 'Ali AMURIKI [sic] ALAMRIKI."" Under further scrutiny, the translator agreed that it was indeed ""alamrikie"" but also said that it meant simply ""like the name Ameuriki which is Amuriq."" In all, six witnesses took the stand over several days. One investigative journalist spoke about interviewing Naseem through an interpreter while posing undercover as a radical Islamist extremist named Zahid Bukhari, another two former neighbors discussed the possibility that he was setting others up for false confessions (one even made reference to Marina Abramovic), and the final three laid out the trajectory of his life leading to his arrest which culminated in the altercation with Sgt Meagher in Sirhan's apartment on August 27, 1969. On cross-examination of German, Mr Pitaro got down to brass tacks - asking repeatedly about his scientific methodology. Asking rhetorically if Prof German actually looked at forensic evidence in assessing the motive behind assassinating RFK, he then began probing each step he took in reaching such conclusions. At one point, he merely asked him to describe his methods in terms of ""basic logic,"" to which German demurred, stating he wasn't trained in basic logic. Not only was this line of inquiry ruled improper by the judge, but Pitaro didn't press on until hours later during closing arguments. Despite Mr Pitaro's request for Mr Justice William Brennan to instruct jurors on the difference between science and proof beyond reasonable doubt, instead the judge instructed jurors solely on circumstantial evidence. Judge Gaughran stated that since the defence sought to discredit the credibility of numerous objectors, the other, the tendency to inferring the second actor were continuous workmen coke about to marketmen).

Billy Connolly's 'I'm alright Jack' video played on TV during Billy Idol tribute The Queen's Birthday Honours list includes more than 2,000 people - including two pop stars - and there are 39 new knighthoods among them. She also awards 71 other honours - the most ever given out by her Majesty so far. Today it can all look very much like any old list of goodies because it often does but they cannot all go up until July 8th to coincide with her birthday. That means that some have only just become available to see and we wait until then to find out whether our favourite people or organisations were honoured. And when the day comes, we all get excited about what has happened and how proud we should feel as well as if we had done anything worth being rewarded for. There are lots of photos here showing some of those receiving special medals and others in one of Britain's oldest institutions, the Order of St John which dates back to medieval times and has its origins in Roman Catholic monasteries. But first let us talk about the folk on television tonight who are going to shout everyone else down regardless of merit - and neither deserve nor would want such an honour anyway. Yes they do though: Phil Collins is getting a CBE in ""outstanding contribution to music"" while Rolf Harris gets a knighthood. They won't mind either although I know they probably do. Anyway, these celebs are not important enough and never will be (although having said that, I am sure someone somewhere thinks less of me right now). Let us instead concentrate on those nobodies and those who matter - particularly those I call my friends family. My daughter Alexandra got married last week and she chose Kate Nottle to sing solo at the wedding reception. Not bad really considering that I don't even rate singing! But however good I may think Kate is, I bet she doesn't think too highly of me! Yet she did serve as my best man and helped organise everything; unlike another old friend of mine who organised things without asking anyone, I mean invited no-one. He seems to have forgotten all about the whole thing recently but for once I forgive him. Asking around he finds 50 catwalk models to fill the place as dinner guests... We didn't dare invite my long suffering lady wife anywhere near the event though this girl would rather die than miss a chance to make herself known to the Prince of Wales and all those dukes and earls and barons and counts - especially some who actually own houses in Chelsea Gardens. She could expect invites to Buckingham Palace anytime soon. Looking forward to seeing this very special guest again. If she wants to come round for tea afterwards, I might help with the washing up but I doubt it.... In fact I suspect it's a bit too late to ask so... Ahem, OK, maybe next time.

Must say, when Jude called me yesterday to confirm his involvement in this latest adventure, I reckoned he was joking. Then he told me that he loved working on the film and wasn't bothered about the title of Daniel Craig's forthcoming 007 outing. Well that sealed it. Isn't that love! Don't worry though, he says he'll keep playing Bond till real life occasionally intervenes - hey Jude, remember Cary Grant...? OK, let's move on..... How about his Royal Wedding outfit? Oh dear!

"Angus Carpenter, of Liverpool, who has played in the city centre for more than 30 years, denied three counts of fraud. The 62-year-old was found guilty of one count when he appeared at Huyton magistrates' court on October 2 last year (2013) but two months later a retrial led to the prosecution dropping the other charges. The pensioner could have been jailed after being convicted but instead pleaded guilty and received an immediate custodial sentence with no order made about his future release or supervision requirements. Carpenter spent nearly four hours behind bars before he returned home where he immediately went back to work as part of probation orders imposed by Huyton crown court in July 2013. He is now also banned from any contact with children under 16 unless they are family members, friends or professionals working within that age group. During sentencing, Recorder Matthew Smith said: ""I am satisfied there would be significant harm caused if you were not put into custody. I cannot see how it will not cause this person serious distress and humiliation.

Founder Michael Eavis, who was at Yeovil Magistrates' Court, said he had been told there could be a 1billion payout after his legal team argued that badgers were likely to have caused the problem because they are known for digging up large quantities of soil near set-up areas. Mr Justice Collins ruled against Mr Eavis but said it would not make sense to order an injunction if he won compensation from DEFRA - or even if he did not win any compensation, as it ""would certainly have some effect."" He added: 'There is no suggestion by your clients (of) either the existence of financial outflows or the source of those funds."" WOOL of Britain chief executive Laurence Jones, whose company represents around half of UK sheep farmers, said her members wanted to see the badger culling programme halted at this stage. She also called on Defra minister Jim Paice MP to declare his own personal support for the culls now, so people knew where ministers stood.

"But when the last Labour government tried to bring them in the plan faced robust opposition, and the reintroduction of ID cards is not currently being considered by this government. So what do we know about these biometric passports? The following information has been provided by Her Majesty's Passport Office: They are issued for a maximum validity period of 10 years from date of issue. This can be extended if used abroad or lost. A passport which does have a valid expiry date but was never used would still continue to work until that time unless it had expired before 2010 (these expired passports will be accepted at UK ports). Two year extensions are possible where necessary without specific need to apply for one. There is no additional fee payable on top of your normal payment for an application to renew with HMIPO. Provisions exist to allow payments for visa applications made through cashless channels to take place during the renewal process. Such arrangements may require certain documentation such as previous bank statements etc. A new photo must be taken every five years for those aged 16-18 and once every ten years thereafter. There is also provision for children under 13 to remain within their home country. Wherever they go outside their home country, there are rules about how long they should stay away - usually for two weeks each visit. When coming back into the UK after travelling out, they cannot leave again without applying for a Visitor Visa.

"About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with Welsh language media as having dual nationality, according to figures from 2016 published by the National Assembly for Wales (NAW). The UK Government is rushing through new legislation which will make it unlawful for public bodies such as schools, hospitals or councils across England to work on behalf of the EU unless they have majority levels of support among their staff. The bill has been passed by MPs but still requires royal approval. It was formally introduced last week amid concerns that official documents could be made available in other languages after Brexit unless there were safeguards. Only one MP voted against the legislation when it came before Parliament this month - former Labour Cabinet minister Kate Hoey, who said she did not want an ""unfinished job."" David Davis also warned the Commons that leaving without a deal would be ""a disaster"" but ultimately backed down due to opposition within his own party. In her first statement since becoming Prime Minister Theresa May's de facto deputy PM following Andrea Leadsom's resignation earlier this year, Mrs Tinsley said: ""I am proud of my British values, I remain committed to working together with our European partners, colleagues on both sides of the House and all parts of society."" She added: ""In order to do so successfully we must seek to ensure people feel confident about travelling into Europe, accessing education abroad, studying in universities and businesses trading freely and safely across borders."" Ministers expect 75 per cent of companies to offer staff flexible working arrangements post-Brexit, though charities say many employers are already taking steps to provide them anyway. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government wanted more flexible employment rules for workers than those currently guaranteed under existing EU law. She said: ""We'd like to see the rights of employees protected more than at present and the employers' obligations considerably reduced... We're looking to take some extra measures in relation to industrial relations the self-employed because obviously if you've got no worker protection then something needs to change and we just want to see changes making sure that there are fewer obstacles facing business where they might choose to employ somebody flexibly."" Ms Rudd said firms should face much less red tape if Britain left the bloc without any agreement either side reached during negotiations. Ms Rudd confirmed there had been discussions between ministers and representatives of different parties regarding how to strike out remaining sections of the 1972 Working Time Directive. While a small number of businesses have announced plans to scrap weekend working hours, most bosses appear keen to avoid being seen to restrict access to jobs.

"The case had been brought by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which formerly owned the transfer rights to the 24-year-old forward.

But in June 2017 FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) annulled the decision and ordered FIFA to compensate DIS with the difference between what they paid Barca and their share of Neymar's current net worth. FIFA decided to appeal against this ruling because not only did it cost them millions but also it appeared the DRC were making decisions without taking account of similar rulings made by other courts including the CFIJUFCA - International Centre For Justice And Fair Play In Sport.

"But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over? Or will Leicester City go back to their roots by fighting on at all costs for survival and salvation as usual? The answer remains unclear. But the signs are clear that the famous relegation dogfight has returned in full force. Just when some fans feared they were losing faith - after a season which seems even more unlikely than it did last summer - Leicester have gone into 201314 under new management with renewed vigour. And this time it's not just about beaming optimism from owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha but an entire team getting behind him. This was never going to be easy; Leicester struggled through anxiety and uncertainty last year. With TCA taking charge of football operations he doesn't have much choice other than to try something different if his beloved club are ever going to turn around their form and fortunes. He has made two major changes already: appointing Chris Hughton as manager (Hughton becomes the second man in charge of the club since Nigel Pearson left) and bringing Paul Konchesky back into the fold as director of football following his spell running technical matters at West Ham United. While these might seem like minor tweaks in what is essentially still the same squad, there could be a lot riding on them. The 2014 campaign ended with the players so knackered they couldn't hold out against Crystal Palace in May, and although the Foxes found themselves moments away from safety in 201213, few would argue those who stayed up didn't deserve to stay up (to use a footballing cliche). So why should we expect anything less again? In fact, perhaps that is why Leicester went down last term: only because they gave everything the previous year wasn't enough reason to think they wouldn't do exactly the same thing again this time round. Now though, confidence seems bubbling once again. For starters, Leicester have won four successive games now, including victories over Chelsea, Newcastle United and Manchester City. They haven't beaten any of the latter three teams during the past nine months but the way they dominated both London rivals at home suggests things appear better right across midfield, where England midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin looks revitalised under Blanc seemingly ready to lead from centre-half. He may yet win the Premier League Player of the Year award despite currently being dropped, along with Riyad Mahrez, while Demarai Gray could well make good progress coming in alongside Jamie Vardy up front. ""I want us to look sharper every week, stronger each game, tighter defensively and smarter offensively. I know how important consistency can mean,"" said Hughton before the opening day defeat to Spurs. Maybe all hope isn't lost yet then. Perhaps the talk surrounding these returns hasn't been overdone either given the circumstances of last season. It is impossible to say whether or not Saturday's 3-0 win against Everton means Hughton really does believe his side can survive without two key men of yesteryear but Leicester certainly looked far fresher here than in recent weeks. Can you imagine if Daniel Levy had seen this display instead of last month's 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane? To start with, Laurent Koscielny and Gary Cahill are doubtful for Arsenal next weekend through injury, meaning Jack Wilshere is likely to come straight back in. Moreover, Hugo Lloris is recovering from concussion sustained towards the end of Tottenham Hotspur's Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Nottingham Forest. A pertinent point as Leicester eye another trip north later on Sunday evening. Anyway, Tuesday night's EFL Cup tie at Swansea City represents Hughton's first real test. As he himself admitted prior to kick-off, ""It'll help me understand my own strengths and weaknesses. Are the boys playing well? We need to keep winning games. If they continue doing that, then I must take responsibility."" Overall results suggest this statement rings true. What happened at Watford earlier in November also appears irrelevant now. When asked about a possible Europa League place early doors, Jak Alnwick insisted the aim was to avoid maximum points penalty for failing to beat the Hornets comfortably, saying: ""We just wanted to get our feet wet. Now we've got ourselves in the hat for Europe [it's] a bonus. Realistically, I don't see us finishing above 10th. We'd rather finish 11th and play European football."" Well now... Still, Monday's 2-2 draw at Derby County followed by today's almost identically bleak result at Southampton makes for a poor return for such lofty ambitions.

Last August, Mr Mancini was sentenced to six months in jail during which time he met Mrs Smith and they began travelling around Europe. Police seized 18 litres of methylamphetamine powder, 25 wraps of MDMA tablets weighing 2.9 ounces, nine grammes of ecstasy pills, 3lb 6oz of ketamine hydrochloride and bags containing more than 100 crushed codeine cough sweets. Mrs Smith described herself as both a user and seller of narcotics and even smoked 400mg of LSD with them once between June 2014 and July 2015. In total police recovered 14kg of drugs worth almost 30,000. Another hooker jailed for luring gay men into snorting huge doses of crystal meth and putting HIV virus in their mouths says she felt like she did nothing wrong. Stacey Neville, 33, was given five years for using her looks to seduce vulnerable young men and then deliberately infecting them with HIV - often sending pictures of their erect penises along with texts such as 'I love your cock so much I want you'. She became addicted as a teenager to taking amphetamines and developing symptoms including asthma, nightmares and depression shortly after becoming sexually active. Neville initially denied involvement in the crimes - telling jurors she didn't understand anything about what happened - however after changing lawyers she later confessed to everything. NEVILLE IS LIKELY TO BE RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER SERVING JUST 15 MONTHS! Miss Neville and another woman, Sarah Day, 28, have fallen victim to the controversial practice of ""pay for poo.""

He then offered to pay her 200 for other amounts if she liked. Burke purchased small quantities from her over several months. Some reached their destinations in parts of south east England and Scotland. The jury at Leeds crown court returned verdicts against all three women following less than four hours deliberation today.

"Under anti-tax avoidance rules, if someone's tax arrangements are found to be ""abusive"" they must pay back the tax they have avoided.

"Researchers followed nearly 240,000 Swedish men for 35 years. The analysis, published in the journal Gut, showed overweight teenagers went on to have twice the risk of bowel cancer. The study also found that people with a high BMI had an increased chance of developing rectal and colon cancers. The researchers said there was no evidence body weight affected survival from other bowel diseases such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis - making it more difficult to draw links between obesity and these conditions. However they did find overweight children were at least two times more likely than their thinner classmates to develop inflammatory bowel disease later in life. Dr Dennis Mackay: ""With this latest research it is becoming increasingly clear that being too fat increases your chances of developing many types of malignancy including breast and bowel cancers. These findings indicate every child should be taught healthy eating habits and encouraged to eat healthily throughout childhood. Recent studies show children are much less active today, which makes tackling childhood obesity even harder. In addition, parents could do far more by helping their obese children lose excess weight.""",0,781

"Government limits to teachers' pay and ""real terms cuts"" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. ""Teachers need a pay rise,"" they urge, in a joint statement to the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) conference being held at Westminster this week. The unions are also concerned that children's educational attainment will suffer as schools have fewer resources than ever before - particularly with regard to maths teaching. They call for a 1bn boost for primary education by 2020. The Department for Education says it is investing 5.4 billion more per year on schools up until 201516. But some analysts say schools are already struggling financially because funding has been cut from around 2005-10. Schools currently receive their core budget via weighted means-testing, based on roughly what pupils would cost if they were educated full time on average household income levels across England. It covers about two thirds of schools in England - but only half of them face real term reductions next April when new pupil premium payments come into force, which support disadvantaged students. Only one quarter of schools saw an improvement between 2010 and 2012 according to figures released last month by Ofsted under freedom of information laws. David Jackson, chair of NAHT, said: 'It seems crazy that we can afford to give tax credits to people earning over 40,000 who don't contribute anything towards paying for our public services yet be unable to provide adequate basic staffing levels in all areas of our schools.' He called for a review of headteacher salaries after stating his belief that a teacher should earn no less than 40 above the living wage or equivalent amount. Philip Marsh, general secretary of ATLAS union, added: 'We know there are 30,000 vacancies across the country and while every job needs doing, we believe too many staff leave the profession, often not moving onto somewhere else within the sector. We're calling on employers to make sure any changes to salary structures do not lead to recruitment problems.' Jennifer Simons, president of PCS, labelled the government's claim that its current plans for schools funding mean 'no net loss' as'scaremongering'. And Chris Keates, chief executive of NASUWT, wrote: 'School leaders want a fair deal. They ask for resources so that they can deliver high quality teaching and learning experiences for young people. The government must increase investment in our schools now otherwise standards will continue to decline. School working groups are urgently needed to properly consider how best to spend additional money.' Source: Daily Mail Guardian Both sets of comments refer to analysis carried out earlier this year showing nearly 800 headteachers worldwide had resigned since 2004 due to reduced professional status, low morale and intolerable workloads. Between 2006 and 2014, one in ten heads accepted redundancy, most commonly following cuts in numbers of assistant principals or other senior managers, according to Academics Supporting Teaching Learning International (AsTEL), a UK charity supporting English secondary schools. In 2013-14, 85 heads in the private sector left posts, almost four times higher than national averages. AsTEL estimates that 80 of such resignations go unreported as they take place outside official hearings into redundancies. Meanwhile, France announced significant rises in both school infrastructure spending and parental contributions for each child in 2008; Germany increased state expenditure on training and research in 2009 and Italy introduced sweeping reforms including free meals for poorer families in 2002. However, Japanese researchers found more effective methods were available to improve test scores than financial incentives alone. A study published last year concluded that economic growth could help countries move past entrenched inequalities, even though it was likely to exacerbate inequality elsewhere - reducing social mobility rather than increasing it. By 2025, China and India are predicted to overtake Japan and Russia respectively, making these three countries larger than America, Britain and Germany combined. Yet, GK Research suggests extra funding for schools may reduce productivity gains slightly and require greater redistribution of wealth away from business, homeowners and the better off middle classes.

"Steven Rodriguez, who was better known as AAP Yams or Yamborghini, died aged 26 on 18 January at Brooklyn's Woodhull Medical Centre. He founded the US rap collective AAP Mob with his childhood friends J-Tique and his brother Hologram Jack in 1994, which later became an imprint of indie label Rawkus Records. The trio were all raised together by their mother in Washington DC during what turned out to be a tumultuous period for her family. In June 1991 she had given birth to twin sons born prematurely; ten months later they both unexpectedly passed away from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). At various points throughout their lives she would have bouts of drug addiction that led to stints in rehab. The boys' father Joe - also well known as Half Pint Jones - could not cope with losing his children so he left them to live with relatives. From then onwards Joe, whose nickname came about because he wore mismatched shoes, brought up the twins himself. When he met the rapper AAP Rocky while working security one day outside the Capitol Building, they formed a bond over music, mainly hip hop. As Joe introduced him around town, word spread that this guy was really talented even though all AAP saw was how scruffy he looked. Eventually Joe moved into a low income housing project where the two lived side by side until 1993 when Joe moved back in with his wife Mary Jane after relapsing. Later that year he began taking care of his nephews again. This time his role as uncle paid off: by 1997 he'd managed to get college scholarships for the kids, including 50k for Jae Millz. In 1998, following graduation, the three teens took over Rawkus, changing its name to AAP Inc., releasing music through it like Andre 3000 did before leaving OutKast to establish Stankonia Records with Big Boi. They signed artists such as De La Soul, Mos Def, Common and Rakim but struggled financially due to financial problems caused by old school gang members jumping ship from the company. After being jailed twice for violent crimes, young men started turning against each other instead of coming forward with information. To combat this Rodger, Maalik Muhammad and BJ the Chicago Kid decided to form a new group called Everlast Recordings alongside Tom Zutell aka Kool Keith. Their first release was ""No Time"" featuring James Brown and others in 2000. By 2004 they released Young Black President via ColumbiaSony. The album featured production work from record producer Kanye West among others. AAP Rocky said last week, ""I don't know if I'll ever make another album that sounds like Wild For the Night."" It wasn't just the albums they made together that inspired fans to fall hard for the New York native. There are many reasons why people got hooked on the trio, some of which included the fact that it was three dudes making amazing beats under one roof and the way they dressed -or failed to dress-. But most importantly there is no denying their ability to write catchy hooks and lyrics packed full of life lessons for real world situations.

"The military said the driver was taken into custody after the incident near the Jewish settlement of Ofra. It brings to 41 the number of Israelis killed in knife, gun or car-ramming attacks since October 1. In other incidents: The Ministry for Military Affairs reported on Saturday that two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded when they came under fire from a Palestinian with an automatic weapon during clashes at the Beit El checkpoint between Ramallah and Jerusalem. A 20-year-old suspect was apprehended by security forces. On Friday night, two Palestinians ambushed and shot dead a border policeman who reached his post late; another officer returned gunfire and struck one of them. In separate shootings overnight Thursday and early Wednesday morning three Israelis died in drive-by shooting attacks in Tel Aviv's Mahane Yehuda market area; four others - including a pregnant woman - were injured. Police arrested two suspects. Saturday will mark the 15th anniversary of the al-Aqsa intifada, which began following Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple MountHaram Al-Sharif complex in August 2000. That year brought some 150 stabbing attacks by Palestinians against Jews in Israel. At least 35 of those involved cars being driven by terrorists toward their targets (including pedestrians). The rest included 11 stabbings and multiple car-and-knife assaults. Sixteen people perished as well as more than 100 victims treated for stab wounds. This is just part of the story. It does not include hundreds of additional vehicular terrorist attacks in much earlier years - before the intifada erupted - nor dozens of successful suicide bombings such as the July 1995 assassination attempt on prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose plot failed only because he decided to shake hands with PLO leader Yasir Arafat while standing next to him. What really puzzles me are the many courageous acts carried out by Israelis over these past 15 years. Many Jews stood up for themselves and stopped violence against Arabs until September 2015. Some of them paid dearly for it, perhaps fatally. Yet there have been no campaigns spearheaded by bereaved families asking why so few good men had the courage valor to do otherwise. These brave souls seem to be forgotten ignored. They deserve all our praises! Thank you dear readers for reading this article about my personal reflections on the events of last week.

"Mandla Hlatshwayo and his friend were shot after confronting a group of men who had robbed women of their mobile phones in a pub in Soweto. The suspects were found hiding under the bed at an ANC office The death toll from South Africa's worst post-apartheid violence rages on, with more than 1 400 murders recorded this year alone - many by members of the country's most powerful political party. In an atmosphere resembling that which prevailed during apartheid, some victims have been killed repeatedly over prolonged periods, as scores of alleged perpetrators go unpunished for months or even years. One victim was allegedly gunned down three times before she died. Another was shot seven times in front of her family, according to two former cops told New Times he shot a woman while drunk and ""out of rage"" because ""he didn't like what [she] said about him."" A third man has been charged only hours after police say they arrested him. But another 22 people face murder charges following the shooting of Mandla Hlatshwayo outside a bar where 16 women had gone seeking help when gangsters robbed them of their cellphones. According to the reports filed with Gauteng provincial police last week, several witnesses claimed Hlatshwayo started flirting with one of the robbers standing near a bush. When he rebuffed the advances, Hltshwayo reportedly confronted others involved in the robbery, asking why they hadn't given back the stolen property. Two shots were fired; Hlatshwayo fell dead immediately, but his friend survived bullet wounds to both legs. While no arrests have yet made, detectives are currently scouring CCTV footage showing passersby at the scene of the crime, including those inside nearby offices. They may find leads leading them towards Alonzo Kempf or Jimmy Dlamini - the pair accused of being behind much of the abortion industry's bloody activity, and who successfully sued SAMBA (Society Against Murder By Abortion), claiming it is not illegal to kill unborn children until birth. Both remain free pending trial. Despite widespread public outrage at previous killings linked to illegality, nothing has come out publicly linking either man directly to the killing of Mandla Hlatshwayo. And yet, despite decades of evidence revealing a link between murder and murderous abortions, controversy still rages on regarding whether abortionists should be forced to carry firearms and undergo regular training in handling such weapons. Some oppose all forms of legalised force, arguing, quite correctly, that there must always be a system of checks and balances whereby killers can be punished otherwise law enforcement does not work as intended. Others argue that doctors should carry guns so they don't become targets themselves, especially since criminals often demand money upfront before carrying out dangerous procedures or threatening loved ones if payment isn't forthcoming within 24 hours. Yet the majority hold that abortion providers need absolutely no special protection beyond that afforded every citizen, seeing only injustice in denying healthcare workers with life experience the ability to protect themselves against wouldbe murderers. What then do you think: Should antiabortion advocates think twice before resorting to the tactics of violent militants? Do we stand by our stance that gun ownership makes medical practitioners vulnerable targets? Or is courageously defending oneself worth risking one's own safety? Share your thoughts below.

"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday. It aims to unite major health services into a single, multi-academy trust (MAT). The proposal is likely to boost patient choice at both sites and could mean lower costs for patients through greater efficiency and more effective use of resources, according to the plan's developers. The two sites would become one MAT with around 27,000 staff by 202324. However, it still needs approval from local people living nearby. So far, 1,500 responded - 56 per cent were against. But there will be further consultation before an application goes forward. Sam Warburton, general secretary of Unison Cymru and Welsh government representative to NHS Wales, welcomed ""real leadership"" shown by health minister Mark Drakeford in his plans for doctors' pay, but said he was concerned about what was not included, such as additional support for rural practices or fighting off privatisation of care under any new deal. He wants a commitment that Welsh social workers are protected from competition by private providers. He also called for urgent action after the latest figures revealed 40p out of every 1 spent on cancer drugs went towards administration rather than treatment. And Mr Warburton pointed out children's wards had closed since 2010 despite cuts in other parts of healthcare. It comes after Welsh Labour published its budget proposals earlier this month which pledged to increase spending in education, transport and housing. There was no mention either of NHS funding.

Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were more moderate than those presented by far-right leader Marine Le Pen or others vying for power, but acknowledged that they risked pushing France closer to a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one. Mr Macron's plans have been well received among voters frustrated with sluggish economic growth and high unemployment, which are at 12 years highs. He is also viewed as an outsider who can shake up government something sorely needed after five years under unpopular Nicolas Sarkozy. His goal of attracting businesses away from Paris has won plaudits too, although many fear it will leave less money for ordinary workers.

"Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common flat and matrix ones, but they were getting nowhere with their people. ""We realised we couldn't make any progress in terms of working collaboratively or setting targets for individual performance assessments unless our people worked at a level where it mattered what kind of work they did,"" says Rosa Lofgren, co-founder and managing director of Crisp. ""And because there are very few examples out there of companies like ours looking at how to manage small teams successfully, we said: 'Let's take on this challenge ourselves. The result was Inspire 2015, an all-day conference held by Crisp last October. It is part coaching session - designed to help attendees focus on their personal goals as well as those of the company and each other - and partly one way of doing business, based around encouraging employees' commitment and motivation through tight processes and metrics. But most importantly, it was a chance to find answers, not only among themselves, but also to external experts who could offer guidance on strategies tailored to them. Although inspired by Human Resources (HR) management rather than professional development tools such as CPD points, the approach may provide a possible future model for businesses to engage with their workforce. In fact, Crisp has begun planning its next event, Inspire 2016. That will be even bigger, covering everything from leadership skills training to team building exercises and high profile speakers too. By then, the consultant team should have come up with enough material to fill three days; right now, it's just two. Insight, coaching, process As HR departments struggle to deal with the changing nature of employment and the growing importance of internal communication, learning management systems might seem redundant. After all, Crisp won't let anyone attend Inspire without filling out some form agreeing to follow whatever it does. But the point isn't simply to gather large amounts of information (though a decent questionnaire is provided), it is to ensure individuals can access support when needed, whether via live online sessions or email correspondence. This keeps attendance rates high while offering flexibility for busy professionals. And since every person gets different levels of attention depending on their needs, there is never any pressure to sign up for formal courses, nor indeed any imbalance between paid and voluntary contributions (the latter include pitches for new services). So far, so good. What sets Inspir apart is the practical application of theory into action. All 27 presenters appear to share the same core values, illustrated by their use of simple diagrams showing how the day flows, both on screen and within participants' mindsets. As a result, it always feels fresh and relevant, helping to keep everyone focused and to avoid useless disjoints in topic coverage. There are slides galore, though nothing would stop a dedicated presenter deciding to skip down a particular path if he wanted to concentrate solely on a specific area of expertise. Inspired? So much so you're considering applying to trainee yourself? Think again! While many self-development courses try to employ an emotional intelligence framework, the Crisps differentiate themselves once more with tangible objectives. For example, although they start off with finding ways to feel happier, they move on to exploring habits, financial responsibility and career progression. Each section ends with notes explaining why these topics matter, providing guidance on how best to go about improving areas deemed weak. Alongside this, there are quizzes throughout the day to test understanding and clear thinking; many aren't comprehensive enough to assign certain results, but they still force respondents to reflect on why questions were answered as they did. Not bad for a small team of programmers... Given that most subjects require participation, it seems strange that the only non-technical option available takes place during lunchtime. Beforehand, delegates complete short surveys on their own time preferences and straightforward hobbies along with details about themselves and their immediate colleagues. Doing so means they get to know each other better before talking shop over food, a tradition which serves to break up long periods of sitting down together. Then, after sharing a meal, attendees split off according to four groups of six people apiece led either by senior managers or otherwise experienced leaders in the field. They remain united until closing time, when projects need to be assigned quickly. At first, things flow smoothly as group members chat freely; however, towards the end of afternoon tea, clashes begin breaking out when people realise they don't agree on anything. Once back inside, they spend another hour discussing issues and ideas, making decisions and passing tasks on. People are allowed to disagree during most discussions but must ultimately adhere to consensus rules. Meanwhile, those leading the workshops talk individually with each participant, asking probing questions to gauge attitudes to others' opinions. A little later, they summarise collective findings as a whole and conclude by gathering feedback on overall success. While inspiring your audience? Nothing else matters quite 1 2.

"Based on a true story, Pride shows how gay rights campaigners from London raised thousands of pounds for miners in the Dulais Valley, after the NUM had spurned their support. It also looks at life in South Wales before and during World War II, when coal was more important than people; there were few women (and none as high-ranking as Minnie Vandeleur) and working conditions were tough. The film opens with a scene that is an early realisation of what will become one of its most enduring images: the long line of miners leaving work by torchlight. And it sets up the theme - which runs throughout - that exuberant defiance against injustice stems from generations of common struggle. But this isn't just another history lesson about mining or class struggles by way of the suffragettes. It's much deeper than that. The film explores the deep division between different unions that gave us two world wars. As we see the efforts to improve working conditions go unheeded because they come not only from the unionised workers but also those who are employed indirectly and need to be paid off first, you realise that even if such men could unite with the likes of Tom Driberg, so entrenched has been the division that no amount of good causes could ever break down the barriers between them. Pride equally examines Britain's lovehate relationship with Empire as well as its leaders' attempts to keep these divisions alive through propaganda.

"The University of Wisconsin successfully claimed that Apple used its microchip technology without permission in some iPhones and iPads. The patent, filed in 1998, is said to improve the power efficiency of devices by slowing down or stopping the flow of data when a phone's processor doesn't need it right now-something we see all too often with modern smartphones. Apple responded yesterday saying they never sought any license from UW for using their patented technologies found on iOS products including iPhone 3G S, iPad 2 and iPod Touch 4th generation (4G). They went further and described UW as hypocritical because it has asked them if it can use similar chips in upcoming models, such as the next-generation iWatch and iTV: ""We have not requested nor would have accepted a license under this old device patent despite our respect for the university,"" according to an email sent to Reuters dated May 29 but first published Feb. 13. ""Our position regarding these other patents was set forth more than four years ago."" AFP noted that it is likely Apple will counter sue under antitrust laws since their intellectual property should be protected against theft. A spokesperson for UW declined to comment to FoxNews.com According to Tim Cook's letter, here are two major points he made about his firm's legal action against UW: First, we did not seek out licensing opportunities related to older product designs either before announcing our new products or after those announcements were made. We had no idea what kinds of products might come along based upon knowledge learned through the research efforts. Second, while one university may believe that it owns every invention created anywhere at anytime in history, courts around the world recognize that universities do not own inventions developed primarily outside of university laboratories; therefore they cannot claim ownership over anything invented unless there is express authorization for commercialization. In fact, even though they owned the electronic circuits themselves - which could only work properly within the confines of the integrated circuit design licensed by Motorola - the court still held that Apple's infringement lawsuit was proper. So for 15 years, Apple refused to pay damages to a company we considered - and continue to consider our friends and partners. But today it ends.... Today marks another step forward in the ongoing evolution of technological innovation, in which many companies like ours find ways to create value simply by building great products well... And I hope you agree that we don't want any country to limit competition simply to protect established businesses. Whether in Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, Africa, Central or North America, we bring the same attitude into each market. Universities have always been known as early adopters of technological innovations due to large amounts of funding available from government agencies. However, recently public institutions have begun developing innovative business strategies; the most famous example being Stanford University that began to develop very strong ties with Google back in 2004. As part of the deal, it gets access to Google's vast RD teams and receives money indirectly via equity stakes in ventures started within its network. Also, Stanford became the unofficial advisor for various startups inside Google and beyond. Forbes' Mark Bergen wrote last year that ""Stanford has become Silicon Valley's college recruiting ground."" He reported extensive talks between Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt during BUILD conference [Microsoft] and predicted Facebook CEO Zuckerberg's decision to drop Harvard Business School classes and take up tech education at Stanford University instead. With huge sums of cash coming from federal grants and private gifts, why wouldn't public schools also invest some resources in exploiting emerging trends? History shows us how valuable intellectual property obtained legally can prove later to be worth billions of dollars. Patent lawyers say that roughly 25 percent of U.S. revenue comes from intellectual property generated internally rather than externally. Companies typically get royalties on sales of products produced by third parties who paid royalties to obtain licenses from others whose original ideas helped give rise to the product. Microsoft Corp., for instance, brings in 5 billion annually from selling Windows software and operating systems developed largely by outsiders, even though the company pays nothing directly for the rights to sell copies. Even before Microsoft bought Internet search engine Yahoo Inc. for US20 million in September 2006, its financial success derived in significant measure from the pioneering role played by three former employees named Jerry Yang, David Filo and Chris Cox. Those men joined Microsoft in 1995 as programmers working on Web browser software that eventually evolved into the MSN portal service. At the time, Microsoft generally kept the source code secret so it couldn't be copied illegally. With hindsight, however, it seems almost inevitable that someone would try to break in sooner or later - and sure enough, eBay did just that in March 2000 when it launched Netscape Navigator 9, copying portions of the MSN user interface. When Microsoft released Win98 SE v1.07 in August 2001, it removed coding keys from both the OS kernel and application binary that enabled the software giant to identify unauthorized copying and prevent it. Yet within weeks of launch, thousands of websites appeared online offering illegal versions of Windows 98 and other applications.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Governing body the UCI introduced the ban in 2011, but a whistleblower said Team Sky continued to inject riders. One of the punishments given was stripping Froome and his team-mates from their Tour de France titles The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has published its new drugs code after an overhaul following last year's London Olympics that saw athletes face tougher sanctions for doping offences. The changes are designed to create ""a fair world where everybody can compete as clean as possible,"" President Sir Craig Reedie says. There were also some pleasant surprises - namely the introduction of long-standing favourites like EPO into the list of banned substances. But while many anti-doping experts welcomed the decision, there were warnings it could lead to innocent people being caught up by the law. Here are six key points about the Wada Code from today: What does the revised version mean? The first thing to note about the updated document is that it will come under the umbrella of European law, which means it cannot be changed without approval from Parliament and therefore must follow EU standards. It will include more details than previous versions, including the creation of a panel of independent experts who must approve any future additions or deletions to the list. WHAT IS IT FOR? For those wading through the text, the aim appears to be twofold. First, to ensure all countries have harmonised rules; second, so drug tests can be carried out with greater consistency across Europe. Some countries such as Russia charge hundreds of thousands of pounds to carry out testing, others only use urine samples. In contrast, the UK uses hair analysis, something its competitors would love them to do too. Other things we know now: EPO remains on the banned list along with other growth hormones including human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Athletes still have three months before they need to start using unapproved methods, but can already begin training In June 2012, Lance Armstrong admitted using performance enhancing drugs at least nine times between 1999 and 2004. He faces lifetime bans against him from international competition if convicted. There are certain exceptions to this rule: individual sports aren't covered by the regulations until 2018 and events run outside national boundaries remain exempt and able to prescribe whatever test regime they wish. However, when it comes to professional cycling these exemptions don't apply because racing takes place within national borders. This means one thing: you'll no longer see cyclists wearing orange jerseys at races unless they're competing in self-sanctioned events - though teams can choose whether to wear them or keep them hidden away instead. A huge relief for fans wanting to watch Brits Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome et al race. HOW DO THEY WORK? Athletes currently go through four phases during a biological passport investigation. They submit 12 blood and saliva samples over five weeks. If results show anything unusual then further investigations take place to determine what dose of prohibited substance may have been taken. Once pinpointing the amount of medicine used, the athlete has 90 days to provide either a full explanation or have their result thrown out. Also added in this version of the WADA Code is the possibility that someone might be exposed to an illegal substance, even accidentally, and not realise it. So, say you've got a bottle labelled 1ml of growth hormone and another 10ml. You put them both back in your fridge but forget to switch off the light next time round... After 90 minutes, the label won't change again. That suggests you haven't made much more than 2ml but, if it shows 5ml, then you'd get a suspension. At present, judges make decisions based on how far down a 'dose' tube goes, the length of exposure expected, the volume ingested etc.. Under the new system, a range of criteria would guide them including: Estimated level of consumption Frequency of administration Amount of medication administered How often it should have been replaced Mislabeling Anticipated toxicity to health Threat to sport Corroboration of evidence Source of contamination Unintentional source of contamination Risk assessment Is there significant risk involved? An example of this was seen recently with US cyclist Taylor Phinney. Last week he tested positive for testosterone, claiming he had inadvertently absorbed a gel cap intended for external application. Doctors found traces of the steroid inside Phinney's body. During questioning, however, the athlete claimed he did not understand why someone would want to give himself such powerful steroids orally. No punishment. Before committing yourself to a programme, look into it thoroughly. Are SACRS approved clinics offering services related to biological passports accredited by relevant bodies? Do they offer educational courses and information? Can I ask my GP if she knows anyone working in the industry? Do I trust her advice?

"It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living cell which genes are active at any time when scientists put certain chemicals into it. This would make it possible to see how cancer cells interact with their environment by looking for patterns they leave behind. The group led by Professors Robert Horvitz (MIT), Paul Nurse (University College London) and Donald Manchon (Institut CurieUniversite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris 6) identified hundreds of specific gene sequences within the chromosomes that show what types of chemical signals are present at each moment in a given cell's life as well as its response or reaction to these cues. They then tested whether these genetic signatures corresponded to known molecular pathways, building on previous work from colleagues including Dr Valeria Zannoni-Pompeo (Istituto di Patologia Molecolare e BioChimica (IPMBC who carried out similar work on breast cancer samples. Their findings included some hitherto unknown links between proteins involved in DNA repair, such as PARP1, and those responsible for tumour suppression through apoptosis, an early form of programmed cell death used to eliminate damaged tissues. Other previously hidden connections were found among three different sets of proteins implicated in controlling cellular growth and division: Rb, p53 and E2F, and this is important because all these proteins have been proposed to be targeted therapeutically to treat cancers. Professors Horvitz, Nurse and Manchon say there are thousands more RNA transcripts than protein products encoded in our genome - and yet even the most basic human diseases occur due to problems caused by faulty RNAs expressed by genes. To further understand these processes, the team built on earlier experiments using synthetic biology techniques developed by Professor Steve Quake's lab at Harvard University Medical School. These showed off-the-shelf parts that allowed them both to add chemical 'switches' to indicate where the transcription process should stop and begin again in order to generate full-length mature mRNA molecules. By attaching these switches only to certain regions of genes, researchers were able to study the precise mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation. In addition, the system enabled real-time tracking of individual mRNAs being made during a normal cell cycle, providing answers about why so much of us do not get sick despite carrying around rogue copies of defective RNAs in every one of our nucleated cells. At the same time it helped reveal many details about how particular mutations give rise to diseased states, offering clues for therapies based on interfering with abnormal transcriptional activity. Each switch has two binding sites; if the first site binds it activates the second one while simultaneous occupancy of the first and last sites prevents activation. The researchers attached switches containing four distinct positions along the length of individual genes encoding GFP (green fluorescent protein). In doing so they mapped out precisely where enzymes bind to start and end translation of GFP messenger RNAs. Using individual position tags, they discovered interactions among multiple components of later steps in the synthesis process, leading eventually to a better understanding of exactly what happens after transcription begins. To test the system the team examined data generated by a mutation that destroys the function of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor, which detects errors in double stranded DNA, thus preventing tumours. Because the mutant BRCA1 cannot perform this crucial role it ends up free running without control, causing tumors. However, the researchers saw increased levels of expression throughout the entire chromosome 13 long arm, indicating that this was far higher than normally expected. Why? For reasons still unclear, the mutated BRCA1 was driving production of unusually high levels of a number of other genes in the same region that had never before been linked together. Together, the results suggest a complex interplay between several biological functions involving the BRCA1 protein - this will require future detailed investigation, but may help explain why women whose family members carry the disease often also develop breast and ovarian cancers themselves.",0,807

"Joanna Michael, 25, from St Mellons, Cardiff, rang 999 twice before Cyron Williams stabbed her to death in 2009. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ruled she was failed by the force's handling of a domestic violence case A woman who called police after being'seriously assaulted' by an abusive boyfriend suffered two strokes which left her unable to walk and with severe brain damage, it has been revealed today. The victim, named only as Joanna because of fears for her safety, may never be able to work again or have children following the horrific attack last September that resulted in injuries so serious they were described at the time as 'catastrophic'. She is now seen as having little hope of recovering much movement in either leg and will need round-the-clock care throughout her lifetime - requiring full-time nursing staff 24 hours per day indefinitely. She also needs oxygen every hour during waking hours. Ms Michael, whose mother Dorothy Dyer helped to raise funds at fund-raisers organised by Ms Michael's family, had made more than 30 calls to emergency services over seven years between 2001 and 2007 when she finally persuaded officers to visit her home six times but failed to arrest Mr Williams until he attacked her from behind on July 4 2008. He then fled and colleagues did not realise what had happened for three days because Joanna's parents told them she was downing tools at their bungalow painting pictures. The ordeal began shortly before midnight when the officer first showed up at Joanna's flat near Eastbrook Road in south east London around 6am asking if there was anything wrong as she complained about pain while walking downstairs. But instead of taking action against her abuser, the policeman informed Joanna's father John that his daughter's back looked like it hurt while he took some photographs and advised him to take her to hospital. Instead, John drove himself to Oxleas Wood Hospital where doctors examined Joanna and discharged her without getting any information about how injured she really was. In bloodied clothes: A photo taken moments after one of many stab wounds inflicted upon Joanna Michael by cyroon William literally split her head open. It shows five stab wounds across her face Mr Williams later turned up unannounced searching for his girlfriend and carrying a knife - he allegedly threatened her life and cut both her upper arms with the blade, slashing deeply into each. Witnesses said that he raped her repeatedly while holding the knife to her throat just hours earlier - despite repeated pleas from terrified friends for help. When armed response arrived half an hour later the couple dashed away through nearby fields leaving her bleeding heavily all over a fence next door - forcing neighbours to call an ambulance and rush her to Lewisham Hospital. Despite such obvious signs of serious harm, medical experts say she should have received a CT scan within minutes and rushed straight into surgery. In fact, surgeons operated on Joanna immediately. Doctors eventually discovered her legs would no longer support her weight and amputation became necessary. They performed four separate operations on Joannia - including debriding the bedsores caused by lying in bed for weeks on end; removing skin grafts; repairing tissue torn apart by infection due to lack of treatment; and cleaning off dead tissues and re-growing new ones. Finally, surgeons inserted metal rods to hold together pieces of bone broken in the initial beating that led to her incapacity. Her cerebral palsy means she cannot sit up or even move herself although she must use computers to communicate with others. Her recovery has been slow and painful but Mrs Michael says that in comparison, intensive care ward nurses treat patients like royalty compared with the way NHS personnel treated Joanna after this appalling crime. As a result of the alleged rapes, Joanna's ruptured bladder was repaired using a catheter - something they tried unsuccessfully to do when she told them about the assault on Wednesday. After months of excruciatingly drawn-out rehabilitation, she can feed herself slowly with minimal assistance, though she still requires constant attention in order to keep her alive. Over the past few weeks her condition has deteriorated with the onset of pneumonia and she is sometimes prone to coughing fits accompanied by chest pains which are strong enough to require intravenous medication and make breathing difficult. CYRON WILLIAMS WAS sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for assaulting Joanna Michael. The judge branded him 'a dangerous man...who clearly cares nothing for human life'. Yet the Metropolitan Police refused to press charges against him because while severely incapacitated, Joanna could give no evidence of rape. Neither detectives nor prosecutors pursued murder charges against the accused because women rarely implicate men who violently abuse them. Nevertheless, Andrew Whitehead QC succeeded in securing a retrial for manslaughter and aggravated burglary involving both offences on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service. On 9 December 2011, Williams pleaded guilty to killing Joanna Michael under extreme provocation as well as raping her causing grievous bodily injury.

"It effectively completes the four-year-old software's transformation from a ""lightweight"" chat app, spun off from the main Facebook site, into a fully-fledged ""platform"" of its own. More than 40 new features and improvements are included in Messenger for Android this week, including international SMS support (with more to come), emoji facetime stickers, privacy tools, and even an App Drawer button that lets you access your apps directly within chats without having to open them separately first. But perhaps most notably, it also brings with it deep integration whether or not users know it yet between Messenger for iOS, Windows 10 Messaging Platform, Google Hangouts, and any web browser. That means many of these same abilities will soon be available on desktop messaging clients like Slack and Microsoft Teams as well. Interestingly enough though, some key changes aren't just coming to Messenger for Android; they're also arriving in full force across all platforms at once meaning we may start seeing direct integrations with other services sooner rather than later. Namely: phone calls, video calling, message templates, end-to-end encryption, and paired devices working together seamlessly. This is the next phase of evolution for Messenger's mobile presence as Mark Zuckerberg has said ""personality doesn't move us."" It seems he was right about that too.

"Dubbed ""carbon farming,"" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices by displacing grains used to feed animals in meat production. Farms enrolled in U.S.-based Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) are raising cows that eat corn but excrete manure rich in nitrogen fertilizer into a series of ponds fed from an underground aquifer similar to how fish farm operations work. Some facilities take advantage of natural processes to increase nutrient levels and improve water quality. Injecting these nutrients encourages faster plant growth and more abundant crops such as tomatoes, which can then easily be harvested for consumption or use in animal fodder. Cattle, sheep and goats consume corn grown on farms like this one. The farmers sell some of their produce at market while others provide fresh milk and eggs to consumers who pay extra for products produced without antibiotics and hormones. [See photos of 'Carbon farming A cow walks down past greenhouses filled with tomato plants guarded by electric netting during sunset in Sangongjin near Seoam City, South Korea, July 6, 2013. Jin Young LeeReuters Image An estimated 100 million tons of emissions per year would be offset through CFI initiatives, according to estimates published last month by the World Resources Institute (WRI). While it's too early to know how much will actually get diverted out of the air thanks to ""carbon farming,"" the concept has proven feasible. In fact, WRI found California has been losing its competitive edge over China and other nations when it comes to using land, space, energy and materials efficiently. There isn't even enough space in North America for all current greenhouse gas emission reductions programs, said Peter Frumhoff, director of climate change science and policy at WRI. So rather than trying to squeeze every available square inch of any given region, he advised governments not to waste money on what may prove ineffective efforts. Instead, countries should try new ideas before committing themselves fully to old ones, Frumhoff told LiveScience. That means investing in research into technologies like bioenergy with little chance they'll ever come into widespread usage - because there simply aren't sufficient resources needed to sustain them well. For example, biodiesel made primarily from soy beans requires massive amounts of fertilizers just to grow those same seeds. And while algae might someday replace fossil fuels, no commercial producers exist today. Even though large-scale carbon offsets already exist in Europe, the United States and elsewhere around the globe, Frumhoff thinks that's only a matter of time: They're expensive; many people still don't believe they actually do anything environmentally beneficial; and nobody really knows whether they create long term economic benefits. Plus, unlike wind turbines, solar panels and hydrogen fuel cells, car engines run forever. If you want to reduce your inventory of oil and coal later this century, you need to start now, thinking about ways to reduce demand for those commodities right away as well, he added. For instance, if we had nuclear power instead of a dwindling portfolio of aging reactors, we wouldn't necessarily have twice as much CO2 stored under our feet as we currently do, either, since most of our electricity gets generated relatively cheaply by burning coal. Most scientists agree that humans have contributed significantly to accumulating atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping gases. However, there are also certain limits beyond which humanity risks going extinct unless major changes occur. With each passing decade, rising temperatures make those tipping points more likely. P]lots of things could happen, so I think it shouldn't surprise us if something does not go quite as expected."" It will probably end badly for lots of different reasons, according to recent studies. Ice sheet collapse, ocean acidification and global warming lead directly to sea level rise, threatening coastal regions over centuries or millennia. At higher latitudes, melting permafrost releases methane trapped beneath the ground, accelerating climate destabilization. Meanwhile, warmer temperatures mean hurricanes become stronger and linger longer, creating severe weather events for years after landfall. Addressing these problems won't be easy, especially when billions live along coastlines where encroaching seas threaten permanent destruction. Current solutions include building dikes or moving populations inland. Another solution being proposed involves geoengineering - altering Earth's atmosphere and surface oceans to mitigate future climate change. Scientists involved in that sort of effort acknowledge that tinkering with nature carries serious dangers and potential unintended consequences. Disputes among experts persist over technical details involving specifics of implementation. In addition, a growing number of environmental groups oppose active intervention against climate change to preserve the environment itself. Others question why government policies should promote costly interventions, even those shown scientifically effective, rather than focusing on reducing costs and expanding access to basic services such as health care, education and shelter. Since 1997, nearly 30 countries worldwide have passed legislation directing national leaders towards actively reducing GHG emissions.

""You can get out where you are because everybody knows everybody else around here, so what do we need this place? We don""t really have anything happening besides football except once a year,"" said Logano, who drives the No. 22 ShellPennzoil Ford Fusion. ""I was born and raised right outside of Miami - I couldn""t imagine living anywhere else than Florida or actually being any other state. So when I got my first job and they were telling me I needed to move somewhere else, I told them no way. This is home. When your family roots go back generations, it doesn""t matter how long you live away from town - if you put down some roots in one spot, then come back after 20 years, those roots never leave. You always start fresh. Here in Florida, especially south of here, all these little towns came together and formed their own small communities, and it made sense to stay close to everything. With our proximity to Interstate 75, people from different parts would come in every day to work and haven""t thought about leaving, either. There""s nothing too far anymore. It feels great to come back here after not having lived within 30 miles from here for 10 months. It should feel good but it""s kind of hard knowing you missed half of the season while doing it. But I""m glad the opportunity exists to bring CGR back full strength. ... Wes Parsons Jr., owner of WPS Race Cars, which owns the cars driven by Tony Stewart, Clint Bowyer, David Ragan, Aric Almirola, Elliott Sadler, Ross Chastain and Paul Menard with sponsorship from Reliant Energy, met his wife here. She runs the OK Go dance company""s office downtown. They married last fall and she moved her stuff here after he bought the shop where she had worked since 2009. Now he works on the team bus instead. Their daughter was born last summer, and they hope to eventually make Central Florida their permanent base. For now, though, they take advantage of PocaRocksFest each September and enjoy coming east to visit friends and relatives at Christmas. This will be the second straight season Pittman Racing hasn""t won its opening Chase race at Phoenix. And I think part of the reason why is simple: He kept losing points through bad finishes and didn""t respond well to adversity early in the season. Maybe something clicked for him late. Or maybe he decided enough was enough and started pushing himself harder on pit road to try to win things more consistently. Whatever it was, he definitely found that groove as the competition leveled off. In fact, he might have used Phoenix as motivation against the rest of us because it forces racers to focus solely on racing without worrying so much about the standings. At least someone learned the lessons of Phoenix as well as everyone else did. On Wednesday night, Butler University freshman Michael Madsen claimed victory in the annual Kia Soul Redneck 500 cruise-in event held along State Road 60 northbound past Windermere. Madsen, of St. Petersburg, drove the 14-passenger Chevrolet Cruze sponsored by Belk Department Stores throughout the 5.5-mile course near Windermere, finishing 16 minutes ahead of runnerup Charles Gray III, of Fort Lauderdale. Three other vehicles finished among the top 15 entries: Richard Sinyakis 1963 Chevy 2 ton pickup truck took third place behind redbrick racer Scott Dunnis 1969 Camaro SS convertible (fourth) and Andy Davisi 2010 Toyota Scion tC coupe, the winner of the previous event.

"Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out on which side he would have gone for. Celtic 1-2 Rangers - Highlights The Glasgow giants go into their first European campaign without a major trophy since 2005 but were too strong for bitter rivals Hibernian at Hampden Park to lift silverware on Saturday after lifting the SPL title earlier this season. The Hoops failed to score for more than half an hour as Hibs went ahead through Darren McGregor before they nearly doubled it when Gary Caldwell headed home. Kris Commons restored parity with a spectacular volley from just inside the penalty area before the visitors took control once again through Lee McCulloch - who fired against the post from 14 yards - 20 minutes from time. Rangers midfielder Barry Ferguson saw red early in extra time for elbowing Fraser Forster from behind near the corner flag. He was booked for dissent by referee John Beaton moments later and will miss next weekend's Old Firm derby clash at Ibrox if he is sent off. ""It looked like a soft one,"" said Onyekachi Aghogho, who played alongside Hughes during Arsenal's run to last year's FA Cup Final. ""He (Ferguson) didn't push him or anything, he just got back up. It looks very harsh that he gets punished for something so minor. I don't think you could award a free kick anywhere else except maybe where that ball came over the line. That wasn't really clear either because there was someone in front of me every step of the way. But even then, if you get all three decisions right, referees probably see them differently.""

"Its reach has also expanded across the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert, attracting members from Mauritania, Morocco, Niger and Senegal as well as from within Mali where, in September 2014 it was reported that al-Qaeda had established a presence. The third element is the suggestion that AQIM may have been involved in attacks on Western targets before 2012 (see section by country). This would be consistent with its role alongside al-Zarqawi's group being to provide logistics for or direct such attacks in order to secure funds while Zarqawi himself remained focused on leading his own organization. The British scholar Ahmed Rashid writes: ""In summary then [in 2003], we can say that Al Qaeda in Iraq - later renamed Islamic State of Iraq - grew out of an existing grouping of radical Islamist terrorists who were originally based to some extent in Afghanistan but gained influence there during late 2001 when they began attacking US forces."" A similar picture emerges for Yemen and Malaysia. Although AQAP itself may not have existed until 2004, both countries are said to host cells which became active after 2006. It does seem evident however that many of these elements were present long before the emergence of AQAP; indeed the most significant feature of AQAP seems to be the degree to which it blends together the various strands already mentioned. Qatar ties It appears likely nonetheless that Qatar and its ruler Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani have provided substantial amounts of funding for extremist groups in North Africa and beyond including AQIM and IS (a fact acknowledged by Washington) before 2013 when, following a political crisis in Egypt, Doha announced withdrawal of their support and took steps to prevent further such flows (Djouhar 2015). In September 2014 Qatari officials denied any involvement in financing terrorist acts outside the Middle East although it could be argued that this denial should be seen in light of the foreign policy interests served by avoiding such accusations since the beginning of the Syrian civil war. As pointed out above, Qatar now finances individuals fighting against Assad's regime in Syria. While most analysts consider those links less than ideal, they do suggest that Qatar and other states will continue providing financial, logistical and technical assistance to anti-Assad rebel factions in exchange for an end to SNC activities inside the territory controlled by President Bashar Al-Asad. On 24 November 2016 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution No 2268 condemning exclusively the use of chemical weapons by the government of Syria and establishing new measures to protect civilians under threat. Amongst them, the resolution prohibits economic relations between member states and Syria. Russia vetoed the resolution arguing among others that it fails to address terrorism.

"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service recorded the acreage of several of the most serious of the 73 heath and grass fires its crews have tackled. The 332-acre total is a new record for this year, which has been described as a ""tough"" one in terms of fire weather conditions. The largest blaze was at Lochinver where 45 acres were involved, with 16 hectares being destroyed by three separate blazes between April 11th and 12th. Two smaller fires on March 29th left six hectares burnt. A further five hectares had burnt along Loch Corrie by May 13th. This area sustained extensive damage from cutters called into service to tackle it after unfavourable weather conditions delayed their arrival until 24 hours later than usual. Five more small fires across lowland areas also caused significant losses - including four that burned through dense conifer plantations around Lochnell - although these items are only counted once each incident so totals do not add up individually. However, Forestry Commission land overall saw a net loss of 43ha. One hectare lost during an operation carried out near Muirhall (Inverness) alone represents about 4 of all woodland within Scotland's forests. A second major disease outbreak affecting woodlands in Shetland and Orkney took place in early June: over 20 square miles of trees affected in North Mainland, mainly spruce fir but also Norway maple. Light winds and warm temperatures helped the spread of chestnut blight, and a benefit event held locally raised 10,000 towards control costs. Elsewhere, Scots pine death cones appeared earlier in Dunbar Forest and St Abbs Park than normal, with the first fall occurring there since 1874; elsewhere 22 species were observed falling for the first time over the last decade. On the other side of the Forth estuary, the latest records show a rise in ash dieback symptoms.",0,827
"Aswad Thomas broke the deadlock for the hosts, heading Sam Magri's cross home after 22 minutes, but from there the visitors took charge. Andy Cook took his goals tally for the season to four with a close-range header before Shaun Miller hit back in first class fashion when he rose highest at an acute angle and drilled into the corner of Morris' left hand post following Richard Woodman's free kick delivery. The Bulls did well not to lose their lead on 68 minutes as they continued to press forward on the counter attack, taking advantage of some sloppy defending by Exeter, who conceded twice more. They were awarded two penalties in quick succession - Ross Ogden was adjudged to have handled the ball outside the area unmarked, while Evans fired over the spot having been hauled down inside the box. The second penalty was converted with ease by Thomas, who calmly sent Adam Stansfield the wrong way. A minute from time substitute Chris Weale saw yellow for fouling Arron Davies in the area, breaking through several players easily along the right flank before being brought down by Gary Mabbutt only moments later. However no further goal followed despite a handful of half chances going begging, and it finished all square between the sides in front of 647 spectators.",0,828

"Katie Locke, 23, was found dead at Theobolds Park Hotel in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire. She had been strangled.

A third man, David Swain, 32, has also pleaded guilty to assisting an offender and is awaiting trial for his part in her murder. Carl Richard Langdell (aged 43) from Columbia Road in Leicester - who swears he did not kill Katie but helped others kill this young woman because she wanted 'to make it look like a sex game' - will be sentenced at Kingston crown court next month The killer's lawyer said: 'I am obviously very concerned about my client's safety after this case. He knows the seriousness with which we are treating him as soon as they read any article or hear anything that might suggest he may have committed this crime himself. I know there has been speculation about how such a thing could happen, although no one can say how this happened beyond what has already occurred in court. But the fact remains that someone other than Mr Langdell murdered Katie Locke yesterday. He told police: ""She asked me if I knew anyone else would do something like that. Because she didn't want to leave nobody behind...she always used to talk about wanting to get out into space... just thinking that things were going too far.

"New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed off one-third of all honey bees in North America and Europe since 2006. It's not yet known whether this particular British variety could also be used to combat other diseases that threaten Honey Bees - including Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), another scourge on the bumblebee, Osmia lignaria, population. But Bocking says that it would make sense if they have similar immune responses against viruses like Deformed Wing Virus because we are ""very likely"" related genetically: ""Some evidence shows us that anatomically and behaviourally we may be closely related."" The study was published today in PLOS ONE by Richard Goulson who works at Rothamsted Research Laboratory near Harpenden, UK, where his team bred this new breed from two existing strains. He explains why he thought of this line as being potentially useful for fighting Varroa Mite. He found last year that when colonies already had some immunity to Varroa there were fewer dead bees at 50 days old than those raised without any natural resistance to the pest. This made him think about feeding resistance genes into bees early so they can develop their own defences before they are exposed to the dangerous pests. And then he remembered earlier work on Africanized bees, suggesting these possess an innate ability to defend themselves against parasites. If bees have such built in defence mechanisms, maybe breeding them out of our stocks of European species wouldn't just lead to problems but might actually help prevent further losses due to the deadly pathogens carried by Varroa. So he set up experiments designed to see if these traits are passed down through generations within the same family lines. He fed both groups of bees artificial food spiked with royal jelly, which helps them grow well, and monitored how quickly each developed a form of protection against V. destructor mites. In addition to looking after themselves economically, he expected this trait to strengthen whatever inherent defence mechanism bees naturally use to keep viral infections under control. As you'd expect, bees reared without any resistance developed none; whereas bees given extra assurance had more even though the experimental group didn't show any increased survival rates over time. Goulson believes the finding will benefit farmers as well as researchers by providing proof of concept for using hybridization between domesticated insects and wild relatives to create more resilient and long lasting breeds. It means gene transfer methods could eventually allow scientists to avoid crossing different varieties or subspecies altogether. Instead, they could combine DNA sequences specific to certain native species together to turn domestic breeds into something much stronger. For instance, perhaps, every spring, commercial hives could receive pollen from newly harvested flowers on your local verge to boost mothers' immune systems while she defends her brood pups against varible fever bacteria? A hive family could then take advantage of its new power to produce healthy offspring with less risk of losing swarms.",0,844
"Aamir Siddiqi, 17, was stabbed at his home in Roath in 2010 and two men, Jason Richards and Ben Hope, were jailed for life in 2013. Mohammed Ali Ege, originally from Somalia, has been freed after serving just five years of a 40-year sentence 'They took my pride away when they sent me to prison. Every day I felt like killing myself because the pain never left my heart but I kept it inside and tried not to give them any reason [to do so]. But now that they have let me go, there is no way back. And every time one comes across those who know what happened it upsets me all over again. The only thing I can say now is ""Why did you take my killer? Why are you letting him out? You will be sorry! - Sabrina Syeed (Facebook) Sabrina Syed says she cannot sleep without dreaming about her son Aamir Siddiquey. He had been brought up by her husband as their own child and he lives with her today, aged 39. When he was stabbed outside his mother's house on Roath Avenue and survived, it seemed impossible that the same person would ever come close enough to harm another member of the family. Then, six months later, 18-year-old Mohammed Ali Ege escaped from Cardiff Crown Court where he faced trial for stabbing Mr Siddiquee twice in front of witnesses. Despite being sentenced to 40 years in jail, Mr Ali Ege walked free due to an ""extraordinary"" reduction in conviction terms made possible thanks to new sentencing guidelines unveiled last year. But this week more than four years since Mr Ali Ege attacked Mr Siddiquee, his former victim was set upon once again while walking alone down Greenbank Road on 19 March 2017. 'I didn't even see anything coming,' Sabrina said. She saw someone dash towards her son from behind, then heard two thuds before she realised three or four people had run off into nearby trees. When police came and questioned her, Sabrina told officers everything she could remember. It seems unlikely a jury would have convicted Mr Ali ege given these circumstances.""The fact the defendant ran away makes me feel very sad,"" Judge Paul Thomas QC said during his ruling. Yet behind closed doors, Sir John Hopkinson reduced Mr Ali ege's minimum tariff by 27 years - which means he will spend little longer behind bars than anyone else involved in carrying out such a brutal attack. Under the Sentencing Guidelines for England Wales published last November, violent sex offenders should serve on average 52 of their original sentences; non-violent rapists, 41; murderers, 57. And, after applying for early release under the newly amended Criminal Justice Act 2003 section 23 (1) (a), judges may reduce offences committed between April 2004 and December 2015 by 10, 20 or 50 - although the latter is rarely used. During the hearing yesterday morning, Judge Thomas expressed surprise at how much credit SAINZ gave to guidance produced by Lord Scrivener's Appointed Ministerial Group (AMG) on offender management in 2012 at its annual conference. While the judge acknowledged the importance of the work done by the AMG, he added: ""It does seem remarkable to use such expressions as ""trivially short"" and ""relatively trivial."" After considering the case in depth, he then decided that 25 years served for robbery and attempted murder represented adequate punishment. A post shared by George Taylor (georgetaylor) on Mar 21, 2018 at 9:59pm PDT In a statement issued following the judgment, CAINZ reiterated calls for further review of the legislation relating to mandatory reporting of sexual violence cases. They also repeated previous requests that this matter be referred to the Committee of Ministers. We continue to believe that substantial improvements must be made to our current practice regarding mandatory reports to ensure justice and public safety are properly protected whilst simultaneously ensuring victims feel supported and treated appropriately. On Friday, Gareth Evans MP for Hove accused CAINZ of failing to adequately protect women and girls facing domestic abuse: ""Whilst we welcome progress towards reforming the criminal law regime around rape, we remain deeply concerned for women living in abusive relationships and those seeking support through ASBATE, where they face prosecution if they report crimes against them. This needs addressing urgently.""",0,845

"A crew from Deeside was sent to the play park in Sealand just before 13:00 GMT. The woman had stepped through the hole in a car tyre and became wedged , leaving her with only one leg trapped. The incident happened on Sunday afternoon at Sealands Adventure Play Park, which has been closed since then due to safety concerns, as well as health and safety issues. It is understood that the hole where the girl fell through may have been caused by children playing in it. There are reports of kids putting their fingers into holes or falling down them. Police said they were called after receiving several calls about a child being stuck inside a hole on top of a slide. They confirmed the report but did not go into any more details because of privacy laws. An air ambulance landed nearby within minutes to take the stranded young lady away for treatment. She later underwent surgery following complications during what has been described as an ""extremely difficult operation."" Sources say she remains critically ill in hospital. A stiletto heel has also reportedly been found with the foot. Once again these incidents happen on real-life theme parks including Water World New Zealand (two years ago) and Maddie's Quest Australia (just last month).

"He wanted a tribunal to approve a move to a Scottish prison, but Ashworth Hospital said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the Merseyside top-security facility. But in July 2003 an independent psychiatrist told Mr Justice Nicol there was no evidence that his condition required any treatment other than regular visits from officers or access to therapy groups. The judge did not think it proper for him to remain on licence after this point - and ordered his release under supervision. He was transferred back to HMP Liverpool two weeks later. But within months of being returned to open conditions, Mr Smith, who suffers learning disabilities and has Asperger's syndrome, stabbed another inmate with a penknife during a fight over 2.50 worth of tobacco at Sefton Prison Farm in Wallasey. The victim lost four fingers as well as suffering damage to the liver, spleen and kidneys. A year later they were fighting again when three prisoners suffered broken bones while battling Russian gangster Ali Khater in C Block. And in March 2004, Mr Smith attacked a fellow prisonerhitting him several times about the body with a homemade weapon, including one blow which fractured the man's skull. In January that year he was sent down for six years for possession of cocaine. Mr Justice Nicol ruled that he must serve half of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole.

"Seven people have denied conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth PS144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011. Matthew Davies, 33, of Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf; Christopher Price, 29, formerly of Penarth in Vale of Glamorgan; Daniel Ford, 36, from Swansea; Paul Rogers, 37, from Torquay; James Hayward, 28, a resident of Newport; and Thomas Whittington, 42, an employee of a building company based on the outskirts of Haverfordwest are each charged with conspiring together for their own economic benefit by dishonestly causing or permitting certain third parties to make material false statements in writing to Lloyds Banking Group Plc (Lloyds) which was owed 60,334.92 as a result of the alleged activity. They deny all charges against them. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant District Prosecutor Martyn Jones and Detective Sergeant David Evans of South Wales Police's Serious Fraud Unit who say that the allegations relate to customers who gave money towards premium payments for motor insurance during this time period and had not been repaid when policy holders requested it before settlement of those policies took place. However, most of these cases involved delay tactics by the defendants over the course of several years through letters sent to Lloyds claiming they needed more funds than what they actually did. ""It appears there has also been some fraudulent use of email addresses where fictitious names appear attached to emails purporting to be from both Lloyds Bank and various claimants with letters stating they do not owe any monies to pay back premiums, but yet they still continue to live above their means without repaying said debts,"" Sgt Williams added. Police suggest that many of those affected were aged pensioners living modest lifestyles and may well have lost their homes if payment plans were not set up by Lloyds. Davies approached his wife Caroline Davies-Price - then known as Carrie Raper -of Redcar, Co Durham about applying for compensation for an accident he claimed to have suffered while driving her car on Christmas Day 2007. She says she never applied because she did not want him to go into debt again. The couple went out drinking and when Davies left his wallet behind in a pub he found himself unable to get home so turned off the engine and asked his wife to drive him to her parents' house instead. Some 30 minutes later he began having trouble breathing and saw blood coming from his nose. He later collapsed and was taken by ambulance to hospital. But police believe Davies fabricated the story of how he came to lose control of the vehicle and hit another vehicle that caused him severe injuries. His claim initially settled for only 1,500 was eventually reduced to just 840 under pressure from Lloyds. In total, the fraudster received two awards totalling 35,156.23 paid directly to his bank account. He used one cheque book to write the amount down and kept the rest in cash hidden away until 2014. A second claimant alleges he withdrew 12,450 using stolen credit card details supplied by Davies along with other personal information such as date of birth which the latter obtained using identity theft software. But soon afterwards Hayes contacted his insurer to ask why he had stopped making monthly repayments and informed them that someone else called Peter Benson had done so previously. For almost four months he waited by phone begging the insurer to return his money telling him he would lose everything if he could not afford to keep paying his mortgage or maintain essential household items like food and gas bills. Eventually, in July 2010 he heard nothing further so phoned Lloyd's once again insisting they investigate whether anyone had ever borrowed money from him as no payment plan was put forward at first attempt.

"The Mercian Regiment said Private Derby XXXI was officially selected by the Duke of Devonshire from his flock at the Chatsworth Estate, Derbyshire. The Swaledale Ram helped to form a strong bond between man and sheep as it spent time with four generations of family members during its preparation for service in Afghanistan. First Sergeant Paul Davies watched on nervously while preparing cartridges along with Corporal James Jones for use in an upcoming firefight against Taliban militants. It's been nearly five years since he joined the Army Reserve unit and has seen many things over that period but never anything quite like this - watching two men prepare their weapons, all part of a much anticipated mission against enemy forces. But then coming across something else - a young ram ready for deployment! To be honest there were no words to describe what we saw except 'wow' or perhaps better still ""utter amazement' - the image is so surreal, so incredible; I can scarcely believe my eyes. This swede - which really does look like any other ram you could come across anywhere near home will soon make history if deployed into battle alongside our brave lads in Helmand province. We hope they take good care of him and do everything possible to ensure he comes back safely when his tour is up. After all His Grace, Charles Brandon, Duke of Devonshire, gave us permission to call him 'Swaledale Ram'. Before deploying he received training and instruction on how to control the ram (it turns out goats are pretty similar to rams) and a short course on goat husbandry. He now joins hundreds of lots of other animals called upon to support troops in varying degrees including horses, dogs and even camels. Their role is not always about combat because some of them are used for search-and-rescue operations and others provide security for bases or patrols involving live fire where the dangers of death or injury may arise from gunfire or explosions. They also help identify human remains following military engagements. Some are employed as messengers within the ranks and those who have previously served with other units find themselves welcomed back after having left the army. The purpose is simple: each animal helps soldiers fight the war. Once these teams have performed their duties the animals go safely through veterinary inspections before being sent home again. For more details see SOLDIER LOVES THE SWEDELEPHANT When Royce Davis wanted a Christmas present for his friend Josh Jackson last December, he ordered the best one available in New York City...a pair of sneakers adorned with pictures of a majestic African elephant. ""He's going to love it,"" Davis told ABC News, referring to Jackson, who had recently returned from duty overseas with the U.S. Marine Corps. ""It kind of makes me feel proud."" In fact, Davis himself just got off active duty, serving eight months in Iraq, and was looking forward to spending part of the holidays with his parents and girlfriend until the gift arrived. And, yes, that rockin' new footwear did indeed get shipped directly from Africa. What started simply enough as a happy surprise turned into an unusual feeling of commitment for both Davis and Jackson. ""It made me think twice,"" says Davis, 26, according to AP. ""We went around doing stuff together [after returning]...we bonded."" Now, though, life isn't exactly normal. Said Jackson:My little bro saved somebody's life today actually,"" says the 24-year-old soldier. ""There was someone laying down dying next to us, and he walked right over and pulled her away from the vehicle and she survived.Jackson, another veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, is currently stationed in San Diego. A few weeks ago, he found a woman wounded in a car accident near Camp Pendleton. She'd suffered severe injuries and needed immediate medical attention. As it happened, only 20 Marines were due to arrive with emergency supplies shortly. Fortunately, however, Harrison County EMS responded quickly with a truckload full of gear. ""They loaded [the victim] onto a stretcher and brought her straight here,"" recalls Jackson, adding that although he knew he couldn't save everyone, he decided to offer his expertise anyway. By the end of the day, the couple would spend three days caring for 36 people, traveling nonstop in 150 miles, while braving torrential rains and gusting winds. Several patients required surgery, but most were able to return home relatively unharmed thanks to soldiers such as the ones who stopped by. En route to several sites, they passed numerous depressed individuals slumped miserably against buildings. At times, the road seemed hopelessly blocked by abandoned cars, livestock stalls, refrigerators, outdoor furniture and even appliances strewn throughout yards and streets.

That is no longer your concern.' The unusual expression was apparently chosen from Shakespeare's Macbeth because it refers to whether people should act in good faith, as they are told, or defy convention and commit treason against their country. It also has intimations of suicide because an indecisive person may choose to 'die' rather than confront life-threatening decisions. Spokesman Mike Norris said: ""We've never had anything like this happen before."" He added that staff did their best to ensure there would have been no offence.

He has now scored four times since being substituted early against Sunderland following an injury sustained during Saturday's win over Chelsea.

"Lara Clarke, from Brownhills, has previously made near-life-sized cakes of Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lawrence. Her latest creation, baked to celebrate the Defender model, fed 2,000 people at a charity event in Hull - but she still had time for an interview She teaches me how it works: A low whirring overhead creates enough noise to mask my voice on the phone while Lara explains her career as a cake artist. She looks like someone you might bump into after work - an attractive woman who smiles easily and wears colours that seem deliberately chosen to make women look younger than they are. But I don't think I've ever met anyone so hardworking or dedicated before, and today is no exception. In total, the plan was for her to bake up to 500 cupcakes for tonight's fundraiser. The first batch will go out just after 6pm, when we have our meeting with supporters' group Friends Of Hull FC Supporters Club (FOFCC). Then there'll be another batch later this evening; two more during breakfast tomorrow morning; then finally one final batch around 10am before our afternoon game against Barnsley. By 3.30pm she needs to leave immediately to pick up some supplies and get ready for tonight - there're 400 children coming along, too many treats and not nearly enough staff. We arrange to meet again between 5.15pm and 6.30pm to collect the finished products and take them home. As usual, nobody gets any sleep. No wonder everyone gets palpitations by half past five! It may sound busy to outsiders, but Lara says she doesn't do anything else apart from baking these days. ""I'm very organised,"" she tells me. ""If I didn't keep organising things I'd never finish."" Organised means lots of different skills because every job takes several hours alone, even if it seems simple. For example, prepping ingredients can involve calculating quantities carefully so everything fits inside your oven without messily spilling over, measuring everything precisely or checking labels. Making decorations requires dexterous manipulation using well-greased fingers. And delivering food is tricky, involving running up steps and through doors. I ask about the infamous Chelsea Clinton moment, which went viral last year. Although she claimed to suffer permanent damage to her finger tips, her hand looked perfect afterwards: Wasn't that something? There must be a way to prove that such an injury could happen: My eyes water as I realise that most injuries couldn't possibly look the same. Even though Lara knows what happened, it makes her laugh. She thinks back to her own'mistake'. One day, driving to Liverpool Street station, she decided to park somewhere close rather than pay extra money to use the car park outside the tube station. When she got home, she realised that she'd parked in front of a shop window displaying birthday candles in all shapes and sizes. After a quick chat with husband Lee, they agreed together to cover them with icing. When he left to make tea, she took down a box of red glittery sugar sprinkles and started decorating. ""It wasn't planned!"" She giggles. ""Lee called me halfway through and said, 'You know those big, fat gold sparklers?' So I did a few rounds of all four sides."" Never mind being temporarily blinded. Given her previous history, I doubt she would repeat such a gaffe. However, I'm not surprised that she found pink roses difficult. That's usually only a problem when painting with royal blue paint. Once upon a time, Lara spent years making eight cakes sized 1m high, each featuring a photo of a famous actor or actress in their natural size plus three small cupcake versions scaled up to show off the detail in greater proportions. Each cake looked like a miniature version of themselves posed next to other familiar faces in various states of undress. To complete the project, Lara created cake figurines using modelling clay modelled onto real photographs. Some were realistic representations of actors with exaggerated features, others caricatures with cartoonlike limbs and heads. Most featured clothing similar to what the original star wore in the photos. Like the iconic Liz Hurley dress worn by Madonna quipping 'Bitch, please', one of Lara's creations showed Carrie Fisher wearing the leotard outfit Princess Leia borrowed from Han Solo in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Only much smaller. ""People thought they were tiny,"" laughs Lara. Fewer people thought so now that she added the cupcakes to the mix. People drove hundreds of miles to buy the cakes online. They sold almost instantly, raising far more cash than expected. Unfortunately, time ran out before Lara completed the second stage of her project, creating 100 copies of 11cm tall models dressed up as every film character played by Gary Oldman. She had to start fresh from scratch when the government changed building regulations. At least she managed to create 50 suitable replicas of what became known as the Famous Five characters.

"Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have been arguing over what this means legally but there is no doubt whatever that it does not mean less than two-thirds of Belfast voters want to remain part of Britain. Northern Ireland has also gained another right to vote on whether or not to leave Europe alongside Scotland and Wales next year - thanks largely to its greater population share within the United Kingdom - so if Scots voted to leave then some kind of special arrangements would be needed for NI too as things stand now. But even leaving aside such possibilities, these figures are very strong evidence indeed that any attempt by Westminster to impose direct rule from London will meet determined opposition at Stormont. Whether or not David Cameron's promise last week was ever realistic remains an open question but one thing he made clear yesterday is that nothing can happen until 2014 when elections take place here. And because of Northern Ireland's unique circumstances, this is likely to involve STV working out how to allocate constituency seats between nationalists and unionists which could affect the outcome. Whatever happens, however, the results reflect quite strongly on the position proposed by Labour leader Ed Miliband who said ""the people I represent"" wanted Scottish independence even though they were being denied the chance to express their views directly.",0,867
"""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving to England but his teammates remain behind, playing for Caledonia FC - an amateur side from Ayrshire that has won everything except Sunday league grand finals over the past two years. In between games they're kitted out with armbands bearing their club name across the front, where others are emblazoned ""Caledonian Embassy."" They don't have a nickname or mascot yet, something that might change once Scotland face Italy in Moscow this summer as part of Euro 2016 qualification. But it is clear these Scotsmen know how important their connection with teams like Caley Thistle will be if they want to compete at such elite level. They speak proudly about their Scottish roots: Celtic Park was never really home because there were too many Rangers fans; English eyes glaze over when talking about the country south of Hadrian's Wall. And while other countries' clubs can shrug off questions about ethnic origin by claiming their supporters come from all corners of Europe, no country quite compares with Scotland when it comes to national identity. Betting shops refuse to take bets against the four major professional clubs any more than they would on Manchester United verses Tottenham (or Man City versus Chelsea). The only time I've heard of anyone taking odds on a team being relegated before kickoff starts was in relation to Aberdeen last year during some midweek matches which preceded their run down the table, after failure to qualify for the Champions League had already seen them drop into the third tier of European competition for the first time since 198485. Even then people did it for fun. Nobody takes real money on anything in Scotland. People talk about doing so, but nobody ever does. That is perhaps why Scotland still appear determined, even now, to lose the battle for world power status. We haven't just lost out economically: we are creating less wealth per head here every decade than almost anywhere else outside America and western Australia. Of course, pockets of success exist elsewhere within our borders, not least in Dundee and Fife, Edinburgh's old rivals. In addition, despite losing out in its bid to host 2014 Commonwealth Games, both cities continue to shine thanks largely to their respective universities and research centres. The Sun newspaper described oil hitches to Edinburgh airport coming under construction in 2012 as the ""second worst day in aviation history,"" and headlines in 2010 screamed about the cancellation of new passenger flights between northern Scotland and London. Alasdair Gray wrote recently that Scotland does indeed seem hellish to outsiders, having been left alone by the EU for 12 hours during the Brexit vote, and that foreigners tend to see us merely as an inconvenient collection of islands rather than as a nation state worthy of respect in itself. We're certainly caught up in all sorts of regional disputes, jealousies and rivalries. Some of those would disappear if independence came later next week. But the impression remains that the most important thing in life here is sport. If devolution hadn't happened, Scotland could probably survive without government departments or courts. It'd simply drift along in ignorance. As things stand, however, independence brings a bigger chance of economic recovery than living and dying by sporting results. There isn't much evidence to suggest people here give half what they do at football away. Certainly, you rarely hear about someone saying they'll donate 2m to charity instead of buying tickets for Celtic v Barcelona. At St Andrew's University Sports Day, held each June, tracksuit tops worn by students look exactly like the kind handed out to schoolkids at Olympic opening ceremonies. When I ask kids aged around 11 whether they reckon Scotland eventually will win the World Cup they get very confused. Fewer than 10 say yes. Often fewer than 5. However hard I try to explain the importance of winning football competitions, the truth sinks in slowly. For a start, you need goalscoring heroes to make your own country feel proud. And while Scottish strikers break records and play for big international sides, the reality is that few No1s compare to former Liverpool striker Michael Owen.

In fact if anyone says anything at all about how well I am doing, I always lie immediately afterwards by telling them I haven't slept properly for weeks which usually works really well. My friend Alice once said she didn't believe I was lying because there isn't even a word called 'liesleepsigh' yet so obviously no one knows what goes through your mind during these sleepless periods! Anyway today though I realised I hadn't told anyone properly why I couldn't go out anywhere any more. It came as quite a surprise and I suppose some good news coming just after Xmas might be bad timing. So instead of that I thought I would tell you about another thing that got added recently. In May 2009 my mother passed away after suffering with dementia for around 6 years and leaving us feeling lost without her support. As time moved onwards I joined forces with my sister Joanna to try and keep alive everything my mum worked towards over the previous 24 months which mainly involved trying to find information on websites like and After almost losing hope, my sister found many wonderful sites telling their stories about living life despite mental illness including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By June 2010 my mum finally did pass away peacefully although sadly none of us knew she wouldn't make it beyond July as nobody bothered to visit her there and only three days later did we discover she wasn't breathing in bed anymore. She died knowing she'd made such a difference to others' lives and being proud of those differences too. However in order to cope with grief we need love, friendship, fun times etc... When I lost our mum I became grateful for every day of her life spent together. We did silly things and laughed lots; sometimes sitting among piles of junk or standing on boxes creating new ones. Mostly though we talked and shared ideas about how to live life better or workable situations. Doing things for other people - helping friends care for their elderly parents for example - was a big part of what we enjoyed most and we also spoke passionately about learning martial arts and taking dance lessons. It's incredible how much joy kids can bring to our family and how much happier seeing loved animals makes us feel. But unfortunately medication meant we weren't able to enjoy ourselves nearly as often as we wanted. For example we never saw that horse running across fields nor took dancing classes because of Dad putting his foot down saying he ""didn't want girls getting the wrong impression of what dad does for a job"" however he wasn't averse to watching Rolf Harris films and there were enough opportunities for him to come round for a beer later on. I wish those days could return but maybe some people call them lost memories and therefore regretful experiences. Taking medication means we cannot take joys and games in our stride because we're thinking about the possible side effects or how they help our bodies recover from illnesses. There's nothing wrong with wanting protection against potentially damaging things in your body but it does mean there may be moments when we miss out on enjoying life to its fullest potential. According to Wikipedia depression affects 7 of women and 4 of men whereas anxiety disorders affect 20 of women and 10 of men. All different types of mental health issues exist but I think it's obvious to see that women far outnumber men.

"28 June 2016 Last updated at 08:03 BST On 1 July 1916, British soldiers started fighting in the Battle of the Somme. The people in charge said that the battle would take 12 weeks to win or lose - but it took four years for Britain's war effort to be brought under control and six more months before they could start winning again... 1 Jul 1915 4th Bn Royal Munster Fusiliers 2nd Lt Thomas Hickey, aged 23 From Dublin A great deal is made today about how the Irish were treated by English forces during WWI; if so many Irishmen died fighting on behalf of England why was Ireland itself neglected? Not just because of its neutral status; rather there were some very good reasons why Northern Ireland should have been part of a united Great Britain (as opposed to being divided into two separate countries). Most obviously one reason was that there are no natural borders between Ulster and Connaught in Ireland; another factor is that what we now know as 'Ulster' did not even exist until after the 1600s! Because Ulster didn't formally enter the United Kingdom until 1922, the earlier rule laid down in 1800 simply wasn't applicable, although this meant that an enormous number of Catholics lived with Protestant neighbours in non-Protestant counties. This meant that they often felt alienated from their own culture and religion. There had also been tensions within Ulster since the mid 1700s when the Catholic gentry began supporting France against William III, which caused conflict between Protestants and Catholics throughout the province. In addition to this, when James II fled across the Irish border he left his son behind who was subsequently declared King of Ireland by most of the populace. He then created his puppet Parliament in Kilkenny where he kept himself hidden while dispatching orders via post riders and messengers. For all these reasons, Irish nationalism really got going towards the end of the 18th century - in fact there was only a brief interruption in this movement between 1798 and 1801 when Napoleon invaded southern Ireland. At first, however the French occupation helped bring both Catholics and Protestants closer together again. However, once Napolean returned to power in Paris things became much worse for the majority nationalists. As time went on, the population split increasingly along religious lines. By 1914 Catholicism outnumbered Anglicanism among the peasantry somewhere around three to one - and the situation remained almost static up until 1918. And yet it appears that nobody knows exactly how many fought on either side of the War despite the huge numbers involved, probably because the vast majority of them came from rural areas of Ireland where records are unlikely to survive longer than 50 years old anyway... At any rate, the figures I've found indicate that over 200,000 served on the Allied side and nearly 500,000 served on the German side.. Many of those serving were conscripted not volunteers; others volunteered and joined without realising precisely what they were taking part in hoping somehow to justify themselves afterwards. These men suffered horrible wounds and casualties (over one million killed outright) which led to the creation of the Red Cross. Despite their heroism, the last major action in WWI saw the failure of the Allies to break through at Amiens - that failure contributed greatly to the Germans launching Operation Michael later in November 1918. During 1919, negotiations continued between Germany and the new Republic of Ireland in order to see whether they might actually make peace together. Even though the Treaty finally signed on 20 December 1920 included Article 6 - guaranteeing freedom of worship for Roman Catholics - it still wasn't enough for their political allies, especially Sinn Fein who wanted complete independence. Their view prevailed everywhere except northern Ireland. Since 1921, the Irish Free State has existed separately from the UK, which means that it hasn't always enjoyed membership of commonwealth organisations like the BBC or the Eurovision Song Contest. It has also remained outside NATO and tried hard to remain independent politically - including having little contact whatsoever with Britain throughout WWII period. Although it accepted neutrality in 1942, wartime measures introduced in 1943 forced the Irish government to introduce censorship and there were strict curbs placed on civil liberties in general. What happened next is well known; the IRA carried out attacks from 1940 onwards for several decades leading eventually to the British Invasion of 1954. That resulted in widespread violence (including executions), U2F IAEA bombings etc.... After much bloodshed, the Good Friday Agreement ended the Troubles in 1998, creating the present state of affairs whereby southern Ireland remains relatively peaceful and prosperous and republicans can get elected freely in every election except possibly West DerryLondonderry. But Britain isn't likely to admit defeat anytime soon, mainly because of EU rules which require shared institutions on cultural matters wherever possible - and Britain doesn't want anyone telling it what music to listen to! So you can expect ethnic tension and division to continue indefinitely into the future unless Britain totally collapses economically first. What does the history tell us about the rest of Europe? If the war hadn't taken place, Europe may well have become racially homogeneous again. Instead, the European Union expanded eastwards into the former Soviet bloc, and south-timeline, i. All told.

"During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK. He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised for them and their families when they arrived on these shores - a huge success considering that only three per cent of British Jews had any savings at all before 1939. He also got Britain involved with the rescue of hundreds more ""asylum seekers"" stranded by The Blitz in Europe. Many thousands died while trying to escape Nazi occupation but those who reached safety in England were taken care of under his watchful eye until it became too dangerous to remain there either. As well as providing sanctuary, over 70,000 refugees ended up working or studying in the country. At the end of August 1945 - after five years in office - Churchill reluctantly left No 10 Downing Street and continued writing books, articles and letters during what would be an eventful second term in government where he again confirmed himself as one of the most gifted communicators ever born and made sure we knew exactly why war broke out between Germany and Poland (he did it very much against public opinion).

Derry were dangerous down both flanks and they almost scored late in the opening period through Darren McCaffrey, whose cross found Paul Byrne unmarked but goalkeeper Brian Cartwright made an excellent save diving low to his right.

""She is a fantastic person with such strength of character you don't see many people like her these days."" It was early 1995 when Pulis first caught sight of this remarkable woman sitting up front as he addressed supporters after West Brom had won promotion from Division Four following their third successive season in the top flight. She then became one of his most important lieutenants during his long spell in charge at Birmingham City but it took until last December for them to reconnect professionally. They are now married (in Perth) and still friends. When I ask him if she helps out behind the scenes too, he replies: ""I'm not sure about that because she studied psychology - no disrespect intended - and she always wanted me to know everything going on. Everybody knows Larraine does all our coaching work while we're away so there'll be plenty of time spent watching television together. We've got more than enough to keep us busy!"" Pulis is well aware how difficult life can become without someone who loves unconditionally whom you can rely upon every day. He met her through his former Crystal Palace manager Bruce Rioch 20 years ago. Rioch used to share his car with her father Alan, who worked alongside Rioch back in south London. After Pulis came north to join Brentford in 1980, Rioch recruited him into the family firm Rawlinson Wicks, which provided building materials including flooring, insulation boards, electrical wiring components and roof tiles under its' own name. In return for helping Rioch build teams capable of achieving success around Britain, Pulis received handouts whenever required; 100 here or there would come in handy in those pre-Premier League days. Rioch had been brought along by Joe Mercer, who owned both clubs, especially Palace where Alan worked as chief scout. It wasn't easy persuading 32-year-old Pulis to make a move from Coventry City which he felt was limiting his chances of achieving greatness. But Newton Heath chairman Jack Walker insisted on signing him despite objections from Leicester, Sheffield United and Wolves amongst others. Later in 1995, Pulis went on to win two promotions with Palace before setting up his own business in 1997 to design, install and maintain carpets, rugs and wall coverings throughout the capital which he runs today. His wife Shazia also works full-time for him in the office. They have six children ranging from five to 16 years old plus three stepchildren. What do they talk about? Well it depends what mood he happens to find himself in, admits Pulis. When he's feeling down, things tend to center round football as they did earlier this year when he suffered another heart attack in April 2009 yet, once again, remains optimistic about his future prospects. As for Shazia, it's mainly housework where possible, though sometimes she gets involved in analysing potential players ahead of new signings like David Bentley this week. Their eldest son Omar provides support at training sessions and matches alike when needed. For Pulis,who moved from Cardiff City to Palace in 1990 after leaving Bristol Rovers, the key word is friendship. Upon returning to Cardiff as assistant boss to Kenny Moore, he encountered several familiar faces from his previous tenure at Newport County, notably Steve Rix, whose brother Phil is currently an advisor at Stoke City. Both men stayed in touch and even shared some home comforts over Christmas 25 years ago although neither knew exactly why they were back at each other's place for Christmas dinner. This year marks 25th anniversary since Andy King started a career at Leeds United -he played twice for Wales against Northern Ireland in 1976.

On Wednesday nights he travels 50 miles across North Yorkshire via train to help coordinate goalkeeping preparations at Padiham AFC. That same club nurtured Latics goalkeeper Paul Farman who joined Chesterfield in 1958 aged 18. Now 61, he usually accompanies his friend Roy McFarland -the present-day manager of Cambridge United -up country on Tuesday evenings.

"Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA analysis indicates most modern-day Swedes have a mix of European ancestry dating back to this migration 3002 years ago By Thomas Allen The Washington Post KOPIETINSKA LINNDA, Sweden ""We're getting ready for winter here,"" says Marika Gustafsson as she and her husband pack their belongings into an old blue Volvo station wagon to return home after a day spent visiting friends. They've filled up on smoked salmon sandwiches made with onions, pickled cucumbers and brown bread at local restaurants; they'll eat it all again tonight when they get home. But there's time yet before freezing temperatures will restrict movement. Until then, these days offer travel opportunities among people who should be strangers but know one another intimately through shared ancestry. Among them is Erik Lindgren, 40, whose surname means ""little lake"" or ""small water."" He lives just outside our little village on an island on Lake Malaren by the name of Nattjorden nightsound, which he refers to affectionately as his summer house, where he spends many evenings drinking homemade wine and watching live music concerts performed by musicians playing traditional folk instruments such as guitar, fiddle, violin, accordion and percussion to standing audiences. His pride and joy is not the garden he tends during quiet moments, nor the meticulous wood carvings he makes in the basement workshop. Nor does he cherish the primo wines his neighbors produce in nearby cellars (the vintner next door has been known to make five bottles of red per week). Instead, it is what lies under the surface of the earth: a deep history revealed each year through DNA testing revealing genetic information about how we came together over millennia. What can you learn about your ancestors if everyone knows someone else? Last month I had my first encounter with similar questions posed by researchers in Kopietinska Linnda, a few miles away from where Mr. Lindgren now dwells. The scientists' interest was sparked partly by the discovery reported last August of two previously unknown ancient sites excavated near the small town of Jonkoping. Detecting only remnants in the soil, archaeologists found evidence suggesting humans lived in Scandinavia hundreds of thousands of years earlier than once thought possible. Some experts believe these remains represent early hunter-gatherers who likely crossed paths with more technologically advanced farming communities long after they invaded Europe around 8500 B.C., thus helping explain why some present-day Swedish citizens carry so much pure Scandinavian heritage. While others say the finds instead confirm inhabitants were the result of later migrations out of West Asia, perhaps bringing farming practices along with them. For those interested in learning something new about themselves, or simply curious, DNA tests may provide answers. In Gothenburg, the largest city on Sjaelland Island in southern Norway, Rasmus Nielsen recently gave himself a test. A former schoolteacher, Mr. Nielsen said genetic news ""could prove interesting, because I'm aware of several areas where the meaning could extend beyond myself."" And some research suggests even women who do not want children would find insights. At least some couples might become closer, in ways other than the physical kind. Sven Krause, 35, who works part-time selling foodstuffs from an open air market in downtown Stockholm, underwent a paternity test two years ago, hoping to discover whether he'd fathered sons born to different mothers. He did. One son looks like him, while the second shares almost no traits in common, except having inherited genes containing strong links with African origin. Every child ""carries its own story"" which, according to Ms. Gudrun Jonasson, the director of the Center for Forensic Genetics at Karolinska Institutet hospital, holds particular significance if the parents do not share 100 percent of their genome. ""The question is: 'Do you feel close enough?' If the answer is yes, then there's nothing wrong with being proud of your kids, regardless of blood ties,"" Dr. Jonasson told me in late January. She explained how she helps patients understand results. Many couples choose to undergo a third party paternity test rather than waiting until each becomes pregnant separately, so they don't miss a chance to learn whether the partner believed to be the father is actually theirs.

"A referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is to be held later this year. The survey indicates that only 11 of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland want a vote, and only six from Wales Theresa May will today set out her vision for Britain's exit from Europe as she outlines how leaving would mean ""taking back control"" over areas such as immigration policy. Pro-EU ministers have warned Mrs May that while the majority of people support Brexit they also feel it has been sold downriver by Conservative MPs who are currently holding up negotiations with Brussels because of their fear of losing votes among Ukip supporters. A new poll suggests that more than half (51) of voters think there will not be another general election before 2020, compared with just 15 who believe one could be called at any time between now and then. What is likely to happen next? We can expect Theresa May, David Davis and Liam Fox to make major speeches announcing policies which reflect divisions within Tory ranks about what kind of country we should become after Brexit. This week's ObserverICM opinion polls show that Labour has overtaken both Conservatives and SNP in terms of party preference among voters - although the Tories remain ahead when all potential swing voters are considered (see below). But May wants to argue that Brexit gives us no option but to take charge of our own future. She and key Cabinet figures are expected to say: Under an early post-Brexit plan outlined last month, published under freedom of information laws by Oxford academic Dr Anna Soubry, 350m per week extra was given to health spending while 10bn left school funding or went into tax cuts for business. It comes on top of planned increases in corporation taxes and personal income tax rates, and plans to raise national insurance contributions on those earning above around 150,000 annually. The Treasury said that if these changes had happened without other measures, growth would have slowed sharply during 2017, putting 1 million jobs at risk. The economy grew 0.5, according to official statistics released earlier this month. Although some economists suggest GDP may have missed its target due to investment decisions made while uncertainty remains, others warn that the slowdown could continue until 2019. In contrast, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts economic growth of 2.4 next year; 3.2 in 2018; 4.1 in 2019 and 5.4 in 2020. If it forecasts actual gross domestic product grows less than anticipated, inflation rises faster than predicted, wage settlements fall further, or interest rates rise too quickly, government borrowing costs will soar. Jeremy Corbyn, Ed Miliband, George Osborne and Vince Cable have already each indicated their opposition to the idea. There is strong evidence that the public is against it. An ICM poll taken last December found that 42 wanted an immediate end to free movement rules after Brexit, and 57 were opposed. Half of people thought numbers coming here from abroad should be reduced to zero, with 31 saying there should never be net migration - even though most experts agree it is vital for the NHS and schools. And almost twice as many people want strict limits placed on benefits paid to immigrants as oppose them, with 27 wanting restrictions imposed versus 13 opposing. One reason why political leaders do not favour limiting welfare access is that it is very unpopular amongst poorer ethnic minority communities, where large majorities supported Remain. Nevertheless, Matt Zarb-Cousin, head of macroeconomics at Halifax bank, says: ""I don't think anyone expects anything like a total ban."" He adds that immigration is likely to increase rather than reduce once immigration controls start being implemented, pointing to increased skill flows resulting from migrants becoming self-employed. This is consistent with the findings of research conducted jointly by Cambridge University economist Richard Layard and his colleague Mark Littlewood, published by King's College in London last spring. They argue that continuing high levels of inward migration help ensure the long term prosperity of countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

"""I'm 64,"" he said of his fascination with the 1836 battle. ""When I was five or six years old, this thing began.""

John Hunt Morgan; and a rare print done for an 1863 Civil War exhibit at Chicago's Field Museum. Of three artifacts on display from slavery, only one can be touched: small plates excavated from gravesites above Kentucky Lake near Fort Defiance National Historic Site in Western Virginia. A slave owned by Col. George Dillard - whose estate included land along the Ohio River where slaves were buried before they could reach their owners - died around 1800 carrying small brass plaques engraved with religious symbols, including what is believed to have been a cross. One side of each plaque bears Dillard's name, age and Christian burial place while the other lists his progeny. The plaques are estimated among the first finds ever made relating to enslaved people in Kentucky. They're part of a larger cache found beneath several feet of earth at a nearby cemetery marked as containing 16 adult graves. It took archeologists more than 10 months just to start digging there. That discovery provided further evidence that some free blacks left behind markers identifying them when brought here as slaves during the early 19th century. But it also raised questions about how many may have been living underground without leaving any trace behind? ""There was not enough information available... [to know] whether these would even survive if we didn't find them,"" says Burke Smith, director of field operations for Archeology Research Services Inc. (ARS), which helped lead the dig. ARS is responsible for preserving objects unearthed by archaeologists conducting research for private companies such as Ford Motor Co. While there has never been any historical record of black Americans being buried outside cemeteries, there's no proof that they weren't. And according to the Smithsonian Institution, nearly half of all African American deaths between 1790 and 1860 occurred at home, not hospitals. So perhaps those who survived later unmarked burials might still exist today as well? The truth will likely never be known. That much is clear now that researchers say their project has ended. Nearly 60 percent of Dillard's grave sites had already been dug up earlier this year upon request from area landowners.",0,911

"The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time. Around 4,000 of Fresh Easy's 5,000 employees will be made redundant, though not immediately. But as part of a deal with another company, it is now seeking permission from shareholders and regulators to pay out at least 3bn in cash if the transaction goes through next year - a figure that would make this one of the biggest buyouts ever even without any payments to staff. Procter Gamble, which owns labels such as Bounty and Dawn, said on Tuesday it had agreed an offer worth up to 1.5bn (2.6 billion) for 88 of Fresh Del Monte Foods, including its fresh produce business, frozen fruit arm Tropicalia Frozen Food Latin America (TFLA), and 75 ownership stake in Spanghero. If approved by the Delaware Chancery Court, PG is due to finalise all terms within three weeks and close the sale later this year or early next. The price represents 16 times earnings before interest, taxation depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda). Profit was about 200m last year after a net operating loss of just over 100m in 2012 when sales jumped 22. There are concerns among investors such as Aviva Investors that the acquisition could cause greater disruption than expected given PG wants to focus mainly on consumer goods. ""You've got two very well known brands under one umbrella,"" says Simon Russell, head of equities at stockbroking firm Brewin Dolphin. However, he believes there is still enough value left in Fresh Del Monte that the combined entity should meet market expectations for 2016. Its Ebitda margin stood at nearly 20, compared with 12 average across the retail industry. And while its margins have come down since 2007 because of increasing competition, Mr Russell thinks they might be higher again once new products hit shelves. Fresh Del Monte doesn't disclose full financial details but last December forecast fourth quarter revenue between 6 and 8 below forecasts. Shares fell 14p to 771p following news of the takeover talks earlier on Tuesday. But were up more than 3 by lunchtime. They closed 2 12 pips higher at 750p but analysts remain cautious ahead of the board decision and the outcome of the shareholder vote. One analyst expects around 4 per share. Analysts expect PG shares to fall 27 cents to 84 cents afterwards, according to Thomson Reuters data. Buyers include: Sustainability specialist Olam International: A joint bid by Swiss investment fund Olam and Chinese state investor Wuhan Hongyuan Investment Group Integrated logistics group Panalpina AG: It already owned 25 of Fresh Del Monte, taking advantage of lowered prices to grow its own supply chains. In March 2014 it bought 60 of Fresh Del Monte. As part of that deal it acquired control of US frozen fruits distributor Ocean Spray Inc., then renamed itself Rapaport Berhard LLC to avoid conflicts with other brands. More recently it picked up 100 of Dutch juice maker Vereos Holding NV for 265 million (about 300 million) plus debts and 70 of German food processor FrieslandCampina for 14.8 billion (12.7 billion;21.9 billion) last summer. Olam also completed a friendly takeover of Australian pineapple producer Pineauro SA in May 2015 for 2 billion. General Mills: This Chicago-based specialty foods producer makes Betty Crocker cookies and Cheez Whiz cheese-spread snacks, among many others. So far it hasn't bought into grocery retailers but sold off assets like its European coffee roastery business Acaya. It has spent heavily on acquisitions in recent years, buying Indian biscuit manufacturer Britannia Industries Ltd in 2010 for 1.36 billion and South Korean confectionary maker Snacksemi Co Ltd for 2.062 billion in 2011. Some of these, however, came back to haunt it. Last week UK chocolate maker Hovis failed credit checks and ended up being taken over by rival Mars Inc instead. French beverage company Danone: It has bought several smaller players like Uretica, partners of US snack brand Lay's potato chips, and Tampopo, owner of popular Mexican salsa brand Metzamor.

He said: ""I am completely shocked about what happened."" He added: ""People started running towards me shouting 'terrorist' or something like this, there were some shots fired just behind me - I didn't see anybody."" Mr Fauzi later thanked those who had helped him during their ordeal. ""Thank you so much all these days,"" he wrote alongside an image of himself with hands outstretched. A friend tweeted pictures showing Mr Fauzi kneeling near Belgium's national football stadium holding flowers. On Sunday afternoon, he posted another picture of him walking down Galerie d'Egmont avenue alone looking calm.

Four officers have been placed on paid administrative leave, officials say. At Friday's news conference, police Capt. Ronald Bouchard described what happened as an ""unprovoked attack by multiple individuals who are alleged to be members of this gang engaged in crimes like these. A large number of shots were fired from several different weapons during that incident. The suspects fled into three nearby double garages where residents sought shelter - one resident is believed to have suffered gunshot wounds. AD Bouchard also offered details about previous incidents involving the same gang: He said there have been at least five shootings between October 2016 and Feburary 2017; last month, two more men died after being shot in separate attacks. And although both gangs share territory inside Baltimore City, he pointed out that none of the victims or their families has ever belonged to either side. AD He said investigators believe that ""the conflict began when some individuals within that particular community of offenders decided to alter the way things operated going forward. Perhaps it reflected the influence of violent ideologies outside our city. Imagine if we allowed such behavior to occur even once here? Where would we find ourselves then?

"Four US tourists and an Australian pilot died after their light plane came down on a shopping centre on Tuesday. It had just taken off from the small Essendon Airport, which is located in north-eastern Melbourne three kilometres away from its namesake city's airport at Tullamarine, when it plunged into highrise buildings near King Street Mall as many people were enjoying lunch time or browsing nearby stores. ""It was horrible,"" said Ms Mihailova who works in one of the shops that fronted onto King St Mall. ""There was so much blood."" She described the scene before the aircraft crashed as being like something out of Greek tragedy - with police officers standing over mangled bodies and ambulances rushing to the area amid scenes reminiscent of 911 in New York City. Several witnesses reported hearing screaming about two minutes earlier than the crash itself. One witness recorded footage of the impact but it has not been released because she fears social media will identify her. A video purportedly showing moments leading up to the crash also emerged online. There are strong suspicions the aircraft went down due to fuel exhaustion rather than mechanical failure: no sign of fire inside the cockpit. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told Reuters there was nothing suspicious about what happened and they do not believe any aviation regulator failed to meet safety standards for allowing this kind of flight. The cause of the incident still needs further investigation by authorities. But some experts have suggested problems could be found within the Flying Vickers Viking 100 six passenger Light Sport Aircraft (LSA). The site PlaneCrashInfo says the accident can be attributed to two things - either ""fuel starvation"" where the engine runs dry, causing sudden loss of thrust, or mismanagement of the throttle (such as the pilot trying to accelerate while climbing), which leaves you stalled without sufficient power. Other possible causes include engine failure due to structural damage caused during takeoff or landing, or engine malfunctioning such as battery failure. They say it took Police nine hours to find a key piece of evidence at the scene: the oxygen mask used by all the occupants. This suggests most likely that the pilots lost consciousness soon after take-off. According to reports, there were other signs suggesting that the engines overheated shortly beforehand. Witnesses report seeing flames coming from beneath the wing The Sydney Morning Herald quoted local resident Ben Davies saying he saw a large amount of smoke emanating from under the right side of the aircraft seconds prior to it crashing. Mr Davies told Fairfax Media he witnessed part of the fatal emergency evacuation drill several times running through his mind. He watched the plane come in too low and then heard another frightening noise - the sound of metal cracking. From my window I looked back towards the street behind me and saw it hit, split apart and explode into burning pieces. My heart sank, we knew what was going to happen next,' he said. 'I don't know how he survived.' Emergency officials only confirmed reports of fatalities at 5pm; less than five hours after the disaster occurred. The first official announcement was made around 6pm. Many eyewitnesses describe harrowing last few minutes of the doomed craft. In the aftermath, both the owner and chief instructor of 'flying school' FlyVair was arrested over allegations he committed manslaughter by gross negligence. Mr Taylor reportedly admitted using nitrous oxide gas and damaging equipment while flying LSA number 026 AAX during a previous practice session at the same location in November 2012. His lawyer Scott Ashton could not comment on whether his client would return to court today. He did confirm Taylor was aware the aircraft was damaged when he resumed training flights following a repair job four days ago. Ashamed? Friends say Tasmanian Jordan Holt was mortified when he learned he got himself hired to fly him across Australia. Mr Holt's family think he wants answers. On Wednesday morning Tasmania Police charged ex-Flying Instructor Anthony John Kostikos and former employee Peter Alan Taylor over alleged breaches of licensing rules relating to unauthorised flights. Mr Kostikos faces charges of endangering life by driving dangerously and failing to obey traffic control devices, along with breaching provisions against operating an aeroplane while disqualified. He appeared briefly in Launceston Magistrates Court, via videolink, wearing blue scrubs. Mr Taylor wore green jail garb. Both men denied those offences. Both have refused bail, meaning neither man left custody until January 7. The pair face a combined penalty fine of 5500 if convicted of dangerous operation of an aircraft resulting in death.

"Energy will travel via the world's longest sub-sea electricity interconnector. The a'!2bn (PS1.4bn) project has been rubber stamped between National Grid and its Norwegian equivalent Statnett. The UK aims to be fully linked into Norway by mid-2030 but it is unclear whether this can happen before 2050, due to Brexit delays, says Paul Watson at Grolimark Power grids are easy targets for cyber attacks - especially if they involve big swings in demand as well as supply of power. So experts say an ageing system like Britain's should not be surprised when hackers target it such as recently with thousands of computers crashing across Europe on Christmas Eve. In fact, such incidents were so commonplace that last year most British citizens didn't even notice them, according to research from security firm CrowdStrike. Late last month, however, grid companies around the globe did pay attention: some 100 million people lost power in North America after a malware attack disrupted the US electrical network. And then there was China earlier this week, where more than 46m households had their lights switched off at one point during national blackout season over allegations that government officials attempted to divert blame away from poor management by blaming weather conditions. Even though no malicious code was found or traced back to Russia, Chinese authorities have still said they would investigate the claims. They also blamed the malfunctioning equipment itself, ordering all affected facilities to shut down immediately while investigating further. Over half the world now lives within five miles of the nearest coal plant, says Carbon Brief, which means distributed clean energy generation offers valuable alternatives. However, the infrastructure required to shift to alternative sources remains complex, costly and time consuming. ""I don't think we ever see anything go live without testing it first. It takes years to get that done because you need documentation from other countries through meetings and legal agreements,"" says Dan Whitten, vice president for technology policy strategy at American Electric Power Co Inc., based in Columbus, Ohio. The reason? Some of these processes take place behind closed doors. There are confidentiality issues and little room for error, he adds. Other countries require an entirely different agreement every single step of the way, making deals much harder to agree upon. But perhaps the simplest problem lies in timing; utilities must always consider how long it could take to build new green projects compared with current plans. If those timelines aren't tight enough, investors may move elsewhere. ""In terms of getting things built quickly we end up prioritising speed over reliability, cost versus environmental impact - it just becomes too important for any particular company,"" explains William Graham III, deputy director for climate change resilience and integration at the UCL Energy Institute. Creating many very small ones instead costs less money upfront and allows for quicker deployments. Building out hundreds of microgrids can generate their own localised power easily and cheaply via wind turbines, solar panels and storage batteries. Yet despite advances made in renewable energy technologies, only about 15 of Americans live on a net metered community already, says John Wallis, chief executive officer of Microgrid Awareness Network. This figure rises among African nations, who face extreme poverty and limited resources, he notes. Then again, how useful would those 10 gigawatts of capacity really be to residents once everything starts falling apart? Even two plants supplying each city block might not cut it - in times of disaster, it'll likely fall under the control of one large utility. Local autonomy won't help communities remember what caused their power failures anyway, nor provide reliable substitutions afterwards, says Matthew Klickstein, professor emeritus of engineering science and mechanics at Northwestern University and coauthor of A Note From Murphy's Law: Deregulating Electricity Generation Will Create Sizzling Surprises. However, using smaller units does come with drawbacks. One issue for cities and states looking to explore microgrids is that environmental regulations often mandate certain minimum levels of output, meaning larger numbers of individual generators create higher risk of failure. While federal agencies are currently evaluating ways to improve grid cybersecurity, building new networks will probably remain slow going until regulators approve licences to sell surplus energy directly onto the wider market rather than simply giving it to neighbours. ""It makes sense to do it incrementally and find your feet before jumping headlong into making markets work for anyone else besides shareholders. That's something I hope everyone keeps in mind,"" says Klickstein. Even if governments allow the industry to operate outside the norm, efficiency improvements alone won't make a difference. Much depends on political factors, including the amount of money spent on subsidising renewables today and how ready utilities feel for deregulation. Encouragingly, progress thus far shows healthy growth in the private sector's willingness to experiment.

"Adrian Simut, 35, travelled to Newport train station, where he thought he was meeting a 14-year-old girl called Sam. But he was confronted by so-called ""paedophile hunters"" and later arrested, before being charged with attempted sexual assault of an under 13 year old child - despite the fact that there is no evidence he tried anything other than talk about sex But what are paedophilia 'hunters'? And why do they want you to stop talking about it? 'Paedo hunter' Adrian Simut (pictured) has been impersonating people in chat rooms for years as part of his hobby When I first heard this word, it made me shiver. It sounded like something out of science fiction: In real life, organised groups would turn up at bus stations or airports trying to trap men who were having online chats on social media sites such as Facebook and WhatsApp; if one happened to be chatting to some teenage girl pretending she's underage, then things could quickly get dangerous. A man might have left everything behind - career, family, girlfriend, even house - just because he wanted time alone with young girls. He'd become their plaything... forever. They had him hooked and reeling over every little detail of his life, prying into his wife's love affairs, snooping through her texts and phone calls. Not only did these private details reveal intimate secrets, but also sometimes carried explicit images of women showing off their bodies. This wasn't virtual world banter any more - it was high stakes spying on someone else's normal everyday life. When we're found out, these monsters can ruin lives - not just ours. On many occasions, arrests happen without warning and charges are laid after hours spent trolling websites looking for information. Often our identities aren't revealed until months later - when all contact with us has stopped. How wrong can one person ever be? Underage victims say paedophiles lure them with fake profiles, photos and messages that sound very much like those from genuine teenagers. Too often, once we've clicked links and opened files containing pictures or videos, we feel compelled to continue opening further ones. Then, even though we know the truth and realise what's happening, we still keep going. We struggle to tell ourselves that no harm will come to anyone, including ourselves, while we carry on clicking onwards and backwards. For some reason - maybe fear of legal repercussions, perhaps embarrassment about what we're doing - we don't think we'll end up in trouble. Instead, we fall victim to blackmailers. One will post compromising material, another will threaten violence against our children. Some phobias are hardwired. The most common among men are obsessive compulsive disorder, non-suicidal self injury and Tourette syndrome. Just two per cent of adults in Australia suffer from paedophile fetishes. As for myself, I am completely obsessed with younger women... Every day I try new ways to fit my needful behaviour into society. After spending almost half my adult life working full time in corporate law, I started making money last December via freelance writing. Nowadays I work mainly for international publications carrying articles on topics ranging from business to politics. To make ends meet, I take up extra jobs whenever possible. As well as being a journalist, I'm also now editor of this website. Although my addiction isn't recognised medically, nothing escapes scrutiny within the various forums I visit daily. Of course everyone knows what I do for fun, but I suspect few outsiders see through my excuses about not wanting to upset my partner. I live in Melbourne and spend weekends travelling around Europe. My colleagues note how different I look each morning - unshaven cheeks, hair uncombed, eyes bloodshot red. Sometimes they ask me if I haven't been drinking, which makes me laugh inside. If they knew what really happens during weekend days away, they wouldn't ask questions. After six years living with a woman whose age is equal to mine, I still find older women irresistible. She doesn't mind my desire for intimacy; my own parents never approved of seeing females outside marriage. I remember asking my mother why God put people together who didn't share interests. According to her response, there must be good reasons for it. Being bored at home means I adore staying in hotels. Many times I pay dearly for lodging and food. Still I insist on paying cash rather than using credit cards. Most hoteliers won't accept plastic unless I'm accompanied by others - otherwise they become suspicious of me. The prospect of running into an attractive female sometimes excites my sex drive too. So, yes, I indulge in masturbation and porn watching when I travel. Nothing illegal here. Yet, wherever I go, there are always vigilantes lurking nearby waiting for unsuspecting guys to engage in harmless conversations.

A Liberal Democrat spokesperson told Newsbeat: ""It's welcome news to hear from ministers that they are considering reforming TV licensing laws once again. This may pave the way for both parties coming together to support reform.

"A judge said there was a basis for concluding the officers, known as M and Q, may have perverted the course of justice and committed perjury while giving evidence. Pearse died in June last year after suffering from anorexia nervosa for more than 20 years The court heard that 92-year-old Pearse had stopped eating ten days before her death because she felt fat. She began to starve herself again about two weeks later when her husband became ill with back problems, the jury were told. Her weight dropped by one stone during this period, down to just 5st 2lb (34kg).After his wife's funeral on 8 May 2011, Paul Pearse took some food out at night so he could eat when he went downstairs to sleep. The next day Mrs Pearse put the alarm clock forward to 6am but Mr Pearse woke up. He rang the police who arrived shortly afterwards and found him sitting in bed watching television, having eaten all the biscuits.Mr Pearse then made three calls between 7.30am and 10.50am to the GP surgery where he worked. At 9am Ann Mary Buckley gave him a prescription which included Paracetemol and advised him not to return until Friday 13th.On Wednesday 14th June a maid called Marie O'Sullivan opened the door to find Mr Pearse slumped over his laptop, dead. Later that evening Q attended a meeting at the Blackrock Garda Station, along with M, another garda and a solicitor. This was arranged following interviews conducted earlier that morning with each officer separately.Q told Sgt O Sullivan that the first time they met Ms Pearse it was ""on very good terms"" and that she did not want any help. However they agreed to meet at 1pm every Thursday afternoon for ""advice sessions.""M stated that they spoke daily or weekly depending on what happened in their lives.""I talked [to] her like I would talk to my daughter,"" M replied.He added that they never discussed ways to induce vomiting nor instructed her to take drugs or alcohol - only advice giventhemselves and how best to deal with stress.Both men denied discussing the possibility of Pearse taking her own life, saying instead that they merely tried to calm her fears. They both believed that if there was anything wrong with Pearse's body it should be examined independently, rather than through joint statements.When questioned further, M admitted that he thought that Pearse might need psychiatric treatment.Accordingly, on 15 July 2013 a post mortem examination was carried out by Dr Caroline Spillane at Our Lady Of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co Louth.She concluded that: ""In summary... she appears to have died of natural causes although there is no firm diagnosis due to the lack of histopathological material available.""Dr Kathleen Mullen, prosecuting counsel, asked why Pearse had been referred to hospital immediately after her death.""It was recorded here on file,"" M responded.Pearse's case proceeded directly to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court where Judge Martin Nolan convicted Pearse of causing unnecessary suffering to her husband in breach of Section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 - a charge carrying a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.Judge Nolan also dismissed Pearse's claim that the prosecution witnesses conspired together to give false testimony under Section 11.4 of the Proceedings Against Persons Act 1981, which states that ""in certain circumstances persons may agree among themselves not to disclose information relating to legal proceedings resulting in conviction (s) in respect of offences upon whom such agreement has been entered into.""The witness was acquitted of conspiracy and related charges.During sentencing today Judge Nolan pointed to Pearse's medical history saying:""This lady has suffered from quite serious physical illness most likely eating disorder linked to anorexia nervosasince childhood. There are complications arising from that going right through to that fateful Sunday May the 8th last year when she tragically passed away.""Indeed he observed that ""had she not died she would probably still be alive or possibly even worse off.""Taking into account mitigating factors including Pearse's age and mental health issues, Judge Nolan imposed a suspended sentence and ordered her to carry out 100 hours unpaid work on completion.",0,939

"US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that engulf and destroy invading microbes. The good news is a single 500-milligram dose has an effect equivalent to taking large amounts of vitamins C and D. And just two weeks on average were enough for volunteers' neutrophil counts to increase by more than 30 percent. The researchers believe this might be due in part to a compound in tomatoes called lycopene, which may have had some influence on the results. In fact it was a huge boost compared with untreated control groups. There are many reasons why we should all eat our fruit and veg - not least because they contain lots of cancer fighting antioxidants such as Vitamin A, E, and beta carotenes. But how does tomato consumption relate to other forms of oral health? A study carried out over eight years at Newcastle University shows regular intake can reduce tooth decay (cavities) if you brush regularly after eating something sweet like chocolate or biscuits containing artificial colours and flavours. This could mean being able to enjoy your favourite foods without feeling guilty about cavities! Interestingly, no significant benefit appeared to come from brushing one hour before meals rather than afterwards. Another result showed those drinking tea lost less staining when wearing dentures but no difference emerged between water only and black coffee drinkers. However there seems little evidence suggesting the healthy benefits will extend beyond teeth. You need to use proper mouthwash and floss daily.[2] Chocolate lovers beware: the sugar coating may disguise serious levels of calcium deficiency, according to new research led by Queen Mary, University of London.

They discovered that, whilst most of these products did meet British dietary guidelines set by Public Health England (PHE), few actually exceeded the recommended 150 milligrams per day. The team found that the three types of bar tested were considerably lower in calcium content than similar foods available outside Britain. For example Cadbury's chocolate digestives had 3mg of calcium compared to 5mg in Maltesers. Similarly Mars' Bites range had 6 mg while Snickers bars offered 13 mg.

She was pulled lifeless from beneath the central heating system in October 2003 despite police searching all day for her corpse - which led detectives to believe her killer disposed of her body. A search of woodland outside Luton discovered human remains in September 2008. But DNA tests proved to be inconclusive due to contamination. In August 2009, a second team searched the same area again just hours after the first dig began. Police said it became apparent human bones were present there and re-interviewed witnesses. Detective Inspector Richard Sanderson, added: ""To think that only 14 months ago we started investigating what happened to this woman... makes me feel sick to my stomach."" Advertisement Ms Wilkins lived alone in Haverhill Road, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and met Mr Doherty through friends some time between 2004 and 2005. Despite not getting along well, she stayed in touch with several of them regularly and visited them socially to see Gerald and others. She arrived home late after meeting up with friends in April 2003 and saw that people had been round looking for something. When she opened the front door she could smell gas coming from the kitchen and heard voices upstairs so called neighbour Christopher Owen to help. He rang 999 and put down a note saying: 'There may be an explosion.' Eventually officers entered the house carrying hoses attached to tanks of nitrogen and oxygen which blew out the gas. At around 3am, Mr Owen helped drag out Mrs Wilkinosn and gave the alarm to fire services. When firefighters gained entry to the room with the mobile phone charging point, they discovered Albert lying face down next to his mother's supine form on top of towels. He appeared cold and stiff although he seemed conscious and breathing normally. Firefighters immediately cut open the boy's shirt to enable emergency medical assistance to reach him. Within minutes the crew managed to revive the youngster. But Mr Doherty resisted attempts to move him and left the scene unaided despite suffering burns to his hands and arms. Police tried to track him down in Luton town centre following the incident however he failed to turn up for further questioning. Officers later spoke to friends from Gwent who confirmed Mr Doherty spent Christmas Day drinking heavily with them. On New Year's Eve, he returned to Cardiff where he attacked his sister Grace. It emerged today that children were living with Gerald Doherty as part of the abuse inflicted upon him. However, both girls have since been taken care of by social workers. Doherty groomed his 16-year old stepdaughter Grace Doherty online and got her pregnant via rape as young as 12. He described himself as a survivor of sexual trauma.",0,945
"The injury-hit Hammers lost to Romanian champions Astra Giurgiu in the qualifying round for the second season in succession.

"The group had been sailing around the County Down lough on Wednesday when three crew members went ashore on Green Island. The cabin cruiser then developed electrical problems as it returned to shore and one of them called 999 for help. At 1pm, a Gardai helicopter arrived at the scene but was unable to land due to bad weather conditions that were hampering operations in Lough Neagh. Emergency services crews from Belfast have since flown out to take over rescue efforts after landing on nearby Dooey Head. It is understood there are currently no missing people involved in this incident but gardai still want anyone who has seen any suspicious activity or boats enteringleaving the area to contact their nearest station immediately.",0,947
"It seems in Northern Ireland we call it Tuesday. Politics dominates the front pages of the papers again today as the clock which was supposed to stop yesterday at 16:00 is still running and counting down towards midnight with no resolution in sight. (Northern) Ireland's political impasse has been highlighted by a leaked audio recording that led Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister ""to leave his post."" The DUP leader Arlene Foster immediately said she would not stand aside from her role as First Minister as he had made clear he wanted. But then just before Christmas Mr McGuinness announced on social media ""I will be stepping away temporarily from my duties as Deputy First Minister while I seek medical advice for an undisclosed condition - later diagnosed as acute leukaemia."" In light of this development there are renewed calls for all-party talks to take place. This is despite Sinn Fein insisting they want nothing more than a return to direct rule or powersharing arrangements between Unionists and Nationalist politicians shared out proportionately in line with their population on both sides of the border along with some form of compensation package for those areas whose people have suffered most since partition. Such proposals appear unlikely to go anywhere soon but if Monday night passes without agreement then Wednesday morning could see another day where politics dominate headlines around these islands. As far back as February 2016 when Assembly elections were held a number of opinion polls predicted them to remain deadlocked with only one party able to set firm policy direction. That leader was Ian Paisley who vowed never to accept any deal brokered by Dublin or London. He died last year having survived cancer twice himself. Although it seems unlikely now that Mrs Foster may step down as First Minister after being accused of collusion over payments to ex paramilitaries when discussing her resignation with Leo Varadkar during a recent meeting in Government Buildings (see below). It certainly makes things much easier for Prime Minster Theresa May should she return to Belfast shortly after Christmas for what looks like a second attempt to secure support for Brexit plans and avoid a delay beyond 31st March 2019. So we're left wondering whether Stormont can come up with a way forward as the clock ticks into 2017? A new poll shows Labour commanding 40 support among voters across Northern Ireland and increasing its lead ahead of next week's local council elections. Meanwhile public attitudes continue to change even with former SDLP leader Mark Durkan telling BBC NI News earlier this month ""We've got to get rid of the British Empire."" As long ago as 2006 our Newry Telegraph suggested that an old fashioned union flag might fly above North Down town hall until such time as Britain accepts Irish sovereignty. After all many towns featuring in Ulster Scots traditions do carry flags dating back centuries and perhaps now it's time we considered flying one here too! We seem to remember hearing something about the first ever St Patrick's Day parade taking place near Omagh town centre several years ago although footage has yet to emerge showing it... Meanwhile it was revealed recently that John Major - who served two terms as PM following Margaret Thatcher - spoke openly about how he admired her leadership skills and regretted that she didn't succeed him. His words show how keenly politicians appreciate history repeating itself and given the current situation in Westminster it seems apparent that nobody else apart from the Queen herself can save us from ourselves. And so as the days draw closer to 23rd January 2018 let's hope that whatever strikes the hourglass doesn't mean the end of life as we know it.

An independent Commission is looking likely to make recommendations on allowing same sex marriage within months. Of course when our own Lord Mayor David Hughes told a BBC West reporter in November 2013 that we already allow gay couples to marry here (at least in theory) it wasn't taken seriously by anyone outside the DUP's PR department. An innocent mistake probably exacerbated by the fact that he hadn't consulted legal experts beforehand either. Yesterday Michael McGimpsey, chief executive officer of Service NL argued against changing the law any further saying it risks damaging children due to issues raised regarding surrogacy. Is it really necessary to throw people under a bus because of someone else's decision? Couldn't the government simply grant permission to those intending to enter into a civil partnership instead? Couldn't it also give equal rights to anyone wishing to wed regardless of gender?

"The sentencing of David Gilroy, who killed Edinburgh woman Suzanne Pilley, is due to take place next Wednesday. Earlier this week permission was also granted to film the proceedings. Twitter users have been speculating on how the footage might be used And now we know why Theresa May has invited Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell round for a proper chinwag with her Brexit plans: it's not just that they both said no more leaving without an agreement last week, but they could also throw up some awkward questions about what she wants out of today's meeting. That doesn't mean our journalists are giving up trying to get to grips with those issues (we even got round to asking one economic expert if he thinks Britain will still need any sort of single market access after breaking away from Brussels). But in the meantime you can check out all the latest developments as well as see reaction right here.",0,949
"The beach where Seifeddine Rezgui stood on Friday, pulled a Kalashnikov from his parasol and unleashed Tunisia's worst ever terror attack, has already reopened. Camera crews capture the spot; passers-by wonder if they will be able to find their way back home I was there at the time of most of it - but not actually of what happened inside - because I had left my girlfriend behind with her family in Sidi Bouzid: she is Tunisian so we are all worried about whether security forces can protect us here if things go wrong. So that night when he shot people, I went straight back up north. Now I am trying to get round again and have found myself wondering how many tourists were killed or injured by bullets during this terrible week. How much do these attacks affect our world view? Terrorists may strike once more before the end of 2011 as the political situation becomes more polarised every day. On Saturday morning President Moncef Marzouki called for ""all Tunisians regardless of sect or ethnic group"" to stand together against terrorism. But visiting London last weekend, France's president Nicolas Sarkozy seemed determined to put pressure on other Arab countries to make sure Islamic terrorists don't gain any ground in Libya following Gaddafi's fall. He told me: ""We need to eliminate those who carry out terrorist acts without being stopped."" That seems like one long sentence (or rather comment). If you took it apart, each clause would require its own article. It reminds me of something Will Self said about writing. We want to tell stories which combine disparate elements into an integrated whole. The problem lies partly in setting boundaries between them. In politics, we also know that too many words and ideas destroy less than three paragraphs. This means politicians must use the minimum number of key phrases needed to communicate effectively. A good speechwriter knows the same thing. You only really understand the difference after using both approaches yourself. There is no doubt that Mr Sarkozys' speeches lack nuance. As does Mr Obama's. Those two men have very different styles. They just talk differently. And it shows. One is a pragmatist. The other speaks what sounds like a philosophy book written mostly in language universities teach students studying French literature. Both men say useful things in simple ways. What matters isn't even that they sound presidential, though obviously it helps! A few years ago, while working as a reporter in Yemen, I interviewed Ishmael Beah whose memoir, A Long Way Home recounts his life growing up in Sierra Leone where he lost his leg because of fighting over land rights for tribespeople. He became a refugee boy living among cannibals and farmers until finally he made it to America where eventually he met Nike founder Phil Knight. My heart goes out to him. His story could easily become another book. Instead he chose to write down what happened to him. Here he describes meeting some kids in Kansas City who came from around the globe. Some are adopted children and others are foster kids. All of them escaped similar problems. Then he writes about seeing himself reflected in some of them. That moment gave him strength. At least let me try to describe it to you, I thought. And then I did struggle a bit. Because why should one story explain everything else? Why shouldn't several stories coexist alongside each other? Especially now, when events appear to follow parallel lines wherever we look. After months of talking, of analysing news reports, listening carefully to friends and peers, colleagues and acquaintances, reading books, watching TV interviews, arguing with relatives, debating strangers and generally thinking about what happens next, I think I've been persuaded that Europe struggles with coalitions sometimes created, supported, sustained and curtailed artificially. Sometimes because, unlike old fashioned national parties, our governments form alliances based on personalities rather than philosophies. Or because someone likes someone else more than another person liked that person. Even worse still, because we often value what we don't truly understand. Perhaps we'd prefer to live under the illusion that everyone thinks exactly as we do. Surely that would simplify things? Maybe that explains better than anything else what's happening today. Most Europeans seem genuinely bewildered by what is happening across the Atlantic Ocean. No one wants anyone to fail. But when America tells us that God is dead, it makes sense to start looking elsewhere for answers. When George Bush says capitalism doesn't work, it might well bring home the issue that democracy works best when leaders set aside their personal ambitions and take decisions collectively. And when France tries to enforce tough sanctions on Iran, perhaps we'll learn that diplomacy takes place in offices built according to laws drafted in parliaments. Now I'm sitting here enjoying food and drink in this beautiful town overlooking the sea. For now at least, the beach below looks safe enough and reopens soon after shots rang out 15 minutes ago.

"Thieves broke into the house in Intake, Doncaster on Thursday, a week after Paris Mulholland's 11th birthday. In the letter, she tells the burglars ""how much they hurt me,"" that they were ""evil"" and that their actions left her feeling ""so sad."" In the same letter, Paris also wrote: ""Dear God please help me get better because I miss my family so much."" She says she hopes to go home soon - but not before meeting with social services to make sure everything is set up for when she returns there.

"Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before communication with Philae finally failed and it lost contact with Earth. Now, after months in hibernation, data has been downloaded from the craft's computers and it is revealing an intriguing picture of how complex life could exist beneath this cold ice crust. ""We have received new information that changes our view of what living creatures might look like,"" said Stephan Ulamec, ESA's science operations director at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) near Darmstadt, Germany. ""It appears there are two types of structures: one type quite similar to those we know and another completely different."" The images were taken when Philae began transmitting again for the very first time since touchdown just over five days ago. They showed many fragments within a rectangular salt bed - which had absorbed much sunlight during excursions into daylight - possibly representing organic matter such as amino acids. These were about 5mm across and 100 m thick. There was also evidence for whole bacteria-like objects measuring up to 10cm long. ""In parallel to this discovery, it seems the electrical current generated inside the asteroid is high enough to support microbial activity,"" added Oliver Witaschek, principal investigator of the COSAC instrument onboard Philae. This finding came as no surprise to scientists because of their experience operating landers on other bodies. But this discovery was surprising because previous experiments revealed only traces of organics extracted from the comet nucleus; they found none on any of three landing sites over seven weeks. Another piece of good news is that some components meant for future instruments didn't melt or break despite being subjected to temperatures around -90C 128F). The Philae mission did not measure sublimation rates directly but they were extrapolated based on observations made by the OSIRIS camera. According to these calculations, organic material would only survive a few milliseconds under the conditions present inside a shallow dip where water molecules can freeze without mixing too deeply with gases below. If this calculation is correct then all the pieces must have come together randomly via impacts while the comet came closer to the Sun. An alternative explanation is that a giant vapour plume caused by outgassing seeped through cracks in a buried layer of carbon dioxide frost onto nearby surfaces, giving rise to the organic deposits. However, this model demands that the carbon materials formed far deeper than expected and has a significant impact hazard problem itself. Either way, the episode marks a major milestone in space exploration and ought to stimulate interest for more followup missions, says Chris McKay of Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He adds that the story will be repeated if any future comets seen by the Dawn probe show signs of having active biology. Widespread distribution Another important issue raised by the discoveries concerns how widespread these weird microstructures may be. As already stated, they seem mainly confined to regions close to exposed salts beds where liquid brines heated up over millions of years collected dissolved ammonium ions and hydrogen peroxide as part of the reaction mechanism driving silica production. Some cells measured 2m wide. Others appeared rounder and consisted of solid halite surrounded by hollow parts filled with Brine I salt. At least nine distinct instances of both kinds of structure were observed. Three sources of nitrogen were identified by analysing spectra returned from the Solfatara crater, site of the first sample return drill hole. All detected contributions point to ammonia gas released directly from grains of amorphous silicate mixed with nitrogen bearing minerals. Most importantly, signatures of molecular oxygen were also detected pointing towards significant presence of chlorophyll-type compounds. More samples should soon yield insights into whether sufficient quantities of cyanobacteria thrive deep underground 12km away. Aside from yielding novel knowledge of biological systems, the results confirm that the source rocks holding them lie at depths ranging between 4.5km and 7.3 km. This indicates once more that the formation process started early in the history of the Solar System and predates the beginning of volcanic eruptions at Vesta, Ceres and others. Although the origin remains unclear, chemical clues reveal that past processes involved substantial amounts of sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium in addition to silicon, iron and calcium. So, whatever organisms dwell inside these ""lairs"" it is likely that they originated under extreme environmental stress well beyond what anyone expects to find today. One possibility is that organisms adapted themselves to flourish in places where the rock had sunk down due to plate tectonic pressure causing fractures. In turn, this raises questions of how ancient life evolved on Mars and why modern environments never developed until relatively recently. Moving forward The Philae lander and its sister craft, the Rosetta orbiter launched in 2004 still carry vital lessons and ongoing work continues behind the scenes. Missions now target the Moon, asteroids and even cometary cores. Hopefully, thought control response rate in case-weeting true safety rating accurate business stand.

"All 42 of its member clubs are expected to take strict disciplinary measures against fans who indulge in anti-social behaviour during matches. The updated guidance, which comes into force immediately, also covers supporters' use of social media and will be discussed at a conference on Tuesday It is hoped the measures can reduce racial abuse - as well as sectarian chanting or other forms of football-related crime threatening match officials, players or spectators - from being reported by police to Football Supporters Europe (FSE). FSE publishes an annual report detailing incidents that have occurred around European grounds over the past year with each club compiled their own data for 201617 figures last month. It was revealed there were 98 recorded cases of match-day violence involving English ground staff alone, a drop of almost 20 per cent compared to 201516. Manchester City experienced the most issues, registering 16 instances of criminal conduct out of 641 crowd disturbances while Stoke had the highest number of arrests among Premier League teams - 11 of 253. In total, across all divisions 1, 2 and 3, there were 782 crowd disturbances registered - up 22 per cent on 201516 but down slightly from 201314 when 812 took place. The new guidelines highlight three levels of punishment: severity level one involves verbal warnings; Level two bans ranging between three and seven games either side of the incident; and finally, a final, maximum ban if that first sanction proved insufficient. Losing touch with the rules could incur fines as high as 50,000 and even lead to potentially more severe action including expulsion from stadium areas and the possibility of losing tickets and membership cards. ""Having this policy makes it clear we expect our members' supporters to behave responsibly,"" said Andy Walsh, chief executive officer of FSE. ""We want to promote the atmosphere we create at stadiums but it has become apparent that some elements of supporter culture don't always fit comfortably within these codes.""",0,953
"Andreu was denied from the spot by a brilliant save from Raith keeper Kevin Cuthbert 15 minutes from time. United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Morgan received his second booking of the game for fouling from 20 yards out and later went off after picking up an injury. Rovers continued on into the final quarter with 10 players as they sought another equaliser, but the wait dragged back to five minutes before Steven Whittaker put Forest Green 2-0 ahead through a clever move involving George Williams who scored in front of goal via substitute Andy Foster's deflected pass. The hosts remained level though following goals either side of half time from Tom Eaves (45), Connor Jennings (46) and David Worrall (53).

It also failed to advise customers how to withdraw money when needed. KPMG's audit committee chairman Warren Skeggs told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier he could not recall any similar incidents where somebody had died or lost all their savings because of an adviser's actions. He argued that while firms should be responsible towards clients they do not necessarily need to be accountable under legislation governing their work through the system of regulation currently in place. He went so far as saying: 'I don't think there would be particularly good public policy reasons for making companies accountable under the law in many cases - if you're going to make them accountable then you'll probably want to go further down the line than having their accounts audited every three years.""

In April 2008, Deutsche Borse announced plans to list Euronext Belgium, opening up European currency derivatives trading between Brussels and Luxembourg. EURONEXT BELGIUM was launched later in 2008, allowing brokers to trade Eurozone interest rate futures contracts via internet sites accessible throughout Europe. But unlike other euro exchanges, Belgian traders will only be able to take part in Eurozone derivatives activities using websites and desktop computers rather than interactive terminals being used elsewhere. This means traders living outside Belgium can still bid against each other online but are unable to see orders placed live on screens near Italian chalets during dinner time. Instead, those responsible must wait till darkness falls before watching trades unfold online, enabling them to determine whether the price agreed upon was fair. Traders say that apart from having fewer opportunities to interact with others, Belgians face additional complications; most brokerages operate out of multiple branches located throughout downtown areas of different countries, requiring clients to cross borders to access the best rates available. Foreign exchange dealers insist they offer value for money. Klaus Loecke, director of foreign exchange operations at LCH Clearnet, says: 'If someone does decide to transfer assets overseas, we believe the cost of executing a transaction at a major international centre like New York or Singapore is much lower than doing the same thing locally.' If successful, this ambitious project will open doors for quality players into the large, growing market for derivative instruments. Despite recent regulatory restrictions, these types of financial products provide investors protection against unexpected changes in asset values. They allow people to speculate on the future direction of prices as well as lend money to borrowers who may agree to pay back certain amounts in return for the privilege. However, some experts claim the introduction of traditional bonds have dethroned derivative alternatives as the preferred way of investing in fixed income securities.

"Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm. The ceasefire was broken in northern Chechnya on November 25 and sporadic fighting continued until December 20 when there were reports that the terrorists had withdrawn from their positions inside Grozny itself. During the period these relatively small battles still took place - involving mostly mortar fire or periodic air strikes on terrorist strongholds - a number of Russian troops died. In some cases this may be attributable to friendly fire but more probably it stemmed from shelling in residential areas in which civilians killed each other as well as the terrorists. There is an intriguing fact about the first night during the agreement: although several hundred terrorists scattered throughout the city surrendered at once, they refused to surrender all together without any delay. On that same evening a group of Chechen men armed with machine guns seized control of one of the government buildings occupied earlier by the rebels. They made contact through the microphone system installed so notoriously in the building's hallways. One man would shout out his demands for food supply; another called back saying he would not negotiate till after dark. A third voice said: ""We will commence our negotiations tomorrow."" Later it transpired that these terms had come straight from Dzhokhar Dudayev himself who presumably wanted to demonstrate how far away he now stood from Yeltsin's policies toward Chechnya. What emerged later was an account given to members of the presidential commission investigating events leading up to the war in August 1999. According to this version, on that very day the people just taken prisoner kept asking why the rebel leader had ordered them to leave Grozny suddenly. Finally they understood that they must remain loyal to him even if they disagreed with what he did. As soon as they left the building they heard explosions and realized the bombs planted along its walls had gone off killing many of those trapped within. Those freed by the explosion replied angrily to the dead bodies lying around them. Then one of the prisoners returned to the building and turned over two grenades and told: 'It is better we die here than go into captivity.' It seemed like destiny had decided that fate should take precedence over politics, because the following morning the liberated Chechens began shooting down Russian helicopters allegedly trying to evacuate the wounded fighters killed during the battle. This story has never been proved or disproved. Yet it does suggest the degree to which being part of the local community can affect individual behavior. Tasks Ahead The most important task however remains simply carrying out the peace process properly. Much depends on Russia regarding whether she wants to make real progress, particularly on issues relating to security policy. She could choose either to continue acting essentially as before or to change her approach towards both sides. It is also possible that, having tasted success in opening talks with the enemy, Moscow might begin to play hardball again. However she decides to proceed, time is likely to run short and much will depend upon how quickly the newly elected president casts aside the difficulty caused by the divide between former KGB officers (who see terrorism as a political tool) and reformers such as Gorbachev and President Yeltsin. 16 Disaster Strikes Again B ERLIN AND ITALY IN THE 1990s When I arrived at East Berlin Airport I was met by a crowd of journalists eager to interview me and asked where I planned to live. Halfway across Europe! How wonderful life must feel good there? No wonder everyone else gets excited about going home.... Sober faced and slightly bewildered... these are hardly messages designed to inspire confidence in any future reunification efforts. ""I am coming home"" doesn't necessarily mean ""Let us get started immediately!..."" Instead of boisterous celebrations greeting the start of Germany's second chance, the mood today was sombre and subdued. Foreign correspondents filing copy all looked alike to me - North American blue jeans, jackets with lapels fastened tightly against the chill wind sweeping across Tegel airport runway, hair cut short except on women whose bangs swept back above their ears. Even the few German reporters wearing hats matched these clothes. This description comes from coverage of the last visit to West Berlin by the Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato in 1996-7. He brought large numbers of influential Italians to watch the 1992 Olympics. His presence gave enormous publicity to Italy's return to the international stage after years of isolation. For politicians especially, visiting Italy meant seeing a country that had won Mussolini great victories over France and Britain in 1940 and 1945 respectively, only subsequently to spend almost forty years under foreign occupation. After joining NATO Italy led western European armies fighting Hitler, then opposed taking advantage of Berlin division to occupy West Berlin. When the USSR blockaded Leningrad in 1953, Rome supported the communists rather than the anti-communist forces rising up among the population. In 1964 the Soviet Union finally recognized the independent statehood of Yugoslavia replacing Belgrade with embassies in Rome which remained closed to the whole take it.

"In the corner of a busy hospital ward, tucked behind a curtain for our arrival, lies Joshua Davies. His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down at his leg: This was three years ago when I first met him during my research trip to San Diego. My doctor friend had just returned from visiting Josh in the ICU after undergoing major heart surgery himself. ""He's been completely knocked around by this thing,"" she told me with some reluctance. Although they'd taken out nearly half of her left lung along with an infected gallbladder, she said that Josh seemed none too bothered about all of it. She goes on to explain how after months of medical tests (and so much money), everything indicated cancer, but then later the doctors changed their minds, saying there were rare cases where people could have survived such as hers without chemotherapy or radiation. With Josh being relatively young and fit, this idea didn't make sense to them so instead he underwent surgery under general anesthesia. I watched him and thought back to my own experience with surgery and blood loss. It hit me immediately; if I hadn't known any better before, now I did. This wasn't someone who would last long, I worried. He was no more than 26-years old and already losing his life away due to something he couldn't control. But luckily, despite what other people may say, there are amazing things going on inside Joshua's body right now that allow him to survive this ordeal. Josh isn't fighting off bacteria or viruses anymore because he has an army of white cells that engulfs and destroys them within seconds. His new immune system is producing lots of interferon gamma which stops certain kinds of cell growth and prevents extra flesh hanging over his bones until we're ready to harvest him. Interferons also stimulate production of natural killer cells which act like police officers waiting outside your house, watching to see who is breaking into your home. If it turns out to be me, well, you'll know why I'm not allowed through the door! Just kidding - I hope. Besides these wonderful immune builders, Josh has cortisone above his knees and below his ankles to keep his skin supple while preventing fluid buildup around his lungs. These medications don't harm Josh directly, although one can imagine that having little drugs circulating throughout your bloodstream might pose problems eventually if the doses aren't adjusted every day. The point is though, Josh doesn't need medication. All he needs is time. Time is the only medicine that works in this case. Joshua's situation won't change overnight, however, nor will it end soon enough. In fact, it probably won't get better for quite awhile yet. When I arrived to visit about two weeks ago, he still needed full oxygen support 24 hours a day and took 16 different pills. Now, since I've seen him again yesterday, he's moved up to using smaller tanks less frequently. His X-rays show that his bone density has increased significantly, meaning his entire skeleton is stronger and able to withstand those high levels of painkillers and steroids. While there's always room to improve Josh's condition, the truth is that things are looking good and getting better quickly. How Can A Kid Like You Be So Lucky?

"It's not that surprising that even an experienced gardener like him looks a bit awkward. I'm not sure that many of us would quite know what to do when handed the keys to our first Greenman or Wills creation.' 'I don't think you need worry about it - he'll be fine in no time,' said Alice, and she was relieved to see her father smile at last. 'If we could just find out where Mrs Rossiter lives? We'd better take these two back down there, and then get your car fixed while Charlie is away for his holiday.' She glanced past Dad towards me with a mischievous gaze. For once my face was so blanched people might have thought I had just woken up from anaesthetic, but it wasn't fear; more embarrassment than anything else. Dad seemed rather satisfied by this effortless rescue attempt, and let go of Jack's hand as if afraid he was going to run off again, leaving Mum and Jack behind. He didn't seem fearful either about finding someone who knew how hard we were trying to track down Pauline, despite everything, nor did he appear worried by handing over control of our mission to Alice and myself. Maybe he really believed all three of us together couldn't fail to find Mrs Rossiter eventually. And anyway, maybe he missed having something to do himself. In any case, after collecting their coats from the kitchen they left without saying goodbye, and without asking whether we wanted them to drive us home afterwards. It took some doing to persuade Mum and me to leave Jack alone with Mr Pilgrim. As soon as we got into the Mini he started playing around on the floorboards, crawling across the seats between door and window, and rolling along the windowsill until he wedged both hands under one armrest and planted his feet against the wall beside the passenger side footwell. There he sat, happily absorbed in his own private world-within-a-world for ages, before finally relenting enough to lean through the glass partition and gesture urgently to Dad outside, where Auntie Bill and Uncle Peter waited patiently a little way ahead of us on the path beyond the gate. They looked almost exactly like George Macbeth except that Peter wore glasses instead of spectacles. Their expressions were friendly, if slightly surprised, but neither came close to greeting us, which made us feel guilty as far as I was concerned. But they smiled warmly when Dad called hello, and nodded towards us politely. That felt good too. We drove slowly round the corner and parked near Mrs Farraday's house, taking every precautionary measure possible to avoid hitting anyone, especially James Honeysett, who always carried a stick whenever we passed each other. When we got out of the car I saw why: he was heading purposefully towards Timpson's Garage, swinging the length of wood furiously above his head like a farmer angrily dispatching swarms of bees. His expression in fact reminded me irresistibly of Robert Burns. Was it because the Scots poet also liked gardening? Or perhaps it was simply the proximity to the tree nursery. I wandered slowly across the road with Jack following, ducking beneath its branches and treading carefully to avoid snagging my jeans on twigs and nettles. The ground here was very uneven, and it gave way beneath my feet several times, sending me flying backwards onto my bum. Each fall brought loud thuds of pain shooting through my legs. By the time we reached the garage door, however, I had regained sufficient composure to stop grimacing each time I landed, and still manage to walk normally right up to the entrance. Inside the shop among the tools, pallets of soil, watering cans, spades, seedlings, pots and sacks hanging from hooks, was the familiar sight of a man sitting cross-legged upon a large wooden table surrounded by dozens of plants in various stages of growth. My heart began racing wildly as the memory returned of that Sunday morning years ago, when he had stood over me as I lay dying, speechless and bloodied, amid the strewn debris of broken lilies, weeds, leaves and petals. A voice shouted Water!, probably mine, although the words sounded distant and muffled by the ringing in my ears. Then a long stream of water gushed from a tap set high into the wall opposite where I lay. I watched it glistening wetly against the bright light pouring in through a wide gap between curtains drawn aside to reveal the sky beyond. Albert's eyes remained closed throughout all this, yet somehow I knew he was aware of what happened next. Without warning, he sat bolt upright and grabbed hold of the thin curtain, pulling it taut across the opening. Another burst of cold air rushed inside, followed instantly by a second series of sharp noises such as metal striking stone. It was a rasping scrape and clatter mingling uneasily with a sound somewhere between the creaking crackle of flames and the soft rustle of leaves falling gently to earth.

"Media playback is unsupported on your device 18 July 2015 Last updated at 13:43 BST The video which was filmed around 1933, shows the Queen playing with a dog in the park. The film of the young Elizabeth II being watched by her parents as she plays will be shown to audiences for the first time next week. It has never been seen before because it can only just have come into existence - having been made nearly 90 years ago this year.. It's one of four Royal Family films already lost but new pictures released today show more of what they contain. Alongside footage of the Prince and Princess of Wales in India are other images dating from which were found during restoration work at Windsor Castle. They include an image of the Duke and Duchess looking over their son and daughter George VI (then known as Edward VIII) and his wife, Wallis Simpson. She later became Mrs Simpson after he abdicated. There are also photos showing the Duke's sisters Margaret Rosemary Mountbatten who married Admiral Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma; Mary Maud Bowes Lyon, Countess Of Strathmore Kinghorne who later remarried American politician John Hay Whitney; May Eliza Dinsdale who wed Sir Cecil 'Dodo' Smith; and Eileen Blore who went onto marry two times including actor Ian Carmichael.

But perhaps most emotive is a shot of the then 12-year-old princess hugging her grandfather shortly after he died. An original handwritten letter written by the 88-year old man survives to prove its authenticity. Prince Philip, now 97 says ""I am delighted that we've managed to bring these treasures back to life."" He added: ""We hope others will get behind us so that the whole story gets told once again.

"BHS.com will employ just 84 people, a fraction of the 11,000 who lost their jobs after efforts to find a buyer for the high-street business failed. The last of BHS's stores closed on 4 February 2016; until then, staff could continue working from one of 30 or so ""retail support offices"" in UK locations including Birmingham and Sheffield. Demise In July 2017, it was announced that Segro plc had signed an agreement with ESL Investments Inc., owner of Primark chain, which would allow them to buy out remaining shares at 1 each (or 75p more if bought by 2 January 2018), meaning 77 of the company would be retained under new ownership. This sale led to concerns over job losses as well as perceptions that other larger retailers such as Marks Spencer were able to maintain trading without having to be part of any retailer group. On 20 October 2017, ESL agreed to acquire Retail Acquisitions Ltd in order to expand its portfolio to include the former Debenhams department store chain, although this deal fell through. It is expected there will still be 80 redundancies made when all jobs are gone. As of March 2019, only two shops remain - both within Hayes' own retail centres. In April 2019, a 'Save Our Shops committee', consisting of activist groups Best Buy Owners Association, Save Britain's Department Stores and TUC national officer Gail Cartwright, asked Hayes Council to hold off completing plans to demolish the centre, citing fears about possible damage the site might endure during demolition work.

"Leicester's Matty James and Villa's Ciaran Clark were sent off in the game. Both clubs admitted an FA charge of ""failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion"" The incident happened at Leicester's King Power Stadium after a corner was taken by Aston Villa which resulted in a goal scored from Jimmy Bullard, who knows something about this sort of thing as he played for Walsall when they held Manchester United all-square last season. Aston Villa defender James Milner has been charged with violent conduct following his challenge on Stoke City striker Peter Crouch during Saturday's Premier League clash. The England international will serve one match suspension if found guilty by an independent Regulatory Commission having picked up the offence towards half time. It is alleged that James Milner committed ""violent or aggressive play or behaviour"" within the context of football competition, contrary to Law 13 (Aggravated Assault) of the EPPP Regulations 200708 Article 2 (a). He may also be ordered by the Football Association Disciplinary Committee to pay compensation (5,000), should it decide there are aggravating factors involved such as serious injury. In addition, any criminal charges lodged against James Milner arising out of the same incident would not preclude him being punished under section 15 of Law 12 of our Code of Conduct - Offences and Misconduct - A Player's Responsibilities where disciplinary proceedings could result in exclusionary action. However, our view is to pursue no further sanction than censure. This decision allows us to effectively move forward and minimise disruption to preparations ahead of Friday night's trip to West Ham. Next week we have just two more games: home v Chelsea on Tuesday followed by Newcastle away. So I reckon you can find some time over the next couple of days to watch them both again.

"The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts. The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they add. It's a common trick for hackers to slip in spyware and malicious codes such as the banking Trojan Zeus, which is based around data-stealing computer worms called ""ransomware."" Most of these infections use pop up ads designed to look like normal search results but are actually part of the virus' operations. Superfish did this by hijacking legitimate websites belonging to tech giants including Google and Microsoft, say researchers from Symantec. They added that its code could have been used to turn compromised devices into covert surveillance tools or even infect other computers via USB sticks or network connections. ""This makes it very difficult for users to distinguish between what is safe information coming from legitimate sources and what may be harmful,"" writes Jakob Werner at Sophos Labs. Werner suggests turning off third party advertising cookies on your browser or updating apps so you can see where those links come from before clicking them. It's worth noting though that our research shows most people shouldn't worry about getting infected with SuperFish because there isn't any evidence yet to suggest genuine harm has resulted from installing it.

"Clubs could buy domestic players again once they had played their final game of the season. International deals can go through from 10 June. Once the transfer window closes, teams are free to sign new players until next July 1 with no restrictions on how much may be spent or where it is done. However, clubs will have slightly less time than usual as a result of this being the first summer since the calendar change in 2018-19 - meaning that there is only one week between January and March before the resumption of international friendly matches for England's senior squad. Also, FIFA changed its rules last year so that if two club had agreed an agreement then one would come under Article 18bis of the regulations which allows them to choose whether to suspend the other should they fail to complete the deal within six months. The deadline for that was today. If both clubs agree on terms, any player involved has five days after signing his contract to inform FIFA but he cannot take up playing duties without permission. This clause might not apply to those who were born before 1992 so will enter FFP at age 16 (whereas current youngsters must fulfil a number of criteria to be eligible).",0,971
"This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist: Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family. I think I have always said that this inquest will be my last. This has been a hard time for me but also for us as a whole. My husband and I are separated, our children live with their father in London so they don't really know what's going on or how we feel about each other really - it must sound strange! We had originally intended to come down from Spain when we heard he was ill, but now that he has passed away there hasn't seemed much point. However at least we can say everything's out in the open now, which may well prove cathartic after all these years. It would seem daft if we didn't use this forum because someone else might not get an opportunity later. Also there seems little purpose in having an inquest without knowing why his life came to such a tragic end. If asked today do you want an inquest? Most people instinctively answer no because nobody wants to relive those final moments again. That doesn't mean perhaps you wouldn't like to discover what happened. At least three quarters of those who attended our wedding were told afterwards that he died suddenly, although in truth none knew exactly what had killed him. The coroner found it ""impossible"" to establish whether Gilchrist died during sex but there wasn't sufficient evidence either way. So everyone assumed he'd died unexpectedly. Of course we felt differently then, even though it was perfectly obvious to both myself and my parents-in-law that his heart attack was entirely preventable. Nowadays we should at least try to see things clearly instead of being fooled into believing something that isn't true. Nobody is ever to blame except ourselves. The first thing I wanted to address before coming here was why did my husband go ahead with plans to travel around Europe alone at weekends long before any of this started happening? He used to spend most weekdays working late hours away from home but he soon grew bored of doing that and began saying he just couldn't bear spending evenings sitting indoors watching television every weekend. A couple of weeks ago I persuaded him to stop work early one Friday evening and head off to a local music festival - 'Roses' held near where we lived in England. On the day itself he wore some new clothes, including fancy trainers bought especially for the occasion (he also liked dressing up). His credit card bills confirmed he spent 750 between 3pm and 5am. When he returned later on that same night I could tell he was more subdued than usual and I remember thinking to myself that maybe he was stressed. In retrospect I realise it shouldn't surprise anyone that he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest in the hotel room of Rome two days later, but sadly neither did I suspect anything until afterwards. After my own brush with death several months earlier he decided I needed looking after properly and insisted on taking over the financial side of caring for me once he retired. Not that I minded, it was reassuring to have someone take responsibility for paying the bills and ensuring I received proper medical attention whenever necessary. But while he loved acting as manager of our affairs and he brought great pleasure and satisfaction to us both it was hardly surprising that sometimes I resented his staying behind in Canada when I went backpacking across Western Europe. Before we met he never took holidays abroad, preferring to stay within the UK. Yet since discovering the joys of travelling together he became enraptured with foreign culture and wanted to explore places far beyond Britain. We made many trips overseas together in the past few years to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Ireland and Northern Ireland. There is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying yourself and relaxing by holidaying somewhere different. But I'm sure many others will agree that too often people can become consumed with trying to fit in all possible activities, leaving very little time left over for friends and relationships. For example recently he flew to Montreal via Toronto and Detroit, claiming it only cost him forty dollars to fly rather than 500 not mentioning another quick trip half way round the world. While I totally agreed that airfares are absurdly expensive nowadays, we agreed to stick to flights through major European destinations from Heathrow Airport because it saves money. Sometimes he'd push himself so hard that he ended up feeling exhausted and tired, yet he still felt compelled to carry on regardless with second helpings etc. Even when he suffered chest pains a month ago whilst driving back from a concert in Scotland he declined calling the emergency services, opting to pull over and wait until he reached the hospital. Needless to say he collapsed minutes later and the following morning he called an ambulance but unfortunately it arrived after he'd expired. You probably won't believe this but actually I've done better lately at keeping track of his whereabouts. So apart from telling me details of concerts and festivals in advance I haven't checked to see if he's taken a flight anywhere since September 2015. And having recently discovered that he drove east to west coast pavement real estate agents frantically endeavouring to seed track the roleperform John does best serve.

"Cheshire East Council said the suspension of chief executive Mike Suarez after a disciplinary committee meeting on Monday was a ""neutral act."" The Conservative-run authority will not reveal details of his case. Suarez had been suspended for 10 days without pay since July 9, in relation to an investigation into allegations made by councillors that he tried to influence their votes at a cabinet meeting last month. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman confirmed it is investigating allegations regarding Mr Suarez and added: ""We can confirm we are aware of incidents involving him during this time but cannot comment further as investigations are ongoing."" Mr Suarez has already apologised personally for any offence caused when he appeared before the disciplinary panel. He insisted there would be no similar breaches again under his leadership. The council leader, Councillor Mohammed Asghar (Con), told BBC Radio Manchester political correspondent Stephen Iddall: ""I'm extremely disappointed with what's happened today - you're talking about someone who's very well respected across all parties within our community...

"Media playback is not supported on this device Real took the lead in the ninth minute through Karim Benzema, but Gaku Shibasaki scored either side of half-time to put Kashima ahead and it remained that way until the final whistle. Japan had a real chance after 30 minutes when Yasuhito Endo broke forward from midfield before being hauled down by Urawa's Keita Yamada, who was sent off for his second yellow card. Shot stopper Takashi Yoshida saved well with his feet then came up covering for two defenders inside the box as he tried to clear an advancing Beasley free kick, while goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima spilled just outside his own area before recovering quickly enough to keep out Shimizu Sato's shot 20 yards away. The 34th-minute goal - which proved to be Kobe F Marinos' last victory of 2012 - also sparked a rapid transition from defence to attack, with Nani winning possession 25 metres above Urawa territory only to lose the ball trying to pass back. He soon found himself under pressure again, though, with Muto firing over at close range.",0,976
"The Reverend Gavin Ashenden, a senior clergyman in the Church of England, left his position as chaplain in order to be free to criticise the move. A passage from the book he writes about this experience reads: ""I was not surprised by these developments - indeed I deplored them but what did surprise me was that they should have come at all when one had only been aware for two years or so of any such radicalism and certainly no idea of it developing in quite such speed...One could say now (2016) very confidently that almost everyone is talking about equality; we are trying to find ways of making our society more equal than before."" Ashenden goes on to describe how the education system has reinforced inequality through measures like widening participation, which makes schools accessible for every child regardless of ability levels. He also notes how mass immigration means that white English children do not get their fair share of places at top universities because there aren't enough spaces available, leaving an even greater number without access to elite institutions. His outlook then changes as the result of having experienced realising social justice work in a Catholic church with a strong link to post-colonial Ireland. It turns out that working within a religion where institutionalised racism exists does not necessarily always make you see things differently. For example the faith community attempts to prevent marriage between black people due to its belief that nobody can chose who marries whom. Despite being based upon centuries old beliefs, modern Christian churches still repeat traditionalist views regarding sexuality. All of this leads him to question why feminism is ideologically accepted despite the fact that women suffer hugely under patriarchal systems. Furthermore he observes individual attitudes to sexism both inside and outside the workplace slowly changing, although the systematic oppression hasn't gone away completely. Even though gender stereotypes continue to exist, any man wanting to become head of household will usually need to demonstrate success in business while a woman would simply need to show she can run her own home successfully and meet certain requirements set by the state. Feminists and feminists have worked tirelessly against the dominant culture, campaigning for laws that enforce gender equality. These include the Equal Pay Act 1970, Sex Discrimination Act 1975, Women's Equality Party founded in 2010 and MeToo campaign started last year to combat sexual harassment and abuse in workplaces. The influence of media outlets such as BBC News and Channel 4 often play into the hands of those opposed to change as statistics reinforce feminist arguments and portray men as villains whilst reducing violence towards females. Why do women choose to enter abusive relationships? Well if the partner treats her badly then yes obviously they will stay together because women feel shame over not resisting domestic violence. However when men treat women poorly (like objectifying them), they have fewer reasons to exit and often don't realise they may encounter victimisation themselves. This results in more men suffering mental health problems after entering a relationship with a depressed person. When will the tide turn? Inequality will never go away entirely, as long as patriarchy exists, but hopefully men will start seeing women as humans rather than objects, thereby breaking down some of the barriers stopping us achieving true equality. There will always be inequalities in employment and pay structure in society until women achieve full legal parity. Until then however it seems most professions require experience which female employees generally lack.",0,977

"EDF boss Jean-Bernard Levy joined officials from the UK, France and China at the behind-closed-doors ceremony in London on Thursday. Earlier this month, the government gave the go-ahead for the first set of bids to be submitted by private companies - a process which will take place over several weeks as part of an auction scheme targeting offshore wind farms. Mr Levett said: ""I'm absolutely delighted that we have finally reached this historic milestone after years in development. This is the result of many hundreds of thousands of hours of work across hundreds of developers, architects, financiers and engineers. It has just taken us five months longer than expected because we had so much competition out there but it was worth every minute. We are genuinely proud of what we achieved with our partners. The next couple of days should prove very exciting."" Around 30 countries could apply for contracts under the new auctions programme later this year, including Australia (pictured), Canada, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Spain and Sweden. South Korea made its intentions clear last week when one of its backers proposed building Europe's largest offshore wind farm off Gotland island. That would make the Baltic Sea nation only the third country outside Britain following Germany and the Netherlands to get such green energy projects scheduled for construction.",0,981
"Sports Minister Caral Ni Chuilin said they stood down just before she was due to meet board representatives. They were there to discuss a report by the Head of Internal Security, which is not supposed to be made public until after it has been discussed at Cabinet level and endorsed with other ministers' approval. The head of internal security told her that ""the vast majority voted for change in every aspect of our national football team but did so on condition that, if necessary, we would go back over everything again once people had time to reflect on what had happened."" The minister also understands that some players will have their contracts terminated early next month as part of this review. Ms Ni Chuilin says those who could no longer play professionally should still receive full support from sport Ireland such as training grants or academic funding through IDA programmes - which are funded largely out-of-pocket themselves - rather than receiving nothing.

"His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most respected characters in English football - but his reign ended amid claims he raped two young women on a night out in 2004 When Matt Le Tissier walked into the changing rooms for Arsenal's final game that season, it still felt like his dreams were about to come true. There had been so much build-up: his sensational goal against Manchester United; an enthralling semi-final rematch with Liverpool; then Wembley as they beat Newcastle 4-1, thanks to penalties from Bergkamp and Henry. The atmosphere inside the stadium was incredible too, with thousands spilling onto White Hart Lane after the sending off of Alan Smith. As the players left the field for extra time, everyone seemed happy, even if there was no guarantee of silverware. ""It really did feel like my last day,"" says Le Tissier now. ""I felt like I'd done enough."" His first career title would be denied by Manchester United in the following year's Champions League Final. But this summer will see him add another historic trophy to his collection when Southampton take on Chelsea in the 2013 Europa League Final. And yet all around him is gossiping about something else entirely: whispers about alleged rape. At 36 years old, in 2004, a woman who became known only as Sarah claims she was assaulted outside a nightclub in London by Adam Johnson, later capped 58 times by Jamaica. It formed part of her mind games over the years since, although not until recently has any story emerged which directly implicates Johnson himself or suggests he may have played a role in covering up what happened. On Friday the Evening Standard published details of how Johnson allegedly met the player at Soho House, a bar frequented by celebrities in north-west London, where he began talking to him while surrounded by a group of men. Soon afterwards he returned to his table crying and told people ""he couldn't go through with it,"" according to court documents seen by the paper. When police got involved, various sources claim Johnson changed tack, claiming he had requested sex instead of being forced to perform fellatio. One witness stated that Johnson said he wanted oral sex before going back home alone despite having asked several friends along because he didn't want them witnessing anything untoward. Johnson denies raping anyone. In 2006 he pleaded guilty to indecent exposure for kissing and touching a 14-year-old girl who was waiting for her school bus after the pair went drinking together, and received three months' community service. The allegations are quite different. According to former criminal barrister Julian Knowles, authorising judge Mr Justice Barry O'Donoghue accepted evidence presented by detectives investigating the case in which he found: ""There is clear and strong evidence of force, threats and intimidation of sexual nature including false imprisonment."" This included Johnson forcing oral sex upon the 20-year-old student. No charges were brought relating to the student, however. Only afterwards was the allegation made that Johnson had sexually attacked someone else. Had he been charged, the offence could've carried a sentence of up to 10 years, though in the end Johnson served just 6 weeks of his 18 month jail term. Southwark Crown Court heard Sarah reported the incident to police nine days after meeting Johnson in August 2004 during a night out with three other students. She believed she had been drugged prior to the assault, but by whom remains unclear. A statement given to officers described her actions immediately prior to entering the bathroom stall where the attack supposedly took place: ""She closed her eyes, curled herself into the foetal position on top of the toilet floor ... Her body shook violently as she cried silently."" After hearing no response, she stood up and looked behind her in the mirror, realising ""what was happening"" and ran away naked down Regent Street past more than 15 onlookers. Two teenagers followed her screaming abuse, prompting Johnson to say to others nearby: This happens every weekend!"" He then added: ""You won't get shut of me mate you don't know who you messing with."" A friend offered her 10 to leave. Eventually she reached home and called 999, making it the second time she had phoned emergency services in less than 12 hours. An ambulance crew arrived minutes after she talked to the operator, and found her covered in blood wearing nothing except a vest bearing a message telling men to 'fk off'. Sarah alleges she underwent tests for HIV and gonorrhoea within six hours - results came back negative, suggesting she was not infected. Four witnesses also claimed they witnessed Johnson standing close to her, offering support, before they both left together. Police arrested Johnson shortly after arriving at Cazenove Road Tube station, Westminster - he was carrying a box containing a shirt he appeared to be trying to wash. However, all DNA samples collected turned out to belong to either Johnson or one of those present during the evening. Three weeks after the alleged attack, Sarah filed a complaint at Bowlerian Jonesiusitself. Both parties sat in the thirdbrave deviceless[B",0,983

"Commentators on the internet have been quick to make fun of Mr Boehner over the years, but his willingness to show emotion has also endeared him to many. His latest display of anger is a result of learning that some states will choose not to hand out any federal stimulus money through their unemployment programmes until further notice. The decision by Florida's Republican governor Rick Scott to block 10bn (6.5) in Federal cash for its jobless programme was swiftly followed by similar moves from governors in Colorado and Georgia by Democratic leaders who oppose what they see as an abuse of power by those with unelected influence. They are particularly angry at how much power goes to pro-business lobbyists on loan from Wall Street banks and other financial institutions, while ordinary citizens lose out. Mr Obama came under fire earlier this week when he said the government would ""go around"" the United States Congress if it needed extra funds to fight the recession. Republicans rallied behind these remarks, which appear intended to let Wall Street know that Washington no longer respects them. The Senate voted down two separate efforts to extend Bush tax cuts due to expire after 2010 so Democrats could try again later. It is now likely that the US economy will contract next year rather than expand more rapidly than previously forecast.

"Mark McCarroll, a father-of-one, was working as a fork lift driver at Hayes Fuels depot in Belfast's Harbour estate when the accident happened. Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk assessor Paul Morrison said they had been keeping an eye on the road since work began nearby last November. When McCarrall hit the back of the truck he lost his balance and fell off onto the ground. The 32 year old neighbour described hearing him scream ""Help me."" He got up but it was too late. One witness who saw what followed described how McCaroll died instantly after being run over by tyre company Vredestein's van carrying spare wheels which ploughed into his neck and head from behind. As paramedics arrived others gathered round to see if there were any survivors among the debris of crushed bodywork and broken glass. By then McCarroll's wife had reached the scene, along with friends and family members. Both drivers told police that neither their tyres nor brakes failed before impact and both men have denied causing death by dangerous driving or failing to stop. They are due for trial later this month accused of manslaughter and two other counts each relating to careless driving and not stopping to render aid. Mr Hayes added: 'I'm very sorry about all the fuss we've caused.'",0,986

And as half-time approached, things got even worse for Barnsley as Jamie Jones came on to replace the injured Andy Johnson at left back - and just like that the Tykes found themselves 4-0 ahead courtesy of Martin Noades (penalty), Tom Bradshaw and Kevin Davies.

"Most flights coming out of or landing in Chile's main airports were cancelled or delayed. The strike hit Chile in the busy run-up to the Christmas holiday period, leaving thousands stranded at major travel hubs such as Santiago airport and prompting airlines to cancel more than 4,000 domestic trips on Wednesday alone. The political dispute has been simmering for two years now but escalated sharply after Chilean President Sebastian Pinera fired senior finance minister Hernan Lacunza last week over a financial scandal involving state construction companies that bears his name. He replaced him with Christian Kruger, an economist who had previously served under previous unpopular presidents Michelle Bachelet (2014-2018) and Sebastian Pinera (2010-2014). Crucially, Lacunza was seen by many opposition supporters as responsible for approving large government spending projects during her administration while his predecessor stood accused of being too timid when it came to fixing banks' debt crisis. As a result, Chileans have turned their ire towards both parties. ""Pirate strikes will come,"" wrote one user on Twitter. ""We'll take down your airplanes."" It is not clear how long these strikes might continue since they are organized labor union action. But according to local news media, there seems no end in sight.

"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention had been to travel across northern Syria to reach their relatives abroad before they are allowed entry into Europe as refugees. But when Turkish police stopped their bus ferrying them through Turkey's eastern border with Iraq and Syria, they were instead sent back to Istanbul where they remain today. Turkey is not a signatory on either of these conventions but it does have common borders with both countries - so says an UN report published earlier this year which concluded that its efforts were ""not fully effective"" to prevent irregular migration. The government has repeatedly complained about being forced to open up its borders during periods such as summer months when large numbers seek refuge there. It also claims asylum seekers make use of human traffickers who charge thousands of dollars for the trip northwards towards Greece or Italy. Both those routes lead eventually via official refugee camps along the coast.",0,995

"Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles are from an ancient Jewish sacrificial altar, most likely dating back thousands or even tens of thousands of years ago By Robert Fisk In Jerusalem 19 July 2000 A few days ago I went with a small group of British Christians on one of our regular visits to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in order to see how we could best pray for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The great majority of our party came from Britain's Christian churches, but there were also Anglican priests who had come from New Zealand, Poland and America; a retired Irish bishop and his wife; and two former members of my staff at Independent Television News (ITN), David Amess, now living in Ireland, and Paul Hollingdale, still in London. We walked around the churchyard where so many have died over the centuries, trying to imagine what it might have been like when this place was not simply home to three separate religions - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - but to all those who came here seeking something deeper than life itself. It is difficult to capture that sense of spiritual presence here into words.... In every language spoken by the followers of each religion, which includes Hebrew among them, God is called Yahweh, Elohim or Adonai. After being captured by the Romans during their conquest of Palestine in 70 AD, and after serving more than 500 years as a monument to Roman power, these places became holy sites for the various sons of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Today they stand side by side yet they occupy different worlds: Christianity sees its future in the rebirth of Israel, while Zionism holds out the prospect of establishing another state based on Palestinian land; Sunni Arabs want recognition of their own distinct identity, while Shiites believe theirs is joined only in a common faith with the last ruler of the Prophet Mohammed's tribe, through whom Allah has appointed himself representative head of humanity in the 21st century. For Christians and Jews alike there can be no compromise with the modern Arab world because it denies the validity of Jesus Christ. Muslims too refuse any surrender to Israeli demands for concessions regarding the right of return of millions of refugees who fled eastwards across Jordan to take refuge within West Bank boundaries before 1967 and again since then. Even if such negotiations did lead eventually to some form of mutual agreement, would that satisfy anyone? No! Neither the Orthodox nor the Catholics have ever accepted territorial compromises made under pressure either towards Spain in 1492 or France in 1904, both by treaty with Muslim rulers. But neither will Arab nationalism allow the establishment of a new Jewish state, even though European Jewry has never questioned, perhaps cannot question, the legitimacy of the claim of the Zionists to their homeland. Nor does Europe accept the principle of self determination for nations without regard to religious differences. Therefore in practical terms it remains impossible to offer Israel anything other than limited economic agreements for the development of certain industries and technology, similarly restricted in scope, leaving open for dispute issues concerning water rights, air space and fishing grounds. For instance, if the United States and Japan offered Qatar unlimited financial aid and as much access to US military bases as Saudi Arabia receives, would anyone deny those countries complete sovereignty over that tiny country? Above all, however, it is clear to me that this conflict transcends geographical divisions, ethnicities and sectarianism and goes far beyond political considerations about borders and territory. This war exists within us all, and it is part of the reason why I returned once again to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher just weeks after participating in the meeting of representatives from a number of religious faiths held outside Bethlehem in May. The atmosphere inside the building was very strange indeed. The first time I visited the Church, two years previously, it had looked strangely empty to me, even though crowds stood waiting to enter and films were being shown in the large lecture theatre erected near one end. There were hundreds of people present today. Many carried photographs of loved ones killed in the recent fighting along the border, others clutched pictures of relatives left behind in Gaza and Lebanon. These families arrived early in the morning to make sure that their names appeared alongside those of 1,000 pilgrims already commemorating the lives lost along the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait. They waited five hours before entering, listened to prayers broadcast live from loudspeakers up above the entrance tunnel, lined up again to climb down the stairs leading directly onto the main sanctuary floor, and finally filed slowly past rows upon rows of crosses bearing identical inscriptions ""Here lies Adam"" or ""Here rests Mary."" Some of those making similar journeys were weeping openly; others prayed silently, heads bowed beneath the weight of grief and loss. One elderly man paused often throughout the day to sit alone and weep quietly for all he had seen: children dead, men beaten by soldiers, women forced to carry ridiculous packages full of the American portion.

""There'll be lots more opportunities for youngsters to get involved,"" says Cara Murray who runs the Kids Comedy Festival. She hopes that it will provide them with something they enjoy doing as much as performing. Many former participants now perform regularly around clubs and colleges. Opinion polls suggest that support for traditional forms such as storytelling have declined over recent years. But many performers believe this isn't necessarily because audiences dislike these genres but just feel like other things are more interesting than hearing someone spin out an ancient tale. And some fear that if new entrants aren't given exposure then they won't develop into future talent and might put comedy on hold altogether.
