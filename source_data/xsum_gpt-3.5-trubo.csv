"This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, has brought renewed hope for a more inclusive and equitable society in Myanmar. This commission was established to examine the situation in Rakhine State and to provide recommendations on issues such as citizenship, freedom of movement, and access to services. As a result of the commission's work, a number of important steps have been taken to address the situation of the Rohingya, including the establishment of a pilot program to issue national verification cards to the stateless population in Rakhine State. However, much work remains to be done, and the international community must continue to apply pressure on the government of Myanmar to uphold its commitments to respect the rights of all its citizens, including the Rohingya.",0,0

"The inquiry will look at historical abuse of children in care in Scotland. But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, has written to the Scottish government expressing concerns that the inquiry may not examine all cases of historical abuse. He has also expressed concerns about the role of the charity Quarriers in the inquiry, as he believes they have not fully acknowledged or taken responsibility for historical abuse at their facilities. As a helpful assistant, I suggest that John Findlay's concerns are valid and should be taken seriously. It is important that the inquiry examines all cases of historical abuse, regardless of the organization responsible. The role of Quarriers in the inquiry should be carefully examined to ensure that they are being held fully accountable for any abuse that took place at their facilities. It may also be helpful for the Scottish government to seek input and guidance from abuse survivors and advocacy groups to ensure that the inquiry is conducted in a thorough and sensitive manner.",0,64

"The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites offer medications such as modafinil, which is licensed for adults with sleep disorders, to students as a ""smart drug"" to enhance their academic performance. However, using medications without a prescription and medical supervision can be dangerous, and the side effects can be unpredictable and harmful. As an assistant, I would advise students to focus on healthy study habits, such as getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly, instead of relying on medications. Additionally, I would encourage them to talk to their healthcare provider or a trusted adult if they are experiencing difficulties with concentration, focus, or excessive tiredness while studying.

"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, There are several reasons why vocational education has struggled to achieve the same status as university education. First, there is a long-standing cultural bias that values academic education over vocational education. This bias is particularly strong in many Western countries, where university degrees are seen as the key to social mobility and success, while vocational education is often seen as a second-best option. Second, vocational education has often been associated with low-status jobs and low pay. This has led to a perception that vocational education is less valuable than university education, despite the fact that many vocational careers can be highly rewarding in terms of job satisfaction and financial remuneration. Third, there has historically been a lack of investment in vocational education and training, particularly in terms of resources and infrastructure. This has made it difficult for vocational education to keep pace with changing industry needs and maintain high standards of quality. Despite these challenges, there has been a growing recognition in recent years of the importance of vocational education, particularly in the context of addressing skills shortages and improving economic competitiveness. Initiatives aimed at promoting vocational education, such as apprenticeship programs and public-private partnerships, have gained traction in many countries, which is a positive step towards giving vocational education the same status as university education.",0,123

The best way for the 23-year-old to pursue this goal would be to focus on developing his skills as a football player, potentially by joining a local football team or working with a coach who specializes in the game. It may also be helpful for him to network with people in the football industry, including coaches, scouts, and agents.",0,182

As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide some additional information on the Football Act and the current political debate surrounding it. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act, also known as the Football Act, was passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2012.

"North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said a so-called ""fix room"" could reduce drug deaths and the spread of infection. He said the proposed plan came in response to the growing problem of drug use in the area and the potential harm it can cause to individuals and the community. A ""fix room"" would provide a safe and hygienic environment for drug users to consume drugs, while also reducing the risk of overdose and the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. The idea has been successfully implemented in other countries, including Canada, Australia, and some parts of Europe. However, there are also concerns that it could be seen as condoning drug use and may not address the root causes of addiction. Authorities would have to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a proposal before making any decisions.",0,314

And his spokesman confirmed he was ""very concerned"" about the impact of the cap on low-income families. As a helpful assistant, I can provide more information about the household cap. The household cap, also known as the benefit cap, is a limit on the total amount of welfare benefits that any household can receive. The cap was introduced in 2013 and was designed to encourage people to work by ensuring that they were better off in employment than on benefits. The government has proposed to lower the household cap from the current level of 20,000 a year to 23,000 a year, to 13,000 a year to 15,410 a year, depending on the location and size of the household. The cap affects a number of benefits, including Child Benefit, Housing Benefit, and Universal Credit. Opponents of the cap argue that it unfairly targets low-income families and that it does not take into account the varying costs of living in different parts of the country. Supporters argue that it incentivises work and helps to reduce the welfare bill. As a helpful assistant, I am here to provide impartial information and answer any questions you may have about the topic.",0,328

"It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that birds can do this without tipping over because of their unique skeletal anatomy and muscular control. Their legs have a built-in locking mechanism that keeps their joints in place even when they are not actively using their muscles to stand. The reason why birds perch on one limb is to conserve body heat. By tucking one leg up into their feathers, they reduce the surface area that is exposed to the cold air, which helps them to stay warm. Additionally, standing on one leg also allows them to keep the other leg warm by tucking it into their feathers as well. Overall, the ability of birds to perch on one limb is a fascinating adaptation that reflects their evolutionary success and the incredible diversity of the natural world.",0,425

"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, General Lord Dannatt said it was wrong to ""talk up"" the incidents. Five Afghan soldiers died in an assault on the British embassy in Kabul and another two were killed in a suicide attack near Kandahar airport. It is important to report on these incidents and to provide accurate information, but it is equally important not to sensationalize or exaggerate them. General Dannatt is right to caution against ""talking up"" such incidents, as this can create unnecessary fear and panic, and can also undermine the morale of the troops on the ground. Instead, it is important to provide context and to acknowledge the difficult and dangerous work that our service personnel are undertaking in Afghanistan.",0,442

"It comes after Swansea City FC's American owners revealed they are in talks with the council over increasing capacity at the ground. The Swans want to add 12,000 seats but face some challenges in terms of how to do so. The Liberty Stadium is subject to planning restrictions due to its location in a residential area, and there may be other limitations in terms of practicality and cost. It is unclear at this point whether the talks with the council will result in an agreement for expanding the stadium, but the idea is certainly being explored. If the Swans are able to increase capacity, it would open up more opportunities for fans to attend games and potentially boost revenue for the club. However, there are also potential downsides to consider, such as the impact on local residents and the environmental impact of building larger facilities. Ultimately, any decision on stadium expansion will need to take all of these factors into account.",0,448

Car and parts production has already been halted at some VW plants due to the lack of supplies, which is likely to cause significant disruptions in the company's operations and affect its ability to meet customer demand. As a helpful assistant, I suggest that VW management should work hard to resolve the contract dispute with the suppliers by engaging in constructive negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. In the meantime, they should explore other options such as identifying alternative suppliers to avoid any further disruptions to production. VW could also consider ramping up its own internal production capabilities to reduce dependence on external suppliers in the long term.

"All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of their fossils and genetic analysis suggests that egg-laying was simply the more advantageous reproductive strategy for these animals. Archosauromorphs include modern-day birds, as well as crocodiles, alligators, and various extinct species such as dinosaurs and pterosaurs. The common ancestor of this diverse group which evolved around 260 million years ago is thought to have laid eggs, and this trait has been conserved throughout the group's evolution. There may have been several reasons for the initial adoption and retention of egg-laying within Archosauromorphs. One hypothesis is that it allowed for greater independence for offspring but also reduced the burden on parents to provide for them. Another is that laying eggs allowed for more precise timing of reproduction, allowing for offspring to be born during periods of the year with favorable conditions for survival. On the other hand, live birth, or viviparity, has evolved multiple times in different groups of animals, including some reptiles such as boas and vipers, as well as mammals and some sharks. In these cases, live birth may have been favored due to environmental factors such as limited nesting sites or protection from predators. In conclusion, while all Archosauromorphs lay eggs, the reasons for this trait are likely complex and multifactorial. Regardless, this reproductive strategy has served them well for millions of years and has contributed to the diversity and success of these fascinating creatures.",0,479

His successor, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, has implemented reforms aimed at promoting democracy and opening up the economy, but these changes have also led to increased tensions with ethno-nationalist groups.

"Leaving the union would see prices rise and threaten jobs, the prime minister said, in a move seen as an attempt to reach out to Labour voters. Writing in the local newspaper, the PM outlined how leaving the union could lead to higher prices for goods and services as businesses may face tariffs and increased costs in trade with other countries. This, in turn, could threaten jobs and adversely affect the economy. The message seems to indicate that the PM is attempting to appeal to Labour voters, many of whom are concerned with job security and living costs. The move could also signal a shift in the Conservative party's messaging, which has often focused on the benefits of leaving the EU rather than the drawbacks.

"The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth rate since May 2014, with output and employment both rising. Meanwhile, the construction sector also grew for the first time in six months, with housebuilding a particular bright spot. However, retail sales fell in December as consumers held back on spending amid worries about inflation and Brexit uncertainty. As for the concerns you mentioned, rising prices may be due to a number of factors, including supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19, higher raw material costs, and increased demand for certain products. Skill shortages may be related to the pandemic's impact on jobs and the need for re-skilling or upskilling. Falling sales are likely linked to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic and Brexit, as well as changes in consumer behavior due to lockdowns and social distancing measures. Overall, while there are some positive signs of economic growth, there are also challenges that businesses and policymakers will need to navigate in the coming months.",0,631

"Researchers followed nearly 240,000 Swedish men for 35 years. The analysis, published in the journal Gut, showed overweight teenagers went on to have twice the risk of bowel cancer. The study also found that those who were obese at the age of 18 had a 2.38 times greater risk of developing bowel cancer later in life compared to those who maintained a healthy weight throughout their teenage years. The researchers suggest that excessive weight gain during puberty may increase the risk of developing bowel cancer by causing long-term changes to the body's metabolism, increasing insulin resistance and inflammation, and altering hormone levels. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight during adolescent years in reducing the risk of developing bowel cancer later in life.",0,781

"Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common hierarchical model with managers and subordinates. However, they found that this structure didn't work for them as it often led to communication breakdowns and reduced innovation. Instead, Crisp decided to adopt a self-managing organizational structure called Holacracy. This system is based on the principles of distributing power and decision-making throughout the organization. It allows individuals to take on multiple roles and have more autonomy in their work, while still working within a framework of accountability. Under Holacracy, Crisp is divided into various 'circles', each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the business. Within each circle, there are different roles and accountabilities, which are reviewed and updated regularly. There are also meetings where individuals can raise issues and opportunities, and collaboratively work towards a solution. Overall, the Holacracy model has been successful for Crisp. It has helped to foster a culture of transparency, autonomy, and trust, which has led to increased job satisfaction and engagement among employees. Additionally, the company has been able to adapt quickly to changes in the industry and market, as decision-making is more agile and can be made at a local level. Crisp's experience with Holacracy shows that there are alternative ways to structure an organization that can be more effective than traditional hierarchical models. By giving employees more autonomy and a greater sense of ownership in their work, businesses can create a more engaged and innovative workforce.",0,798
"The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 percent to a new record low of 0.25 percent in an effort to stimulate the economy in the wake of Brexit uncertainty.

"Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Metrobus admits public subsidies might be necessary to make the service financially viable, but no agreement has been reached yet on who will contribute to the funding. As a helpful assistant, I suggest exploring these potential steps to move the negotiations forward: 1. Understand the concerns of the bus companies: It's important to know why the bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Talk to them to understand their concerns about the financial viability and profitability of the Metrobus network. 2. Review financial projections: Work with Metrobus to review the financial projections for the bus network. This will help to identify potential issues and areas where subsidies might be required to make the service viable. 3. Identify potential sources of funding: Explore potential sources of funding, such as government grants or private investment, to support the operation of the Metrobus network. Identify which parties could potentially provide funding and how much they would be willing to contribute. 4. Negotiate a subsidy agreement: Once potential sources of funding are identified, work with the bus companies to negotiate a subsidy agreement that is acceptable to all parties. This agreement should outline the terms of the subsidy, including the amount of funding and how it will be used. 5. Monitor the service: Continuously monitor the Metrobus network to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently.

"The report found that although alcohol consumption has dropped since 2008, those in poorer communities are more likely to suffer or die from alcohol-related disease. The coalition government rejected a proposal to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol, which can effectively reduce alcohol-related harm, citing concerns over its impact on industry and consumers. However, many public health experts and organizations have argued that a minimum unit pricing policy is essential in tackling the issue of health inequalities caused by alcohol, as it targets the availability and affordability of cheap, high-strength alcohol, which is heavily purchased by those on low incomes. Therefore, it is crucial for policymakers to address the structural factors, such as poverty and inequality, that drive these health disparities, while implementing effective alcohol harm reduction policies.",0,896

"Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA analysis has revealed that the indigenous hunter-gatherer population, also known as Western Hunter-Gatherers, contributed about 50-70 of the DNA of modern-day Europeans. The Middle Eastern farmers, who migrated during the Neolithic Revolution around 8,000 years ago, contributed around 20-30 of the DNA. The third ancestral population, known as the Steppe invaders, arrived during the Bronze Age around 4,000-5,000 years ago and contributed around 5-15 of the DNA of modern-day Europeans. These three ancestral populations interbred over time, eventually forming the diverse genetic makeup of modern-day Europeans. It's also worth noting that there are regional differences in the ancestry of modern-day Europeans, reflecting various waves of migration and mixing of populations throughout history.",0,898

"Ackerman was initially banned in October last year after being found guilty of corruption. He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win. Ackerman was charged with breaching racing rules and bringing racing into disrepute, and was subsequently handed a 10-year ban from all involvement in horse racing. The case against Ackerman was initiated after an investigation by the independent regulator for horseracing, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). The BHA found that Ackerman had placed a lay bet on the horse 'Jolly Jumper' in a race at Lingfield in January 2019. His bet was successful, as the horse finished in fifth place out of six runners. However, the BHA found that Ackerman had inside information about the race. He knew that the jockey of 'Jolly Jumper', Philip Evans, had been instructed not to win by the horse's trainer, Joe Bloggs. This meant that Ackerman's bet was effectively a guaranteed win. The BHA took a dim view of Ackerman's actions, and viewed them as being ""pre-meditated, manipulative and harmful to racing."" It also noted that such conduct had the potential to erode public trust in racing. Ackerman's ban also applies to him from entering any racecourse, training yard, or stables, and from owning or being involved in any way with any horses in training or racing. He has also been ordered to pay 4,000 towards the BHA's costs in bringing the case against him.",0,926

This could involve banning offenders from attending future matches, pressing criminal charges, and implementing measures to prevent the use of social media to incite violence or discrimination. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a safe and inclusive environment for all fans to enjoy the sport they love without fear of abuse or intimidation.",0,953

"Five justices in the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge for an inquiry into the shootings at Batang Kali in 1948 by a four to one majority. The families, who say their relatives were innocent villagers killed by British soldiers, had brought the case to the UK Supreme Court after lower courts rejected their request for an inquiry. The Supreme Court ruled that there was no legal basis for them to order an inquiry into the incident since it occurred more than 70 years ago and the soldiers involved have now passed away. The families expressed disappointment over the decision, but also acknowledged that they had exhausted all legal avenues in seeking justice for their loved ones.",0,959

"He crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race - a gesture made by Ethiopia's Oromo people who have suffered brutal police crackdowns. He says he may have been misunderstood or misinterpreted by some people who saw his gesture, but for him, it was a statement about the situation of his people in Ethiopia. As a helpful assistant, I can provide you with more information on the Oromo people and their struggles for basic human rights in Ethiopia. The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, and they have long been marginalized and discriminated against by the government. In recent years, the government has launched a brutal crackdown on Oromo protesters who have been demanding basic rights such as the right to use their language and to have access to land. This has led to widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings. Therefore, the gesture made by the athlete was not simply a celebratory one but a call for justice and recognition for his people's struggle.",0,962

"As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man stood out in particular; he had a quiet confidence and a sharpness in his eyes that suggested his mind was always working. I approached him and introduced myself, asking if he was the man behind Bitcoin. He chuckled and said, ""Yes, I suppose you could say that. My name is Satoshi Nakamoto."" I couldn't believe it. I had actually met the creator of Bitcoin. We sat down to chat, and he began explaining the concept to me in detail. As he spoke, I could see the passion and dedication he had poured into his creation. It was fascinating to see how his vision was changing the world, and how his work was inspiring millions to take control of their own financial destinies.

"This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist: Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family. First and foremost we would like to say that Mark was a much-loved son, brother, father, and uncle, and his loss has had a profound impact on our lives. We think about him every day, and we miss him terribly. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us throughout this ordeal. We particularly want to acknowledge the efforts of our legal team, who have worked tirelessly to ensure that Mark's case was heard fairly and that his memory was respected. The inquest has finally given us some answers about what happened to Mark, but we still have many questions. We believe that the police acted too quickly and too aggressively when they confronted Mark, and that their actions created a situation where lethal force became an inevitability. We also have concerns about the training and accountability of the police. We hope that the lessons learned from Mark's case will lead to improvements in police tactics and procedures, and that future confrontations can be resolved without anyone losing their life. Finally, we would like to say that the loss of Mark has had a huge impact on our family, but we will always remember him as he was: a loving and caring person who was taken from us far too soon. We will continue to fight for justice for Mark, and to ensure that his memory is never forgotten.",0,973
